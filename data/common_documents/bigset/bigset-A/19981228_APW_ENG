Heavy seas usual fare for race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A blue-water classic renowned for
unpredictable weather, the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race is often
sailed in southwesterly weather patterns bringing massive seas and
howling winds of 60 knots or more.
	   Relatively shallow Bass Strait, with its short, steep seas and
strong currents, is often the most treacherous part of the voyage,
coming after several days of sailing when the bodies and minds of
crew are already exhausted.
	   Race official Peter Campbell said Monday there has never been a
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race without a radical change in wind
direction and strength _ another danger lurking for those on
treacherous journey.
	   The course for the Sydney-to-Hobart race is 630 nautical miles,
(1,160 kilometers or 725 miles), stretching from the safety of
Sydney harbor down mainland Australia's east coast, across the
eastern edge of Bass Strait, down the Tasmanian east coast, and up
the Derwent River to the Tasmanian capital of Hobart.
	   Yachts must be crewed by a minimum of six experienced ocean
racers aged 18 years or older, but no restrictions on age and
experience exist for extra crew.
	   Selected race history:
	   1945 _ A group of Sydney yachtsmen planned a post-World War II
cruise to Hobart. Nine yachts started the race on Dec. 26, battling
stormy weather to reach the finish. Winner of line and handicap
honours was Rani in a time of 6 days, 14 hours and 22 minutes.
	   1984 _ The race experienced one of its worst years with 104 out
of 150 yachts retiring due to gale-force southerly winds off the
New South Wasles south coast and in Bass Strait.
	   The race's first recorded death by misadventure occurred when a
72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from Yahoo 2 and
presumed drowned.
	   1989 _ A 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the coast snapped the
boat's mast.
	   1993 _ Also remembered as one of the race's worst years. Only 38
yachts out of 110 competitors finished after a series of
southwesterly and southerly fronts with gusts of up to 70 knots hit
the competitors. Two yachts were abandoned and sank.
	   The skipper of another yacht was washed overboard and spent five
hours in treacherous seas before being picked up.
	   1994 _ A record 371 starters competed in the 50th race,
including two yachts that sailed in the inaugural race. Two
yachtsmen from the first race also sailed. Most of the yachts, 308,
finished the course.
	   1996 _ American-designed, Australian-built, German-owned yacht
Morning Glory broke the line honours record with a time of 2 days,
14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds. (djp)

Only Singapore hot spring to disappear in air force base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The only remaining hot spring on this tropical
island will disappear soon in the midst of an air base expansion,
The Straits Times reported Monday.
	   The hot spring, discovered in 1909, has been neglected, although
several ideas for using it as the focal point of a spa center have
surfaced over the years.
	   But the Ministry of Defense says a decision has been made to use
the site for the expansion of Sembawang Air Base and no public
access will be allowed.
	   Land is being cleared around the hot spring, but no date has
been fixed for when it will be covered over, the report said.
	   ``We are not aware of any other hot springs in Singapore,'' the
Defense Ministry said in a statement.

Indonesia gets aid from European Commission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The European Commission said Monday it
has approved a contribution of dlrs 1.65 million for three
humanitarian projects in economically struggling Indonesia.
	   About half the money will be used for drinking water facilities
and nutritional and medical aid in the remote eastern province of
Irian Jaya, the commission's Jakarta office said in a statement.
	   The rest of the donation will fund a program for malaria and
dengue fever control in the province of East Kalimantan on Borneo
island.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in three decades
and is already receiving billions of dollars in aid from the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders.

Good Samaritan charged by Thai police with making up good deed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have charged a Thai businessman
with making up a publicity-seeking story about finding 5 million
baht (dlrs 140,000) in a taxi and returning it to its owner.
	   Soroj Theekasathien, who was on the verge of opening a Bangkok
nightclub called the Good Samaritan when he claimed his good deed,
turned himself in to police Sunday, newspapers reported.
	   Police charged him with making a false statement and released
him on 20,000 baht bail (dlrs 550).
	   Police were suspicious when Soroj's story surfaced on a radio
call-in show in early December. It was similar to the case of a
taxi driver earlier this year who was discredited and jailed for
fraud after taking money and prizes as a reward for his good deed.
	   The taxi driver claimed he had found a small fortune in his cab
and returned it to a grateful French tourist at Bangkok's airport
whom no one was ever able to subsequently find.
	   Soroj claimed that he had also found the money in the back of a
taxi and called the radio show to put out a bulletin for the owner.
A building contractor _ later determined to be Soroj's friend _
claimed it and the money was turned over.
	   Patpong Srisupak, the contractor, is also likely to be charged,
newspapers quoted police as saying. The offense is less substantial
than fraud and could result in fines if they plead guilty.
	   Newspapers reported that Soroj refused a police invitation to
take a lie-detector test.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cracks widened in a deal to form a coalition
government Monday, when a top opposition leader said Japan's ruling
party was not serious about cutting a deal, and a government
spokesman said a disagreement over defense could torpedo the plan.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal
Party had been expected to soon wrap up a coalition deal in the
works for weeks that would bolster the LDP's standing in
Parliament.
	   But the talks have snagged over how far to expand the
participation of Japanese troops in U.N. missions. The LDP wants to
limit Japan's military to logistical support, while the Liberals
are pushing for a broader interpretation of the constitution
allowing troops to participate more fully in U.N.-backed
multinational operations.
	   The dispute blocked progress in talks Sunday and forced the
postponement of a meeting between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa scheduled for Monday morning.
	   Ozawa on Monday suggested the LDP lacked the will to follow
through on its deal with the opposition.
	   ``There is little eagerness (on the part of the government) to
definitely implement the agreement. That's where the situation
stands today,'' Ozawa said. He said that unless the government
demonstrated more willingness to go ahead with the deal, it would
be useless to have talks between the heads of the two parties.
	   The government, meanwhile, stood by its refusal to change its
interpretation of the U.S.-written constitution, which restricts
the Japanese military to defense operations and prohibits offensive
military action abroad.
	   ``We've already reached agreement with Ozawa that there will be
no change in the interpretation of the constitution,'' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters in Okinawa on
Monday. ``If the Liberal Party insists on more, we'll have to go
back to square one.''
	   So far, the two sides have agreed to reduce the number of
Cabinet posts from 20 to 18 and abolish the system in which senior
bureaucrats speak on behalf of ministers during Diet debates.
Obuchi plans to offer one Cabinet post to the LP in the proposed
coalition.

Ganguly and Tendulkar keep Indian hopes alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The batting brilliance of Saurav
Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar kept India's hopes alive in the second
cricket test at the Basin Reserve Monday.
	   After New Zealand had been inspired to 352 and a first innings
lead of 144 by a record-breaking stand between Dion Nash and Daniel
Vettori, India reached 179 for three at stumps on the third day.
	   Ganguly and Tendulkar unbeaten on 47 and 42 respectively hit
India out of trouble after the visitors were reduced to 112 for
three.
	   The pair caned the New Zealand attack for 67 runs in 71 minutes
including of 13 boundaries between them and a six to Tendulkar.
	   India was quick erase the 144-run first innings deficit and by
stumps it was 35 runs ahead, and looking to set a competitive
target for the hosts to chase.
	   ``So far we have scored the runs fast. Our aim is to set them
300 plus in the last innings,'' skipper Mohammad Azharuddin said.
	   ``In the first innings we bowled badly, but I think we have the
spinners to make use of the track that is already showing signs of
playing tricks.''
	   Azharuddin said the onus is on the Indian batsmen to score
quickly to give the bowlers enough time to bowl New Zealand out the
second time.
	   ``In the first innings we didn't bowl to a plan. I think we know
how make use of this pitch and we'll be wiser the second time.''
	   While praising Nash and Vettori, Azharuddin said his bowlers
gave the home side a ``lot of room'' on both sides of the wicket.
	   ``We haven't caught well either,'' Azharuddin said, referring to
the six dropped catches in the New Zealand innings.
	   After New Zealand had been dismissed early in the post-lunch
session, India began the run chase characteristically with Ajay
Jadeja and Navjot Sidhu hammering 41 runs in nine overs.
	   Jadeja (22) played on going for an over ambitious shot but Sidhu
feasted against Vettori, hitting the left-arm spinner for two sixes
in three balls.
	   He fell two balls after tea, trapped leg before wicket by first
innings' destroyer Simon Doull for 34 runs.
	   Doull took a career-best 7-65 as India made 208 on the first day
after electing to bat first.
	   Rahul Dravid who was caught behind off a Chris Cairns no-ball
before he had scored, hit 28 with five boundaries before being
bowled charging off spinner Paul Wiseman's sixth ball of the match.
	   But Ganguly and Tendulkar made their intentions clear as they
hit the New Zealand attack to all corners of the ground.
	   Earlier Nash's unbeaten 89 and Vettori's 57 saved New Zealand
from embarrassment after struggling on 208 for seven.
	   The pair raised a new record against all countries _ 137 runs _
before being separated by the part-time off spin of Tendulkar
(2-7).
	   Coming together four minutes before the tea break on the second
day, the pair was finally separated after four hours together on
the third morning. New Zealand had resumed the day on 290 for
seven.
	   Vettori, having reached his second half century was bowled
behind his legs as he exposed the middle and leg stumps trying the
work the ball fine.
	   Nash was left stranded short of his maiden test century after
Tendulkar and leg spinner Anil Kumble (4-83) did a short work on
the New Zealand either side of lunch.
	   ``We would like to chase something between 150-200,'' New
Zealand coach Steve Rixon said. ``In that respect the fourth
morning is going to be very crucial for us,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ The latest attempt to fly
nonstop around the world in a balloon was stalled Monday by strong
winds over the Outback launch pad.
	   Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger said his Re/Max team
would wait until a high pressure weather system hovering overhead
lifted before attempting takeoff.
	   ``We are anxious to get into the air,'' Liniger said, as spots
of rain fell on the red dust of the desert launch zone, defying the
normally brutal midsummer conditions in central Australia.
	   ``But we're scrambling a bit, we've had a bit of a weather
problem,'' he said.
	   Winds much stronger than those considered safe for takeoff were
blowing between the ground and 900 feet (270 meters), the height of
the giant balloon during the launch, said Dan Pedersen, mission
control director.
	   ``Maximum surface winds for a safe launch is five knots or less,
while winds at the 900-ft. top end must be 11 knots or less,''
Pedersen said.
	   ``Winds exceeding these maximums could not only damage the
balloon, but present danger to the three pilots and their
gondola.''
	   The launch had been scheduled for 6 a.m. local time Tuesday
(1900 GMT Monday). The low pressure system is forecast to have
moved by Thursday, and Thursday or Friday are the next possible
launch days.
	   The delay is the second for the team, after a plane chartered to
bring the balloon's capsule to Australia was diverted during the
latest Gulf crisis. Also, arranging commercial shipping cost the
team two days of a two-week launch window in which weather
conditions will allow take-off.
	   The bid by Liniger and copilots journalist Bob Martin of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Australian balloon pilot John
Wallington comes just days after Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett
and his team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Fossett, British millionaire Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand
of Sweden abandoned their more conventional balloon flight Friday
about 10 miles (15 kilometers) off Kahuku Point at the northeast
tip of Oahu, Hawaii. They have tried a total of 11 times.
	   The Re/Max team expects to succeed where others failed by flying
on the outer edge of the atmosphere where weather shouldn't be an
issue.
	   Once they get to the stratosphere, flying in subspace will pose
its own dangers. The biggest threat is a sudden leak in the gondola
_ a 7-foot (2-meter) by 8-foot (2.5-meter) pressurized,
temperature-controlled capsule that is like a mini-spacecraft.
	   The team will fly in a polyethylene balloon thin as lunch wrap
that is 460 feet (140 meters) in diameter at ``full float'' and 700
feet (210 meters) high, large enough to envelope the Houston
Astrodome.
	   They will wear pressure suits made by Russian space engineers
and rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff to reach a
cruising altitude of 130,000 feet (40,000 meters), or about 24
miles (39 kilometers), above sea level.
	   There, they expect to catch winds that will carry them west at
up to 80 mph along a route that almost directly follows the Tropic
of Capricorn.
	   Sixteen to 18 days and 22,800 miles (37,000 kilometers) later,
they hope to return to earth somewhere in the Australian Outback.
	   The NASA-developed balloon type has been used before, but only
to carry unmanned scientific payloads to heights of about 80,000
feet (24,000 meters).
	   Team spokesman Bill Echols said Monday there was some good news:
Winds in the stratosphere had increased by one knot per day over
the last several days, making it possible for the adventurers to
cut hours or even days off their expedition.

Defense implies blood taken from Anwar while unconscious
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister in a sex and corruption trial implied
Monday that blood samples were taken from Anwar Ibrahim while he
was unconscious.
	   Dr. Halim Haji Manzar, a pathologist at General Hospital,
testified that he was ordered to go to police headquarters on Sept.
28 to take blood samples from Anwar. The doctor said the blood was
to be tested for the HIV virus, hepatitis and venereal disease.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and then
arrested Sept. 20, faces abuse of power charges and will be tried
separately on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the accusations against him, saying they were
trumped up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Defense attorney Christopher Fernando asked Halim whether Anwar
was unconscious when the blood was taken. But High Court Judge
Augustine Paul ruled the question irrelevant.
	   Fernando then asked Halim whether Anwar was fit or ill when he
took the blood samples.
	   ``Not 100 percent fit and not very seriously ill,'' Halim
replied.
	   In his last attempt, before another warning from Paul, Fernando
asked Halim: ``Is it possible to take blood samples from someone
who is unconscious?''
	   Halim replied, ``Yes.''
	   Halim said his medical report submitted to the court did not
include the results of the blood tests because the blood was taken
by the police and the hospital never had the chance to test it.
	   After Anwar's arrest, he was beaten while in custody. The
investigation into that beating has not yet been released by the
Attorney General's office.
	   Anwar's wife Azizah Ismail expressed fear shortly after his
arrest that police might infect him with the HIV virus to prove
allegations of homosexuality.
	   Earlier in the day, the defense failed to win the judge's
approval to begin impeachment proceedings against star prosecution
witness Ummi Hafilda Ali. The defense contends a taped conversation
between Ummi and a Malaysian businessman shows she is an unreliable
witness.
	   The defense team had hoped to play the taped recording Monday of
the conversation it says would prove its theory that there was a
conspiracy to ruin Anwar.
	   Ummi, a 31-year-old advertising executive, wrote a letter to
Mahathir last year alleging that Anwar committed adultery with the
wife of her brother, Anwar's secretary at the time.
	   Much of the prosecution case hinges on her testimony and
credibility since she also encouraged Azizan Abu Bakar, a former
driver in Anwar's household, to write a declaration that Anwar
repeatedly sodomized him.
	   Anwar's lawyers have accused Ummi of acting out of jealousy
because of her unreciprocated love for Anwar.

Report: Many Thais drunk on roads during New Year's holiday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Health studies show that as many as 30
percent of Thai drivers and 60 percent of motorcyclists on the
roads during the New Year's holiday are drunk, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The Nation cited Champaipan Santikan, a chief officer at the
Health Ministry's epidemiology division, as saying records show a
frightening rate of high blood-alcohol content by motorists.
	   Thailand's statistical average of two deaths per hour shoots up
threefold during the New Year's period, Champaipan said.
Drunkenness is the key factor.
	   New Year is a popular holiday for visiting relatives and taking
long holidays in the country or the beach. Airlines and bus
companies are laying on extra services to meet the annual demand.
	   But the regional economic crisis, which is still hitting
Thailand hard, is expected to keep many people at home.

Report: 10,000 to be vaccinated against deadly virus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Health Ministry will give
mandatory vaccinations to 10,000 residents in a town outside Kuala
Lumpur to prevent the outbreak of a deadly virus, a news report
said Monday.
	   Health officials have been monitoring a rise in cases of
Japanese encephalitis, which is believed to be passed to people by
mosquitoes that have bitten infected pigs. Twenty cases have been
reported in the past year, including seven deaths.
	   Some 10,000 people living and working in the vicinity of 16 pig
farms in the town of Shah Alam have been told to register for
vaccinations in the next two weeks or face legal action, said Izhar
Kadarman, the head of the municipal council's health department.
	   ``Those who refuse can be charged under the Communicable Disease
Prevention and Control Act,'' he was quoted as saying in the Star
newspaper. The penalty is a maximum fine of 2,000 ringgit (dlrs
530).
	   Izhar said no cases of the disease had been reported in Shah
Alam, 25 kilometers (16 miles) west of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
But the Health Ministry considers it a high risk area due to the
number of pig farms.
	   Izhar added that pig farms refusing to comply with recently
issued guidelines on cleanliness faced court action.
	   In Malaysia, there are strict rules governing the sale of pork,
which cannot be eaten by the country's Muslim majority.
	   According to a ministry report last month, the disease, which
attacks the brain, is not transmitted by eating pork. Symptoms
include high fever and headaches for up to a week, muscle and back
aches, vomiting, drowsiness and a coma several days later.
	   Most cases of the disease have been reported in the western
state of Perak and in Sarawak state on Borneo island.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A cargo of firecrackers exploded in the
back of a pickup truck, blowing the vehicle and its two occupants
to fragments, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Bangkok Post reported that the bodies of the occupants were
so badly vaporized in Sunday's blast that police could not identify
them.
	   The force of the explosion was so great that the engine was
hurled 50 meters from the site, while the chassis flew 250 meters
(825 feet) in another direction.
	   Another pickup following the vehicle was thrown off the road.
The driver, his wife and two children were injured.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks slip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Monday in thin
end-of-year trading. Tokyo stocks slipped as talks aimed at forming
a coalition government between two conservative parties hit a snag.
	   The dollar bought 116.28 yen as of mid-afternoon, up 0.10 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York and London
were closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 88.89 points,
or 0.64 percent, to close at 13,709.06. On Friday, the average
closed up 91.22 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   In currency dealings, trading was sluggish as many overseas
markets remain closed for the year-end holiday period or open with
reduced staff.
	   Pessimism about the Japanese economy weighed on the yen in what
little buying that took place, said traders.
	   But that was good news for shares of exporters, which rose in
morning trading on expectations the cheaper yen would boost their
sales in overseas markets.
	   Stocks reversed course in the afternoon, however, after a
spokesman for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said talks with a
smaller party over forming a coalition government had reached an
impasse.
	   Without the Liberal Party's votes to give it a majority in the
upper house, the LDP could have a tough time winning passage of key
bank-bailout legislation, analysts warned.
	   Prices kept to a narrow range as many investors stayed out of
the market at the end of the year.
	   ``There is no direction to the market because there are so few
participants,'' said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of equity
trading at Okasan Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,079.89.
The TOPIX closed up 8.78 points, or 0.82 percent, on Friday.
	   A lack of participants also soothed the nerves of the bond
market, which had swooned last week amid concerns increased
government borrowing would flood the market with new bond issues.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.685 percent from Friday's finish of 1.750
percent. Its price rose to 100.93 yen from 100.40 yen.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two sailors died and 10 were missing
after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles washed off Sword of
Orion and the nine-man crew of veteran cutter Winston Churchill
were missing.
	   The navy frigate HMAS Newcastle was preparing to pick up the
five-man crew of Solo Globe and they were considered safe,
Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) spokesman Robin Pike
told AP.
	   ``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is
tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's
only two people who have died in it before,'' another AMSA
spokesman, David Gray, said.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   Grave fears were held for the safety of the crew on Winston
Churchill and Charles, who was swept off the Sword of Orion on
Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas. At 1730 local time
(0630 GMT) Monday Charles had been missing for about 23 hours.
	   Race officials said Charles had sailed in four Admiral's Cups
and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long
Charles could survive in the water.
	   ``It's supposition,'' Campbell said. ``We had John Quinn survive
for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in
very severe conditions.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989 a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched to safety in this
year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quicky. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   At least 37 of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella and expected to cross the line later Monday.

Davis reaches 2,000, wins first rushing title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AARON J. LOPEZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ With every touch of the ball, Terrell Davis' heart
beat a little faster and his legs felt a little lighter.
	   A 10-yard, tackler-dragging run up the middle got his adrenaline
pumping and another 10-yard burst moved him tantalizingly close to
2,000 yards. A four-yard run off right tackle set the stage for
history.
	   ``When I got 10 yards on that first carry, I got a little bit
more excited,'' Davis said, describing the fourth-quarter sequence
that put him in the NFL record book Sunday. ``Then another 10
yards, I got a little bit more excited. And the line, they were
pushing for me, so it was interesting in the huddle. You should
have been there. It was pretty cool.''
	   With Davis 7 yards from the 2,000 mark, Denver quarterback John
Elway called ``19 Handoff.'' He received no objections.
	   ``I was saying, `Let's run the ball. Let's run the ball.' I
never say that,'' Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``Even I
wanted to block better. You don't get very many opportunities like
this. I would hate to have him squander that opportunity with 1,980
or 1,995.''
	   Davis didn't disappoint, taking the handoff 15 yards along the
left sideline to become the fourth NFL running back to run for
2,000 yards in a season. He finished with 2,008 yards after gaining
178 on 29 carries in Denver's 28-21 win over the Seattle Seahawks.
	   Eric Dickerson (2,105 yards in 1984), Barry Sanders (2,053 in
1997) and O.J. Simpson (2,003 in 1973) are the other members of the
2,000-yard club.
	   ``It's an elite group, and it's a special club to be in, and I'm
just happy I'm finally in there now,'' Davis said. ``No one can
ever take that away from me.''
	   Getting to 2,000 wasn't easy. Once considered a lock to reach
the mark, Davis went through a four-game stretch with just one
100-yard game, and he was a long shot after being held to 29 yards
at Miami last Monday.
	   ``I didn't really think I would be able to get it to be honest
with you,'' Davis said. ``Especially coming into the last game.
There's a lot of pressure.''
	   Despite being dogged by a sore back, Davis seemed to get
stronger as he got closer to 2,000, spinning out of tackles and
carrying Seattle defenders with him in the fourth quarter as the
crowd chanted ``TD!, TD!, TD!''
	   ``I kept coming out (of the game), and I was like, `Man, I can't
let anything bring me down at this point in time. I've come so
close,''' Davis said. ``They were going to have to kill me to get
me off that field today.''
	   Davis removed himself from the game after his memorable run that
ended in a blue-and-orange mob along the Broncos sideline.
	   Elway hurried to secure the game ball, and Davis exchanged hugs
with several teammates before jogging from the field as
McGwire-esque camera flashes captured the moment.
	   ``There was definitely a running tally going,'' fullback Howard
Griffith said. ``It was a sense of urgency. Everybody wanted to
make sure that we got it. If we had blown it, we all would have
been sick for the rest of our lives.''
	   Davis led the NFL in rushing nearly the entire season, but his
recent slump allowed Atlanta's Jamal Anderson to move 16 yards
ahead of him by the time Denver kicked off at 2 p.m. MST.
	   Davis needed just three carries to regain the lead and clinch
the first rushing title of his four-year career. He nearly earned
the crown in 1996, but Sanders ran for 175 yards on the season's
final day to edge Davis 1,553 to 1,538.
	   ``I can't describe it,'' Davis said. ``I never felt it would
happen. I was just elated about it. It was almost like winning the
Super Bowl.''
	   Davis also became Denver's career rushing leader with 6,413
yards, supplanting Floyd Little, who had 6,323 yards in nine
seasons with the Broncos.

Report: Singapore drug dealers getting younger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Drug dealers in Singapore, which routinely
hangs traffickers, are getting younger despite the city-state's
strict laws, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   This younger generation of dealers are also more heavily armed,
and more likely to resort to violence, said The Straits Times,
quoting a spokesman from the Central Narcotics Bureau.
	   They typically carry knives, daggers, swords and machetes, added
the report. Guns are illegal in Singapore.
	   In past years, about 30 percent of those arrested annually for
drug dealing were younger than 29 years old. Last year, however,
the figure rose to 40 percent, and the trend has continued this
year, the authorities told the newspaper.
	   Officials from the bureau were not immediately available for
comment or confirmation.
	   While older dealers were more cautious, the younger traffickers
push drugs more aggressively, especially among their own
generation, said the report.
	   ``They are flamboyant, extravagant and careless,'' the bureau's
assistant director of intelligence Muhammad Azni Sarbini was quoted
as saying. ``They flaunt their wealth'' and ``splurge on wine,
women and song.''

Two die, six missing in yacht race

 &UR; Eds; RECASTS; UPDATES with four members of Winston Churchill crew
found safe. EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two sailors died and six were missing
after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the
Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday.
	   A race spokeswoman said four members from the lost cutter
Winston Churchill had been found safe and the search had begun for
five others believed to be in another life raft nearby.
	   ``The four were found in a raft this afternoon and have been
winched to safety,'' the spokeswoman, who did want to be named,
told The AP.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles washed off Sword of
Orion and at 1830 local time (0730 GMT) had been missing in heavy
seas for about 23 hours.
	   The navy frigate HMAS Newcastle was preparing to pick up the
five-man crew of Solo Globe and they were also now considered safe,
Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) spokesman Robin Pike
told AP.
	   ``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is
tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's
only two people who have died in it before,'' another AMSA
spokesman, David Gray, said.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   Race officials said Charles had sailed in four Admiral's Cups
and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long
Charles could survive in the water.
	   ``It's supposition,'' Campbell said. ``We had John Quinn survive
for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in
very severe conditions.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989 a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched to safety in this
year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quicky. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   At least 37 of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella and expected to cross the line later Monday.

Rural Cambodians struggle to stave off hunger

	   VOR YEAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Markets in Cambodia seem to burst with
food at harvest time, but the sickly thin children in this remote
village confirm what aid workers say is a silent crisis.
	   Extreme poverty, lack of social services and two years of
erratic rains have worsened severe hunger in the countryside, where
the U.N. World Food Program now is assisting 1.7 million people _
15 percent of Cambodia's population.
	   Children are the hardest hit. U.N. reports say one-fifth of
Cambodians younger than 5 are acutely malnourished from lack of
food and nearly half have stunted growth from years of insufficient
diet.
	   ``The nutrition situation is severe, there is no doubt about it.
It is the worst in Southeast Asia,'' said Festo Kavishe of the
United Nations Children's Fund.
	   Vor Yeau, a village 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of the
Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, lies in one of the worst-fed areas
of the country.
	   Rice supplies from last year's harvest ran out in July. This
year's crop is so stunted from unfavorable weather that villagers
expect yields to be even worse.
	   A drought hit shortly after planting in May, causing rice
seedlings to wither and die. Farmers borrowed rice seeds to fill
their fields, but many undersized plants drowned when two tropical
storms swept over Cambodia in October.
	   ``Our hopes are up to the sky,'' said the village leader, Kim
Oeun. ``People try to grow many crops, but the weather was so
extreme this year that there is not much left.''
	   Relief agencies stress that the weather is not the sole factor
in the Cambodian food crisis. Villages like Vor Yeau lack basic
knowledge of sanitation and health care, making diseases like
cholera a constant threat to farming families who already live
hand-to-mouth.
	   Many mothers also don't know how to properly care for their
children, a problem that can be traced back to the brutal 1975-79
reign of the Khmer Rouge, which destroyed social and family
structures in an attempt to turn the country into an agrarian
utopia. As many as 2 million people perished from starvation,
disease and execution.
	   ``Basic information just wasn't handed down to a whole
generation of mothers,'' said Ken Noah Davies, the World Food
Program's acting country director.
	   Vor Yeau is one of 552 villages in Cambodia that receives
developmental assistance from UNICEF, but villagers say the two
years of poor weather have made the benefits of education and crop
diversification slow to arrive.
	   Some desperate parents in the surrounding area have resorted to
selling off their youngest children to feed the rest of their
families.
	   Chheang Pich, a 53-year-old market stall owner in the nearby
town of Kompong Thom, said he was approached by a woman in October
who offered him her 6-month-old child. The asking price was 30,000
riel _ about dlrs 8.10.
	   ``Right away I decided to take the boy because I felt pity for
him and we do not have any children of our own,'' Chheang Pich
said.
	   The people of Vor Yeau are breathing a bit easier now with the
beginning of the harvest, which will mean some relief for hunger.
But aid workers warn that unless the government begins to deal with
the severity of rural poverty, little can be done to turn the
situation around.
	   ``Malnutrition rates are extremely high and they aren't going to
go away unless something is done to remedy the situation. And that
means the government itself. No international donor from outside
can change that,'' Davies said.
	   The violent nature of politics in Cambodia has seen the police
and military receive most of the national budget, while health,
education and rural development _ 11 percent of the government's
1998 budget _ is mostly left to aid agencies.
	   There is some hope as 1998 ends on a note of peace. Warring
factions have agreed to work together in a coalition government and
the last remnants of the Khmer Rouge army have laid down arms, and
that could free up more government money for rural aid.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen's proposed 1999 budget contains modest
increases for social services.
	   But doubts persist that rural Cambodians will actually receive a
peace dividend, because actual government spending on social
programs has fallen 30 percent to 40 percent short of budgeted
amounts in the past.

Khmer Rouge leaders hole up as government wrestles with trial

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Two defecting Khmer Rouge leaders stayed
hidden Monday ahead of a planned meeting with Prime Minister Hun
Sen, whose government wrestled with strong demands to ensure they
stand trial for genocide.
	   Residents of this former Khmer Rouge stronghold, where the
defectors and their families are under wraps in guest houses,
voiced fears that the pair could be plotting to rebuild the group's
forces.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea agreed to defect in a Christmas
phone call with Hun Sen, 20 years to the day after Vietnamese
forces invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer Rouge
regime.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
aimed at bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said.
``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now be
denied.''
	   A team of United Nations legal experts recently visited Cambodia
to assess the possibility of creating an international tribunal to
try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity.
	   But language used by Hun Sen and King Norodom Sihanouk in
welcoming the defections has indicated the pair would be allowed to
give up on the understanding they would not be tried.
	   Such deals with other leaders over the past two years broke the
back of the Khmer Rouge and brought peace to large areas of
Cambodia for the first time in a generation.
	   The deals were grudgingly accepted when the Khmer Rouge was
still a feared fighting force, but now that the group is finished
calls are building to hold someone accountable for their brutal
rule.
	   The de facto surrender of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea marks the
end of decades of guerrilla war after the group was overthrown that
crippled Cambodia's reconstruction.
	   Only one rebel leader, the one-legged general Ta Mok, remains at
large with no more than an estimated 100 men. They pose no threat.
	   Hun Sen's officials huddled Monday in Phnom Penh, the capital.
Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith confirmed that the defectors
fear they would be arrested on arrival Tuesday.
	   Khieu Kanharith said that speculation about a trial _ either in
Cambodian courts or a yet-to-be-created international tribunal _
was moving much faster than the negotiations.
	   ``Now we are only at the starting line, but everyone is talking
about the finish line,'' Khieu Kanharith said.
	   Neither Khieu Kanharith nor members of Hun Sen's Cabinet would
confirm rumors that Tuesday's meeting had been delayed while the
two rebels sought safety assurances.
	   Gen. Meas Sophea, deputy army chief of staff, said the trip was
still on schedule and that the rebels would be afforded tight
security during their stay in the capital.
	   ``Legally speaking, they are not in a good position,'' Khieu
Kanharith said. ``They can come if the government says it is OK and
we won't arrest them, but they must respect the law as well.''
	   The government cannot protect them from international attempts
to prosecute for genocide, Khieu Kanharith said. Treaties preclude
amnesty for crimes against humanity.
	   As long as they stay in Pailin, they are relatively safe. Though
nominally under government control, the area is run by a pardoned
former Khmer Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary, their old comrade.
	   The last time Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly
after a landmark peace treaty was signed, he was injured in a mob
attack orchestrated by the government. The Khmer Rouge eventually
turned their backs on the treaty.
	   As many as 2 million Cambodians perished of disease, overwork,
starvation and executions after the Maoist-inspired revolutionaries
won a civil war in 1975 and forced the population into slave labor
camps.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that the victims have
already waited too long for justice.
	   ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' the party said.
	   In Pailin, residents were split Monday on the surrender of their
former comrades. Some feared they may be hatching an elaborate plan
to regroup the guerrilla fighting force.
	   Others said Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea had simply run out of
room to run and were looking to survive.
	   ``Everyone is fed up with fighting here,'' said Nget Ret, a
local civil servant.

Dozens of homeless evicted from walkway in Osaka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with local government saying eviction was completed

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hundreds of officials evicted some 35 homeless
people inhabiting tents and cardboard shelters along a walkway in
western Japan's largest city, a municipal spokesman said.
	   The city of Osaka ordered the Monday evacuation after local
residents complained that noise produced by the homeless was
disturbing classes at a nearby junior high-school, said spokesman
Katsuya Matsumoto.
	   The homeless clashed with security guards and lit bonfires in an
attempt to hinder the evacuation, Matsumoto said. About a thousand
day laborers turned up to support the walkway dwellers.
	   The homeless had refused earlier instructions to leave
voluntarily, prompting the local government to clear out the area
by force, Matsumoto said.
	   Some 230 city officials backed up by Osaka prefectural, or
state, police carried out the evacuation, Matsumoto said. The
make-shift dwellings were piled up and carried away on trucks.
	   The city, about 408 kilometers (255 miles) west of Tokyo, plans
to install large flower boxes along the walkway to prevent the
homeless from setting up camp there again.
	   The ranks of Japan's homeless have been swelling in recent years
as the country's severe recession forces more and more people out
of work.

Japanese spending rises for first time in five months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese workers are finally starting to loosen
their purse strings and spend more, even as their salaries continue
to drop, the government said Monday.
	   The average Japanese wage earner spent about 335,000 yen (dlrs
2,900) in November, 2 percent more than in the same month last
year, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   That's the first increase in five months, an agency official
said, and a rare piece of good news for an economy stuck in its
worst recession since World War II.
	   Still, it may be premature to look for a recovery. The official
warned that the size of the gain was probably exaggerated because
spending was unusually low in November 1997 following a string of
high-profile bankruptcies, which undermined consumer confidence.
	   The agency also found that the average monthly pay of Japanese
workers fell again in November to 473,000 yen (dlrs 4,080), down
1.5 percent from last year.
	   The average income for heads of households dropped by an even
steeper margin, 2.3 percent, as companies allowed less overtime,
the official said.
	   Much of November's increase in spending came in the form of
purchases of more expensive household items, such as personal
computers and video tape decks, the official said.
	   Spending on such durable goods jumped almost 19 percent from
last year.
	   Japanese wage earners also spent more on education and travel,
the official said.

Indonesian human rights official criticizes trial of elite soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A top human rights official said the
trial of 11 elite soldiers on kidnapping charges was not a serious
attempt to uncover the masterminds, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Last week, the members of Indonesia's special forces were
charged with abducting pro-democracy activists earlier this year in
the chaotic last months of former President Suharto's rule.
	   But Marzuki Darusman, head of the government-backed National
Human Rights Commission, said the trial was designed to appease
public clamor for convictions without targeting those who ordered
the crime.
	   Prosecutors have accused the soldiers of acting on their own
initiative despite widespread suspicion that high-ranking military
officials ordered them to carry out the abductions.
	   ``The whole trial is staged and is designed to minimize the
damage done to (the military),'' The Jakarta Post quoted Marzuki as
saying. ``It seems that it will lead to a miscarriage of justice.''
	   The abductions were carried out between February and April amid
a growing wave of protests against the authoritarian Suharto. The
demonstrations triggered deadly riots that forced him from power in
May.
	   The suspects allegedly abducted nine activists and interrogated
them at the Jakarta headquarters of Kopassus, the military's elite
force. Some of the activists testified they were tortured and
Marzuki criticized military prosecutors for failing to include that
charge.
	   The suspects include one major, seven captains and three
sergeants. However, a key figure linked to the kidnappings, the
former head of Kopassus, has not been charged and is currently in
Jordan.
	   Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto,
appears to be beyond the reach of military investigators for now.
	   The next hearing in the soldiers' courts-martial will be held
later this week, and the trial is expected to last several months.
If convicted, the soldiers face up to seven years in jail.

Survivors gather in small seaside village

<TEXT>
	   EDEN, Australia (AP) _ While scores of rescues were taking place
on Bass Strait, more than 40 yachts from the Sydney-to-Hobart race
and their crew took refuge in this tiny New South Wales town, happy
to be alive.
	   The marina in the town of a little over 2,000 residents was
overflowing Monday with crews bearing the wounds of their night on
mountainous seas in winds gusting up to 85 knots.
	   Dismasted yachts and broken rigging is strewn across the docks
as crews from boats now out of the race work to get their boats
ready to return to home port.
	   Matt Stephens, a foredeck hand on the 34-foot Melbourne-based
Vagrant, said his tiny vessel was pounded through the night by
winds of 60 knots and a swell of seven meters (25 feet).
	   ``It was really bad out there for a while, like going up and
down an elevator,'' Stephens said Monday. ``They were the biggest
seas I've ever seen in my three Hobart races.''
	   Stephens, 24, has his left arm trussed up in a sling after
dislocating a shoulder early Monday.
	   He said his injuries are typical of those suffered by many of
the crew of the yachts that limped into Eden, and paid tribute to
his Swedish crewmate who reset his shoulder into the joint after he
was slammed against rigging.
	   Susie Graney, on the 40-foot Lady Penryhn, which carried the
youngest crew in the fleet, said they were lucky to escape most of
the troubles.
	   ``People were just sitting around with their heads in their
hands, desolate, it was awful,'' she said of some of the crews'
arrival on Sunday night.
	   ``Everyone has been really quiet today since we heard about the
deaths of the two crew.''
	   Two sailors, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's owner-skipper
Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles was washed off Sword
of Orion on Sunday night.
	   David Evelyn, owner of the Wheelhouse restaurant, which
overlooks the Eden dock, said it was the worst scene he has
experienced in his 10 years in the town.
	   ``It was calm in the harbor, but outside it was the worst seas
anyone can remember here,'' he said. ``Ambulances rushed to the
dock to take the wounded to hospital, many people were in shock.''
	   ``We saw crews in tears from exhaustion and probably just from
relief really to be on dry land.'' (bp/djp)

Turkey's premier-designate starts talks to form government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Starting with the head of an Islamic
party, Turkey's new premier-designate began talks Monday with party
leaders to seek support for a new coalition government.
	   Yalim Erez, an independent lawmaker appointed last week, is
trying to form a broad-based coalition that would include Cabinet
members from several parties to run the country until elections set
for April.
	   Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a
coalition government led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed last month over
allegations that the acting premier rigged the sale of a bank.
	   News reports have suggested the Islamic Virtue Party, the
largest block in Parliament, would only support Erez if the number
of pro-Islamic ministers he appoints is proportionate to the number
of seats the party holds in Parliament.
	   It was unclear if Erez was prepared to do that.
	   The powerful military is opposed to any deal that would bring
Virtue to power.
	   A government led by Virtue's predecessor, Welfare, was pressured
out by the military last year. Welfare was closed down by the
constitutional court for anti-secular activities.
	   President Suleyman Demirel asked Erez, the acting industry and
trade minister, to try for the premiership after a center-left
party leader was unable to form government that excluded Virtue.
	   Veteran leftist politician Bulent Ecevit gave up last week after
three weeks of trying to piece together a coalition of Turkey's
bickering center-left and center-right parties. He had refused to
negotiate with Virtue.

Court fines minister for ordering attack on journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Supreme Court has asked a junior
minister, who also is the father of Sri Lanka's cricket captain, to
pay compensation to a journalist for ordering his police bodyguards
to attack him.
	   A court official said Monday that a Supreme Court ruling last
week found Reggie Ranatunga, the deputy minister for transport,
environment and women's affairs, guilty of instigating the assault
on Jayantha Dias, who heads the news division of the state-run
television network. He was ordered to pay the journalist 50,000
rupees (dlrs 735).
	   Ranatunga, father of cricket hero Arjuna Ranatunga who led Sri
Lanka to the 1996 world championship, denied he ordered the attack
and blamed his political supporters.
	   The court also ordered the government to pay 75,000 rupees (dlrs
1,100) to Dias. Two of the police bodyguards were asked to pay a
total of 25,000 rupees (dlrs 367).
	   Dias told the court he was filming protesters setting fire to a
truck that hit a pedestrian on a highway near Colombo when the
minister's motorcade pulled up.
	   When the camera turned on Ranatunga, he became angry and
demanded that the tape be handed over, fearing he would be blamed
in the torching, according to court documents.
	   When Dias refused, half a dozen of the minister's police escorts
beat him and robbed him of 3,700 rupees (dlrs 55). They then threw
him into a police jeep and took him to a police station.
	   ``Upon Dias refusing to accede to Ranatunga's demand for the
surrender of the tape, he attempted to seize the tape and the
camera by force, through the instrumentality of the others
(bodyguards), and when that failed, it was he (Ranatunga) who
instigated the assault,'' the court said in its judgment.
	   Police threatened to charge Dias with being drunk in public, but
gave up because of pressure from journalists' groups. Dias was
released six hours later.

Report: Scandal-tainted legislator indicted on new corruption
</HEADLINE>
charges

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors indicted a lawmaker already accused of
misusing campaign funds on new charges Monday for allegedly
accepting bribes from a major manufacturer.
	   Yojiro Nakajima is suspected of taking 5 million yen (dlrs
43,000) in kickbacks from Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. in exchange
for using his influence to secure a defense contract for the
company, the Tokyo District Prosecutors office said.
	   Former Fuji Heavy Chairman Isamu Kawai, 76, and Yasuyuki Kogure,
64, a former managing director, already have been arrested on
suspicion of offering the bribes.
	   Nakajima, 39, allegedly abused his position as a parliamentary
defense minister to help Fuji Heavy win a contract to develop
search-and-rescue amphibian craft for Japan's Marine Self-Defense
Forces.
	   Prosecutors also suspect Nakajima of taking government funds
earmarked for policy work, though the work was never done.
	   In October, Nakajima, a lower house of Parliament legislator and
former member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was arrested
for ordering false receipts made to account for party funds he
allegedly pocketed.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru automobiles, has also
admitted to donating 4 million yen (dlrs 34,400) to Nakajima since
1993, and to buying 740,000 yen (dlrs 6,364) worth of tickets to
fund raising parties for the lawmaker.
	   In a separate scandal involving the Defense Agency, ministry
officials are being investigated for allowing NEC Corp. to inflate
defense contracts bills in exchange for cushy executive posts for
retiring bureaucrats.
	   Two Defense Agency officials have been indicted in the scandal,
as have a dozen employees at NEC and two of its subsidiaries.

Security tightened to avoid attacks on Christians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURAT, India (AP) _ Police stood guard Monday at churches in
western India as Hindu radicals rallied behind an anti-missionary
campaign that led to the weekend razing of one church and spread
fear among India's small Christian minority.
	   Christian organizations and human rights groups say police
support has come too late in the state of Gujarat, where dozens of
anti-Christian incidents have been reported since the election last
March of a Hindu nationalist government.
	   Hindu radicals called rallies for later Monday to protest what
they call the forcible or paid conversion of low-caste Hindus by
the missionaries. More than 1,000 right-wing activists demonstrated
Sunday in a village near Surat to urge converted Hindus to return
to their faith.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, a mob gutted a Pentecostal church in the
village of Varki, 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of Surat, an
industrial city about 250 kms (150 miles) north of Bombay. Seven
people were wounded when the village headman opened fire on the
arsonists, police said.
	   On Friday, Hindu militants attacked two Catholic schools, a
hospital and three churches in Gujarat. More than 10 people,
including two priests, were injured in a hail of stones.
	   Christian leaders say the violence is being fanned by Hindu
groups linked to the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. They
complain of inadequate protection by authorities in Gujarat, where
the state government also is under BJP control.
	   Police said 19 people have been arrested for Friday's attacks.
Small churches made of teak wood, bamboo and brick in remote
villages make easy targets.
	   ``The people who have attacked church property are generally not
from the village. They come on motorbikes or in trucks, indulge in
violence and arson and leave quickly,'' said Bharat Desai, a police
officer.
	   Right-wing activists, returning from a rally in Ahwa town on
Friday, stoned Christian women coming out of a church, said Father
Cedric Prakash, director of the St. Xaviers Social Service Society.
He conceded the first stone may have been thrown by a woman angered
by the Hindu activists' abusive language.
	   The trouble spread to three neighboring villages where wooden
furniture in two churches, a Christian hostel and a primary school
were torched.
	   Hindu nationalist groups Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang
Dal blamed the Christians.
	   ``I'm not saying the attack by the Hindus didn't take place.
We're saying that ours was the reaction, they attacked us first,''
said Ashwin Modi, president of the Bajrang Dal.
	   ``We will not allow this to happen again. The next time they hit
us, the consequences will be dangerous,'' Modi said.
	   An organization fighting for the rights of the tribal people
accused the state government of supporting the Hindu militants.
	   ``The attacks are under state patronage. There is internal
conflict in the factions within the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party,'' said Madhusudan Mistry of Eklavya Sanghathan, an
organization that fights for rights of the tribes.
	   Christians said the Hindu parties fear Christian activities
could cost them votes.
	   ``We've put up schools, hospitals in remote villages.
Empowerment is a threat,'' said Father Prakash. ``Conversion is a
bogey. Some villagers do become Christians, but they are a
minority. Basically people come to our schools for education.''
	   Christians make up just 2.5 percent of India's nearly 1 billion
people, while Hindus account for 80 percent and Muslims 12 percent.

Hunt in Russian Far East for nine missing men after barge sinks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rescue boats were searching Monday for nine border
guards who disappeared when a supply barge capsized and sank in
Russia's Far East.
	   Border guard officials said four ships were taking part in the
search, but aircraft could not be used because of bad weather in
the area.
	   Two men were rescued when the barge sank Sunday and were
hospitalized in stable condition, according to a Federal Border
Guard spokesman in Moscow. The barge was carrying fuel, coal, and
food to a border guard base.
	   The barge flipped over and sank as it entered a narrow,
hard-to-navigate section of the Kamchatka River, located on the
Kamchatka peninsula, about 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   Kamchatka, which juts out into the Bering Sea, has been buried
in snow since early fall.

Iraq says it won't extend oil-for-food program

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has declared that it will refuse to
extend a U.N.-monitored program that brings crucial food to
families struggling under U.N. sanctions _ striking another blow in
its latest confrontation with the United Nations.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that
Baghdad will ask some 400 U.N. workers who monitor the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program to leave, but he did not give a
date.
	   The latest phase of the program _ which allows Iraq to sell oil
in return for needed supplies _ doesn't expire until next May.
	   Saleh's announcement was the latest Iraqi response to the
four-day U.S. and British bombing campaign that ended Dec. 19.
Washington and London launched the airstrikes after U.N. weapons
inspectors said Baghdad was not cooperating in the search for
weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.N. officials declined to comment Sunday on Iraq's declaration.
	   Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban the
inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the support the
country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in Amman,
Jordan.
	   Delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary Union's 19
member states on Sunday condemned the airstrikes as ``unjust
U.S.-British aggression'' and urged their governments to work
toward lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Their recommendation, however, fell short of Iraq's demand that
Arab countries begin circumventing the sanctions.
	   Al-Jumhuriya daily called again Monday for such action, saying:
``Let's break the sanctions, relying on the will of the Arabs.''
	   Al-Qadissiya said the legislators recommendations ``are a real
expression of the stand the Arab masses adopted ... by strongly
condemning the vicious U.S. and British aggression.''
	   It was a reference to demonstrations in a number of Arab states
protesting the airstrikes.
	   In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the
airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the
attacks, a newspaper reported in early Monday editions.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel to and from the country,
limit oil sales and bar most other financial transactions _ have
seriously damaged Iraq's economy.
	   The oil-for-food program was launched in December 1996 to bring
crucial supplies such as flour, lentils, rice, sugar and medicine
to families struggling under sanctions. It is generally extended
every six months.
	   Though Iraq desperately needs the goods, it long has feared the
program makes it easier for the world to allow the sanctions to
continue.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands the
lifting of sanctions,'' Saleh said. ``This means the ouster of U.N.
teams which supervise it.''
	   About 400 U.N. workers monitor the program to ensure that the
Iraqi government does not divert any of the money for aid and use
it for its own purposes.
	   The latest six month phase, which began Nov. 26, allows Iraq to
sell dlrs 5.2 billion in oil to buy needed supplies.

Bank of China changes rates on pounds, euro-linked currencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's top state bank sharply cut
interest rates Monday for deposits of British pounds and Hong Kong
dollars and unified rates for four European currencies linked to
the new euro, a bank official said.
	   The one-year rate paid by the Bank of China for British pounds
fell from 5.25 percent to 4.625 percent, while the rate for Hong
Kong dollars fell from 5 percent to 4.375 percent, the official
said.
	   The reduction reflected lower global interest rates, the
official told Dow Jones Newswires. Hong Kong banks cut lending and
deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point earlier this
month.
	   The rate for U.S. dollars was unchanged at 3.75 percent,
compared with a rate of 3.78 percent for the Chinese currency, the
yuan, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Rates for German marks, French and Belgian francs and Dutch
guilders were unified at 2.1875 percent, compared with previous
rates ranging from 1.5 to 2.625 percent, the official said.
	   The bank did not explain the changes, but the official said they
were linked to the Jan. 1 introduction of the euro, the new
European Union currency.
	   Britain, although part of the EU, is not participating in the
launch of the euro.
	   Some Chinese banks say they will offer euro accounts, and the
currency exchange in Shanghai plans to introduce the euro later in
1999.

Steve Waugh century puts Australia in charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at stumps &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Steve Waugh pounded a majestic
century Monday to lift Australia into a good position in the fourth
test against England at the MCG.
	   Waugh finished unbeaten on 122, his 17th test century, and
passed 7,000 career runs in the process as Australia posted 340 in
reply to England's 270.
	   Batting a second time, England was still five behind at 65 for
two at stumps on an extended day three with opener Mike Atherton
out for a pair of ducks for the first time in his career and Mark
Butcher falling to a freak catch.
	   Waugh showed rare emotion after reaching his century with a
faultless performance in difficult conditions. He added 88 with No.
10 Stuart MacGill, who struck 43.
	   England paceman Darren Gough bowled superbly early Monday and
looked to have done enough to give the tourists, 2-0 down with two
tests to play including this one, a strong chance of a first
innings lead.
	   Gough finished with 5-96, his first five-wicket haul since the
triumphant victory over South Africa at Headingley last August.
	   Australia resumed Monday on 59-2 and Angus Fraser had made the
initial breakthrough of the day, getting a lucky lbw decision
against Mark Waugh (36).
	   But it was the pace of Gough which enabled England to make
serious inroads into Australia's formidable batting order by
dismissing in-form Justin Langer for 44 and Darren Lehmann for 13.
	   Ian Healy joined Waugh for a 58-run stand and MacGill helped
Australia to its strong position. The Australian innings was again
in sharp contrast to England, which lost its last seven wickets for
70 runs Sunday.
	   Waugh dug in with 13 boundaries in his five-hour stay and helped
Australia add 189 runs for the last five wickets.
	   With the 40th run of his innings, he overtook Sir Donald
Bradman's test match total of 6,996 and a few minutes later he
passed the 7,000 run mark, only the fifth Australian batsman to do
so.
	   Waugh's century was his seventh in Ashes tests and his unbeaten
innings allowed him to lift his all-time average past 50.
	   Australia made a strong start to England's second innings when
Damien Fleming had Atherton clean bowled a ball after a strong
shout for lbw was denied.
	   No. 3 Butcher fell second to an unlucky dismissal, hitting a
shot off the meat of the bat only for it to lodge in the arms of
short leg fielder Michael Slater who was trying to avoid getting
hit.
	   England sent Dean Headley out as nightwatchman and he was yet to
score with captain Alec Stewart unbeaten on 43.

OSCE may reconsider Kosovo mission if violence continues, chief

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe is warning it may reconsider its
participation in the Kosovo peace accord if violence in the Serbian
province does not cease.
	   The OSCE manages the international force of unarmed
``verifiers'' who make sure the Oct. 12 peace deal between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is
upheld.
	   Following last week's fighting in northern Kosovo, OSCE Chairman
Bronislaw Geremek , chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, noted that both sides have not followed the
accord.
	   ``Contrary to the October agreement and commitments, Serbian
forces have re-entered Kosovo and undertaken repressive actions,''
he said in Warsaw. ``At the same time terrorist acts have again
been committed by Kosovo Albanian military factions.
	   ``This spiral of violence puts in danger the perspective of a
peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo...If the bloodshed and
violence escalate, the OSCE would have to reconsider the forms of
its activities in Kosovo in the context of a broader involvement of
the international community in the search for a peaceful solution
to the conflict,'' he said.
	   The OSCE, headquartered in Vienna, currently has about 600
verifiers from its 54 member nations in Kosovo.

Iraq says it won't extend oil-for-food program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Monday editorials, CORRECTS dates oil-for-food
program expires, bombing ended. TIGHTENS, CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-103, LON108 &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has declared that it will refuse to
extend a U.N.-monitored program that brings food to families
struggling under U.N. sanctions in its latest confrontation with
the United Nations.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that
Baghdad will ask some 400 U.N. workers who monitor the oil-for-food
program to leave, but he did not give a date. The latest phase of
the program, which allows Iraq to sell oil in return for needed
supplies, expires in May.
	   Saleh's announcement was the latest Iraqi response to the
four-day U.S. and British bombing campaign that ended Dec. 19.
Washington and London launched the airstrikes after U.N. weapons
inspectors said Baghdad was not cooperating in the search for
weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.N. officials declined to comment Sunday on Iraq's declaration.
	   Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban the
inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the support the
country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in Amman,
Jordan, where delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary
Union's 19 member states condemned the airstrikes as ``unjust
U.S.-British aggression'' and urged their governments to work
toward lifting the U.N. sanctions.
	   Their recommendation, however, fell short of Iraq's demand that
Arab countries begin circumventing the sanctions.
	   Al-Jumhuriya daily called again Monday for such action, saying:
``Let's break the sanctions, relying on the will of the Arabs.''
	   In reference to demonstrations in a number of Arab states
protesting the airstrikes, Al-Qadissiya said the legislators
recommendations ``are a real expression of the stand the Arab
masses adopted ... by strongly condemning the vicious U.S. and
British aggression.''
	   In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the
airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the
attacks, a newspaper reported in early Monday editions.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify Iraq is
free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions, which ban air travel to and from the country,
limit oil sales and bar most other financial transactions, have
seriously damaged Iraq's economy.
	   The oil-for-food program was launched in December 1996 to bring
crucial supplies such as flour, lentils, rice, sugar and medicine
to families struggling under sanctions. It is generally extended
every six months.
	   Though Iraq desperately needs the goods, it long has feared the
program makes it easier for the world to allow the sanctions to
continue.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands the
lifting of sanctions,'' Saleh said. ``This means the ouster of U.N.
teams which supervise it.''
	   About 400 U.N. workers monitor the program to ensure that the
Iraqi government does not divert any of the money for aid and use
it for its own purposes.
	   The latest six-month phase, which began Nov. 26, allows Iraq to
sell dlrs 5.2 billion in oil to buy needed supplies.

Security tightened to avoid attacks on Christians

<TEXT>
	   SURAT, India (AP) _ Police stood guard Monday at churches in
western India as Hindu radicals rallied behind an anti-missionary
campaign that led to the weekend razing of one church and spread
fear among India's small Christian minority.
	   Christian organizations and human rights groups say police
support has come too late in the state of Gujarat, where dozens of
anti-Christian incidents have been reported since the election last
March of a Hindu nationalist government.
	   Hindu radicals called rallies for later Monday to protest what
they call the forcible or paid conversion of low-caste Hindus by
the missionaries. More than 1,000 right-wing activists demonstrated
Sunday in a village near Surat to urge converted Hindus to return
to their faith.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, a mob gutted a Pentecostal church in the
village of Varki, 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of Surat, an
industrial city about 250 kms (150 miles) north of Bombay. Seven
people were wounded when the village headman opened fire on the
arsonists, police said.
	   On Friday, Hindu militants attacked two Catholic schools, a
hospital and three churches in Gujarat. More than 10 people,
including two priests, were injured in a hail of stones.
	   Christian leaders say the violence is being fanned by Hindu
groups linked to the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. They
complain of inadequate protection by authorities in Gujarat, where
the state government also is under BJP control.
	   Police said 19 people have been arrested for Friday's attacks.
Small churches made of teak wood, bamboo and brick in remote
villages make easy targets.
	   ``The people who have attacked church property are generally not
from the village. They come on motorbikes or in trucks, indulge in
violence and arson and leave quickly,'' said Bharat Desai, a police
officer.
	   Right-wing activists, returning from a rally in Ahwa town on
Friday, stoned Christian women coming out of a church, said Father
Cedric Prakash, director of the St. Xaviers Social Service Society.
He conceded the first stone may have been thrown by a woman angered
by the Hindu activists' abusive language.
	   The trouble spread to three neighboring villages where wooden
furniture in two churches, a Christian hostel and a primary school
were torched.
	   Hindu nationalist groups Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang
Dal blamed the Christians.
	   ``I'm not saying the attack by the Hindus didn't take place.
We're saying that ours was the reaction, they attacked us first,''
said Ashwin Modi, president of the Bajrang Dal.
	   ``We will not allow this to happen again. The next time they hit
us, the consequences will be dangerous,'' Modi said.
	   An organization fighting for the rights of the tribal people
accused the state government of supporting the Hindu militants.
	   ``The attacks are under state patronage. There is internal
conflict in the factions within the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party,'' said Madhusudan Mistry of Eklavya Sanghathan, an
organization that fights for rights of the tribes.
	   Christians said the Hindu parties fear Christian activities
could cost them votes.
	   ``We've put up schools, hospitals in remote villages.
Empowerment is a threat,'' said Father Prakash. ``Conversion is a
bogey. Some villagers do become Christians, but they are a
minority. Basically people come to our schools for education.''
	   Christians make up just 2.5 percent of India's nearly 1 billion
people, while Hindus account for 80 percent and Muslims 12 percent.

Stocks, dollar down in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks dropped in lackluster trading Monday
as talks about forming a conservative coalition government broke
down. The dollar slipped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 88.89 points,
or 0.64 percent, to close at 13,709.06. On Friday, the average
closed up 91.22 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.12 yen as of late afternoon, down 0.06 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York and London
were closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.
	   Stocks fell after a spokesman for the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party said negotiations with a smaller party over forming a
coalition government had reached an impasse.
	   Without the Liberal Party's votes to give it a majority in the
upper house, the LDP could have a tough time winning passage of key
bank-bailout legislation, analysts warned.
	   That drove down shares of major banks such as the Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd., which lost more than 3 percent.
	   Still, overall prices didn't move much because of a dearth of
market participants as many foreign investors stayed home for
Christmas and Japanese investors prepared for New Years holidays,
when markets here close.
	   The value of all shares traded on Monday amounted to just 130
billion yen (dlrs 1.1 billion), the lowest so far this year.
	   An estimated 192 million shares changed hands, less than
Friday's 227 million and about half the activity of a normal
trading day. Declining shares outnumbered gainers by almost three
to two.
	   ``There is no direction to the market because there are so few
participants,'' said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of equity
trading at Okasan Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,079.89.
The TOPIX closed up 8.78 points, or 0.82 percent, on Friday.
	   Trading was also sluggish on the currency market, where a
growing sentiment that the Japanese economy may have hit bottom
while U.S. growth may stall boosted the yen in late trading.
	   The U.S. dollar traded in a range between 117.15 yen and 115.50
yen.
	   A lack of participants also soothed nerves on the bond market,
which had swooned last week amid concerns increased government
borrowing would flood the market with new bond issues.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.685 percent from Friday's finish of 1.750
percent. Its price rose to 100.93 yen from 100.40 yen.

Asia Development Bank warns Philippines lenders about bad loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank warned the
Philippines on Monday that growing corporate loan defaults may pose
a threat to the country's banking system.
	   In a country report, the ADB said a critical factor affecting
the economy's ability to recover quickly will be the pace at which
the health of the banking sector can be restored.
	   The ADB praised the way the government handled a labor dispute
that nearly closed Philippine Airlines Inc. earlier this year, as
well as its efforts to find an investor for the loss-making
airline. But the ADB said the episode ``highlighted the financial
distress facing many corporate entities.''
	   Since the currency turmoil broke in June 1997, companies
continue to grapple with the burden of high interest rates.
	   The Manila-based bank noted the ratio of bad loans to total
outstanding loans in the banking system has risen from a pre-crisis
level of 4 per cent to 10.5 per cent in August.
	   ``A close watch over the growing number of non-performing loans
will have to be kept so as to prevent declining asset quality from
fatally infecting the banking and corporate sectors,'' the report
said.
	   Some economists believe there will be a marked rise _ possibly
to 15 per cent _ in the ratio of bad bank loans in the coming
months, but the levels should fall from mid-1999 in step with an
expected recovery in the broader economy.
	   Still, as a measure of the resilience of the Philippine economy,
its bad-loan ratio is still considerably lower than the ravaged
banking systems of neighboring countries.
	   Indonesia's bad-loan ratio, for example, is around 75 per cent.
	   The ADB acknowledged that in contrast to other crisis-hit
countries in the region, there were no incidents of major bank
failures or corporate bankruptcies until early 1998.

Japanese companies say Moody's is most influential rating agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese companies consider Moody's Investors
Service to have the biggest impact of any ratings agency on their
funding and investment decisions, but they said foreign rating
companies tend to underestimate Japanese corporations, a think-tank
said Monday.
	   The survey of Japanese companies by the Japan Center for
International Finance said two-thirds of respondents expressed
concern that agencies Moody's and Standard and Poor's have
excessive influence in the markets, hindering sound competition
from other rating companies.
	   Because of the outstanding market share of these two companies,
which is estimated to be around 80 percent combined, companies
tapping global markets have little choice but to ask for a rating
from these globally influential companies, JCIF said.
	   About 60 percent of the respondents also called for all rating
companies to boost their accountability on rating actions, claiming
that a lack of sufficient explanation on a rating action has often
led to confusion among investors.
	   U.S. agencies have downgraded the debt ratings of a number of
top-flight Japanese companies in recent years as the country
grapples with the Asian financial crisis and the worst recession in
decades at home. Some in Japan, however, have questioned the
accuracy of the ratings.
	   The JCIF report said the ratings agencies seemed to be less
adept at predicting business failures in Japan than in the United
States.
	   For example, of the 25 Japanese companies which Moody's five
years ago rated at or below the speculative ``Ba'' level, none has
been declared in default, whereas in the United States, the chances
for companies rated ``Ba'' by Moody's to be in default within five
years averaged 20 percent in the 1990s, JCIF said.
	   ``The data suggest that Moody's ratings on Japanese firms up
until now may have taken lightly intrinsic structural factors in
Japanese corporate governance which have kept the rate of default
low,'' JCIF said.
	   JCIF surveyed 264 companies including financial institutions
from June to August this year. More than half, or 149, responded to
questions about problems and evaluations of each rating company.
JCIF's survey covered Moody's, Standard and Poor's, Fitch IBCA,
Thomson BankWatch, Japan Credit Rating Agency, and Japan Rating and
Investment Information.
	   Companies generally had high marks for S and P and Moody's for
their high-quality analytical reports, and the scope and magnitude
of their rating coverage. Fitch IBCA was regarded as providing the
best investor information on structured finance.
	   Japanese rating agencies were considered slightly better than
others in their analysis and rating performance for Japanese
companies.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rescue boats recovered the body of a border guard
and were searching for eight others missing after a supply barge
capsized and sank in Russia's Far East.
	   Border guard officials said four ships were taking part in the
search, but aircraft could not be used because of bad weather in
the area.
	   Two members of the 11-man crew were rescued when the barge sank
Sunday and were hospitalized in stable condition, according to a
Federal Border Guard spokesman in Moscow. The barge was carrying
fuel, coal, and food to a border guard base.
	   The barge flipped over and sank as it entered a narrow,
hard-to-navigate section of the Kamchatka River, located on the
Kamchatka peninsula, about 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   Kamchatka, which juts out into the Bering Sea, has been buried
in snow since early fall.

USOC panel to hold first meeting on Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A U.S. Olympic Committee panel probing
allegations that bribes helped Salt Lake win the 2002 Winter
Olympics will hold its first meeting Tuesday.
	   Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials will not attend the
closed-door meeting in Washington, a spokesperson said. No agenda
has been released, but the meeting will likely build the framework
for the probe.
	   Salt Lake bid officials allegedly paid for scholarships for
relatives of International Olympic Committee members, provided IOC
members with free medical services, and gave numerous gifts in
violation of IOC rules.
	   The USOC probe will be headed by former Sen. George Mitchell,
and includes baseball union boss Donald Fehr, as well as Ken
Duberstein, Roberta Cooper Ramo, Jeff Benz, and USOC president Bill
Hybl.
	   The USOC investigation should lead to changes in future bid and
selection processes, said USOC executive director Dick Schultz. The
investigation is expected to be completed in February.
	   But an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice is the
most serious probe, since the Justice Department has the power to
subpoena witnesses and compel testimony and to hand out
indictments.
	   SLOC officials say they will cooperate with all of the probes
and get back to preparing for the Games.

Two die, six missing in yacht race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede; UPDATES with four members of Winston Churchill
crew found
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two sailors died and six were missing
after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the
Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday.
	   A race spokeswoman said four members from the lost cutter
Winston Churchill had been found safe and the search had begun for
five others believed to be in another life raft nearby.
	   ``The four were found in a raft this afternoon and have been
winched to safety,'' the spokeswoman, who did want to be identified
by name, told The Associated Press.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles washed off Sword of
Orion and as of 1830 local time (0730 GMT) had been missing in
heavy seas for about 23 hours.
	   Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long
Charles could survive in the water.
	   The navy frigate HMAS Newcastle was preparing to pick up the
five-man crew of Solo Globe and they were also now considered safe,
Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) spokesman Robin Pike
told AP.
	   ``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is
tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's
only two people who have died in it before,'' another AMSA
spokesman, David Gray, said.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989 a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched to safety in this
year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   At least 37 of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella and expected to cross the line later Monday.

Taiwan-China trade fell 20 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Trade between Taiwan and China plunged 20
percent to U.S. dlrs 1.7 billion in October as Taiwan exported
fewer parts and raw materials to manufacturing bases on the
mainland, the government said Monday.
	   But more electronic components were imported from China to
supply Taiwan's thriving high-tech industry, a Finance Ministry
report said.
	   In the first 10 months of the year, Taiwan's overall trade with
China declined 5.7 percent to U.S. dlrs 18.4 billion, the ministry
said.
	   Taiwanese exports to China fell 8.4 percent to U.S. dlrs 15
billion in the January-October period, but imports rose 8.3 percent
to U.S. dlrs 3.4 billion, it said.
	   More than 80 percent of trade between Taiwan and China is
conducted through Hong Kong because Taiwan bans direct trade with
the mainland.
	   The regional economic crisis has also affected Taiwanese
investment in China, which fell 4 percent to U.S. dlrs 1.35 billion
in the first 11 months this year. China is Taiwan's second-largest
trading partner after the United States.

At least 30 dead as violence rages in southern Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ At least 30 people died and 70 others
were wounded in two simultaneous attacks in southern Algeria,
hospital sources said Monday.
	   Mortar shells and bombs were fired Sunday night at the town of
Khenis-Miliana, about 100 kilometers (62.5 miles) south of Algiers.
Fifteen people died and 40 were injured, the sources, who requested
customary anonymity, said.
	   The newspaper Le Matin reported that a school and several homes
were hit during the attack. It said the shells were fired from the
nearby Merouana mountain range.
	   At the same time, 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) to the north, some
40 armed men burst into the village of Ain N'sour and killed 15
people. Most of them were stabbed to death, hospital sources said.
	   Another 30 were wounded, many of them by gunshot wounds. News
reports said the army had launched a sweep in the area to hunt for
the assailants.
	   The attacks came during the holy month of Ramadan, when militant
activity usually intensifies in a nearly 7-year-old insurgency that
has left 75,000 people dead.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government
scrapped a January 1992 parliamentary runoff the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win. The Front had promised to fight high
unemployment and corruption in this petroleum-rich nation.

 &UR; PHNOM PENH: Cambodians decide.

<TEXT>
	   Hun Sen did not rule out a trial in Cambodia, saying it would be
up to prosecutors, but his power over the woefully unequipped
judicial system leaves the chances of punishment near zero.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen told reporters
after a Cabinet meeting. ``We should dig a hole and bury the past
and look toward the future.''
	   The Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, remained
holed up in the ex-rebel stronghold of Pailin in the northwest,
where they were staying in guest houses under the protection of old
comrades who defected to the government two years ago.
	   They agreed to defect _ in effect, surrender _ in a phone call
with Hun Sen on Christmas, 20 years to the day after Vietnamese
troops invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer Rouge
regime.
	   The government wrestled Monday with intense international
demands that Khieu Samphan, the official leader though others held
real power, and political chief Nuon Chea stand trial for genocide.

Survivors gather in small seaside village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BENJAMIN PEDLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EDEN, Australia (AP) _ While scores of rescues were taking place
on Bass Strait, more than 40 yachts from the Sydney-to-Hobart race
and their crews took refuge in this tiny New South Wales town,
happy to be alive.
	   The marina in the town of a little over 2,000 residents was
overflowing Monday with crews bearing the wounds of their night on
mountainous seas in winds gusting up to 85 knots.
	   Dismasted yachts and broken rigging is strewn across the docks
as crews from boats now out of the race work to get their boats
ready to return to home port.
	   Matt Stephens, a foredeck hand on the 34-foot Melbourne-based
Vagrant, said his tiny vessel was pounded through the night by
winds of 60 knots and a swell of seven meters (25 feet).
	   ``It was really bad out there for a while, like going up and
down an elevator,'' Stephens said Monday. ``They were the biggest
seas I've ever seen in my three Hobart races.''
	   Stephens, 24, has his left arm in a sling after dislocating a
shoulder early Monday.
	   He said his injuries are typical of those suffered by many of
the crew of the yachts that limped into Eden, and paid tribute to
his Swedish cremate who reset his shoulder into the joint after he
was slammed against rigging.
	   Susie Graney, on the 40-foot Lady Penryhn, which carried the
youngest crew in the fleet, said they were lucky to escape most of
the troubles.
	   ``People were just sitting around with their heads in their
hands, desolate, it was awful,'' she said of some of the crews'
arrival on Sunday night.
	   ``Everyone has been really quiet today since we heard about the
deaths of the two crew.''
	   Two sailors, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's owner-skipper
Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   British Olympic Games sailor Glyn Charles was washed off Sword
of Orion on Sunday night.
	   David Evelyn, owner of the Wheelhouse restaurant, which
overlooks the Eden dock, said it was the worst scene he has
experienced in his 10 years in the town.
	   ``It was calm in the harbor, but outside it was the worst seas
anyone can remember here,'' he said. ``Ambulances rushed to the
dock to take the wounded to hospital, many people were in shock.''
	   ``We saw crews in tears from exhaustion and probably just from
relief really to be on dry land.''

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks slumped Monday in extremely
thin trading after the Christmas holiday.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 122.06, or 1.2 percent,
closing at 10,170.14. On Thursday, the index had gained 133.45
points.
	   The market was closed on Friday for Christmas.
	   Turnover fell to 1.222 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 156
million), its lowest full-day trading level since March 23, 1989.
	   Brokers said there was selective profit-taking following last
Thursday's gains, but that many investors remained on holiday.
	   ``There's very little news'' to move the market, said Alan
Hutcheson, research director at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.,
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.25 Hong Kong dollars to
56.75, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 75 cents to 57.50.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China made trading in the euro official Monday,

exchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January

	   ``In addition, they can convert, use and open the euro
accounts,'' it said.
	   Chinese officials have said the government may convert a
proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange
reserves into the euro after the currency's Jan. 1 debut.

	   Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the
Khmer Rouge movement by offering amnesty to leaders in exchange for
ending civil war, bringing peace to large areas of Cambodia for the
first time in a generation.
	   With the movement now all but extinct _ only one leader, the
one-legged general Ta Mok, and perhaps 100 followers are still at
large _ demands are growing for someone to be held accountable for
the reign of terror in the 1970s that left as many as 2 million
people dead.
	   ``This is a pure Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know
the right medicine to use to cure this problem. If any foreigners
try to add something, it will never go away.''
	   Hun Sen said he had the support of King Norodom Sihanouk and his
son, National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
aimed at bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said.
``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now be
denied.''
	   A team of United Nations legal experts recently visited to
assess the possibility of creating an international tribunal to try
Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity.

Diplomats: Foreign ministers' meeting postponed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An emergency meeting of Arab foreign
ministers, scheduled Wednesday to discuss the U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq, has been postponed until after the holy Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Arab diplomats told The Associated Press on Monday that the
meeting has been rescheduled for Jan. 24. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, Egyptian newspapers had reported that moves were under
way to get the meeting put off.
	   ``There is a trend towards postponing the emergency meeting,''
the daily Al-Akbar said.
	   Plans for this week's meeting were announced by U.N.
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid after the U.S. and British
airstrikes on Iraq. The four days of attacks, which ended Dec. 19,
were aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime for refusing to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Yemen has said it wants the foreign ministers to consider
calling a summit on Iraq _ a country on which Arab nations remain
deeply divided.
	   On Sunday, Arab diplomats said that Saudi Arabia's foreign
minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, visited Cairo to ask Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to back the kingdom's request that any
meeting be put off until after Ramadan.
	   Muslims fast from dawn to dusk during Ramadan, which
commemorates Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God. The holy
month ends in mid-January.
	   Egyptian officials would not confirm that the Saudi envoy was
here.
	   Late Sunday, Mubarak issued one of his strongest statements to
date about Iraq, blaming Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking
the U.S.-British attacks.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying in its early Monday
edition.
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been pushing for the
Arab League ministers meeting and would like to see it followed by
a summit.
	   After meeting Sunday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf in the Yemeni capital San`a, Saleh told reporters that
``convening an urgent Arab summit aims at restoring Arab
solidarity.''
	   It is ``a badly needed Pan-Arab necessity through which Arabs
can discuss all their issues in a spirit of reconciliation and
frankness,'' he added.
	   Iraq wants the Arab League to back its demand that the U.N.
Security Council lift crippling economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Baghdad also wants the Arab League to condemn the American and
British airstrikes.
	   But some Arab countries, especially Iraq's Gulf neighbors, are
not yet ready to forgive Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. And most
have demanded that Iraq fulfill its obligations under U.N.
resolutions before the sanctions are lifted.
	   U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will
reconsider the sanctions issue.

Riots hit Indonesian town, at least 22 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs armed with sickles and swords on
Monday battled each other and hurled gasoline bombs at houses and
shops in an Indonesian provincial town. At least 22 people were
injured in the outburst of ethnic violence.
	   The riots in the town of Poso on Sulawesi island were triggered
by brawls between rival gangs of youths a day earlier. The unrest
escalated into attacks by townspeople on the homes of migrants from
the main island of Java.
	   Rioters set afire as many as 20 buildings and threw stones at
the bus station, a local resident, Hajj Fatma, said by telephone.
	   ``The center of the town was blackened from the smoke billowing
into the sky,'' Fatma said. She was preparing food for civilian
guards who patrolled neighborhoods, fearing more violence.
	   Police and soldiers were also deployed to protect government
buildings and mosques and churches in Poso, 1,500 kilometers (930
miles) northeast of Jakarta. Shops were closed and buses stayed off
the streets.
	   A nurse at the local hospital said by telephone that 22 people
were injured and that the staff anticipated more victims. Fatma
said she saw men bleeding from head wounds.
	   Indonesia has endured sporadic riots this year amid economic
hardship and rising ethnic and religious tensions. Deadly riots in
Jakarta helped force former President Suharto to quit in May after
32 years of authoritarian rule.

Ho Chi Minh City's GDP grows by 9.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Ho Chi Minh City's economy grew by 9.2
percent this year, down from 12.1 percent in 1997, an official from
the city's statistical office said Monday.
	   Despite the decline, the growth in gross domestic product in the
country's economic engine was still much higher than the national
figure of 6 percent.
	   Annual per capita income in the former Saigon rose to dlrs 1,172
from dlrs 1,119 last year, the official said. But spending
increased only 2.2 percent this year, compared with 11.3 percent in
1995, 9 percent in 1996 and 3.7 percent last year, she said.
	   The country has been hit hard by the Asian economic crisis, with
sharp drops in exports to the region and investment from it.
	   In a report to the National Assembly last month, the government
said it will try to maintain positive GDP growth next year.

<TEXT>
	   Since the Khmer Rouge started breaking up two years ago, many
Cambodians have said they rate peace as more important that
bringing the killers who once ruled them to trial.
	   The recent U.N. visit raised hopes among some of justice as
well. But Hun Sen said there was little point: ``If the wound no
longer hurts, we shouldn't poke a stick in it and make it bleed.''
	   ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome him for national
reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a bouquet of
flowers for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.''
	   Earlier, government spokesman Khieu Kanharith had said that
speculation about a trial _ either in Cambodia or abroad _ was
raising fears among the defectors that they would be arrested.
	   Hun Sen's assurances should make it easier for them to keep a
scheduled meeting with him in the capital Tuesday.
	   Gen. Meas Sophea, deputy army chief of staff, had said the trip
was still on schedule and that the rebels would be afforded tight
security.
	   In Pailin, they are relatively safe. Though nominally under
government control, the area is run by a pardoned former Khmer
Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary, their old comrade.
	   The last time Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly
after a landmark peace treaty was signed, he was hurt in a mob
attack orchestrated by the government. The Khmer Rouge eventually
turned their backs on the treaty.
	   As many as 2 million Cambodians perished of disease, overwork,
starvation and executions after the Maoist-inspired revolutionaries
won a civil war in 1975 and forced the population into slave labor
camps.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that the victims have
already waited too long for justice.
	   ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' the party said.
	   In Pailin, residents were split Monday on the surrender of their
former comrades. Some feared they may be hatching an elaborate plan
to regroup the guerrilla fighting force.
	   Others said Khieu Samphan or Nuon Chea had simply run out of
room to run and were looking to survive.

 &UR; Eds: ADDS new final graf with official announcement on trading in
euro.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's top state bank sharply cut
interest rates Monday for deposits of British pounds and Hong Kong
dollars and unified rates for four European currencies linked to
the new euro, a bank official said.
	   The one-year rate paid by the Bank of China for British pounds
fell from 5.25 percent to 4.625 percent, while the rate for Hong
Kong dollars fell from 5 percent to 4.375 percent, the official
said.
	   The reduction reflected lower global interest rates, the
official told Dow Jones Newswires. Hong Kong banks cut lending and
deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point earlier this
month.
	   The rate for U.S. dollars was unchanged at 3.75 percent,
compared with a rate of 3.78 percent for the Chinese currency, the
yuan, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Rates for German marks, French and Belgian francs and Dutch
guilders were unified at 2.1875 percent, compared with previous
rates ranging from 1.5 to 2.625 percent, the official said.
	   The bank did not explain the changes, but the official said they
were linked to the Jan. 1 introduction of the euro, the new
European Union currency.
	   Britain, although part of the EU, is not participating in the
launch of the euro.
	   Some Chinese banks say they will offer euro accounts, and the
currency exchange in Shanghai plans to introduce the euro later in
1999.
	   Also Monday, China's central bank and the government's foreign
exchange regulatory agency released an expected announcement
formally authorizing trading in the euro.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Floods caused by heavy rain washed
away 100 homes on Indonesia's main island of Java, forcing many
residents to flee their villages, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   A total of 18 villages were swamped Sunday after torrential rain
swelled the Kelawing river in West Java province. A dam also
overflowed, the daily Kompas newspaper said.
	   Some 2,440 houses also were flooded and hundreds of acres
(hectares) of rice and other crops were damaged.
	   Roads linking major towns in the province were inundated with
water levels of 0.5 meter (1.5 feet). Electricity was cut in some
areas.
	   There were no reports of casualties.

	   President Kim Dae-jung's government wants LG Semicon to merge
with Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. to cut out overlapping
investments by the country's computer chip makers and boost their
competitiveness.
	   Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest
conglomerates, agreed in September to merge their chip-making
subsidiaries. But talks have stalled because of a dispute over who
should take control of the merged company.
	   The government supports a U.S. consulting firm's recommendation
that Hyundai become the majority shareholder in the new entity. LG
says it can not accept the recommendation because it was biased in
favor of Hyundai.
	   Later Monday, LG Semicon's 13 creditor banks, most of them
state-controlled, held LG responsible for foiling the merger and
stopped providing new funds to the heavily indebted company.
	   The banks threatened to call in LG Semicon's existing loans as
well unless it accepts the merger.
	   LG Semicon's total debt amounted to 7.48 trillion won (dlrs 6.23
billion), mostly owed to banks. About dlrs 3.5 billion of the debt
comes due within a year.
	   With their merger talks stalling, LG and Hyundai hired
Massachusetts-based Arthur D. Little Inc. in November to study who
should take control of the new company.
	   The consulting firm announced last Thursday it considered
Hyundai the better choice to run the merged company.
	   LG Semicon is preparing to file a lawsuit against Arthur D.
Little in a U.S. court next month, accusing it of being biased in
its month-long research and damaging the South Korean company's
reputation.
	   The LG-Hyundai merger, if realized, would create a company with
17 percent of the world memory chip market. South Korea's Samsung
Electronics Co. is the largest such company, with a 20 percent
global share.
	   South Korean conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding
during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the current
financial crisis. A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50
subsidiaries.
	   President Kim is urging the nation's top five conglomerates to
merge or swap some of their overlapping subsidiaries in auto,
semiconductor and other key products so that they will focus on
core businesses for competitiveness.

Son of Menachem Begin announces he is running for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Benny Begin announcing he is running
for prime minister, Labor and Likud representatives failing to
reach agreement on election date; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Likud legislator Benny Begin, a staunch
opponent of the land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians,
announced Monday that he is breaking away from the party to run for
prime minister on his own slate.
	   Begin, a 57-year-old geologist, is a son of Likud's founder and
first prime minister, Menachem Begin. He served as science minister
in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but quit the
Cabinet after Netanyahu agreed to pull troops out of the West Bank
town of Hebron in January 1997.
	   Begin's chances of becoming prime minister are remote. However,
he could weaken Netanyahu in upcoming elections by splitting the
hard-line vote and forcing a second round.
	   In such a case, most hard-line groups would support Netanyahu
against a centrist or liberal candidate as the ``lesser evil,''
said Hanan Porat, a legislator from the National Religious Party.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
also running for prime minister on a centrist slate.
	   Two senior Likud figures and members of Netanyahu's Cabinet,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister
Limor Livnat, are debating whether to leave the party.
	   Legislators from Likud and the opposition Labor Party failed
Monday to reach agreement on a date for the elections. Labor
proposed May 11 and Likud suggested May 25. More meetings were
scheduled to try to reach a compromise by Tuesday.
	   President Ezer Weizman met with Netanyahu and opposition leader
Ehud Barak to push for elections at the earliest date possible.
	   It appeared unlikely that elections would be held before May 4,
the date by which Israel and the Palestinian Authority were to have
reached a permanent peace accord.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on that day.
	   However, a Palestinian negotiator suggested Monday that Arafat
would not go through with the plan if it became apparent such a
declaration would help Netanyahu get re-elected. The Palestinians
have accused Netanyahu of making excuses to get out of promises he
made to them in peace agreements.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour, a
Palestinian negotiator, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are looking for a peace partner, and at the moment there is
no Israeli peace partner,'' Asfour said, referring to the Netanyahu
government.
	   The Wye River peace agreement under which Israel was to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank by January has been suspended
since parliamentary support for Netanyahu collapsed last week.
	   During a Likud Central Committee meeting Sunday night, Netanyahu
said Labor was colluding with Arafat in order to topple him.
	   Netanyahu appeared confident and cheerful, a stark contrast to
his agonized equivocation last week. His apparent weakness had
unleashed a week of furious speculation that he might not survive
even as a leader of the Likud.
	   That ended Sunday when Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, his chief
rival, decided to bow out of the leadership race after failing to
enlist the support of Mordechai.
	   The only remaining challenger for the Likud leadership is Uzi
Landau, 55, the hard-line chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
	   Landau is not likely to win, and has indicated that he knows it
_ and is hoping to use his bid to force Netanyahu to make hard-line
pledges during the leadership campaign.

 &UR; Premier slams door on trial for Khmer Rouge defectors
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and COMBINES pvs to show no trial for Khmer Rouge
leaders. Adds byline.
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associate Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen defied
growing pressure Monday to bring two Khmer Rouge leaders to trial
for genocide and said they would face neither an international
tribunal nor a Cambodian court.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said before a
Cabinet meeting. ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look
toward the future.''
	   The Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, remained
holed up in the ex-rebel stronghold of Pailin in the northwest,
where they were staying in guest houses under the protection of old
comrades who defected to the government two years ago.
	   They agreed to defect _ in effect, surrender _ in a phone call
with Hun Sen on Christmas, 20 years to the day after Vietnamese
troops invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer Rouge
regime.
	   The government Monday rejected intense international demands
that Khieu Samphan, the official leader though others held real
power, and political chief Nuon Chea stand trial.
	   Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the
Khmer Rouge by offering amnesty to leaders in exchange for ending
civil war, bringing peace to large areas of Cambodia for the first
time in a generation.
	   With the movement now all but extinct _ only one leader, the
one-legged general, Ta Mok, and perhaps 100 followers are still at
large _ demands are growing for someone to be held accountable for
the reign of terror that left as many as 2 million people dead.
	   But Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official who fled bloody
purges in 1978, said peace was more important than prison.
	   ``This is a pure Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know
the right medicine to use to cure this problem. If any foreigners
try to add something, it will never go away.''
	   Hun Sen said he had the support of King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
aimed at bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said.
``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now be
denied.''
	   United Nations legal experts recently visited to assess the
possibility of creating an international tribunal to try Khmer
Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity.
	   Though many Cambodians rate peace as more important that
bringing the killers who once ruled them to trial, the recent U.N.
visit raised hopes of finding justice away from the always volatile
politics of Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen said there was little point: ``If the wound no longer
hurts, we shouldn't poke a stick in it and make it bleed.
	   ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome him for national
reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a bouquet of
flowers for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.''
	   Earlier, government spokesman Khieu Kanharith had said that
speculation about a trial was raising fears among the defectors
that they would be arrested.
	   Hun Sen's assurances should make it easier for them to keep a
scheduled meeting with him in the capital Tuesday.
	   Gen. Meas Sophea, deputy army chief of staff, had said the trip
was still on schedule and the rebels would receive tight security.
	   In Pailin, they are relatively safe. Though nominally under
government control, the area is run by a pardoned former Khmer
Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary, their old comrade.
	   The last time Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly
after a landmark peace treaty was signed, he was hurt in a mob
attack orchestrated by the government. The Khmer Rouge eventually
turned their backs on the treaty.
	   As many as 2 million Cambodians perished of disease, overwork,
starvation and executions after the Maoist revolutionaries won a
civil war in 1975 and forced the population into labor camps.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that the victims have
waited too long for justice.
	   ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' the party said.

Steve Waugh century puts Australia in charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Steve Waugh quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Steve Waugh pounded a majestic
century Monday to lift Australia into a good position in the fourth
test against England at the MCG.
	   Waugh finished unbeaten on 122, his 17th test century, and
passed 7,000 career runs in the process as Australia posted 340 in
reply to England's 270.
	   Batting a second time, England was still five behind at 65 for
two at stumps on an extended day three with opener Mike Atherton
out for a pair of ducks for the first time in his career and Mark
Butcher falling to a freak catch.
	   Waugh showed rare emotion after reaching his century with a
faultless performance in difficult conditions. He added 88 with No.
10 Stuart MacGill, who struck 43.
	   ``I've always dreamed about getting a hundred here before a big
crowd, I got a hundred against Sri Lanka here a couple of years ago
but the crowd wasn't as big,'' Waugh said of his feat Monday in
front of more than 43,000 fans.
	   ``It was an important hundred in the context of the match which
makes it all the more special. You always rate a hundred highly
when your team is in a bit of trouble and they need you to score
runs.''
	   England paceman Darren Gough bowled superbly early Monday and
looked to have done enough to give the tourists, 2-0 down with two
tests to play including this one, a strong chance of a first
innings lead.
	   Gough finished with 5-96, his first five-wicket haul since the
triumphant victory over South Africa at Headingley last August.
	   Australia resumed Monday on 59-2 and Angus Fraser had made the
initial breakthrough of the day, getting a lucky lbw decision
against Mark Waugh (36).
	   But it was the pace of Gough which enabled England to make
serious inroads into Australia's formidable batting order by
dismissing in-form Justin Langer for 44 and Darren Lehmann for 13.
	   Ian Healy joined Waugh for a 58-run stand and MacGill helped
Australia to its strong position. The Australian innings was again
in sharp contrast to England, which lost its last seven wickets for
70 runs Sunday.
	   Waugh dug in with 13 boundaries in his five-hour stay and helped
Australia add 189 runs for the last five wickets.
	   With the 40th run of his innings, he overtook Sir Donald
Bradman's test match total of 6,996 and a few minutes later he
passed the 7,000 run mark, only the fifth Australian batsman to do
so.
	   ``I was aware of it and I was certainly nervous about going past
Don Bradman,'' Waugh said of the milestone. ``But it took me a lot
longer to get the runs than he did.''
	   Waugh's 7,000 came in his 110th test while Bradman took only 52
to make his runs at the astonishing average of 99.94. He joined
David Boon, Allan Border, Mark Taylor and Greg Chappell in reaching
the mark.
	   Waugh's century was his seventh in Ashes tests and his unbeaten
innings allowed him to lift his all-time average past 50.
	   Australia made a strong start to England's second innings when
Damien Fleming had Atherton clean bowled a ball after a strong
shout for lbw was denied.
	   No. 3 Butcher fell second to an unlucky dismissal, hitting a
shot off the meat of the bat only for it to lodge in the arms of
short leg fielder Michael Slater who was trying to avoid getting
hit.
	   England sent Dean Headley out as nightwatchman and he was yet to
score with captain Alec Stewart unbeaten on 43.

Pinochet case reversal damaging to British legal system, head of
</HEADLINE>
judiciary says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of Britain's judiciary rebuked the
country's highest court on Monday, saying its conduct in the case
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet endangered the reputation of the legal
system.
	   Earlier this month, the House of Lords set aside its own ruling
against the former Chilean dictator because one of the judges, Lord
Justice Hoffman, failed to disclose his ties with the human rights
organization Amnesty International.
	   ``We would not have wished this to happen,'' Lord Irvine, the
Lord Chancellor, told BBC Radio. ``It is in the highest degree
unfortunate, particularly when he eyes of the world are upon us.
... It does have a tendency to bring the legal system into
disrepute.''
	   The decision means a new House of Lords panel must rehear
Pinochet's claim that, under British law, his status as a former
head of state gives him immunity from arrest on charges of murder
and torture during his 1970-93 rule.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 under a Spanish arrest warrant
while recuperating from back surgery in London. He remains under
police guard at a rented mansion 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of
London.
	   The general's lawyers, asking the House of Lords to reverse its
earlier ruling, cited the maxim that justice must be done and also
be seen to be done . They complained that Hoffmann should not have
been allowed to sit in judgment of Pinochet since he is the
director of Amnesty International's fundraising arm.
	   Hoffmann was one of the majority judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling
Nov. 25 holding that Pinochet does not have immunity.
	   In addition to Hoffmann's own role with the human rights group,
the judge's wife has worked at Amnesty's London headquarters since
1977.
	   Amnesty has played a key role in a long campaign to have
Pinochet charged with gross abuses of human rights, and also made
special representations in the first hearing before Hoffmann and
the other law lords. But the group insists Hoffmann and his wife
played no role in its efforts to try Pinochet.
	   Irvine said Law Lords should declare their interests and
``should address together whether there are any circumstances that
... might give rise to an appearance of a conflict of interest.''
	   But he refused to say whether he thought Lord Hoffmann should
face any disciplinary action.
	   ``What is necessary is not to cry over spilt milk but see
procedures are put in place to make sure this does not happen
again,'' he said.
	   The rehearing in the Law Lords is expected to take place Jan.
18.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An emergency meeting of Arab foreign
ministers, scheduled Wednesday to discuss the U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq, has been postponed until after the holy Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Arab diplomats told The Associated Press on Monday that the
meeting has been rescheduled for Jan. 24. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, Egyptian newspapers had reported that moves were under
way to get the meeting put off.
	   ``There is a trend towards postponing the emergency meeting,''
the daily Al-Akbar said.
	   Plans for this week's meeting were announced by Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid after the U.S. and British
airstrikes on Iraq. The four days of attacks, which ended Dec. 19,
were aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime for refusing to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.

More Namibians flee to Botswana

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Some 250 more Namibians from a
troubled strip of land have crossed the border into Botswana,
bringing the total since October to 1,763, authorities here said
Monday.
	   The latest arrivals from the Caprivi strip came within the past
10 days, said government spokesman Andrew Sesinyi.
	   The Namibians are seeking refugee status, saying they are
fleeing persecution by the Namibian government. Authorities in
Namibia accuse them of supporting secession of the Caprivi area,

Botswana from Angola and Zambia to the north. It touches Zimbabwe

	   The influx of Namibians has contributed to tensions between
Botswana and Namibia, two fairly stable countries in southern

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Likud legislator Benny Begin, a staunch
opponent of the land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians,
announced Monday that he is breaking away from the party to run for
prime minister on his own slate.
	   Begin, a 57-year-old geologist, is a son of Likud's founder and
first prime minister from the party, Menachem Begin. He served as
science minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government,
but quit the Cabinet after Netanyahu agreed to pull troops out of
the West Bank town of Hebron in January 1997.

Thousands of Romanians in hospital after overeating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of Romanians crammed
hospital emergency rooms after stuffing themselves with pork,
pickled cabbage and prune alcohol over Christmas holidays, local
media reported Monday.
	   About 3,500 Romanians called ambulances since Christmas Eve in
Bucharest alone and thousands more were treated elsewhere for
ulcers and gastritis over the weekend, Bucharest newspaper
Libertatea reported Monday.
	   Hospitals nationwide are prepared for more patients as Romanians
continue the traditional indulgence of food and drink through to
New Year's Day.
	   ``It happens every Christmas due to excess of food,'' said Lucia
Oana, a doctor with the state ambulance service in Bucharest. She
said problems ranged from simple stomach aches to liver failure.
	   National television showed images of emergency rooms crowded
with patients holding their stomachs, many unable to speak and
others too embarrassed to say how much they ate.
	   Despite declining living standards, most Romanians managed to
save enough for the traditional holiday meals of pork chops,
cabbage rolls and dozens of other typical dishes washed down with
prune alcohol and vodka.
	   Doctors say sarmales, made of spicy minced meat and pickled
cabbage, generally cause most cases of indigestion.

Doctor testifies Anwar never agreed to DNA testing

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister never agreed to DNA testing, a doctor testified Monday in
Anwar Ibrahim's corruption and sexual misconduct trial.
	   Yet DNA specialists for the prosecution prepared to testify in
the sensational trial now in its eighth week.
	   Dr. Halim Haji Manzar, a pathologist at General Hospital,
testified that he was ordered to go to police headquarters on Sept.
28 to take blood samples from Anwar. The doctor said the blood was
to be tested for the HIV virus, hepatitis and venereal disease.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and then
arrested Sept. 20, faces abuse of power charges and will be tried
separately on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the accusations against him, saying they were
trumped up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked Halim on Monday whether
Anwar agreed to DNA testing. Halim said Anwar only agreed to give
the blood for the testing of diseases.
	   ``At no time did I ask nor did ... Anwar give his consent for
DNA testing,'' Halim testified.
	   Earlier, while cross-examining the prosecution witness, defense
counsel Christopher Fernando asked Halim whether Anwar was
unconscious when the blood was taken. But High Court Judge
Augustine Paul ruled the question irrelevant.
	   The defense may be leading to an argument that Anwar had DNA
samples taken from him by police shortly after his beating, while
he was unconscious.
	   Fernando then asked Halim whether Anwar was fit or ill when he
took the blood samples.
	   ``Not 100 percent fit and not very seriously ill,'' Halim
replied.
	   After Anwar's arrest, he was beaten while in custody. The
investigation into that beating has not yet been released by the
Attorney General's office.
	   Anwar's wife Azizah Ismail expressed fear shortly after his
arrest that police might infect him with the HIV virus to prove
allegations of homosexuality.
	   The prosecution said it would bring in DNA experts to testify on
Tuesday.
	   Lead defense attorney Abdul Raja Aziz asked the judge to defer
that testimony until the defense could fly in its own DNA experts.
	   But Paul denied the request, saying it would delay the trial and
that state DNA experts were qualified.
	   Earlier in the day, the defense failed to win the judge's
approval to begin impeachment proceedings against star prosecution
witness Ummi Hafilda Ali. The defense contends taped conversations
between Ummi and a Malaysian businessman show inconsistencies in
her testimony.
	   The defense team had hoped to play the taped recording Monday of
the conversation it says would prove its theory that there was a
conspiracy to ruin Anwar.
	   Ummi, a 31-year-old advertising executive, wrote a letter to
Mahathir last year alleging Anwar committed adultery with her
sister-in-law.
	   Much of the prosecution case hinges on her testimony and
credibility since she also encouraged Azizan Abu Bakar, a former
driver in Anwar's household, to write a declaration that Anwar
repeatedly sodomized him.
	   Singh told the court Monday that the defense had three
additional tapes of conversations by Ummi and asked that
impeachment proceedings against her be deferred until they could
complete transcripts of the tapes.
	   But Paul thwarted the impeachment process, saying the defense
had not proven the tapes were unedited or that Ummi's testimony had
holes in it.
	   ``We are now in a situation where the defense does not have a
sense of direction,'' he said.

Nuclear reactor restarted in Ukraine after unscheduled repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor was restarted at
Ukraine's Yuzhnaya power plant following brief unscheduled repairs,
officials said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 3 was restarted Sunday after plant operators fixed
the facility's cooling system. The reactor was shut down Saturday
because of hydrogen leaks, the state nuclear energy company
Energoatom said.
	   The shutdown led to an electricity shortage and forced officials
to delay repairs at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, where one
reactor was to have been stopped Saturday.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants provide more than 40 percent
of the former Soviet republic's energy needs. Three of the
country's 14 reactors are currently undergoing repairs.

West Indies bat their way back against South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara led
the charge in trying to drag his team back into the match as they
took lunch on 91 for two wickets on the third day of the third test
against South Africa at Kingsmead Monday.
	   Earlier, South Africa was dismissed for 312, the first time
either side has scored in excess of 300 in this series.
	   This gave the hosts a 114-run lead, which was all but wiped out
by some sparkling strokeplay by Lara on 32 not out, and a typically
gritty undefeated 20 by Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Lara has looked in
sublime form, playing some breathtaking cover drives off all the
bowlers.
	   Allan Donald started the innings with pace and hostility, and he
was the first to strike. He removed Philo Wallace for one.
	   Shaun Pollock was unlucky to have Junior Murray caught off a
no-ball, but the wicketkeeper retreaded into an opening batsman and
	   was caught pulling once too often, off the first ball of Jacques
Kallis' first spell of the second innings.
	   In dismissing South Africa in just 4.4 overs this morning, and
ridding themselves of Jonty Rhodes for 87 and an obstinate Donald
for 13, the West Indies are playing themselves back into the match
especially with Lara looking so threatening.

Singapore's manufacturing output continues to slide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's manufacturing output, a key
economic indicator, shrank 3.3 percent last month compared to the
same period a year ago, the government Economic Development Board
said Monday.
	   November's contraction was less severe than October's
year-on-year dip of 7.5 percent, but deeper than the 0.8 percent
decline in September, the board said.
	   Production in the fields of precision, transport and process
engineering slumped 10 percent in November compared to the previous
year. But the electronics sector, which accounts for the largest
proportion of the country's industrial output, managed a 0.4
percent gain last month.
	   The board said in a statement that the growth in electronics
``was due to higher output of computers, computer peripherals,
printed circuit boards...and telecommunications equipment in
response to orders from the U.S. and Europe.''
	   Production in the chemicals industry _ including petroleum,
petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals _ grew 5.1
percent compared with November last year, it said.

Sharif's government stops Bhutto from traveling abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani authorities Monday stopped
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto from going to Dubai, saying
she cannot travel abroad because of ongoing corruption cases
against her.
	   ``They (authorities) showed me a written order that I can't go
abroad because there are (corruption) cases against me,'' Bhutto
told reporters at the Karachi airport as she wiped her tears with
tissue paper.
	   Bhutto was going to Dubai to celebrate New Year with her three
children who are studying there.
	   ``My children have nothing to do with politics. The incident has
shocked me. . . it has also exposed the ugliness of Pakistani
politics,'' Bhutto said.
	   Former President Farooq Leghari sacked Bhutto in November 1996
under allegations of corruption and misrule. She and her jailed
husband Asif Ali Zardari face a number of corruption cases in
Pakistani courts.
	   Bhutto denied the charges and accuses Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif of massive corruption, loan defaults and illegal transfer of
money to foreign bank accounts.

Swiss hopeful over Chinese clearance for balloon attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China
will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly
the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world
flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
	   The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone
its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals
Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect
previously agreed conditions.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and
is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard
and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry
spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
	   Piccard and Jones, who had obtained conditional permission, had
previously said they might take off as soon as Sunday. It would be
Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a
balloon around the world nonstop.
	   Beijing originally gave British tycoon Branson, Chicago
millionaire Fossett and Lindstrand, of Sweden, permission to cross
China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   The trio, however, drifted further north last Monday. After
diplomatic communications between Britain and China, the
balloonists were allowed to continue flying as long as they left
China as quickly as possible.
	   Caught in poor weather conditions, the team splashed down off
Hawaii Friday.
	   Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream
winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
	   Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday by
strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs,
Australia.

Curfew imposed in Pakistani city after six people die in riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ The army sealed roads leading to a
northern Pakistani city, where it imposed an indefinite curfew
after clashes between armed mobs and security forces left six
people dead and 20 wounded, authorities said Monday.
	   Armed mobs attacked police stations and torched at least 10
police check points Sunday in Bannu city, some 120 kilometers (75
miles) south of Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier
Province.
	   The violence was prompted by protest against the killing of
15-year-old Haroonur Rasheed. Policeman Syed Rasul is accused of
trying to sodomize the boy and shooting him dead when he resisted.
	   ``It is a very sad incident,'' said Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan,
chief minister of the province told reporters. ``Rasul has been
arrested and will be tried before a speedy court.''
	   Bannu city has been sealed with barbed wires, and the army
patrol teams are directing people to stay home, the state-run
Associated Press of Pakistan said Monday.
	   ``Life has totally been paralyzed in Bannu city and all the
government . . . offices are closed,'' it said.

Asian stock markets close generally lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Monday after the Christmas holiday, with the key index slumping 3
percent in Taipei.
	   Some investors in Taiwan doubt that a market stabilization fund
set up by the government can prop up the local bourse, traders
said.
	   Participating institutions in the fund would have to spend too
much money to push up the market at a time when the island's
economic fundamentals were weak, a dealer said.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 201.35
points to 6,481.65.
	   Japanese share prices also fell as talks about forming a
conservative coalition government broke down.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 88.89
points, or 0.64 percent, to close at 13,709.06. On Friday, the
average closed up 91.22 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   Shares fell after a spokesman for the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party said negotiations with a smaller party over forming a
coalition government had reached an impasse.
	   Without the Liberal Party's votes to give it a majority in the
upper house, the LDP could have a tough time winning passage of key
bank-bailout legislation, analysts warned.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 116.12 yen, down 0.06
yen from late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York and
London were closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.
	   Hong Kong stocks slumped in extremely thin trading.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 122.06, or 1.2 percent, closing at 10,170.14.
	   Turnover fell to 1.222 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 156
million), its lowest full-day of trading level since Jan. 4, 1993,
when it stood at 1.020 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 130
million).
	   Markets were closed in Australia and New Zealand for holidays.
	   Elsewhere:
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed mixed, with the main
index closing little changed as many participants remained on the
sidelines ahead of the New Year break. The Philippine Stock
Exchange index of 30 selected stocks edged up 0.79 point to
1,932.39.
	   SEOUL: The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 7.10 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 562.46.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed in stagnant
trading. The benchmark Composite Index rose 3.82 points, or 0.6
percent, to 556.14.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower in thin trading. The
Straits Times Index fell 11.48 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,381.27.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on continued profit-taking.
The Composite Index fell 1.679 points. or 0.4 percent, to 400.176.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher on buying by retail
investors hoping for quick gains. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index rose 4.13 points, or 1.2 percent, to 360.29.

Hong Kong exports, production fall in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Weaker demand for Hong Kong-made products led
to a sharp decline in the territory's exports and industrial
production last month, while its trade deficit narrowed, the
government said Monday.
	   Exports fell by 9.3 percent in November compared to the same
month a year ago to 113.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 14.5
billion).
	   The slackened demand for goods produced in Hong Kong took a toll
on industrial output, which fell by 10.2 percent in the
July-September quarter, compared with the same period the previous
year.
	   Production in the food, beverage, and tobacco industries fell by
15.8 percent on the year. Output of basic metals and fabricated
metal products fell by 14.7 percent. Textile industry production
also fell sharply, by 13.2 percent.
	   A government spokesman attributed the decline in exports to a
plunge in demand from Japan and other East Asian economies hit by
the regional financial turmoil, as well as a softening of demand in
the United States and Europe.
	   For the first 11 months of the year, exports fell 6.9 percent
and imports, hit by falling domestic demand, dropped 11 percent, an
economic report said.
	   Shipments of products that come in from mainland China before
being re-exported elsewhere declined by 8.2 percent, while exports
of goods produced domestically fell by 15.8 percent in the first 11
months of 1998.
	   Chinese-made products make up the majority of Hong Kong's
exports.
	   Exports to mainland China also continued to fall, the government
said.
	   Meanwhile, weak domestic demand led to a smaller trade deficit
of 74.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 9.6 billion) in the
11-month period, compared with a 145.8 billion Hong Kong dollar
(U.S. dlrs 18.7 billion) deficit in the same period last year, the
report said.
	   The November deficit amounted to 700 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 89.7 million), or just 0.6 percent of the value of
imports.
	   The decline in industrial production was also partially due to
the relocation of production to mainland China, the government
said.

Russian armed forces cut down to 1.2 million
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Monday that Russia's
armed forces have been cut to 1.2 million troops, down from 1.5
million troops a year ago, and meeting the government's target for
reducing the military.
	   Yeltsin spoke during a meeting with Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, who briefed the president on the progress of army reform.
	   ``The target is met, the mission is accomplished,'' Yeltsin
summed up, as reporters listened in.
	   The government has been gradually trimming the bloated and
underfunded military, which had about 5 million men during the
1980s.
	   There are no plans to cut the military below 1.2 million _ still
a huge burden for the cash-strapped Russian government, struggling
with the gravest economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
The Russian military barely functions, lacking funds to buy new
weapons or maintain its aging arsenal.
	   Critics advocate deeper cuts, citing abysmal conditions in the
military. Military officials have acknowledged they are short of
funds to feed and dress troops. Begging soldiers are a common sight
on the streets of Russian cities.
	   In 1996, Yeltsin pledged to turn the military into an
all-volunteer force and end conscription by the year 2000, but the
government later dropped the plan, saying it could not afford a
professional army.
	   During the meeting, Yeltsin telephoned Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov to say the government must allocate 3.6 percent of next
year's budget to the military.
	   Russia's coffers are so bare that the entire 1999 budget calls
for government spending of just 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion). By comparison, the United States government collects and
spends more than dlrs 30 billion in an average week.
	   Sergeyev said, however, that the sum would be enough for the
military and thanked Yeltsin for a promised rise in military
salaries next year. In the past, the government has usually failed
to meet spending promises.
	   During their meeting, Yeltsin also praised Sergeyev for starting
the deployment of the new Topol-M ballistic missiles, designed as a
backbone of Russia's strategic missile force. On Sunday, the
minister inaugurated the first 10 Topol-M missiles at the
Tatishchevo missile base, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) south of
Moscow.
	   ``We have achieved a very important goal. We have planned to
deploy the new Topol-M missiles and we did it on time,'' Yeltsin
said.
	   The deployment was a major step for Russia's beleaguered
military. The government committed scarce resources to the Topol-M,
due to replace aging missiles to be cut under the START II arms
reduction agreement with the United States.
	   Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and the
U.S. Senate approved it in 1996, but the Communist-dominated
Russian parliament has stalled ratification, claiming it would hurt
Russia's security.
	   The lawmakers appeared heading toward its approval earlier this
month, but then again delayed ratification until next spring to
protest U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq.

Khmer Rouge defectors, shielded by premier, will escape trial

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen defied
growing pressure Monday to bring two Khmer Rouge leaders to trial
for genocide and said they would face neither an international
tribunal nor a Cambodian court.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said before a
Cabinet meeting. ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look
toward the future.''
	   The Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, remained
holed up in the ex-rebel stronghold of Pailin in the northwest,
where they were staying in guest houses under the protection of old
comrades who defected to the government two years ago.
	   The pair agreed to defect _ in effect, surrender _ in a phone
call with Hun Sen on Christmas, 20 years to the day after
Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer
Rouge regime.
	   The government slammed the door on intense international demands
that Khieu Samphan, the official leader though others held real
power, and political chief Nuon Chea stand trial.
	   ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome him for national
reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a bouquet of
flowers for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.''
	   Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the
Khmer Rouge by offering amnesty to leaders in exchange for ending
civil war, bringing peace to large areas of Cambodia for the first
time in a generation.
	   With the movement now all but extinct _ only one leader, the
one-legged general, Ta Mok, and perhaps 100 followers are still at
large _ demands are growing for someone to be held accountable for
the reign of terror that left as many as 2 million people dead.
	   Hun Sen said Monday that he would never make a deal with Ta Mok,
known as ``The Butcher'' for his revolutionary brutality. He once
said the same thing of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
	   Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official who fled bloody purges in
1977, said peace was more important than prison.
	   ``This is a pure Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know
the right medicine to use to cure this problem. If any foreigners
try to add something, it will never go away.''
	   Hun Sen said he had the support of King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
aimed at bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said.
``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now be
denied.''
	   United Nations legal experts recently visited to assess the
possibility of creating an international tribunal to try Khmer
Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity.
	   Perhaps one Cambodian in five perished of disease, overwork,
starvation and executions after the Maoist revolutionaries won a
civil war in 1975 and forced the population into labor camps.
	   After 30 years of war and terror, many Cambodians rate peace
higher that bringing the killers who once ruled them to trial. But
the recent U.N. visit raised hopes of finding justice away from the
volatile politics of Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen said there was little point: ``If the wound no longer
hurts, we shouldn't poke a stick in it and make it bleed.''
	   Earlier, government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said that
speculation about a trial was raising fears among the defectors
that they would be arrested.
	   Hun Sen's assurances should make it easier for them to keep a
scheduled meeting with him in the capital Tuesday.
	   Gen. Meas Sophea, deputy army chief of staff, had said the trip
was still on schedule and the rebels would receive tight security.
	   In Pailin, they are relatively safe. Though nominally under
government control, the area is run by a pardoned former Khmer
Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary, their old comrade.
	   The last time Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly
after a landmark peace treaty was signed, he was hurt in a mob
attack orchestrated by the government. The Khmer Rouge eventually
turned their backs on the treaty.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that Khmer Rouge victims
have waited too long for justice.
	   ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' the party said.

Wachter beats Meissnitzer, clinches first victory of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wachter looks for a podium finish in a night slalom &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) - After her first giant slalom victory
in nearly three years, Austrian veteran Anita Wachter is looking
for another podium finish Monday in a night slalom at the
Hirschenkogel course.
	   Wachter, a 15-year-veteran of the Austrian national team, had
been largely written off as a contendor after a crash in Cortina,
Italy, last season which left her with severe knee injuries.
	   But the 31-year-old Austrian managed to come back after two
operations to beat the overall World Cup leader, Alexandra
Meissnitzer of Austria, Sunday in what was her best race since
January 1996.
	   Wachter faces tough competition Monday, with the slalom
standings leader Anja Paerson of Sweden, runner-up Sabine Egger of
Austria, and third Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden all in a good shape.
	   Switzerland's Karin Roten, winner of the last World Cup slalom
at her home territory of Veysonnaz, and Slovenian Urska Hrovat are
also looking for success.
	   Meissnitzer takes a break Monday, slalom being her least
favorite discipline.
	   This opens the door for Martina Ertl of Germany to close the
351-point gap in the overall standings.
	   A jubilant Wachter called Sunday's victory _ her first in almost
three years _ ``incredible.''
	   ``I knew could be in the top three today, but the victory is a
big surprise,'' she said Sunday after denying Meissnitzer a third
straight giant slalom victory.
	   Meissnitzer, the favorite and overall World Cup leader, finished
a relatively distant second and said she had no chance against her
countrywoman.
	   Wachter sped down the fast, perfectly prepared Hirschenkogel
course Sunday in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 7.90
seconds, beating Meissnitzer by 0.74 seconds.
	   ``I gained a lot of self-confidence from that race,'' Wachter
said.
	   When Wachter, the 1993 overall World Cup champion, put her skis
on again after four months of rehabilitation, she knew she wouldn't
be able to compete in speed disciplines anytime soon.
	   She decided to pursue World Cup points in slalom and giant
slalom only, a move which has brought her third place in the giant
slalom standings after four events.
	   ``I didn't know how my knees would react to a full load,'' she
explained. ``Now I see it was a good decision.''
	   She added: ``I risked a lot today, more than anyone else.''
	   The 31-year old Austrian, on the women's alpine skiing circuit
since 1985, hopes for a podium finish at the alpine skiing World
Championships at Vail, Colorado, in January.
	   ``I proved to myself I'm still good,'' she said.
	   Meissnitzer squandered her chances on the second run, in which
she finished a disappointing tenth.
	   ``In the last few days, the pressure was pretty high,'' the
Austrian champion said.
	   Praising Wachter for her performance, Meissnitzer said she

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Starting with the head of an Islamic
party, Turkey's latest premier-designate began talks Monday with
party leaders to seek support for a new coalition government.
	   Yalim Erez, an independent lawmaker appointed last week, is
trying to form a broad-based coalition that would include Cabinet
members from several parties to run the country until elections set
for April.
	   ``I am looking for a government that has the widest support
possible. This does not depend on me alone,'' Erez said after a
meeting with Islamic Virtue Party leader Recai Kutan. ``I am
looking for a grand compromise.''
	   Kutan agreed that a consensus was needed within Parliament but
did not say if his party would support Erez.
	   ``We will make our decision after a second-round meeting with
Erez,'' Kutan told reporters.
	   Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a
coalition government led by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed last month over
allegations that the acting premier rigged the sale of a bank.
	   News reports have suggested that Virtue, the largest bloc in
Parliament, would only support Erez if the number of pro-Islamic
ministers he appoints is proportionate to the number of seats the
party holds in Parliament.
	   Erez denied that the two had discussed ministerial posts.

Wachter beats Meissnitzer, clinches first victory of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wachter looks for a podium finish in a night
slalom &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) _ After her first giant slalom victory
in nearly three years, Austrian veteran Anita Wachter is looking
for another podium finish Monday in a night slalom at the
Hirschenkogel course.
	   Wachter, a 15-year-veteran of the Austrian national team, had
been largely written off after a crash in Cortina, Italy, last
season which left her with severe knee injuries.
	   But the 31-year-old managed to come back after two operations to
beat the overall World Cup leader, Alexandra Meissnitzer of
Austria, on Sunday in what was her best race since January 1996.
	   Wachter faces tough competition Monday, with the slalom
standings leader Anja Paerson of Sweden, runner-up Sabine Egger of
Austria, and third Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden all in a good shape.
	   Switzerland's Karin Roten, winner of the last World Cup slalom
at her home territory of Veysonnaz, and Slovenian Urska Hrovat are
also looking for success.
	   Meissnitzer takes a break Monday, slalom being her least
favorite discipline.
	   This opens the door for Martina Ertl of Germany to close the
351-point gap in the overall standings.
	   A jubilant Wachter called Sunday's victory _ her first in almost
three years _ ``incredible.''
	   ``I knew could be in the top three today, but the victory is a
big surprise,'' she said Sunday after denying Meissnitzer a third
straight giant slalom victory.
	   Meissnitzer, the favorite and overall World Cup leader, finished
a relatively distant second and said she had no chance against her
countrywoman.
	   Wachter sped down the fast, perfectly prepared Hirschenkogel
course Sunday in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 7.90
seconds, beating Meissnitzer by 0.74 seconds.
	   ``I gained a lot of self-confidence from that race,'' Wachter
said.
	   When Wachter, the 1993 overall World Cup champion, put her skis
on again after four months of rehabilitation, she knew she wouldn't
be able to compete in speed disciplines anytime soon.
	   She decided to pursue World Cup points in slalom and giant
slalom only, a move which has brought her third place in the giant
slalom standings after four events.
	   ``I didn't know how my knees would react to a full load,'' she
explained. ``Now I see it was a good decision.''
	   She added: ``I risked a lot today, more than anyone else.''
	   The 31-year old Austrian, on the women's alpine skiing circuit
since 1985, hopes for a podium finish at the alpine skiing World
Championships at Vail, Colorado, in January.
	   ``I proved to myself I'm still good,'' she said.
	   Meissnitzer squandered her chances on the second run, in which
she finished a disappointing tenth.
	   ``In the last few days, the pressure was pretty high,'' the
Austrian champion said.
	   Praising Wachter for her performance, Meissnitzer said she
wouldn't have won even if she hadn't been so cautious in the second
run.
	   ``Today I simply had no chance,'' she said.
	   Finishing eighth in Sunday's first run, Norway's Andrine Flemmen
came home third in a combined 2:09.33, posting a brilliant second
leg.
	   Despite being beaten, Meissnitzer boosted her lead atop the
overall World Cup standings, where she sits with 891 points.
	   Germany's Martina Ertl, seventh in Sunday's race, is second with
504, followed by Austrian Renate Goetschl with 485.

Taiwan orders plastics company to ship back waste from Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The Taiwan government on Monday ordered
Formosa Plastics to ship back 3,000 tons of mercury-laced waste it
had dumped in Cambodia, saying its toxic level slightly exceeded
safety standards.
	   The company questioned the tests, performed by an environmental
group, and made no commitments about shipping the waste back to
Taiwan.
	   Five deaths have been blamed on the waste _ a dock worker who
died a day after cleaning the hold of the ship that brought it, and
four more killed in road accidents in a panic-stricken exodus from
the area where it was discovered more than two weeks ago.
	   The government's Environmental Protection Bureau said tests of
the waste samples show a mercury level of 0.284 parts per million,
compared with the 0.2 parts per million safety standard set by the
government.
	   The samples were taken back from the dump site in Cambodia
Saturday by the environmental group Green Formosa Front.
	   ``It poses no immediate health threat and we urge Cambodians not
to panic,'' Fu Shu-chiang, head of the Bureau's Waste Control
Department told a news conference. ``But we want the waste to be
shipped back to Taiwan before other alternatives can be
considered.''
	   The Cambodian government has asked Taiwan to take the waste
back, accusing Taiwan of trying to dump toxic waste in poor
countries.
	   But Formosa Plastics, which generated the waste, questioned the
sampling method used by Formosa Front, saying earlier government
analyses showed the waste met the safety standards.
	   Lee Chih-chun, general manager of the company, said it will send
a team of European and U.S. specialists to Cambodia to conduct its
own sampling and tests before deciding whether to ship the waste
back.
	   In a statement, the company said, ``we will take full
responsibility for this unfortunate incident, which has caused
jitters among the Cambodian government and its people.''
	   After the incident is settled, it said, it will ``make
consolations'' to the Cambodian people, including paying for the
expenses of a Japanese team that analyzed the waste.

After a tumultuous 1998, Indonesia faces more uncertainty as
</HEADLINE>
elections near
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ If the soothsayers are right,
Indonesia is heading for another stormy year.
	   They're not the only ones who predict more upheaval in the
world's fourth most populous nation, which endured a year of
economic hardship, riots, protests and the downfall of a president.
	   Free of the stern rule of authoritarian leader Suharto for the
first time since the 1960s, many Indonesians fear parliamentary
elections scheduled for June 7 might be chaotic. Even when Suharto
was in power, tightly controlled polls were often marred by deadly
violence.
	   ``We need to be cautious,'' said Abdurrahman Wahid, a prominent
Muslim leader and government critic who is considered a possible
presidential candidate.
	   Dozens of newly formed political parties are vying for influence
and students who have fought police are likely to resume
anti-government protests in early 1999. The economy is shrinking
and religious and ethnic tensions are growing.
	   Things could get so bad that Indonesia's experiment with
democracy will stumble, reputed clairvoyants say. Their opinions
get a wide audience in the Southeast Asian nation of 200 million
people, where many believe in the supernatural.
	   ``The election will not take place because turmoil and bloodshed
will break out between April and May,'' The Jakarta Post quoted
soothsayer Laurentia Pasaribu as saying.
	   Even if she is wrong, her prognosis reflects a popular mood of
pessimism about Indonesia's future. The euphoria that greeted
Suharto's ouster in May faded long ago and Habibie has warned that
recent unrest poses a threat to national stability.
	   Student protesters wept and danced with joy and citywide riots
by Indonesia's poor subsided after Suharto quit, his credibility
undermined by his failure to revive the shattered economy as well
as a longtime intolerance for dissent.
	   Then, a new litany of tensions emerged, no longer stifled by the
rigid rule of Suharto.
	   Deprived of its patron, the new government remained a bastion of
Suharto appointees even though it had distanced itself from the
ex-president and embarked on political reforms.
	   Students launched new protests against President B.J. Habibie,
who has not yielded to their demands that he put Suharto on trial
and strip the military of its prominent political role.
	   Habibie, once a close ally of Suharto, ordered a corruption
investigation of Suharto but critics have dismissed it as cosmetic.
	   After security forces killed nine student demonstrators during a
Nov. 13 protest, some activists became more militant, attacking
police with bamboo staves at later rallies.
	   They may be back on the streets after the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan ends in January.
	   The overstretched military plans to deploy thousands of civilian
guards in 1999 to help keep order, a move that opponents say might
backfire and provoke more violence.
	   Religious unrest also erupted on Nov. 22 when Muslim mobs burned
or ransacked more than a dozen Christian churches. A week later,
Christians in the eastern city of Kupang retaliated by attacking
mosques.
	   In an outburst of ethnic violence on Monday, mobs armed with
sickles and swords battled each other and hurled gasoline bombs at
houses and shops in the town of Poso on Sulawesi island.
	   The attacks by townspeople on the homes of migrants from the
main island of Java left 22 people injured.
	   There have also been scattered outbursts of worker unrest in
Indonesia, where millions of people have lost their jobs and prices
of basic commodities have soared.
	   ``Competition to get power is normal in a democratic society,''
said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, an aide to Habibie.
	   ``But the problem here in Indonesia is that public figures have
to prevent their followers from going on rampages,'' she said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs armed with sickles and swords on
Monday battled each other and hurled gasoline bombs at houses and
shops in an Indonesian provincial town. At least 22 people were
injured and hundreds of residents fled their homes.
	   The riots in the town of Poso on Sulawesi island were triggered
by weekend brawls between rival gangs of youths. The unrest
escalated partly into attacks by townspeople on the homes of
migrants from the main island of Java.
	   But the motive for much of the violence was unclear, with mobs
attacking stores and houses at random. Rioters set afire as many as
20 buildings and threw stones at the bus station, a local resident,
Hajj Fatma, said by telephone.
	   ``The center of the town was blackened from the smoke billowing
into the sky,'' Fatma said. She was preparing food for civilian
guards who patrolled neighborhoods, fearing more violence.
	   At least 100 families fled to a mountain outside Poso while
others sought shelter with relatives. One witness said he saw eight
truckloads of rioters drive into his neighborhood.
	   Police and soldiers were also deployed to protect government
buildings and mosques and churches in Poso, 1,500 kilometers (930
miles) northeast of Jakarta. Shops were closed and buses stayed off
the streets.
	   A nurse at the local hospital said by telephone that 22 people
were injured, including one man whose neck had been cut by a sword.
Other victims bled from head wounds after being hit by rocks.
	   Indonesia has endured sporadic riots this year amid economic
hardship and rising ethnic and religious tensions. Deadly riots in
Jakarta helped force former President Suharto to quit in May after
32 years of authoritarian rule.

Regional allies to meet over conflict in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Representatives from member nations
of the Economic Community of West African States are scheduled to
hold emergency talks Monday to discuss the growing rebel war in
nearby Sierra Leone.
	   The ECOWAS officials are expected to put pressure on Sierra
Leone's embattled President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to open a dialogue
with a rebel army threatening to shell the capital of Freetown, a
newspaper reported.
	   Rebel fighters say they have moved to within striking distance
of Freetown and a top commander has threatened to start shelling
the city anytime.
	   Member states of the West African bloc will hold the talks in
large part to reaffirm their commitment to defending Kabbah's
democratically elected government, but also to urge a dialogue
between the warring sides, the daily Fraternite Matin newspaper
reported.
	   A Nigerian-led regional peacekeeping force operating under the
ECOWAS banner has been working in effect as Kabbah's defense force
since Sierra Leone's military was disbanded amid defections to the
rebels.
	   Kabbah was deposed after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma staged a
coup in May 1997 and installed a military junta with the support of
Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front.
	   The ECOWAS coalition force drove Koroma from power and helped
return Kabbah, but has failed to disarm rebel fighters who in
recent weeks have stepped up attacks near Freetown.
	   Rebel leader Sam Bockarie's Revolutionary United Front has
staged a surprise series of assaults in recent days, reportedly
moving his troops to within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of Freetown _
now filled with refugees from the nearby town of Waterloo.
	   The RUF along with remnants of the former military junta have
been waging a campaign of terror in the countryside since their
ouster in February.
	   Human rights groups and aid workers say thousands of Sierra
Leonean civilians have been butchered and maimed at the hands of
the rebels.
	   Rebel leaders have denied the charges.
	   Gunmen from the Nigerian-led coalition force, known as ECOMOG,
along with traditional militiamen, have been reinforcing the
capital in anticipation of the looming attack by the rebels.

Health Ministry plays down report about deadly virus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to lead with Health Ministry comment; CHANGES overline
and EDITS to conform

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Health Ministry played down a
news report on Monday that said mandatory vaccinations would be
given to 10,000 residents in a town outside Kuala Lumpur to prevent
the outbreak of a deadly virus.
	   ``The outbreak is already over. We don't want to panic
everybody,'' said Tee Ahsian, an official in the Ministry's Disease
Control Unit.
	   According to a report in Monday's Star newspaper, some 10,000
people living and working in the vicinity of 16 pig farms in the
town of Shah Alam were told to register for vaccinations against
Japanese encephalitis.
	   Health officials have been monitoring a rise in cases of the
virus, which is believed to be passed to people by mosquitoes that
have bitten infected pigs. Twenty cases have been reported in the
past year, including seven deaths.
	   Most cases of the disease have been reported in the western
state of Perak and in Sarawak state on Borneo island. None have
been reported in Shah Alam, 25 kilometers (16 miles) west of the
capital.
	   Izhar Kadarman, the head of the municipal council's health
department, was quoted as saying the health ministry considered the
municipality a high risk area, however, due to the number of pig
farms.
	   Tee, of the ministry, said that Shah Alam had not been specified
as a high risk area, since no cases of the disease have been
reported there. She added a census was still being taken to
determine the number of people potentially at risk.
	   The ministry has, however, advised workers on pig farms to be
vaccinated, Tee said.
	   According to a ministry report last month, the disease, which
attacks the brain, is not transmitted by eating pork. Symptoms
include high fever and headaches for up to a week, muscle and back
aches, vomiting, drowsiness and a coma several days later.

Yeltsin orders state support for embattled TV station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has approved a government
loan for Russia's main television station, which had complained
that Communists were trying to take it over, the Kremlin said
Monday.
	   Yeltsin signed orders for Russia's Foreign Economics Bank to
open a line of credit for an unspecified amount to ORT, or Russian
Public Television, the Kremlin press service said.
	   The government, which holds a controlling interest in the
network, and other ORT shareholders were to deposit shares with the
bank as collateral for the loan, Yeltsin's decree said.
	   ORT had been sued for bankruptcy earlier this month, but the
suit was dropped after network chief Igor Shabdurasulov appealed to
Yeltsin for protection, saying Communist politicians were using the
company's massive debts in a bid to take control.
	   According to the business daily Kommersant, ORT owes up to dlrs
80 million to private creditors and the government.
	   Communists have long demanded the introduction of what they call
``people's councils'' to monitor and control television broadcasts.
TV executives and Russian liberals say the councils would
effectively be censors.
	   ORT, which reaches 98 percent of Russia's population, first drew
criticism from opposition leaders in 1996 for what they said was
unfair coverage of that year's presidential race. The station
focused heavily on Yeltsin's campaign, gave critical coverage to
his main opponent, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, and painted a
gloomy picture of Russia's future should Communists return to
power.

Sahara refugees lose hope for delayed independence referendum

	   SMARA REFUGEE CAMP, Algeria (AP) _ Living in the desert, Dijya
Salek is used to mirages.
	   But the most elusive is the promised referendum that she and
thousands of other Saharawis hope will return them to an
independent Western Sahara after a quarter century in desolate
refugee camps.
	   The camps are a sea of beige-colored tents and brown mud hovels
surrounded by sand and gravel stretching to the horizon. There is
scant water or electricity and barely enough vegetation to support
the goat herds.
	   With few resources, the refugees produce little besides
handicrafts, such as sandals, colorful veils, and rugs. For 23
years they have depended almost entirely on international aid and
relief groups.
	   ``The hardest thing is simply having to live here, with little
food, little water and little possibility of change,'' said Salek,
who has spent all but two of her 25 years in Smara.
	   A blue and gold embroidered Islamic veil conceals her face, but
her voice is forlorn, lacking the joy and openness for which her
people are noted.
	   ``They talk of a referendum, but it's always beyond reach,'' she
said, gazing across the wind-whipped, barren landscape of western
Algeria where Smara and three other camps lie.
	   Proposals for a ballot on independence from Morocco stretch back
to an International Court of Justice ruling in 1975 and have been
proposed and postponed periodically ever since.
	   Plans were made for a vote in 1992, a year after the United
Nations-sponsored truce ended a war between 15,000 ragged Saharawi
rebels of the Polisario movement and Morocco's U.S.-equipped modern
army.
	   The war began after Morocco annexed and moved settlers into the
territory when Spain ended a century of colonial rule in 1976.
	   Polisario fighters took control of a quarter of Western Sahara,
but the conflict forced 150,000 Saharawis eastward to settlements
they expected to be temporary. Tens of thousands more _ no one
knows exactly how many _ still live under Moroccan rule in Western
Sahara.
	   The latest planned referendum was scheduled for Dec. 7, but a
continuing dispute over who will get to vote caused it to be pushed
back to next December.
	   Moroccan King Hassan II claims Western Sahara has traditionally
been a part of his country.
	   Rich fishing grounds lie off the territory's 600-mile
(960-kilometer) coastline, and the interior holds ample phosphate
deposits and untapped oil resources.
	   Unlike Polisario, Morocco has powerful friends, among them the
United States and the European Union, which view it as a friendly
nation in a volatile region. Morocco was among the first Arab
states to back the United States in the Gulf War and has strong
trade ties with Spain and France.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's visit last month raised
hopes among the refugees, but only briefly.
	   The Saharawis consider Annan and special U.N. representative
James Baker III, a former U.S. secretary of state, as their best
chance for ending the conflict. But Annan dismissed suggestions of
sanctions on Morocco, which has delayed the referendum on Western
Sahara's political future by seeking clarifications and amendments
on every point.
	   ``He said nothing. The truth is, Morocco does not want a
referendum and nobody wants to pressure Morocco,'' said Naja Alien,
a Polisario member. ``We thought he'd come with something definite,
but we're back where we have always been: waiting.''

Thai economy forecast to grow in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's recession-stricken economy
should grow 0.9 percent next year after shrinking 7.8 percent in
1998, a national planning board reported Monday.
	   Wirat Wattanasiritham, secretary-general of Thailand's National
Economic and Social Development Board, told government economic
ministers that key determinants of growth in 1999 will be export
performance, exchange rates and the state of global markets.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda told reporters after the
ministers' meeting that the economy will expand by at least 0.9
percent on the basis of an average exchange rate for the Thai baht
of 36 to 37 per U.S. dollar.
	   Exports are forecast to expand 4.8 percent next year in dollar
terms, economic board head Wirat said, after a contraction this
year that the central bank has estimated at 6.7 percent to 6.9
percent.
	   The central bank and the economic board currently make their own
estimates. Finance Minister Tarrin has said a project is under way
to develop a unified system by 2000.
	   Thailand grew accustomed to annual growth rates in excess of 7
percent during a boom in the early 1990s. But the growth bubble
burst last year after a decision to devalue the baht triggered a
region-wide meltdown.
	   Since taking power a year ago, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's
adherence to the conditions of a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout arranged
by the International Monetary Fund has restored some confidence in
Thailand's hard-hit economy.
	   The baht has regained about half the value it had lost at its
nadir last year and the stock market has staged a mild recovery.

Two die, six missing in yacht race

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British sailor Glyn Charles was missing
and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while five others remained stranded
in a liferaft in rough seas when night fell Monday.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles
could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off
Sword of Orion on Sunday night.
	   ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and
80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it.''
	   Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in
the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered
the entrants while four members from the veteran cutter Winston
Churchill were winched to safety from a liferaft.
	   Another liferaft containing the remaining five members of
Winston Churchill was reported to have been sighted by a search
helicopter late Monday night, but it was uncertain whether a rescue
would be attempted.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. ``He loved
the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race.
Dad simply loved life.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four
rescued.
	   ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into
the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned
thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody
frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quickly. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

Sharif's government stops Bhutto from traveling abroad

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani authorities on Monday stopped
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto from going to Dubai, saying
she cannot travel abroad because of ongoing corruption cases
against her.
	   ``They (authorities) showed me a written order that I can't go
abroad because there are (corruption) cases against me,'' Bhutto
told reporters at the Karachi airport as she wiped her tears with
tissue paper.
	   Bhutto was going to Dubai to celebrate New Year with her three
children who are studying there.
	   Bhutto, twice elected prime minister and the opposition leader,
said she will file a contempt of court suit against the government
because there was no court order banning her from traveling abroad.
	   ``I will ask court to give me permission to meet my children,''
she said. ``My children have nothing to do with politics. The
incident has shocked me. . . it has also exposed the ugliness of
Pakistani politics.''
	   ``The government is trying to exploit the emotions of a mother
by not allowing me to see my children. . . It is another black
chapter,'' she said.
	   Former President Farooq Leghari sacked Bhutto in November 1996
under allegations of corruption and misrule. She and her jailed
husband Asif Ali Zardari face a number of corruption cases in
Pakistani courts.
	   Bhutto denied the charges and accuses Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif of massive corruption, loan defaults and illegal transfer of
money to foreign bank accounts.
	   Dozens of supporters of Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples' Party raised
anti-Sharif slogans.
	   ``Down with Sharif and his corrupt government,'' they said.
	   Sharif's government has been jolted by a series of stories in
local and foreign newspapers which accused him and his family of
graft and also purchasing millions of pounds (dollars) worth
property in London.
	   The opposition is demanding an independent inquiry into charges
against Sharif, who denies these allegations.
	   Bhutto said she was stopped from traveling abroad because of her
speech in the parliament Saturday in which she assailed Sharif for
``corruption.''
	   ``For the last two years, me and my family have been being

	   There was no immediate comment from the government.

Court in Lahore city challenging government's decision of putting
her name on exit control list.

Registration opens for municipal elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Candidates began registering on Monday to
run in Iran's municipal elections, scheduled for Feb. 26.
	   Balloting for mayors and municipal councils _ the first to be
held since the 1979 Islamic revolution _ will be the next contest
between hard-liners and moderates who support President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   Registration is to last a week. Later, the Interior Ministry,
which oversees municipal elections, will approve candidates from an
anticipated 800,000 applicants.
	   There are 10,000 municipalities in Iran, and voters will be
selecting mayors and governing councils. Upwards of 200,000 people
will be elected to manage local government affairs and advise the
central government on social and cultural activities.
	   A victory by moderate candidates would be seen as an endorsement
of Khatami and create a broad base of support for his efforts to
create a less restrictive society.
	   Since Khatami's election in May 1997, hard-liners have resisted
his efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and to
reduce Islamic strictures on average Iranians _ reforms that seem
to have widespread public support.
	   Moderates hope the municipal elections will produce a huge
turnout similar to the one that gave Khatami his own victory.
	   In the 1997 presidential vote, 30 million of Iran's 38.5
eligible million voters cast ballots, 20 million of them for
Khatami.
	   In last October's elections for the Assembly of Experts, a
hard-line council vetted the would-be candidates, and many
moderates were not allowed to run.
	   Just 18 million voters turned out for the assembly elections,
and many Iranians said they had boycotted the vote because most
moderates had been denied a chance to run.
	   Moderates gained just 13 of the assembly's 86 seats in October.

Lawyer asks Philippine Supreme Court to defer execution of
</HEADLINE>
convicted rapist

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A lawyer urged the Supreme Court
Monday to defer the scheduled execution next week of a convicted
rapist while lawmakers review a law that restored capital
punishment in the Philippines.
	   A judge has ordered prison authorities to execute Leo Echegaray,
who was convicted of repeatedly raping his 10-year-old
stepdaughter, on January 4.
	   But the planned execution has triggered a nationwide debate over
the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   In recent weeks, several senators and congressmen have expressed
doubts about whether capital punishment will deter crimes and filed
resolutions seeking a review of the law that reimposed the death
penalty.
	   ``These legislative actions are significant because they are
admissions from members of Congress that the law they passed is not
working and may not be needed,'' Te told the court in a petition.
	   ``All doubts must be indulged in favor of an accused,'' he said.
	   The Vatican, the European Union and Canada also recently sent
appeals to the Philippine government to abolish capital punishment,
arguing that death penalty would not reduce widespread crime.
	   President Joseph Estrada has turned down the appeals, saying he
would only pardon Echegaray if evidence could be presented proving
the poor house painter was innocent. Estrada said Echegaray's
execution would deter more rapes, a widespread crime.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter criminals, and
that crime has become rampant because no one has been executed in
recent years.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of the deterrent effect. And
they claim that poor people are more likely to be sentenced to
death because they cannot afford good lawyers.

Youth violence continues for second night in eastern France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ Youths torched cars, hurled objects at
buses and tried to set a primary school classroom on fire in a
second night of violence in this eastern city, officials said
Monday.
	   Firefighters, alerted by a caretaker, quickly extinguished the
flames at the school in Strasbourg-Hautepierre, after youths threw
a bottle of burning petrol through a window on Sunday night.
	   In the early hours of Monday morning, seven cars were set on
fire in and around the city, bringing to 27 the number of vehicles
torched since violence broke out after a public concert on Saturday
night.
	   The unrest came despite an ongoing government program aimed at
cutting youth violence.
	   From Saturday until Jan. 2, local officials have organized
low-cost hip hop, techno and Algerian rai music concerts. Cyber
cafes have also slashed prices.
	   City officials are funding the progams at a cost of 3.5 million
francs (dlrs 625,000).
	   Last year, 500 cars were burned in Strasbourg _ 100 more than
the year before.
	   Youth violence in many cities across France often occurs in poor
immigrant neighborhoods wracked by high unemployment, and has
recently sparked transit walkouts by drivers fed up with attacks.

Clashes between rival fishermen leave five dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Feuding between rival fishing
communities in the Ivory Coast has escalated into violent clashes
that in recent days have left five dead, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Armed with rifles and machete knives, members of the Neyo tribe
in the Ivory Coast have been battling with rival fishermen from
Ghana, who live in the Ivorian town Sassandra, the French-language
daily Fraternite Matin reported.
	   The clashes began more than a week ago after Neyo villagers
spotted a dead body floating near the coastline. Accusing the
fishermen of killing the Ivorian victim, Neyo men began attacking
the Ghanian fishing communities in Sassandra, the newspaper
reported.
	   At least five Ghanian fishermen have been killed since the
fighting began. Another 27 Ghanian and Neyo villagers have been
wounded.
	   Sassandra, near the Liberian border, is an important fishing
port, attracting crews from Ghana, Liberia and the Ivory Coast.

Bad loans account for nearly half of loans in Thai banking system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank announced
Monday that non-performing loans in the domestic banking system
accounted for nearly half of the country's outstanding loans as of
Oct. 31.
	   The soured loans _ defined as those where no payment has been
received for at least three months _ account for 40.5 percent of
bank loans and fully 63.6 percent of the total at non-bank finance
companies.
	   The figures reflect the depth of the problems affecting
Thailand's financial system after an economic meltdown triggered by
the flotation of the nation's currency in mid-1997.
	   As the value of the Thai baht plummeted, companies with large
exposure to foreign currency-based financing went broke _ leaving
behind a massive load of bad debts. Thailand was forced to seek a
dlrs 17.2 billion bailout led by the International Monetary Fund to
deal with the economic crisis.
	   Thai authorities have closed half of the finance companies and
taken over or consolidated a third of the banks. But many
cash-strapped firms are still unable to pay loan installments.
	   Total banking sector bad debt was 2.25 trillion baht (dlrs 62.5
billion) and 300.5 billion baht (dlrs 8.3 billion) at the finance
companies, the Bank of Thailand said.
	   Bad debt at 24 still-operating finance companies accounted for
55.6 percent of total loans. Non-performing loans at 12 finance
companies closed earlier this year accounted for 77.9 percent of
total loans.
	   Non-performing loans at foreign bank branches in Thailand
accounted for 8.05 percent of outstanding credits.

Moscow calls for quick review of Iraq compliance with U.N.
</HEADLINE>
resolutions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called Monday
for a quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for
lifting sanctions, and again warned the United States against using
force.
	   Speaking to reporters after meeting with President Boris
Yeltsin, Ivanov said Russia believes Iraq must cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors, but said the United Nations must swiftly
complete a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance.
	   Moscow denounced U.S. and British air raids against Iraq earlier
this month in harsh rhetoric reminiscent of the Cold War and
briefly recalled its ambassadors to Washington and London.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied with
resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles before the
Security Council can lift sanctions.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq, wants to help
rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are ended
and has been pushing for their early lifting.
	   Ivanov also warned the West against using force on another
long-time Russian ally, Serbia, over the renewed violence in
Kosovo.
	   ``Military actions will not solve the conflicts (in Iraq and
Kosovo), and would only exacerbate them further,'' he said,
according to the Interfax news agency.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An emergency meeting of Arab foreign
ministers, scheduled Wednesday to discuss the U.S.-British
airstrikes on Iraq, has been postponed until after the holy Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters
on Monday that the meeting has been rescheduled for Jan. 24. He
said the delay had been requested by Arab Gulf states.
	   Earlier, Egyptian newspapers had reported that moves were under
way to get the meeting put off.
	   ``There is a trend towards postponing the emergency meeting,''
the daily Al-Akbar said.
	   Abdel-Meguid had announced plans for this week's meeting after
the U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq. The four days of attacks,
which ended Dec. 19, were aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime for
refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to change slug

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Monday after the Christmas holiday, with the key index slumping 3
percent in Taipei.
	   Some investors in Taiwan doubt that a market stabilization fund
set up by the government can prop up the local bourse, traders
said.
	   Participating institutions in the fund would have to spend too
much money to push up the market at a time when the island's
economic fundamentals were weak, a dealer said.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 201.35
points to 6,481.65.
	   Japanese share prices also fell as talks about forming a
conservative coalition government broke down.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 88.89
points, or 0.64 percent, to close at 13,709.06. On Friday, the
average closed up 91.22 points, or 0.67 percent.
	   Shares fell after a spokesman for the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party said negotiations with a smaller party over forming a
coalition government had reached an impasse.
	   Without the Liberal Party's votes to give it a majority in the
upper house, the LDP could have a tough time winning passage of key
bank-bailout legislation, analysts warned.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 116.12 yen, down 0.06
yen from late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York and
London were closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.
	   Hong Kong stocks slumped in extremely thin trading.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 122.06, or 1.2 percent, closing at 10,170.14.
	   Turnover fell to 1.222 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 156
million), its lowest full-day of trading level since Jan. 4, 1993,
when it stood at 1.020 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 130
million).
	   Markets were closed in Australia and New Zealand for holidays.
	   Elsewhere:
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed mixed, with the main
index closing little changed as many participants remained on the
sidelines ahead of the New Year break. The Philippine Stock
Exchange index of 30 selected stocks edged up 0.79 point to
1,932.39.
	   SEOUL: The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 7.10 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 562.46.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed in stagnant
trading. The benchmark Composite Index rose 3.82 points, or 0.6
percent, to 556.14.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower in thin trading. The
Straits Times Index fell 11.48 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,381.27.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on continued profit-taking.
The Composite Index fell 1.679 points. or 0.4 percent, to 400.176.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher on buying by retail
investors hoping for quick gains. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index rose 4.13 points, or 1.2 percent, to 360.29.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Police on Monday said they had arrested a

death on Christmas Day, six months after she entered the hospital
paralyzed and with permanent brain damage.
	   Until Betty Kavata's death Dec. 25, police had refused demands
by family and civil rights activists to arrest Constable Felix
Nthinwa Munyao, saying they could not file charges until they
received a medical report, which they said required a statement
from the battered woman.
	   But Kavata, who was paralyzed after suffering severe head
injuries in the July 31 beating, had lost most of her teeth and was
no longer able to speak.
	   She died on her 28th birthday, and the media, politicians and
civil rights groups demanded that her husband be punished.
	   On Monday, senior police official Gabriel Thinwa told the
private Kenya Television Network that Munyao had been arrested.
	   ``He beat his wife on July 31, and she had been in hospital all
that time until the 25th of December when unfortunately she died,''
Thinwa said.
	   He insisted police were dedicated to punishing criminals,
``whether it is a police officer or member of the public who
commits a crime.''
	   Kavata's condition was publicized last month when KTN showed
footage of her writhing in a hospital bed, emitting wordless shouts
of anguish.
	   Thinwa said at the time that police investigators had determined
that Munyao was responsible for his wife's injuries and had
suspended him from duty. But they were waiting to get a statement
from Kavata before taking legal action against him.
	   Another police officer believed to have doused his girlfriend
with paraffin in October and set her aflame after a quarrel, has
not been charged. The woman died of burns.
	   Women's rights groups complain that wife beating is on the rise
throughout Kenya, where men have traditionally dominated society.
	   Even when other officers are not involved, the male-dominated
Kenyan police force has often been reluctant to intervene in cases
of domestic violence, claiming they are private matters.
	   Criminologists and sociologists say another reason for the
rising domestic violence is Kenya's worsening economic situation.
	   The Federation of Women's Lawyers in Kenya is working to amend
the constitution, which they say discriminates against women.
	   There is no law in Kenya against wife-beating. The few cases
that have gone to court have been heard as incidents of assault,
rather than domestic violence.

codes:
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen defied
growing pressure Monday to bring two Khmer Rouge leaders to trial
for genocide and said they would face neither an international
tribunal nor a Cambodian court. ``If we bring them to trial, it
will not benefit the nation, it will only mean a return to civil
war,'' Hun Sen said before a Cabinet meeting. ``We should dig a
hole and bury the past and look toward the future.'' The Khmer
Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, remained holed up in
the ex-rebel stronghold of Pailin in the northwest, where they were
staying in guest houses under the protection of old comrades who
defected to the government two years ago. (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has declared that it will refuse to
extend a program that brings crucial food to families struggling
under U.N. sanctions, striking another blow in its latest
confrontation with the United Nations. Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that Baghdad will ask the
approximately 400 U.N. workers who monitor the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program to leave, but he did not give a date. The
latest six-month phase of the program, which allows Iraq to sell
dlrs 5.2 billion in oil for needed supplies, doesn't expire until
next May. Saleh's announcement was the latest Iraqi response to the
four-day U.S. and British bombing campaign that ended Dec. 20.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The son of the Likud party's first prime
minister, Menachem Begin, and a staunch opponent of the
land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians, announced Monday
that he is breaking away from the party to run for prime minister.
Benny Begin, a 57-year-old geologist, served as science minister in
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. He quit the Cabinet
after Netanyahu agreed to pull troops out of the West Bank town of
Hebron in January 1997. Although Begin's chances of becoming prime
minister are remote, he could weaken Netanyahu by splitting the
hard-line vote and forcing a second round. In such a case, most
hard-line groups would support Netanyahu against a centrist or
liberal candidate as the ``lesser evil,'' said Hanan Porat, a
legislator from the National Religious Party. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Monday that Russia's
armed forces have been cut to 1.2 million troops, down from 1.5
million troops a year ago, and meeting the government's target for
reducing the military. Yeltsin spoke during a meeting with Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, who briefed the president on the progress
of army reform. ``The target is met, the mission is accomplished,''
Yeltsin summed up, as reporters listened in. The government has
been gradually trimming the bloated and underfunded military, which
had about 5 million men during the 1980s. There are no plans to cut
the military below 1.2 million _ still a huge burden for the
cash-strapped Russian government, struggling with the gravest
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse. The Russian
military barely functions, lacking funds to buy new weapons or
maintain its aging arsenal. (RUSSIA-MILITARY)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A pair of attacks in southern Algeria
has left at least 30 people dead and 70 others wounded, hospital
sources said Monday. Mortar shells and bombs fell Sunday night on
the town of Khenis-Miliana, about 65 miles (100 kilometers) south
of the capital, Algiers. Fifteen people died and 40 were injured,
said the sources, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
The bombardment struck a school and several homes, the newspaper Le
Matin reported. At the same time, six miles (10 kilometers) to the
north, about 40 armed men burst into the village of Ain N'sour and
killed 15 people. Most of the victims were stabbed to death,
hospital sources said. The two attacks came during the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan, a time when bloodshed has intensified in previous
years of Algeria's nearly 7-year-old insurgency. The conflict has
left 75,000 people dead. (ALGERIA)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Monday after the Christmas holiday, with the key index slumping 3
percent in Taipei. Some investors in Taiwan doubt that a market
stabilization fund set up by the government can prop up the local
bourse, traders said. Participating institutions in the fund would
have to spend too much money to push up the market at a time when
the island's economic fundamentals were weak, a dealer said. The
Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 201.35 points
to 6,481.65. Japanese share prices also fell as talks about forming
a conservative coalition government broke down. Elsewhere, shares
fell in Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. Shares were higher in
South Korea and Thailand, and they closed mixed in the Philippines
and Malaysia. Markets were closed in Australia and New Zealand for
holidays. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank announced
Monday that non-performing loans in the domestic banking system
accounted for nearly half of the country's outstanding loans as of
Oct. 31. The soured loans _ defined as those where no payment has
been received for at least three months _ account for 40.5 percent
of bank loans and fully 63.6 percent of the total at non-bank
finance companies. The figures reflect the depth of the problems
affecting Thailand's financial system after an economic meltdown
triggered by the flotation of the nation's currency in mid-1997.
(THAILAND-BAD LOANS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Weaker demand for Hong Kong-made products led
to a sharp decline in the territory's exports and industrial
production last month, while its trade deficit narrowed, the
government said Monday. Exports fell by 9.3 percent in November
compared to the same month a year ago to 113.1 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 14.5 billion). The slackened demand for goods
produced in Hong Kong took a toll on industrial output, which fell
by 10.2 percent in the July-September quarter, compared with the
same period the previous year. (HONG KONG-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese workers are finally starting to loosen
their purse strings and spend more, even as their salaries continue
to drop, the government said Monday. The average Japanese wage
earner spent about 335,000 yen (dlrs 2,900) in November, 2 percent
more than in the same month last year, the Management and
Coordination Agency said. That's the first increase in five months,
an agency official said, and a rare piece of good news for an
economy stuck in its worst recession since World War II. Still, it
may be premature to look for a recovery. The official warned that
the size of the gain was probably exaggerated because spending was
unusually low in November 1997 following a string of high-profile
bankruptcies, which undermined consumer confidence.
(JAPAN-SPENDING)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's top state bank sharply cut
interest rates Monday for deposits of British pounds and Hong Kong
dollars and unified rates for four European currencies linked to
the new euro, a bank official said. The one-year rate paid by the
Bank of China for British pounds fell from 5.25 percent to 4.625
percent, while the rate for Hong Kong dollars fell from 5 percent
to 4.375 percent, the official said. The reduction reflected lower
global interest rates, the official told Dow Jones Newswires. Hong
Kong banks cut lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a
percentage point earlier this month. (CHINA-INTEREST RATES)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China made trading in the euro official Monday,
announcing authorization for the European common currency's use in
trade and financial dealings starting Jan. 1. The expected
announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried by the official Xinhua
News Agency, also authorized the opening of euro accounts. Chinese
officials have said the government may convert a proportion of its
dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro
after the currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 countries launching the
common currency are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland,
France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.

Atletico's chairman Gil faces fine for badmouthing Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
counterpart Nunez &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jesus Gil y Gil, the controversial chairman
of Atletico Madrid, faces a fine for publicly accusing FC
Barcelona's chairman Josep Lluis Nunez of ``buying off,'' the
referees in the Spanish first division, news reports said Monday.
	   A Madrid-based court ruled that Gil had made ``insidious
insinuations,'' and ``directly offensive comments,'' during a radio
interview almost a year ago that amounted to ``an illegitimate
attack on the honor of Nunez,'' Spanish daily El Periodico
reported.
	   Judge Milagros de Saz Castro said the Atletico chairman was not
protected by freedom of speech guarantees because he could not
justify his comments, the Barcelona-based paper said.
	   The amount of the fine had yet to be determined, El Periodico
reported.
	   A spokesman for Atletico said Monday that neither chairman nor
club had yet reacted to the ruling.
	   Gil is one of the most controversial figures in Spanish soccer,
and no stranger to fines.
	   In March he was ordered to pay 15,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 10,300)
for ignoring a FIFA ban on him representing Atletico outside of
Spain that was imposed after he insulted the body's officials.
	   Gil is also under investigation for alleged corruption in his
other role as mayor of the glitzy southern Spanish resort city of
Marbella.

Khatami calls for quick solution to slump in oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami on Monday urged
oil-producing countries to move quickly to shore up weak world oil
prices, which are harming Iran's economy, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   Khatami ``deplored the indifference shown by certain countries
regarding the falling oil prices,'' the agency said.
	   ``This is not acceptable,'' he added. ``We must reach a firm
decision quickly in order to be able to defend our resources.''
	   IRNA said Khatami made the comments during a meeting with
Qatar's new ambassador to Tehran, Hussein bin Ali al-Dowsari.
	   Al-Dowsari expressed hope that OPEC members would reduce their
production to boost prices, the agency said.
	   Iran is at odds with other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which have accused Tehran of failing
to cut its production as much as it agreed to earlier this year.
	   OPEC pledged output cuts totaling 2.6 million barrels a day last
April and July, using February output as the baseline for the cuts.
	   But Iran objected and said it would make its cuts from the quota
it was assigned by OPEC in November 1997.
	   That means Iran has been working off a base of 3.9 million
barrels per day, rather than the 3.6 million barrels estimated to
be its February output.
	   Iran has said it is willing to attend an emergency meeting of
OPEC and would support new cuts of 1.5 million barrels per day by
the cartel, provided the higher baseline level stayed in place.
	   Both Iran and Qatar are members of OPEC. Iran has an output
quota of 3.318 million barrels per day, and Qatar's quota is
640,000 barrels per day.

Ukraine's regional parliament lawmaker arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula have
arrested a lawmaker of the regional parliament, charging him with a
long string of crimes, officials said Monday.
	   Mykola Kotliarevsky, 25, was arrested Sunday and charged with
numerous cases of assault, racketeering and swindling with a gang
in the resort city of Yevpatoria between 1994 and 1997, Crimea's
police chief Hennadiy Moskal said.
	   In addition, Kotliarevsky, also a member of Yevpatoria's
municipal government, was charged with organizing the murder of a
city businessman last year, Moskal told a session of the Crimean
parliament, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Moskal said police arrested five other members of the Yevpatoria
gang besides Kotliarevsky, while three others were killed in
clashes with rival gangs over the years.
	   Politics and business in Crimea, a Black Sea resort region, are
plagued by violence and crime. A number of senior regional
officials have been killed in recent years in gang wars for control
of lucrative resort areas.
	   Ukraine's Interior Ministry began an anti-crime campaign on the
peninsula in the spring and has arrested dozens of people,
including a gang of 23 people, which had allegedly killed several
senior officials.

Two die, six missing in yacht race

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British sailor Glyn Charles was missing
and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while five others remained stranded
in a liferaft in rough seas when night fell Monday.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority, admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could
survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off Sword of
Orion on Sunday night.
	   ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and
80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it.''
	   Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in
the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered
the entrants while four members from the veteran cutter Winston
Churchill were winched to safety from a liferaft.
	   Another liferaft containing the remaining five members of
Winston Churchill was reported to have been sighted by a search
helicopter late Monday night, but it was uncertain whether a rescue
would be attempted.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. ``He loved
the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race.
Dad simply loved life.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four
rescued.
	   ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into
the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned
thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody
frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After four days of clashes left at
least 14 people dead in Kosovo, the head of the organization
overseeing a fragile truce is questioning whether the peace mission
can continue without cooperation by the warring sides.
	   International peace verifiers reported the province quiet Monday
following a Christmas Eve offensive by Serbian forces north of the
Kosovo capital Pristina.
	   But a spokesman for the top ethnic Albanian politician in Kosovo
warned that only a NATO military intervention could prevent further
fighting in the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the
overwhelming majority.
	   In a sometimes-fierce battle Sunday, artillery, mortar and
machine-gun fire sounded for hours across the snowy fields of
rebel-controlled territory as the two sides fought from trenches,
villages and dirt roads.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group reported Monday that a KLA
fighter wounded in the clashes Sunday had died, bringing the
four-day death toll to at least 14.
	   At least four more people were wounded _ three Serb policeman
and a Serb civilian.
	   The clashes are the worst since an unofficial truce was agreed
in October. The American diplomat who heads the Kosovo Verification
Mission argued that the violence does not necessarily mean that a
return to fullscale war is inevitable.
	   ``This is what I would call sporadic fighting,'' William Walker
told CNN after Sunday's clash ended. ``Both sides are being
relatively cautious'' and not using full firepower, he said.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity ... in terms of getting the wounded out,''
Walker said.
	   Verifiers from the 54-nation peace mission, led by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, mediated the
evacuation of two wounded Serbs and one ethnic Albanian after the
firefight.
	   Despite Walker's comments, the chairman of the OSCE, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, said the fighting raised doubts
about the commitment to peace on both sides and questions on the
effectiveness of the international verification force.
	   ``This spiral of violence puts in danger the perspective of a
peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo,'' Geremek said. ``If
the bloodshed and violence escalate, the OSCE would have to
reconsider the forms of its activities in Kosovo in the context of
a broader involvement of the international community in the search
for a peaceful solution to the conflict,'' he said.
	   Xhemail Mustafa, spokesman for ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, repeated calls for NATO intervention, saying that the
Western alliance was the ``only force'' capable of securing the
peace and opening the door to a political solution.
	   Sunday's clash was attributed to the funeral of a Serb farmer
killed by rebels the previous day. The Serbs said they needed to
ensure the safety of other civilians while evacuating the body; the
KLA complained the heavy Serb buildup was a provocation preventing
civilians who fled the previous fighting from returning.
	   A new trouble spot emerged Sunday night when Serb police sealed
off a suburb of Kosovska Mitrovica and began searching for
``terrorists,'' their term for the rebels. The Serb-run Media
Center said men in KLA uniforms had shot dead three Gypsy men, also
known as Roma, in the town 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
the capital, Pristina.
	   Shootings blamed on the rebels have resulted in harsh crackdowns
backed by tanks and artillery.
	   The clashes centered on the KLA stronghold of Lapastica and
neighboring Obranca.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go. Attempts at talks have
been stalled.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels in
February, and about 300,000 have been driven from their homes.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British sailor Glyn Charles was missing
and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while five others remained stranded
in a liferaft in rough seas when night fell Monday.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority, admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could
survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off Sword of
Orion on Sunday night.
	   ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and
80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it.''
	   Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in
the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered
the entrants while four members from the veteran cutter Winston
Churchill were winched to safety from a liferaft.
	   Another liferaft containing the remaining five members of
Winston Churchill was reported to have been sighted by a search
helicopter late Monday night, but it was uncertain whether a rescue
would be attempted.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. ``He loved
the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race.
Dad simply loved life.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four
rescued.
	   ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into
the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned
thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody
frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

Press watchdog says Burkina Faso fails to probe reporter's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A Paris-based press freedoms
group accused Burkina Faso's government of reneging on promises to
conduct an independent investigation into the suspicious death of a
prominent local journalist.
	   Reporters Without Borders said President Blaise Compaore's
government had done little to explain the death of newspaperman
Norbert Zongo, who along with three companions was killed in a car
fire earlier this month.
	   The death triggered mass demonstrations as many government
opponents accused Compaore of complicity in the deaths.
	   ``It is unfortunate to observe that concerning police
investigations, absolutely nothing has been done,'' Reporters
Without Borders Secretary General Robert Menard said in a statement
released in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou.
	   Zongo, two of his cousins and his driver were all found dead in
a car, which had been torched from the inside.
	   Reporters without borders earlier said the deaths looked
suspicious since the outside of the car showed no signs of an
accident that could have caused the fire.
	   At the time of his death, Zongo had been working on a series of
investigative reports looking into the unexplained shooting death
of an employee working for Compaore's brother.
	   Shortly after his death, the Justice Ministry said it would
launch an independent probe into charges that Zongo had been
killed.
	   The Justice Ministry flatly denied any links between Zongo's
death and the president.
	   Menard, however, said he no longer believed a fair and unbiased
investigation into Zongo's death would be conducted.
	   ``In Burkina we are used to certain deaths that remain
unexplained,'' he said.

Prosecutor: Russia lost 18 billion rubles to economic crime in
</HEADLINE>
1998 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Economic crimes ranging from tax evasion to
embezzlement have cost Russia 18 billion rubles (dlrs 878 million)
so far this year with most scams aided by corrupt officials, the
chief prosecutor said Monday.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov blamed economic crimes for
virtually all of Russia's financial problems, saying it ``is
blocking the normal operation of banking institutions, making
shadow-economy businessmen rich, and creating a budget deficit,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The 18-billion ruble losses from economic crimes that Skuratov
cited would be a fraction of the country's 1998 budget deficit of
132.4 billion rubles (dlrs 6.5 billion at the current rate).
	   Skuratov also said most economic crimes are committed with the
help of corrupt officials, Interfax reported.
	   Deputy general prosecutor Mikhail Katyshev said Russia ranks
among the world's top 10 countries for corruption. The shadow
economy accounts for between 40 percent and 50 percent of the gross
domestic product, he said.
	   About half of Russia's private banks and about 40 percent of
government-owned companies are controlled by criminal groups, he
said, according to Interfax.
	   Crime is especially common in the oil, gas, coal and
metallurgical industries, Katyshev said.
	   Russia is gripped by its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. The government devalued the currency and defaulted on
some of its debts in August, sending financial markets in a
nosedive and prompting foreign creditors to freeze aid to the
country.
	   ``Unless the shadow economy is stamped out, and a civilized
market is created, the question of Russia's prosperity can be taken
off the agenda,'' Skuratov told a meeting of senior law-enforcement
officials, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Climate researcher Hans Oeschger dies at 71
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss climate researcher Hans Oeschger
has died after a long illness, newspapers reported Monday. He was
71.
	   Oeschger, born in 1927 in Ottenbach, near Zurich, died Friday, a
death notice in the daily Berner Zeitung said.
	   After studying physics at the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich, Oeschger in 1955 obtained a doctorate from the University
of Bern. He went on to become a professor at the university, and in
1992 was made professor emeritus of physics.
	   He researched climate changes over thousands of years by
analyzing air bubbles trapped in layers of polar ice in Greenland
and Antarctica.
	   Oeschger's work showed that carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere have increased over the last 200 years. He warned of the
effects on the planet's climate of human activity.
	   He developed a number of methods for extracting data from the
ice, including radiocarbon dating. He also invented the ``Oeschger
counter,'' a device for measuring small quantities of natural
radiation.
	   Oeschger was honored for his work last December by the American
Geophysical Union. In 1996, he received the University of Southern
California's Tyler Prize.
	   A memorial service will take place Wednesday at the Petruskirche
in Bern. Details of survivors were unavailable.

Tudjman aide says Croatia may reconsider cooperation with war
</HEADLINE>
crimes tribunal
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia might reconsider or even end its
cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal if it
indicts Croatian generals, a close aide of President Franjo Tudjman
said in an interview published Monday.
	   Aide Ivic Pasalic told the daily newspaper Jutarnji list that if
the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, indicts Croatia's
top military leaders, ``our patience would certainly fail.''
	   ``That would certainly put into question Croatia's cooperation
with the tribunal, all the way to possible annulment of Croatia's
law'' endorsing cooperation, Pasalic said.
	   Earlier this month, Tudjman protested against the tribunal's
policies, saying that along with the 12 Croats from Bosnia already
in custody, indictments had been drafted against ``five or six''
Croatian generals.
	   Tudjman did not name the generals or say how he knew of their
indictments.
	   Pasalic said the indicted generals are most likely those who
commanded 1995 offensives in which Croatia recaptured areas seized
by rebel Serbs during the 1991 war.
	   The leaders of the offensives have been honored by the Croatian
government for ending rebel occupation of these areas.
	   United Nations observers said 200 Serb civilians were killed in
the aftermath of the fighting.
	   Tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour refused to say whether
the indictments existed, but said Tudjman's claims ``are based on
no information that the (Zagreb) government should be privy to.''
	   Croatia agreed to cooperate with the tribunal in 1995. Although
tribunal officials have complained that cooperation has been
unsatisfactory, Croatia did orchestrate the surrender of 11
indicted Bosnian Croat war crimes suspects.
	   ``Croatia hoped that the tribunal would be just, not politically
directed,'' Pasalic said, but no Muslim or Serb is charged with war
crimes against Croats in Bosnia. Serbs indicted for crimes
committed against Croats during the 1991 war here are not
imprisoned, he complained.
	   Frustration with the tribunal recently grew after Bosnian Croat
Anto Furundzija received a 10-year sentence for his role in the
rape of a Muslim woman in 1993, and because three Yugoslav generals
indicted by the tribunal for crimes against Croats live freely in
Yugoslavia.
	   Meanwhile, the tribunal has indicted two more Bosnian Croats,
Mladen Naletilic, known as Tuta, and Vinko Martinovic, aka Stela,
for war crimes committed against Muslims in the southwestern
Bosnian town of Mostar.
	   Both are in Croatian custody, but officials have not announced
whether they will be turned over to The Hague.
	   Naletilic is being tried in Croatia on charges of attempted
murder and other crimes. Martinovic was recently sentenced to eight
years in prison for the 1996 killing of a woman in Mostar.

Maier leads final downhill practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier,
bidding for his first downhill victory this season, on Monday led
an impressive showing of Austrian skiers in the final practice for
the last race of the year.
	   Maier flashed down the icy, 3,070-meter long Stelvio course in
one minute, 56.20 seconds beating teammates Hannes Trinkl,
Christian Greber and Stephan Eberharter between 0.31 to 0.74
seconds.
	   Didier Cuche edged Swiss teammate Bruno Kernen for fifth place
in the second and last practice run for Tuesday's downhill - the
fourth of the season.
	   Maier, who led an unprecedented 1-9 finish by Austrian skiers in
a Super-G race at Innsbruck last Monday, is shooting for a replay
of his 1997 downhill triumph in this Italian Alpine resort.
	   ``The Herminator'' can also extend his World Cup overall lead as
Norway's top downhiller Lasse Kjus is sidelined with bronchitis.
	   Kjus upset the Austrians in the two first World Cup downhills at
Val D'Isere and Val Gardena earlier this month and finished second
to Italy's Kristian Ghedina in a third speed race, again at Val
Gardena.
	   Maier enters Tuesday's race with 540 points from 12 events.
	   Kjus is second with 537 and Austrian Christian Mayer third with
462.
	   The Austrians pushed hard throughout the course which hosted the
1985 World Championships as Monday's practice qualified 11 of them
for the race, out of 13 starters.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen defied
growing pressure Monday to bring two Khmer Rouge leaders to trial
for genocide and said they would face neither an international
tribunal nor a Cambodian court.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said before a
Cabinet meeting. ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look
toward the future.''
	   The Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, remained
in the ex-rebel stronghold of Pailin, staying in guest houses under
the protection of old comrades who defected to the government in
1996.
	   Hun Sen confirmed they would visit Phnom Penh on Tuesday,
accompanied by their wives and children. Military officials said
they would have tight security.
	   The pair agreed to defect _ in effect, surrender _ in a phone
call with Hun Sen on Christmas, 20 years to the day after
Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer
Rouge regime.
	   The government slammed the door on international demands that
Khieu Samphan, the official leader though others held real power,
and political chief Nuon Chea stand trial.
	   ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome him for national
reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a bouquet of
flowers for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.''
	   Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the
Khmer Rouge by pardoning leaders in exchange for ending a civil
war, bringing peace to much of Cambodia for the first time in a
generation.
	   With the movement now all but extinct _ only one leader, the
one-legged general, Ta Mok, and perhaps 100 followers are still at
large _ demands are growing for someone to be held accountable for
the reign of terror that killed as many as 2 million people.
	   Hun Sen said Monday that he would never accept Ta Mok, known as
``The Butcher'' for his revolutionary brutality. He once said the
same of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea.
	   Long-time leader Pol Pot died in April of a heart attack.
	   Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official who fled bloody purges in
1977 and came to power under the decade-long Vietnamese military
occupation, said peace was more important than prison.
	   ``This is a pure Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know
the right medicine to use to cure this problem. If any foreigners
try to add something, it will never go away.''
	   Hun Sen said he had the support of King Norodom Sihanouk and the
leader of the National Assembly, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
aimed at bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said.
``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now be
denied.''
	   United Nations legal experts recently visited to assess the
possibility of creating an international tribunal to try Khmer
Rouge leaders for crimes against humanity.
	   Perhaps one Cambodian in five perished of disease, overwork,
starvation and executions after the Maoist revolutionaries won a
civil war in 1975 and forced the population into labor camps.
	   After 30 years of upheaval, many Cambodians rate peace higher
than trying the the killers who once ruled them. But the recent
U.N. visit raised hopes of finding justice away from the volatile
politics of Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen said there was little point: ``If the wound no longer
hurts, we shouldn't poke a stick in it and make it bleed.''
	   Earlier, government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said that
speculation about a trial was frightening the defectors they would
be arrested if they came to Phnom Penh.
	   In Pailin, they are relatively safe. Though nominally under
government control, the area is run by a pardoned former Khmer
Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary.
	   Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly after a
landmark peace treaty was signed, and was stoned by a
government-orchestrated mob. The Khmer Rouge eventually broke the
treaty.
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that Khmer Rouge victims
have waited too long for justice.
	   ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' the party said.

Israeli army demolishes two Palestinian homes, setting off clashes

	   KUFR HARIS, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers on Monday dragged
a Palestinian family out of a home slated for destruction and
wrestled the 26-year owner to the ground as he clutched his toddler
son and tried to block the troops.
	   The child fell to the ground in the melee and the owner, Hussam
Abu Yakoub, had blood running down his right temple.
	   Troops eventually fired tear gas into the one-story home,
forcing the remaining residents out. After the struggle, Abu
Yakoub's home and another house in the village were leveled by
bulldozers.
	   In response, dozens of villagers hurled stones at the troops who
responded with more tear gas and rubber-coated steel pellets. Two
Israelis were injured by stones.
	   Peter Lerner, spokesman of the Israeli military government in
the West Bank, said the two homes in the village were demolished
because they were built illegally, without proper permits.
	   Palestinians complain that Israel uses house demolitions as a
political tool and refuses to issue building permits in areas of
the West Bank it wants to keep under its control. The United States
also opposes the practice, saying it undermines trust.
	   Monday's confrontation took place in Kufr Haris, a village close
to the Jewish settlement of Ariel, the second largest in the West
Bank.
	   Abu Yakoub, his wife and two young sons, along with about 30
others, sat on the floor of the house to try to prevent the
demolition. However, Israeli troops dragged them out.
	   Abu Yakoub was knocked to the ground in the melee, dropping his
young son as villagers and family members continued to scuffle with
Israeli soldiers.
	   ``One day I'm going to take revenge...I will teach my kids the

referring to the Islamic militant group that has carried out more

Faced with NBA lockout, Divac to join Yugoslav team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Faced with the NBA lockout, former
LA Lakers and Charlotte Hornets center Vlade Divac will join
Yugoslav champion Red Star in the Euro basketball league, the
Belgrade team officials said Monday.
	   Divac, who like many other National Basketball Association stars
is seeking to play in Europe because the lockout has no end in
sight, will start for Red Star in the Euro League match against
Zalgiris, Lithuania, in Belgrade on Jan. 7.
	   Divac will face Portland Trail Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis
who joined the Lithuanian team for the remainder of the lockout,
said Red Star manager Vojislav Stojakovic.
	   Divac, who signed for LA Lakers in 1989 and played the last two
seasons with the Charlotte Hornets before becoming a free agent,
confirmed he was joining Red Star.
	   Divac, a Yugoslav, told the daily newspaper Politika that he had
rejected a much better financial offer to play for Kinder Bologna,
and opted for the Belgrade team because of patriotic reasons.
	   Politika said that Divac and Red Star agreed that he could
return to the NBA as soon as the lockout and the collective
bargaining talks end positively.

Probe of Vatican shootings nearing conclusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A Vatican probe of the slaying of the Swiss
Guard's commander is nearing its end.
	   Rome daily Il Messaggero reported Monday that Vatican prosecutor
Nicola Picardi's conclusions matched the scenario given by the
Vatican shortly after the fatal shootings in May of the commander,
his wife and a Swiss Guard -- that the young guardsman killed the
couple in a fit of anger and then turned the gun on himself.
	   The prosecutor's Vatican office said the prosecutor was away on
vacation, but Picardi's private legal studio in Rome confirmed that
the probe was being wrapped up. An assistant in the office said the
report would likely be presented in early January.
	   A Vatican judge then will decide either to accept the
conclusions or to order further investigation into what were the
first killings at the Vatican in 150 years.
	   Lying next to the bodies of Alois Estermann and Estermann's
wife, Gladys Meza Romero, was the body of Swiss Guard Cedric
Tornay, whom the Vatican described as angry at Estermann because he
was denied a medal.
	   The guards are deployed during ceremonies and provide protection
for the pontiff.
	   Il Messaggero reported that a few questions about the shootings
remained unanswered, including how the gun could have ended up
under the back of Tornay, who had shot himself in the head.
	   Picardi's assistant disputed the contention that there were
still unanswered questions. ``At the beginning there were doubts.
After six, seven months, all the doubts have been cleared up,''
said the assistant, speaking on condition of anonymity and
declining to go into detail.
	   The Vatican press office, declining comment on the newspaper
report, said the conclusions would be made public after the case is
closed.

Cash-strapped Indonesia to close 54 small airports in remote areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Jakarta, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government is planning
to shut down 54 remote airports throughout the country in a move to
lower costs because of the economic crisis.
	   There are 158 small airports in remote areas throughout the
sprawling archipelago nation of 17,000 islands. Most of them have
600-meter (2,000-feet) runways and employ three staffers as well as
several other temporary workers.
	   Employees at airports that are operating at a loss will not be
laid off and will be transferred to jobs in other locations, said
Soenaryo Yosopratomo, director general of air transportation.
	   ``To continue to operate inefficient airports cost a lot of
money,'' the Bisnis Indonesia daily newspaper quoted him as saying.
``The government is having trouble with money and they have to cut
down on spending.''
	   Many travelers prefer to use land transportation because it is
cheaper, Yosopratomo said.
	   Indonesia's rupiah plunged more than 80 percent earlier this
year because of financial turmoil, although it has made a partial
recovery.
	   Airlines have increased their fares by large amounts in order to
cope with mounting costs in dollars.
	   Indonesia plans to end subsidies for jet fuel and aviation
gasoline in January.

U.S. top monitor in Kosovo hopeful fighting can be contained

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with renewed Albanian call for NATO intervention,
wounded ethnic Albanian reported to have died, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After four days of clashes left at
least 14 people dead in Kosovo, the head of the organization
overseeing a fragile truce is questioning whether the peace mission
can continue without cooperation by the warring sides.
	   International peace verifiers reported that the province was
quiet Monday following an offensive by Serbian forces that started
Thursday north of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   But a spokesman for the top ethnic Albanian politician in Kosovo
warned that only a NATO military intervention could prevent further
fighting in the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the
overwhelming majority.
	   Artillery, mortar and machine-gun fire sounded Sunday for hours
across the snowy fields of rebel-controlled territory as the two
sides fought from trenches, villages and dirt roads.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group said Monday that a KLA
fighter wounded in the clashes Sunday had died, bringing the
four-day death toll to at least 14. At least four Serbs were
wounded.
	   The clashes were the worst since an unofficial truce was reached
in October. The American diplomat who heads the Kosovo Verification
Mission, William Walker, said the violence does not necessarily
mean that a return to full-scale war is inevitable.
	   ``This is what I would call sporadic fighting,'' William Walker
told CNN after Sunday's clash ended. ``Both sides are being
relatively cautious'' and not using full firepower, he said.
	   ``We're trying to talk to both sides, get them to stand down,
show some humanity ... in terms of getting the wounded out,''
Walker said.
	   Verifiers from the 54-nation peace mission, led by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, mediated the
evacuation of two wounded Serbs and one ethnic Albanian after the
firefight.
	   Despite Walker's comments, the chairman of the OSCE, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, said the fighting raised doubts
about the commitment to peace on both sides and questions about the
effectiveness of the international verification force.
	   ``If the bloodshed and violence escalate, the OSCE would have to
reconsider the forms of its activities in Kosovo in the context of
a broader involvement of the international community in the search
for a peaceful solution to the conflict,'' Geremek said.
	   Xhemail Mustafa, spokesman for ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, repeated calls for NATO intervention, saying that the
Western alliance was the ``only force'' capable of securing the
peace and opening the door to a political solution.
	   Sunday's clash was attributed to the funeral of a Serb farmer
killed by rebels the previous day. The Serbs said they needed to
ensure the safety of other civilians while evacuating the body; the
KLA complained the heavy Serb buildup was a provocation preventing
civilians who fled the previous fighting from returning.
	   A new trouble spot emerged Sunday night when Serb police sealed
off a suburb of Kosovska Mitrovica and began searching for
``terrorists,'' their term for the rebels. The Serb-run Media
Center said men in KLA uniforms had shot dead three Gypsy men, also
known as Roma, in the town 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of
the capital, Pristina.
	   Shootings blamed on the rebels have resulted in harsh crackdowns
backed by tanks and artillery.
	   The clashes centered on the KLA stronghold of Lapastica and
neighboring Obranca.
	   The KLA insists on independence and on driving Serb police out
of the predominantly Albanian province, while the Serbian
government says it will never let Kosovo go. Attempts at talks have
been stalled.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against the rebels in
February, and about 300,000 have been driven from their homes.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has no immediate plans to eject U.N.
humanitarian workers who help distribute supplies to Iraqis under
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, Iraq's trade minister said
Monday.
	   But the minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said the 2-year-old
program was a temporary measure and could not substitute for
meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, which limit its
oil exports.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export
oil worth dlrs 5.2 million over six months _ when it expires in
May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq rejected continuation
of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said in the interview Sunday.
	   The program, which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to
export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicines for the 22
million Iraqis who have been hard hit by the sanctions.
	   In his remarks to APTN Sunday, Saleh set no date for expelling
the humanitarian workers, but complained that too little of the
money from the sale of oil went to the Iraqi people and too much to
administration.
	   ``Iraq is bearing huge expenses which it pays to these (U.N.)
personnel, and they do nothing apart from verifying that the
imports have reached Iraqi ports,'' he said.
	   On Monday, however, he said that the 400 U.N. workers
supervising the program would remain in Iraq as long as the program
continues.
	   Iraq has taken a harder line toward the United Nations since
four days of U.S. and British airstrikes aimed at punishing the
Baghdad regime for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors. The bombardment ended Dec. 19.
	   Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban the
inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the support the
country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in Amman,
Jordan.
	   Delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary Union's 19
member states on Sunday condemned the airstrikes as ``unjust
U.S.-British aggression'' and urged their governments to work
toward lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Their recommendation, however, fell short of Iraq's demand that
Arab countries begin circumventing the sanctions.
	   Al-Jumhuriya daily called again Monday for such action, saying:
``Let's break the sanctions, relying on the will of the Arabs.''
	   In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the
airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the
attacks, a newspaper reported in early Monday editions.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel to and from the country,
limit oil sales and bar most other financial transactions _ have
seriously damaged Iraq's economy.
	   On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for a
quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting
sanctions and again warned the United States against using force.
	   He told reporters after meeting with President Boris Yeltsin
that Russia believes Iraq must cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors, but said the United Nations must swiftly complete a
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance.

No trial for Khmer Rouge leaders, premier says

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen slammed the
door Monday on growing pressure to try two Khmer Rouge leaders and
said their defection would be welcomed with ``flowers ... not a
bullet'' to bring peace to long-suffering Cambodia.
	   Khieu Samphan, official leader of the murderous revolutionary
group, and political chief Nuon Chea would visit Phnom Penh with
their wives and children Tuesday, Hun Sen said. Military officials
promised tight security.
	   The government will not force them to face either an
international tribunal nor a Cambodian court, Hun Sen said before a
Cabinet meeting.
	   ``If we bring them to trial, it will not benefit the nation, it
will only mean a return to civil war,'' Hun Sen said. ``We should
dig a hole and bury the past and look toward the future.''
	   The Khmer Rouge leaders remained under wraps in the ex-rebel
stronghold of Pailin under the protection of former comrades who
defected to the government in 1996.
	   The pair agreed to defect _ in effect, surrender _ in a phone
call with Hun Sen on Christmas, 20 years to the day after
Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to topple the bloodstained Khmer
Rouge regime.
	   Hun Sen defied demands that the pair be charged and tried for
crimes against humanity for the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians under their rule.
	   ``Should we kill Khieu Samphan or welcome him for national
reconciliation?'' Hun Sen asked. ``This deal is a bouquet of
flowers for this pair, not a bullet or a pair of handcuffs.''
	   Over the past two years, the government broke the back of the
Khmer Rouge by pardoning leaders in exchange for ending the
guerrilla war that followed their overthrow.
	   The policy brought peace to much of Cambodia for the first time
in a generation, but with the movement now all but extinct, there
are new calls for someone to be held accountable.
	   Only one leader, the one-legged general, Ta Mok, and perhaps 100
followers are still at large.
	   Hun Sen said Monday that he would never accept Ta Mok, known as
``The Butcher.'' He once said the same of Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea.
	   Pol Pot, the group's leader until losing a power struggle to Ta
Mok last year, died in April of a heart attack.
	   Hun Sen is a former Khmer Rouge field officer who fled bloody
purges in 1977 and came to power under the decade-long Vietnamese
military occupation.
	   Critics have long speculated that Hun Sen would never allow a
Khmer Rouge trial for fear of his own past, but investigators of
the genocide say there is no evidence he was involved in big
atrocities.
	   Hun Sen said he had support for the deal from King Norodom
Sihanouk and the leader of the National Assembly, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   ``This is a purely Cambodian solution,'' Hun Sen said. ``We know
the right medicine to use to cure this problem. If any foreigners
try to add something, it will never go away.''
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department noted Sunday that the
Cambodian government has repeatedly asked for _ and received _ help
in bringing top Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' spokesman Lee McClenny said.
``Justice in Cambodia has been long delayed, but must not now be
denied.''
	   The opposition Sam Rainsy Party said that victims have waited
too long for justice and demanded a trial.
	   United Nations legal experts recently visited to assess the
possibility of creating an international tribunal to try Khmer
Rouge leaders.
	   Perhaps one Cambodian in five perished of disease, overwork,
starvation and executions after the Maoist revolutionaries won a
civil war in 1975 and forced the population into labor camps.
	   After 30 years of upheaval, many Cambodians value peace more
highly than trying the killers who once ruled them. But the
visiting U.N. team raised hopes of justice away from Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen was dismissive: ``If the wound no longer hurts, we
shouldn't poke a stick in it and make it bleed.''
	   Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said talk of a trial was
making the defectors afraid they would be arrested if they came to
Phnom Penh.
	   In Pailin, they are relatively safe. Though nominally under
government control, the area is run by a pardoned former Khmer
Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary.
	   Khieu Samphan visited Phnom Penh in 1991, shortly after a peace
treaty was signed, and was stoned by a government-orchestrated mob.
The Khmer Rouge eventually broke the treaty.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs armed with sickles and swords on
Monday battled each other and hurled gasoline bombs at houses and
shops in an Indonesian provincial town. At least 22 people were
injured and hundreds of residents fled their homes.
	   In a separate incident, police on Sumatra island fired warning
shots and plastic bullets at peasants who were arguing over
cultivation rights with the owners of a state-owned farm.
	   At least six people were injured in the clash in the
northwestern town of Deli Serdang. Most were shot in the legs.
	   The riots by sword-carrying mobs in the town of Poso on Sulawesi
island were triggered by weekend brawls between rival gangs of
youths. The unrest escalated partly into attacks by townspeople on
the homes of migrants from the main island of Java.
	   But the motive for much of the violence was unclear, with mobs
attacking stores and houses at random. Rioters set afire as many as
20 buildings and threw stones at the bus station, a local resident,
Hajj Fatma, said by telephone.
	   ``The center of the town was blackened from the smoke billowing
into the sky,'' Fatma said. She was preparing food for civilian
guards who patrolled neighborhoods, fearing more violence.
	   At least 100 families fled to a mountain outside Poso while
others sought shelter with relatives. One witness said he saw eight
truckloads of rioters drive into his neighborhood.
	   ``I have to go because they're coming here,'' he said by
telephone before hanging up.
	   Police and soldiers were also deployed to protect government
buildings and mosques and churches in Poso, 1,500 kilometers (930
miles) northeast of Jakarta. Shops were closed and buses stayed off
the streets.
	   A nurse at the local hospital said by telephone that 22 people
were injured, including one man whose neck had been cut by a sword.
Other victims bled from head wounds after being hit by rocks.
	   Indonesia has endured sporadic riots this year amid economic
hardship and rising ethnic and religious tensions. Deadly riots in
Jakarta helped force former President Suharto to quit in May after
32 years of authoritarian rule.

Law granting privileges revoked following outrage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Faced with public outrage, Serbian
lawmakers on Monday revoked a much-criticized law granting the
president and other top officials high salaries, paid servants and
other privileges.
	   The law was passed in the parliament only 20 days ago by
neo-Communists and their ultranationalist allies.
	   But with Serbia average salary about dlrs 50 a month and
unemployment approaching about 50 percent, the law triggered
outrage among impoverished Serbs.
	   Under the law, the Serbian president, government ministers,
state prosecutors, judges, parliament deputies and some other top
officials, were supposed to receive salaries 10 to 20 times the
national average, starting Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The officials would enjoy other privileges, such as use of
residence, official cars, bodyguards, paid servants or
administrative clerk.
	   The law was revoked after the government ``took into
consideration critical remarks of the public,'' said a statement
carried by Tanjug news agency.
	   The government said another law on ``rights and obligations'' of
the state officials would be drafted.
	   The government had defended the law saying it would make state
officials, such as court judges and government ministers, less
corrupt by making them richer. Corruption on all levels has taken
deep root in the Serbian society.
	   Despite growing poverty, President Slobodan Milosevic and his
government have so far faced little unrest. The workers have
avoided street protests, fearing reprisals. Critics accuse
autocratic Milosevic and his aides of accumulating wealth while
destroying Serbia's economy in the past decade of their rule.

Bodies of foreign hostages to be handed over to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The bodies of four foreigners who were beheaded in
Chechnya earlier this month were to be handed over to British
envoys on Monday, but the sides appeared at odds as to where the
handover would take place.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock,
said Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian
capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said the
separatist republic considered the proposal ``unacceptable'' and
wanted the bodies to be handed over in the nearby republic of
Azerbaijan, Interfax reported.
	   In that case, the bodies would have to be driven across Russia's
region of Dagestan, which separates Chechnya and Azerbaijan,
Makhashev said.
	   Chechnya, which had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from
Russia, adamantly tries to assert its independence from Moscow. No
country has recognized its sovereignty.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday evening in the
village of Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital,
Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday,
according to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   British officials confirmed that the bodies had been identified
by Chechen experts. But Britain has been unable yet to get an
independent confirmation of their identity, Haddock said, according
to Interfax.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   A mourning service for the four was held Monday in the church of
St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly
Muslim Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since Chechnya's independence war ended.

Italian court says no to Turkey's request for jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court on Monday took up a recommendation by
Italy's justice minister, ruling against a Turkish request to order
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan back to jail.
	   Turkey wants Ocalan jailed to prevent him from fleeing the
country while Italy considers Ankara's request to extradite the
guerrilla leader on charges that do not carry the death penalty.
	   Italy has so far refused to extradite Ocalan to Turkey for trial
on terrorism charges, citing laws that prevent it from extraditing
suspects to countries where they face the death penalty.
	   But Turkey insists Ocalan can be extradited for crimes that do
not carry capital punishment and is pressuring the Italian
government to do so.
	   Italy's justice minister last week rejected Turkey's request to
jail Ocalan, but the final say rested with Rome's appeal court.
	   Ocalan, who leads the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, is
reportedly negotiating with a number of governments outside the
European Union to take him in. He has been looking for a safe place
to go since Syria expelled him earlier this year in response to
heavy pressure from Turkey.
	   The Kurd has been staying in a villa on the outskirts of the
capital since about a week after he was arrested Nov. 12 at the
Rome airport, where he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
	   The PKK has been fighting in southeastern Turkey to gain
autonomy for the country's Kurds since 1984. Close to 37,000 people
have been killed since the conflict began.

Banks withhold new loans for LG Semicon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTs 8th graf with President Kim's comment

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Banks halted fresh loans to LG Semicon
Co. Monday, accusing it of resisting a promised merger that would
create the world's second-largest computer memory chip maker.
	   President Kim Dae-jung's government wants LG Semicon to merge
with Hyundai Electronics Industry Co. to cut out overlapping
investments by the country's computer chip makers and boost their
competitiveness.
	   Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest
conglomerates, agreed in September to merge their chip-making
subsidiaries. But talks have stalled because of a dispute over who
should take control of the merged company.
	   The government supports a U.S. consulting firm's recommendation
that Hyundai become the majority shareholder in the new entity. LG
says it can not accept the recommendation because it was biased in
favor of Hyundai.
	   Later Monday, LG Semicon's 13 creditor banks, most of them
state-controlled, held LG responsible for foiling the merger and
stopped providing new funds to the heavily indebted company.
	   The banks threatened to call in LG Semicon's existing loans as
well unless it accepts the merger.
	   LG Semicon's total debt amounted to 7.48 trillion won (dlrs 6.23
billion), mostly owed to banks. About dlrs 3.5 billion of the debt
comes due within a year.
	   ``LG Semicon must do what it has agreed to do, which is very
important to its future and credibility,'' President Kim was quoted
by his spokesman Park Jie-won as saying.
	   With their merger talks stalling, LG and Hyundai hired
Massachusetts-based Arthur D. Little Inc. in November to study who
should take control of the new company.
	   The consulting firm announced last Thursday it considered
Hyundai the better choice to run the merged company.
	   LG Semicon is preparing to file a lawsuit against Arthur D.
Little in a U.S. court next month, accusing it of being biased in
its month-long research and damaging the South Korean company's
reputation.
	   The LG-Hyundai merger, if realized, would create a company with
17 percent of the world memory chip market. South Korea's Samsung
Electronics Co. is the largest such company, with a 20 percent
global share.
	   South Korean conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding
during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the current
financial crisis. A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50
subsidiaries.
	   President Kim is urging the nation's top five conglomerates to
merge or swap some of their overlapping subsidiaries in auto,
semiconductor and other key products so that they will focus on
core businesses for competitiveness.

Pope thanks Castro for allowing Christmas celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has thanked Cuban leader
Fidel Castro for allowing Christmas to be celebrated on the
Communist-run island as an official holiday, the Vatican said
Monday.
	   ``I want to express to you my deep appreciation for the decision
to give back to Christmas its holiday character for all Cubans,
conforming to tradition,'' the pope said in a telegram to Castro,
whom he wished a happy holiday.
	   The telegram was sent Dec. 23 but disclosed only on Monday.
	   In November, the Cuban government declared Christmas an official
holiday, and this year allowed the local Roman Catholic Church the
rare privilege of broadcasting a national greeting on state radio.
	   In the telegram, the pope said he was praying so that ``with the
collaboration of all the citizens, this noble country, always
present in my heart, can consolidate its way toward a more
prosperous, just and fraternal society.''
	   John Paul met with Castro when he visited the island in January.
During that pilgrimage, the pontiff called for an end to the U.S.
economic embargo on Cuba.
	   The Christmas message by Cuba's top Catholic leader, Cardinal
Jaime Ortega, further testified to warmer relations between Havana
and the church.
	   Although the government declared itself atheist in 1962,
Christmas remained an official holiday until 1969.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An emergency meeting of Arab foreign

	   Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters
on Monday that the meeting, which was to be held Wednesday, has
been rescheduled for Jan. 24. He said the delay was requested by
Arab Gulf states.
	   Earlier, Egyptian newspapers had reported that moves were under
way to put off the meeting.
	   The meeting was called after the U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq. The four days of attacks, which ended Dec. 19, were aimed at
punishing the Baghdad regime for refusing to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.

Ousted Tehran mayor appeals to have investigation reopened
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The jail sentence imposed on Tehran's former
mayor was put on hold after his lawyer filed an appeal to the
prosecutor general, state-run Iranian radio reported Monday.
	   A statement from the prosecutor general's office said that
Gholamhossein Karbaschi will not be sent to prison before further
investigation of the case, the radio said.
	   ``A request was put to the office of the state prosecutor
general by Karbaschi's lawyer requesting the office to review the
case,'' the radio said. His lawyer is Bahman Keshavarz.
	   Karbaschi was convicted in July of corruption charges and
sentenced to five years in prison.
	   On Thursday, an appeals court reduced the prison sentence to two
years. It also reduced to 10 years from 20 years the period
Karbaschi is banned from holding public office. And it replaced his
sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of dlrs 3,000.
	   This would be in addition to earlier orders to pay dlrs 330,000
as punishment and dlrs 200,000 to reimburse the city for money he
allegedly embezzled.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians
saw the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in
Iran is controlled by hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his
eight years as Tehran's mayor.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted to making mistakes but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi won wide respect for his work as mayor, mainly for
city improvements he implemented. But he also made enemies among
the merchant class, who were upset by new taxes, and hard-liners,
who were angered at his pro-Khatami stance.
	   Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's arrest in April.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.

Lara leads West Indies back against SAfrican cricketers

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies is on its way back
against South Africa as it took its second inning score to 193 for
two wickets at tea on the third day of the third test at Kingsmead
Monday.
	   The West Indians led South Africa by 79 runs, and captain Brian
Lara seems to have finally come good on a tour characterized so far
by lack of application by the batsmen.
	   Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul batted through the first session
of the series, which did not see a wicket fall, scoring 102 runs
between them.
	   And although it was Chanderpaul who scored more freely than his
captain during the session, it was the discipline of Lara which was
impressive. He resisted the urge to pull or hook each time a
short-pitched ball was presented to him, avoiding a stroke which
has led to his downfall three times in the tests.
	   In the face of what could become a run glut, the South African
bowlers remained disciplined and aggressive. Allan Donald clipped
Lara's bat with a bouncer, and the ball could easily have flown to
the slip cordon
	   Pat Symcox was unlucky to have an appeal for a pad-bat catch at
silly mid-off turned down. Replays showed Lara had definitely
gloved the ball. New man David Terbrugge continues to impress with
his line and length, and bowled three consecutive maidens just
before tea.
	   Lara led the charge to try to drag his team back into the match
as they took lunch on 91 for two. Earlier, South Africa were
dismissed for 312, the first time either side has scored in excess
of 300 in this series.
	   This gave the hosts a 114-run lead, which has all but been wiped
out by some sparkling strokeplay by Lara on 32 not out, and a
typically gritty undefeated 20 by Chanderpaul. Lara looked in
sublime form, playing some breathtaking cover drives off all the
bowlers.
	   Donald started the innings with pace and hostility, and he was
the first to strike. He removed Philo Wallace for one.
	   Shaun Pollock was unlucky to have Junior Murray caught off a
no-ball, but the wicketkeeper retreaded into an opening batsman and
was caught pulling once too often, off the first ball of Jacques
Kallis' first spell of the second innings.
	   In dismissing South Africa in just 4.4 overs this morning, and
ridding themselves of Jonty Rhodes for 87 and an obstinate Donald
for 13, the West Indies have played themselves back into the match
especially with Lara looking so threatening.

Two main opposition parties unify against nationalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After months of negotiations,
the two biggest opposition parties in Bosnia agreed Monday to
unite.
	   The Social Democratic Party, led by Zlatko Lagumdzija and the
Social Democrats, led by the mayor of the northern city of Tuzla,
Selim Beslagic, were in negotiations for almost a year.
	   They were both encouraged by foreign mediators as well as by
social democrats from Europe to unify and establish a strong front
against the nationalists who have been in power for the last eight
years.
	   ``This is an act which will swing the pendulum to the other
side,'' said Lagumdzija, referring to the inability of the social
democrats to take power from the ethnically-based nationalists who
have dominated politics.
	   Officials of the office of Bosnia's top international mediator,
Carlos Westendorp, welcomed the unification and said anything that
furthers democracy in the country was a good sign.
	   The name of the new party will be the Social Democratic Party of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will hold a congress at the end of February,
officials said at the signing ceremony held in Tuzla.
	   Both of the parties separately have gained enough support to be
represented at all levels of Bosnia's complicated political
structure.
	   The first party president will come from Lagumdzija's party and
the president of the main board from Beslagic's. The posts will be
given out in proportion with the last September's election results.
	   Both parties are active throughout the country in both the
Bosnian Serb half and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   ``This will not only be a simple sum of two parties but it will
represent a new power that will gather all citizens of Bosnia that
have so far refrained from voting,'' said Beslagic.
	   He referred to the numerous Bosnians who believed there was
nobody who could ever beat the nationalists and thought it was
pointless to vote.
	   Officials of both parties denied the unification was done under
foreign pressure. They claimed it was rather a product of good will
and the attempt to come closer to Europe, where social democrats
are strong.

Faced with NBA lockout, Divac to join Yugoslav team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Faced with a continuing NBA lockout,
Charlotte Hornets center Vlade Divac decided to join Yugoslav
champion Red Star in the Euro basketball league, the Belgrade team
officials said Monday.
	   Divac, who like many other locked out NBA stars is seeking to
play in Europe, will start for Red Star in the Euro League match
against Zalgiris, Lithuania, in Belgrade on Jan. 7.
	   He will face Portland Trail Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis who
joined the Lithuanian team for the remainder of the lockout, said
Red Star manager Vojislav Stojakovic.
	   Divac, who signed for LA Lakers in 1989 and played the last two
seasons with the Charlotte Hornets before becoming a free agent,
confirmed he was joining Red Star.
	   Divac, a Yugoslav, told the daily newspaper Politika that he had
rejected a much better financial offer to play for Kinder Bologna,
and opted for the Belgrade team for patriotic reasons.
	   Politika said that Divac and Red Star agreed that he could
return to the NBA as soon as the lockout ended.

Iranian president calls for quick solution to slump in oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami on Monday urged
oil-producing countries to move quickly to shore up weak world oil
prices, which are harming Iran's economy, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   Khatami ``deplored the indifference shown by certain countries
regarding the falling oil prices,'' the agency said.
	   ``This is not acceptable,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We must
reach a firm decision quickly in order to be able to defend our
resources.''
	   IRNA said Khatami made the comments during a meeting with
Qatar's new ambassador to Tehran, Hussein bin Ali al-Dowsari.
	   Al-Dowsari expressed hope that members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce their production to
boost prices, the agency said.
	   Iran is at odds with other OPEC members, which have accused
Tehran of failing to cut its production as much as it agreed to
earlier this year.
	   OPEC pledged output cuts totaling 2.6 million barrels a day last
April and July, using February output as the baseline for the cuts.
	   But Iran objected and said it would make its cuts from the quota
it was assigned by OPEC in November 1997.
	   That means Iran has been working off a base of 3.9 million
barrels per day, rather than the 3.6 million barrels estimated to
be its February output.
	   Iran has said it is willing to attend an emergency meeting of
OPEC and would support new cuts of 1.5 million barrels per day by
the cartel, provided the higher baseline level stayed in place.
	   Both Iran and Qatar are members of OPEC. Iran has an output
quota of 3.318 million barrels per day, and Qatar's quota is
640,000 barrels per day.

BAGHDAD: to flee.

<TEXT>
	   The statement was distributed to reporters by the Information
Ministry.
	   The casualties were the first reported by Iraq since a four-day
bombing campaign by American and British forces ended Dec. 19.
	   Iraq said 62 soldiers and at least 40 civilians died in those
airstrikes, but never gave a final civilian casualty count.
	   ``The murderers and criminals returned once again and violated
our national airspace,'' the statement said.
	   It said ``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace at
10:25 a.m. (0725 gmt) from Turkey.
	   Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with valor and forced them
to flee to their bases of evil and aggression in Turkey,'' it said.
	   The statement said another wave of the planes entered Iraq at
1:37 p.m. (1037 gmt) and ``fired criminal missiles against one of
our sites in the area.''
	   These missiles, it said, killed four soldiers and wounded seven.
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over northern
Iraq. The zone was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after
their failed uprising against the Iraqi regime.
	   Earlier, Iraq's trade minister said the country has no immediate
plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who help distribute
supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.

Two die, six missing in yacht race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with three more rescued &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British sailor Glyn Charles was missing
and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while three others remained missing
in rough seas after nightfall Monday.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles
could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off
Sword of Orion on Sunday night.
	   ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and
80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it.''
	   Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in
the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered
the entrants.
	   Four members from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill were
winched to safety from a liferaft before dark Monday.
	   Two more crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a
second liferaft late Monday night, but three others who had been
aboard the liferaft were still missing.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the liferaft,'' a spokesman for the
authority said.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. ``He loved
the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race.
Dad simply loved life.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four
rescued.
	   ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into
the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned
thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody
frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quickly. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A man using a stolen hearse to smuggle
illegal immigrants led police on a high-speed chase Monday before
escaping on foot, a report said.
	   The smuggler allegedly stole the hearse Sunday from a funeral
home in Maniaki on the border with Albania. He used it to transport
seven Albanians who hid in the space for the coffin, the Macedonian
Press Agency quoted police as saying.
	   Patrol cars pursued the hearse after its driver failed to pull
over. But the driver abandoned the vehicle and managed to escape,
the agency said.
	   The seven Albanians told authorities they paid the driver to
transport them to the northern port of Salonica.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants attempt to sneak across
Greek borders each year. Some are sent home, while others manage to
find jobs in Greece.

BAGHDAD: the statement.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Pentagon could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   The statement was distributed to reporters by the Information
Ministry.
	   The casualties would be the first reported by Iraq since a
four-day bombing campaign by American and British forces ended Dec.
19.
	   Iraq said 62 soldiers and at least 40 civilians died in those
airstrikes. It never gave a final civilian casualty count.
	   ``The murderers and criminals returned once again and violated
our national airspace,'' the statement said. It added that
``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace at 10:25 a.m.
(0725 GMT) from Turkey.
	   Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with valor and forced them
to flee to their bases of evil and aggression in Turkey,'' it said.
	   The statement said another wave of the planes entered Iraq at
1:37 p.m. (1037 GMT) and ``fired criminal missiles against one of
our sites in the area.''
	   These missiles, it said, killed four soldiers and wounded seven.
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over northern
Iraq. The zone was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after
their failed uprising against the Iraqi regime.
	   Earlier, Iraq's trade minister said the country had no immediate
plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who help distribute
supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.

World champion yachtsman dies at age 87
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EASTON, Maryland (AP) _ E.W. ``Skip'' Etchells, an influential
boat builder who won many U.S. and international yachting
championships, has died at age 87.
	   Etchells, who died Dec. 20, designed the Etchells 22. This
design is now known as the International Etchells Class _ sailboats
built to a specific design so that the outcome of racing depended
on the skill of the crew rather than that of the boat builder.
	   In the 1940s and the 1950s, Etchells dominated international
competition in the one-design Star Class. In the 1960s, he created
the Etchells 22. He built Stars for 30 years and Etchells 22s for
20 years.
	   In 1951, with his wife, Mary, as crew, he won the Star Class
world championship. She is the only woman to have won a world title
in the popular boat.
	   Etchells won the 1959 North American Star Class and many U.S.
and international championships.
	   Etchells grew up in Trenton, New Jersey and graduated the
University of Michigan in 1936 with a degree in naval architecture
and engineering.
	   During World War II, he helped build destroyers and icebreakers
for the Navy. After the war, he worked in New York for Sparkman and
Stephens, the well-known yacht designers. After two years, he
founded Old Greenwich Boat Co., which became a leading builder of
Stars, Lightnings and other one-design boats.
	   In 1965 and 1966, the International Yacht Racing Union held a
competition in Kiel, Germany, to choose a new three-man keelboat
for the Olympics. The six entries included an Etchells-designed
craft with a wooden hull covered with fiberglass. Although it won
10 of the 13 races, the officials chose a Soling.
	   Sailors, however, praised his yacht, and he started production
of the class that he called the Etchells 22 because the boat's
waterline length is 22 feet (6.7 meters). The design's first
national championship was held in 1968. Etchells won it and sailed
in Etchells 22 races throughout the 1970s.
	   In 1984, he retired to Easton. He is survived by his wife, the
former Mary O'Toole; a son, Tim of Middlebury, Vermont; a daughter,
Anne Nieusma of Easton, and three grandchildren.

Germany phone war reaches new low: calls for free
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's telephone price wars hit new lows
Monday, with giant Deutsche Telekom planning to offer calls for
next to nothing and a big rival going even further: short chats for
free.
	   Telekom, which is still mostly state-owned, said its 1999 rate
cuts would beat the private competitors, who have taken about 15
percent of Germany's phone market since it was liberalized a year
ago.
	   Although details have yet to be settled, Telekom intends to
slash its lowest, late-night rate for long-distance calls within
Germany in half, to 6 pfennig (less than 4 cents) a minute.
	   Not to be outdone, rival MobilCom said it will extend its
Christmas Day promotional offer _ free calls anywhere in Germany _
to all of 1999. The catch: calls must be made between 7 p.m. and
midnight and last less than a minute.
	   Another private operator, o.tel.o, took a wait and see approach,
having earlier announced its own price cuts to take effect in
February. ``We won't let ourselves be shocked,'' spokesman
Christian Hoppe said.
	   The competition spurred by more than 100 companies seeking
customers has been a boon for German consumers. Government
regulators figure charges for long-distance calls have fallen up to
70 percent this year.
	   Telekom, however, charges it is being forced to subsidize the
privates through unfair decisions by government regulators, who set
the fees Telekom can charge independent operators for connections
to its network.
	   Telekom charges the fees are less than what it has to pay to
maintain the network.
	   ``So they (competitors) can offer our customers telephone calls
at extremely low prices on our network,'' Telekom boss Ron Summer
said in an interview published in Monday's Bild tabloid. ``Is that
really competition?''

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Lebanese bank has bought the private
Jordanian bank, Middle East Investment Bank, it was announced
Monday.
	   Societe General Libanaise European Bank will own 51 percent of
MEIB and increase its capital to 22 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs
31 million) from Jan. 1, the chairman of MEIB, Ali Hamdi Mango,
told the Associated Press.
	   Mango described the deal as a ``partnership agreement,'' but the
Societe General's effective take-over of MEIB is confirmed by the
fact that the Jordanian bank will change its name to Societe
General- Jordan.
	   Societe General will take control of its Jordanian subsidiary's
management for eight years, Mango said. After 2007, the management
will return to Jordanian hands.
	   The deal has its origins in the Jordanian Central Bank's
instruction to local banks to increase their capital to 20 million
dinars (dlrs 28 million) by 1999.
	   Owned by private shareholders, MEIB had a capital of 10 million
dinars (dlrs 14 million).
	   Banking sources said that Societe General Libanaise, which is 50
percent owned by Societe General of France, has bought the Jordan
bank as part of its strategy to expand its presence in the
Jordanian and Palestinian market in line with the regional peace
process.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The authority that manages Kuwait's foreign
investments has found that its assets are worth about 25 percent
more than previously thought, a local newspaper reported Monday.
	   Legislators who attended a meeting Sunday of the parliament's
financial and economic committee were told the assets of the Kuwait
Investment Authority were now worth 15 billion dinars (dlrs 49.66
billion), the newspaper Al-Watan said.
	   The report could not be confirmed as neither the KIA, which
manages the government's empire of foreign investments, nor the
Finance Ministry ever discloses the total value of the authority's
assets. However, the figure was thought to be dlrs 40 billion.
	   The KIA's funds are seen as a source of income for future
generations when oil, the backbone of Kuwait's economy, runs out.
	   The government has recently taken to using the KIA funds to
bridge its budget deficits.
	   The newspaper said that such a move was discussed at Sunday's
meeting, the newspaper said.
	   Because of low oil prices, Kuwait expects its net deficit to
reach more than 2.1 billion dinars (dlrs 6.95 billion) in the
current fiscal year that started July 1.
	   ____
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A Sudanese daily has put together a
petition to urge the government to lower the price of newspapers.
	   The editor-in-chief of Al-Wifaq newspaper, Ahmed Mudathir, told
the Associated Press on Monday that his company believed the
recently raised price would ``shrink the political awareness of our
people.''
	   Earlier this year, the Sudanese Council of Press and
Publications raised the price from 250 Sudanese pounds (11 U.S.
cents) to 400 Sudanese pounds (17 U.S. cents) and ordered the
newspapers to expand from eight pages to 12.
	   Most of the papers represented on the council are owned by, or
support, the military-backed government of Omar el-Bashir.
	   The new price means that a person who buys a newspaper every day
would spend 12,000 pounds (dlrs 5) in a month, which is equivalent
to almost 20 percent of the average worker's salary.
	   The petition calls on el-Bashir to order a reduction in the
price and page numbers ``to respect the rights of poor people to
read and receive political enlightenment.''
	   Mudathir, whose paper has expanded to 12 pages but still sells
for 250 pounds (11 U.S. cents), said that 115 influential persons
and low-income readers have signed the petition.
	   It will be presented to the president on Tuesday, he said.

BAGHDAD: food program.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   But the minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said the two-year-old
program was a temporary measure and could not substitute for
meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, which limit its
oil exports.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq would accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export
oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months _ when it expires in
May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq rejected continuation
of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said in the interview Sunday.
	   The program, which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to
export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicines for the 22
million Iraqis who have been hard hit by the sanctions.
	   In his remarks to APTN Sunday, Saleh set no date for expelling
the humanitarian workers, but complained that too little money from
the sale of oil went to the Iraqi people and too much to
administration.
	   ``Iraq is bearing huge expenses which it pays to these (U.N.)
personnel, and they do nothing apart from verifying that the
imports have reached Iraqi ports,'' he said.
	   On Monday, however, he said that the 400 U.N. workers
supervising the program would remain in Iraq as long as the program
continues.
	   Iraq has taken a harder line toward the United Nations since
four days of U.S. and British airstrikes aimed at punishing the
Baghdad regime for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors. The bombardment ended Dec. 19.
	   Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban the
inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the support the
country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in Amman,
Jordan.
	   Delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary Union's 19
member states on Sunday condemned the airstrikes as ``unjust
U.S.-British aggression'' and urged their governments to work
toward lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Their recommendation, however, fell short of Iraq's demand that
Arab countries begin circumventing the sanctions.
	   Al-Jumhuriya daily called again Monday for such action, saying:
``Let's break the sanctions, relying on the will of the Arabs.''
	   In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he opposed the
airstrikes but blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for provoking the
attacks, a newspaper reported in early Monday editions.
	   ``The ruling regime (in Iraq) is the reason for all the problems
... and Egypt naturally does not support this regime,''
Al-Gomhuriya newspaper quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel to and from the country,
limit oil sales and bar most other financial transactions _ have
seriously damaged Iraq's economy.
	   On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for a
quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting
sanctions and again warned the United States against using force.
	   He told reporters after meeting with President Boris Yeltsin
that Russia believes Iraq must cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors, but said the United Nations must swiftly complete a
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance.

Report: Japan's first lung transplant patient released from
</HEADLINE>
hospital

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 24-year-old Japanese woman who received the
country's first lung transplant from a living donor was released on
Monday from a hospital in western Japan, local media reported.
	   The woman, whom hospital authorities have declined to identify
by name, received half of her 48-year-old mother's left lung and
one-third of her 21-year-old sister's right lung in October. The
surgery was necessary because an incurable lung disease had left
her unable to breathe on her own.
	   Doctors at Okayama University Hospital discharged the woman
after her breathing capacity improved to about half of that of a
normal adult woman, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   ``Breathing has become a lot easier...I feel like I've been born
again,'' she was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   Hospital officials in Okayama, located 547 kilometers (342
miles) west of Tokyo, were unavailable for comment late Monday.
	   Organ transplants have been extremely rare in Japan because of a
previous law that recognized death only after a patient's heart
stopped beating. Once the heart stops, organs such as hearts and
lungs usually become unsuitable for transplant operations.
	   Although a new law recently was passed to recognize brain death,
the practice of removing organs still has yet to catch on widely in
Japan. Not a single transplant has been performed in the country
from a brain-dead donor.
	   Japanese doctors have performed lung transplants before _ but
never using organs from a living donor. The most common organ
transplants from dead donors carried out in Japan are kidney and
cornea transplants.
	   The nation's first lung-transplant recipient must stay in
Okayama for check-ups at the hospital three times a week, but she
may be able to return to her hometown in Nagano prefecture as soon
as February, Kyodo said.
	   Nagano is 179 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of Tokyo.

Iraq says warplanes attack, 4 soldiers killed

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Western warplanes fired missiles Monday at
an Iraqi air defense site in the north, killing four Iraqi
soldiers, the government said in a statement.
	   The statement, attributed to an unnamed military spokesman, said
that seven other soldiers were wounded.
	   The statement said Iraqi air defenses fired in response, forcing
the warplanes to flee.
	   The casualties were the first reported by Iraq since a four-day
bombing campaign by American and British forces ended Dec. 19.
	   Iraq said 62 soldiers and at least 40 civilians died in those
airstrikes, but never gave a final civilian casualty count.
	   ``The murderers and criminals returned once again and violated
our national airspace,'' Monday's statement said.
	   It said ``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace at
10:25 a.m. (0725 gmt) from Turkey.
	   Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with valor and forced them
to flee to their bases of evil and aggression in Turkey,'' it said.
	   The statement said another wave of the planes entered Iraq at
1:37 p.m. (1037 gmt) and ``fired criminal missiles against one of
our sites in the area.''
	   These missiles, it said, killed four soldiers and wounded seven.
The statement was distributed to reporters by the Information
Ministry.
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over northern
Iraq. The zone was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after
their failed uprising against the Iraqi regime.
	   In London, the Ministry of Defense said that British planes were
not involved in the incidents.
	   Earlier, Iraq's trade minister said the country has no immediate
plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who help distribute
supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   But the minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said the 2-year-old
program was a temporary measure and could not substitute for
meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, which limit its
oil exports.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export
oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months _ when it expires in
May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq rejected continuation
of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said in the interview Sunday.
	   The program, which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to
export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicines for the 22
million Iraqis who have been hard hit by the sanctions.
	   In his remarks to APTN Sunday, Saleh set no date for expelling
the humanitarian workers, but complained that too little of the
money from the sale of oil went to the Iraqi people and too much to
administration.
	   ``Iraq is bearing huge expenses which it pays to these (U.N.)
personnel, and they do nothing apart from verifying that the
imports have reached Iraqi ports,'' he said.
	   On Monday, however, he said that the 400 U.N. workers
supervising the program would remain in Iraq as long as the program
continues.
	   Iraq has taken a harder line toward the United Nations since the
airstrikes earlier this month aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban the
inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the support the
country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in Amman,
Jordan.
	   Delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary Union's 19
member states on Sunday condemned the airstrikes as ``unjust
U.S.-British aggression'' and urged their governments to work

	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Hermann Maier and his teammates on Monday
served notice that Austria's first World Cup downhill victory of
the season is within range of the ``Power Team.''
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, set the fastest time in
the last practice run for Tuesday's speed race and seven other
Austrian skiers placed among the top ten.
	   ``The Herminator,'' who led an unprecedented 1-9 finish by the
Austrians in a World Cup Super-G race at Innsbruck last Monday,
said he was looking forward to his second downhill triumph in this
Italian Alpine resort and to another impressive team showing.
	   Maier won in Bormio the first of consecutive World Cup downhills
in 1997, with Andreas Schifferer taking the second race.
	   ``This is one of the most difficult courses of the men's circuit
and you must ski a perfect race to win,'' said Maier, who exploded
to international fame last season clinching ten World Cup races,
the overall title and two Olympic golds at Nagano.
	   The defending World Cup overall, Super-G and giant slalom
champion said he was surprised with his first place in practice
``as I did not ski well today.''
	   ``The bib number for the race could be decisive as visibility
changes quickly, with parts in the sun and others in the shade,''
Austria's No.1 skier said.
	   He added he still had in mind quickly changing weather and track
conditions in the downhill at Val D'Isere where the favored
Austrians suffered the first of consecutive defeats in the most
prestigious discipline of Alpine skiing.
	   Norway's top downhiller Lasse Kjus, who's sidelined with a
bronchitis and will not start in Bormio, won the Val D'Isere
downhill and the next in Val Gardena.
	   In Monday's practice, Maier flashed down the icy, 3,070-meter
long Stelvio course in one minute, 56.20 seconds beating teammates
Hannes Trinkl, Christian Greber and Stephan Eberharter between 0.31
to 0.74 seconds.
	   Didier Cuche edged Swiss teammate Bruno Kernen for fifth place
with four more Austrians taking from seventh to tenth place.
	   Cuche was 0.76 seconds slower than Maier while Kernen, the
defending world downhill champion, had a gap of 1.3 seconds.
	   Austrian skiers pushed hard throughout the course which hosted
the 1985 World Championships as Monday's practice qualified 11 of
them for the race, out of 13 starters.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, was beat Kjus in the second of
back-to-back downhills in Val Gardena earlier this month, trailed
Maier by nearly 3 seconds in 27th place.
	   Ghedina said he did not like the course and did not expect
anything good in Tuesday's race.
	   Kjus' absence in the last World Cup race of the year offers
Maier the chance to extend his overall lead.
	   The Austrian ace, who has won two Super-Gs and one giant slalom
this season, enters Tuesday's downhill with 540 points, three ahead
of Kjus.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China
will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly
the country in its quest for the first nonstop round-the-world
flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
	   The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone
its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals
Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect
previously agreed conditions.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and
is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard
and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry
spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
	   But even if China gives the go-ahead, the team said weather
conditions mean the balloon can't launch from the alpine village of
Chateau d'Oex before Saturday.
	   Piccard and Jones, who had obtained conditional permission, had
previously said they might take off as soon as Sunday. It would be
Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a
balloon around the world nonstop.
	   Beijing originally gave British tycoon Branson, Chicago
millionaire Fossett and Lindstrand, of Sweden, permission to cross
China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   The trio, however, drifted further north last Monday. After
diplomatic communications between Britain and China, the
balloonists were allowed to continue flying as long as they left
China as quickly as possible.
	   Caught in poor weather conditions, the team splashed down off
Hawaii Friday.
	   Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream
winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
	   Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday by
strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs,
Australia.

German stock exchange says it's ready for euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German stock exchange said Monday
that it's ready for the launch of the euro after completing a
six-month test run of all trading and settlement systems.
	   The exchange, Deutsche Boerse AG, said all of its customer links
have gone through tests involving everything from orders intake
through payment and settlement systems and their conversion into
the euro to ensure that the systems are adjusted and produce
correct results.
	   Eleven European Union countries will begin adopting the single
currency Friday, meaning financial institutions will be working
over the holiday to convert their books to be ready to begin
trading in euros when markets reopen Jan. 4.
	   On Dec. 31, Deutsche Boerse's 90-member conversion team will be
ready to feed the euro's conversion rates against its constituent
currencies and the dollar into their systems after their official
announcement, it said.
	   Deutsche Boerse's software will automatically make the changes
needed, it said, although some highly complex steps and booking
activities will be carried out manually.
	   Finally, the conversion team will examine the results and
calculation methods and send reference data to all market
participants, it said.
	   On Jan. 4, when trading opens at 0730 GMT, all rates will be in
euro, Deutsche Boerse said.

Iraq says warplanes attack, four soldiers killed

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Western warplanes fired missiles Monday at
an Iraqi air defense site in the north, killing four Iraqi
soldiers, the government said in a statement.
	   In London, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said its
planes were not involved in the incident Monday. However, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, he confirmed that there were
reports of U.S. aircraft coming under attack in northern Iraq and
responding.
	   Pentagon officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Seven other soldiers were injured and Iraqi air defenses fired
back in response, forcing the warplanes to flee, according to the
statement, which was attributed to an unnamed military spokesman
and distributed by the Information Ministry.
	   The casualties would be the first reported by Iraq since a
four-day bombing campaign by American and British forces ended Dec.
19. Iraq said 62 soldiers and at least 40 civilians died in those
airstrikes. It never gave a final civilian casualty count.
	   ``The murderers and criminals returned once again and violated
our national airspace,'' Monday's statement said. It added that
``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace at 10:25 a.m.
(0725 GMT) from Turkey.
	   Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with valor and forced them
to flee to their bases of evil and aggression in Turkey,'' the
statement said.
	   The statement said another wave of the planes entered Iraq at
1:37 p.m. (1037 GMT) and ``fired criminal missiles against one of
our sites in the area.''
	   These missiles, it said, killed four soldiers and wounded seven.
The statement was distributed to reporters by the Information
Ministry.
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over northern
Iraq. The zone was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after
their failed uprising against the Iraqi regime.
	   Earlier, Iraq's trade minister said the country has no immediate
plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who help distribute
supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   But the minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said the two-year-old
program was a temporary measure and could not substitute for
meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, which limit its
oil exports.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export
oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months _ when it expires in
May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq rejected continuation
of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said in the interview Sunday.
	   The program, which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to
export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicines for the 22
million Iraqis who have been hard hit by the sanctions.
	   In his remarks to APTN Sunday, Saleh set no date for expelling
the humanitarian workers, but complained that too little of the
money from the sale of oil went to the Iraqi people and too much to
administration.
	   On Monday, however, he said that the 400 U.N. workers
supervising the program would remain in Iraq as long as the program
continues.
	   Iraq has taken a harder line toward the United Nations since the
airstrikes earlier this month aimed at punishing the Baghdad regime
for failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Baghdad's first response to the airstrikes was to ban the
inspectors from returning to Iraq. On Saturday, Iraq said it would
fire on U.S. and British warplanes patrolling skies over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers on Monday hailed the support the
country received a day earlier from Arab legislators in Amman,
Jordan.
	   Delegations from 16 members of the Arab Parliamentary Union's 19
member states on Sunday condemned the airstrikes and urged their
governments to work toward lifting the sanctions.
	   Their recommendation, however, fell short of Iraq's demand that
Arab countries begin circumventing the sanctions. Al-Jumhuriya
daily called again Monday for such action, saying: ``Let's break
the sanctions, relying on the will of the Arabs.''
	   The U.N. sanctions _ which ban air travel to and from the
country, limit oil sales and bar most other financial transactions
_ cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Also Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for a
quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting
sanctions and again warned the United States against using force.

Bodies of foreign hostages to be handed over to Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with bodies taken to Azerbaijan,
handover to take place Tuesday, other details. Minor editing to
conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A convoy bearing the bodies of four foreigners who
were beheaded in Chechnya earlier this month left Monday for the
nearby country of Azerbaijan, where the bodies were to be handed
over to British envoys, a news report said.
	   The convoy of medical vehicles, accompanied by Chechnya's Deputy
Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev and Deputy Prosecutor General
Magomed Magomadov, was to travel across the Russian region of
Dagestan, which separates Chechnya and Azerbaijan.
	   The handover was set to take place in the Azerbaijani capital,
Baku, on Tuesday, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news
agency. It was originally planned for Monday, but appeared to have
been delayed by the sides' disagreement on where it should take
place.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock,
said Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian
capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said the
separatist republic considered the proposal ``unacceptable'' and
wanted the bodies to be handed over in Azerbaijan, Interfax
reported.
	   Chechnya, which had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from
Russia, adamantly tries to assert its independence from Moscow. No
country has recognized its sovereignty.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday evening in the
village of Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital,
Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday,
according to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   British officials confirmed that the bodies had been identified
by Chechen experts. But Britain has been unable yet to get an
independent confirmation of their identity, Haddock said, according
to Interfax.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   A mourning service for the four was held Monday in the church of
St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly
Muslim Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since Chechnya's independence war ended.

Jail term for columnist found guilty of insulting prosecutors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A popular Kuwaiti columnist has been sentenced to
three months in prison for writings deemed insulting to public
prosecutors, his newspaper said Monday.
	   The columnist, Fouad al-Hashem, said he wanted to serve the term
to attract attention to the need for more freedom of expression.
	   The Court of First Instance ruled Saturday that al-Hashem
insulted prosecutors in a column he wrote for the daily Al-Watan,
said Mohammad al-Jassem, the paper's editor-in-chief.
	   The court also ordered al-Jassem to pay a fine of 100 dinars
(dlrs 331) for allowing publication of the column, which appeared
in June 1997.
	   Al-Hashem's column was a jocular comment about a controversy
over travel expenses paid by the Kuwait Oil Tankers Co. for
prosecutors who were investigating alleged embezzlement by its own
officials.
	   In the column, al-Hashem asked that prosecutors be sent with him
to Beirut to investigate a dispute he was having with a landlord.
He added the prosecutors would not regret going since he would take
them to music concerts and expensive dinners.
	   ``I did not insult them,'' al-Hashem told The Associated Press.
``I was just practicing my right to freedom of expression.''
	   He added he has packed a bag and was waiting for police to take
him to jail.
	   ``I want to send a message to those who preach free press in
Kuwait, the Arab countries and the world, that writers should not
have to go to prison,'' said the 47-year-old columnist.

Cracks widen in proposed Japanese coalition; talks seen continuing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 9th-11th grafs on reported agreement to seek
new meeting between party heads and quote from senior ruling party
official.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Cracks widened in a deal to form a coalition
government Monday, when a top opposition leader said Japan's ruling
party was not serious about cutting a deal, and a government
spokesman said a disagreement over defense could torpedo the plan.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal
Party had been expected to soon wrap up a coalition deal in the
works for weeks that would bolster the LDP's standing in
Parliament.
	   But the talks have snagged over how far to expand the
participation of Japanese troops in U.N. missions. The LDP wants to
limit Japan's military to logistical support, while the Liberals
are pushing for a broader interpretation of the constitution
allowing troops to participate more fully in U.N.-backed
multinational operations.
	   The dispute blocked progress in talks Sunday and forced the
postponement of a meeting between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa scheduled for Monday morning.
	   Ozawa on Monday suggested the LDP lacked the will to follow
through on its deal with the opposition.
	   ``There is little eagerness (on the part of the government) to
definitely implement the agreement. That's where the situation
stands today,'' Ozawa said. He said that unless the government
demonstrated more willingness to go ahead with the deal, it would
be useless to have talks between the heads of the two parties.
	   The government, meanwhile, stood by its refusal to change its
interpretation of the U.S.-written constitution, which restricts
the Japanese military to defense operations and prohibits offensive
military action abroad.
	   ``We've already reached agreement with Ozawa that there will be
no change in the interpretation of the constitution,'' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters in Okinawa on
Monday. ``If the Liberal Party insists on more, we'll have to go
back to square one.''
	   Still, the two parties have agreed to seek a new meeting between
Prime Minister Obuchi and Ozawa, though no schedule has been set,
local media reported.
	   They also reached a consensus on setting up inter-party teams
focused on implementing mutually acceptable polices in five key
areas, including basic issues relating to national security and
efforts to streamline the bureaucracy, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   ``The stage has been set for the resumption of the talks between
the leaders,'' Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the ruling party,
was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   So far, the two sides have agreed to reduce the number of
Cabinet posts from 20 to 18 and abolish the system in which senior
bureaucrats speak on behalf of ministers during Diet debates.
Obuchi plans to offer one Cabinet post to the LP in the proposed
coalition.

Maier leads final downhill practice

	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Hermann Maier and his teammates on Monday
served notice that Austria's first World Cup downhill victory of
the season is within range of the ``Power Team.''
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, set the fastest time in
the last practice run for Tuesday's speed race and seven other
Austrian skiers placed among the top ten.
	   ``The Herminator,'' who led an unprecedented 1-9 finish by the
Austrians in a World Cup Super-G race at Innsbruck last Monday,
said he was looking forward to his second downhill triumph in this
Italian Alpine resort and to another impressive team showing.
	   Maier won in Bormio the first of consecutive World Cup downhills
in 1997, with Andreas Schifferer taking the second race.
	   ``This is one of the most difficult courses of the men's circuit
and you must ski a perfect race to win,'' said Maier, who exploded
to international fame last season clinching 10 World Cup races, the
overall title and two Olympic golds at Nagano.
	   The defending World Cup overall, Super-G and giant slalom
champion said he was surprised with his first place in practice
``as I did not ski well today.''
	   ``The bib number for the race could be decisive as visibility
changes quickly, with parts in the sun and others in the shade,''
Austria's No.1 skier said.
	   He added he still had in mind quickly changing weather and track
conditions in the downhill at Val D'Isere where the favored
Austrians suffered the first of consecutive defeats in the most
prestigious discipline of Alpine skiing.
	   Norway's top downhiller, Lasse Kjus, who's sidelined with
bronchitis and will not start in Bormio, won the Val D'Isere
downhill and the next in Val Gardena.
	   In Monday's practice, Maier flashed down the icy, 3,070-meter-
(10,072-foot-) long Stelvio course in one minute, 56.20 seconds
beating teammates Hannes Trinkl, Christian Greber and Stephan
Eberharter between 0.31 to 0.74 seconds.
	   Didier Cuche edged Swiss teammate Bruno Kernen for fifth place
with four more Austrians taking from seventh to tenth place.
	   Cuche was 0.76 seconds slower than Maier while Kernen, the
defending world downhill champion, had a gap of 1.3 seconds.
	   Austrian skiers pushed hard throughout the course, which hosted
the 1985 World Championships, as Monday's practice qualified 11 of
them for the race, out of 13 starters.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, who beat Kjus in the second of
back-to-back downhills in Val Gardena earlier this month, trailed
Maier by nearly 3 seconds in 27th place.
	   Ghedina said he did not like the course.
	   Kjus' absence in the last World Cup race of the year offers
Maier the chance to extend his overall lead.
	   The Austrian ace, who has won two Super-Gs and one giant slalom
this season, enters Tuesday's downhill with 540 points, three ahead
of Kjus.

Greece's Attica to buy majority stake in Cronus Air
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Ferry line operators Attica Enterprises
Holdings announced Monday it will acquire a fast-growing private
Greek airline.
	   The plans to take controlling interest in Cronus Airlines is
part of Attica's ``strategic plans which aim to develop an
international passenger and cargo transportation network at sea and
in the air,'' said a company statement.
	   No other details were available on the timing or the cost of the
acquisition.
	   Attica operates four passenger ferries between Greece and Italy.
	   Founded in 1994, Cronus operates flights between Athens,
Salonica, Rhodes and Crete in Greece. It also flies to London,
Paris, and the German cities of Munich, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt,
Stuttgart and Cologne.
	   It carried about 500,000 passengers this year. Revenue is
expected to reach 15 billion drachmas (dlrs 53 million) in 1998, up
from 8 billion drachmas (dlrs 28 million) last year.

Dutch government lifts ban on nuclear transports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government confirmed Monday
that it has lifted a temporary ban on transporting nuclear waste to
France and England for reprocessing after imposing a tighter
monitoring system on the shipments.
	   The ban was introduced in June following revelations that some
Dutch nuclear waste transports had leaked radiation. The Dutch
incidents came to light following similar cases in neighboring
Germany.
	   Up to 12 shipments of Dutch nuclear waste are trucked each year
to Britain's Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant and a treatment
plant at La Hague in France.
	   Greenpeace Netherlands dismissed the new monitoring regime as an
ineffectual administrative measure.
	   ``It doesn't solve the real problem,'' said Greenpeace
spokeswoman Annemiek van der Molen. ``The containers the waste is
in are not safe enough to transport nuclear waste.''
	   In a letter to parliament, dated Dec. 23 and released Monday,
Environment Minister Jan Pronk said that under the new monitoring
regime, nuclear waste containers will be checked for radioactivity
two days before they are transported, during transport and on
arrival.
	   Empty containers being returned to the Netherlands also must be
checked and the two Dutch nuclear power stations must report
contamination cases.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ West African, U.S. and British
diplomats held emergency talks on Monday amid a military buildup in
Sierra Leone, where foreign mercenaries are accused of escalating a
brutal rebel war.
	   The sideline diplomacy in the Ivory Coast came in response to
mounting fears of full scale war in nearby Sierra Leone's capital,
Freetown, where a West African coalition force has been deploying
reinforcements against an advancing rebel army.
	   Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Sam Banya told reporters at the
meeting that two battalions of Nigerian soldiers flew into Freetown
late Sunday night to reinforce the West African coalition army _
known as ECOMOG _ fighting on the government's behalf.
	   Several hundred Gambian troops were also expected to join the
ECOMOG force and other West African nations pledged troops for
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's defense.
	   The buildup was in response to recent rebel advances led by
mercenaries recruited from Liberia, Burkina Faso and the Ukraine,
Banya alleged. He gave no details and his claims could not be
independently confirmed.
	   ``We have strong evidence that Liberia is helping the rebels and
they have also hired these foreign mercenaries who are the reason
for the recent attacks,'' he said.
	   Although Kabbah's government says it remains open to
negotiations with the insurgents, the rebels have rejected talks
and vowed to storm the capital unless Kabbah resigns.
	   Fighting was reportedly continuing Monday in the central town of
Makeni, where rebels claimed to have captured the town from ECOMOG
forces.
	   Although declining to say who controlled the town, Banya said
all of Makeni's several thousand residents had fled.
	   Monday's talks were spearheaded by the Economic Community of
West African States, the region's chief political group, which
directs ECOMOG operations in Sierra Leone and Liberia, where they
are carrying out peacekeeping duties.
	   Foreign ministers and officials from seven West African
countries were present. Delegations from Washington, London and the
United Nations were also attending the meeting, where military and
diplomatic measures were being debated.
	   Lansana Kouyate, ECOWAS general secretary, called for further
troop reinforcements in Sierra Leone from West African countries.
Several countries, including the Ivory Coast have promised troops,
but so far have failed to deliver.
	   Led and largely financed by Nigeria, the force also includes
troops from Ghana and Guinea.
	   Kouyate stressed that while ECOWAS was trying to open a dialogue
with the rebels, the first priority was to end the rebel threat
posed to civilians.
	   Togo's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Koffi Go called on
Western powers to send logistical equipment to back up the
intervention troops. Earlier this year, the U.S. and Britain sent
military vehicles and other equipment to ECOMOG.
	   Kabbah's government had offered to negotiate with the rebels and
proposed an amnesty for their troops on the condition they lay down
their arms. The renegades have rejected talks and vowed to storm
the capital unless Kabbah resigns.
	   Witnesses and aid workers have accused the rebels of vicious
massacres, kidnappings and mutilations of villagers in a campaign
aimed at wreaking revenge against the government and spreading
their influence through fear.
	   Rebel leaders have denied the charges.
	   Sam Bockarie, a top commander in the Revolutionary United Front,
has staged a surprise series of assaults in recent days, reportedly
moving his troops to within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of Freetown _
now filled with refugees from the nearby town of Waterloo.

Two die, four missing in yacht race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more rescued &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British sailor Glyn Charles was missing
and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while three others remained missing
in rough seas after nightfall Monday.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles
could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off
Sword of Orion on Sunday night.
	   ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and
80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it.''
	   Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in
the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered
the entrants.
	   Four members from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill were
winched to safety from a life raft before dark Monday.
	   Two more crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a
second life raft late Monday night, but three others who had been
aboard the life raft were still missing.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the life raft,'' a spokesman for
the authority said.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. ``He loved
the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race.
Dad simply loved life.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four
rescued.
	   ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into
the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned
thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody
frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quickly. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

Japan to lend Kazakstan dlrs 180 million to upgrade airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan has agreed to loan Kazakstan dlrs 180
million to upgrade the airport in the new Kazak capital, Astana, a
news agency reported Monday.
	   The money will be used to rebuild runways, build new passenger
and freight terminals and other work, Interfax said, citing the
Kazak Foreign Ministry. The 30-year loan is to be provided by the
Japanese Fund for Foreign Economic Cooperation, the ministry said.
	   Astana, formerly called Akmola, became Kazakstan's capital in
December 1997, when President Nursultan Nazarbayev moved the
government of the former Soviet republic 700 miles south from
Almaty, the nation's largest city.
	   At the time of the move, Astana was a city of 300,000 with a
poorly developed infrastructure and appeared ill-prepared to become
the national capital.

Germany phone war reaches new low: calls for free
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from trade group rep &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's telephone price wars hit new lows
Monday, with giant Deutsche Telekom planning to offer calls for
next to nothing and a big rival going even further: short chats for
free.
	   Telekom, which is still mostly state-owned, said its 1999 rate
cuts would beat the private competitors, who have taken about 15
percent of Germany's phone market since it was liberalized a year
ago.
	   Although details have yet to be settled, Telekom intends to
slash its lowest, late-night rate for long-distance calls within
Germany in half, to 6 pfennig (less than 4 cents) a minute.
	   Not to be outdone, rival MobilCom said it will extend its
Christmas Day promotional offer _ free calls anywhere in Germany _
to all of 1999. The catch: calls must be made between 7 p.m. and
midnight and last less than a minute.
	   Another private operator, o.tel.o, took a wait and see approach,
having earlier announced its own price cuts to take effect in
February. ``We won't let ourselves be shocked,'' spokesman
Christian Hoppe said.
	   The competition spurred by more than 100 companies seeking
customers has been a boon for German consumers and industry.
Government regulators figure charges for long-distance calls have
fallen up to 70 percent this year.
	   Gerd Eickers, director of a telecommunications trade
association, said he expects to see prices continue to slide 10
percent to 20 percent a year.
	   ``I think we're just at the beginning and will experience many
more interesting surprises for consumers,'' he said.
	   Telekom, however, charges it is being forced to subsidize the
privates through unfair decisions by government regulators, who set
the fees Telekom can charge independent operators for connections
to its network.
	   Telekom charges the fees are less than what it has to pay to
maintain the network.
	   ``So they (competitors) can offer our customers telephone calls
at extremely low prices on our network,'' Telekom boss Ron Summer
said in an interview published in Monday's Bild tabloid. ``Is that
really competition?''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Western warplanes fired missiles Monday at
an Iraqi air defense site in the north, killing four Iraqi
soldiers, the government said in a statement.
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. administration official confirmed
that U.S. warplanes fired on targets in Northern Iraq in response
to Iraqi fire.
	   U.S. pilots ``took appropriate action to enforce ``no-fly zones
which is an important element of our containment policy,'' the
official said.
	   ``We will continue to enforce no-fly zones, and take protective
actions to protect our pilots,'' the official said, speaking only
on condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense said its planes
were not involved in the incident Monday.
	   The Iraqi statement, attributed to an unnamed military
spokesman, said that seven other soldiers were wounded.

Kendal Cavalier wins Welsh National

	   CHEPSTOW, Wales (AP) _ Kendal Cavalier held off a strong, late
challenge from Fiddling the Facts to win the 50,000-pound (dlrs
83,500) Welsh National steeplechase on Monday.
	   Ridden by Barry Fenton, the 8-year-old gray gelding hit the
front with two fences to go in the 3.6 mile (5.75 kilometer) race
at Chepstow and moved three lengths clear of the field in the
straight.
	   But Mick Fitzgerald made a late charge on Fiddling the Facts and
was eating up the lead stride by stride only for Kendal Cavalier to
hold on by half a length.
	   The winner was returned at 14-1 with Fiddling the Facts an 11-2
shot. Forest Ivory was third of only six horses to finish the
gruelling race. Earth Summit, last year's winner of the Grand
National at Aintree and the 9-2 favorite, was one of eight to pull
up.

18 killed, nearly 100 injured in China traffic accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ At least 18 people were killed and nearly 100
injured when a truck laden with detonators and fuses exploded after
colliding with a bus in eastern China, official media said Monday.
	   The explosion, which happened as rescuers were trying to pull
people from the wreckage of the accident, killed 17 people on the
spot and another seriously injured person died later in a hospital,
the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Of the remaining nearly 100 injured, 63 are still in hospital,
Xinhua added.
	   The bus carrying nine people collided Saturday afternoon with
the truck in Dingyuan county, Anhui province, about 850 kilometers
(530 miles) south of Beijing, Xinhua said. The cries of people
caught in the accident attracted a crowd of several hundred people
who tried rescuing the injured and putting out a fire.
	   After about 10 minutes, the truck was burning out of control. As
a group of people were preparing to push the bus away from the
burning vehicle, a badly injured person climbed down from the truck
and said it was carrying a dangerous cargo, Xinhua said.
	   The explosion occurred as people began running away. It was
later discovered that the truck was carrying 60,000 detonators and
40,000 meters (132,000 feet) of fuse, Xinhua said.
	   It quoted witnesses as saying that casualties would have been
worse had rescuers not got the last minute warning from the injured
person who came down off the truck. The witnesses said that they
had seen that the truck was laden with boxes, but that the boxes
were not labeled with their contents.

	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quickly. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Western warplanes fired missiles Monday at
an Iraqi air defense site in the north, killing four Iraqi
soldiers, the government said in a statement.
	   In Washington, a senior U.S. administration official confirmed
that U.S. warplanes fired on targets in Northern Iraq, saying it
was in response to Iraqi fire.
	   U.S. pilots ``took appropriate action to enforce ``no-fly zones
which is an important element of our containment policy,'' the
official said on condition of anonymity. ``We will continue to
enforce no-fly zones, and take protective actions to protect our

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Feuding between rival fishing
communities in the Ivory Coast has escalated into violent clashes
that in recent days have left five dead, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Armed with rifles and machete knives, members of the Neyo tribe
in the Ivory Coast have been battling with rival fishermen from
Ghana, who live in the Ivorian town Sassandra, the French-language
daily Fraternite Matin reported.
	   The clashes began more than a week ago after Neyo villagers
spotted a dead body floating near the coastline. Accusing the
fishermen of killing the Ivorian victim, Neyo men began attacking
the Ghanian fishing communities in Sassandra, the newspaper
reported.
	   At least five Ghanian fishermen have been killed since the
fighting began. Another 27 Ghanian and Neyo villagers have been
wounded.
	   Sassandra, near the Liberian border, is an important fishing
port, attracting crews from Ghana, Liberia and the Ivory Coast.
	   --
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A Paris-based press freedoms
group accused Burkina Faso's government of reneging on promises to
conduct an independent investigation into the suspicious death of a
prominent local journalist.
	   Reporters Without Borders said President Blaise Compaore's
government had done little to explain the death of newspaperman
Norbert Zongo, who along with three companions was killed in a car
fire earlier this month.
	   The death triggered mass demonstrations as many government
opponents accused Compaore of complicity in the deaths.
	   ``It is unfortunate to observe that concerning police
investigations, absolutely nothing has been done,'' Reporters
Without Borders Secretary General Robert Menard said in a statement
released in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou.
	   Zongo, two of his cousins and his driver were all found dead in
a car, which had been torched from the inside.
	   Reporters without borders earlier said the deaths looked
suspicious since the outside of the car showed no signs of an
accident that could have caused the fire.
	   At the time of his death, Zongo had been working on a series of
	   investigative reports looking into the unexplained shooting
death of an employee working for Compaore's brother.
	   Shortly after his death, the Justice Ministry said it would
launch an independent probe into charges that Zongo had been
killed.
	   The Justice Ministry flatly denied any links between Zongo's
death and the president.
	   Menard, however, said he no longer believed a fair and unbiased
	   investigation into Zongo's death would be conducted.
	   ``In Burkina we are used to certain deaths that remain
unexplained,'' he said.
	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Traffic accidents claimed 20 lives
between Christmas Eve and Sunday morning, about the normal holiday
toll, police said.
	   Another 161 people were injured in a total of 299 accidents
across the country, numerous of them linked to alcohol abuse.
	   Over the same period last year, 22 people died on the roads.
	   --
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Some 250 more Namibians from a
troubled strip of land have crossed the border into Botswana,
bringing the total since October to 1,763, authorities here said
Monday.
	   The latest arrivals from the Caprivi strip came within the past
10 days, said government spokesman Andrew Sesinyi.
	   The Namibians are seeking refugee status, saying they are
fleeing persecution by the Namibian government. Authorities in
Namibia accuse them of supporting secession of the Caprivi area,
South African Press Association reported.
	   The strip runs along Botswana's northern border, dividing
Botswana from Angola and Zambia to the north. It touches Zimbabwe
on the east.
	   The influx of Namibians has contributed to tensions between
Botswana and Namibia, two fairly stable countries in southern
Africa.
	   Botswana has declined to send them back, instead urging them to
return voluntarily.
	   ``We hope the threat of persecution is over, and that these
latest arrivals are people rejoining their families and not
activists,'' Sesinyi said. ``We know the Caprivi movement split
many families.''
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A special corruption
investigator is poised to launch a probe of four South African
banks over government bailouts, his spokesman said Monday.
	   Judge Willem Heath, who heads a special corruption unit, has
asked the government permission to pursue the case against the
banks, said spokesman Guy Rich.
	   Information about the bailouts was uncovered during a
longstanding probe of a 1.5 billion rand (dlrs 263 million) bailout
of the ailing Bankorp group in 1990, Rich said. The bailout money
came from South Africa's Reserve Bank.
	   ABSA, one of the nation's largest banks, bought the Bankorp
group in 1992.
	   Rich said he could not name the four banks or give the amount
involved pending permission to proceed from the Cabinet, which must
approve investigations by the Heath unit.
	   Investigators must hear another witness and then sift through a
``large amount of information'' before deciding to refer the
Bankorp case to a special tribunal. The tribunal could then sue to
recover the money.
	   The Sunday Independent reported that the 1.5 billion rand
Bankorp bailout money was invested in government stock and placed
on deposit with the Reserve Bank.
	   The money earned interest of 225 million rand (dlrs 40 million)
a year for five years, the newspaper said.
	   ``We are investigating why it was done, how it was done and
whether or not the money should have been paid back,'' Rich said in
a telephone interview.
	   There was no answer at the office of an ABSA spokesman.

Climate researcher Hans Oeschger dies at 71
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss climate researcher Hans Oeschger
has died after a long illness, newspapers reported Monday. He was
71.
	   Oeschger, born in 1927 in Ottenbach, near Zurich, died Friday,
according to an obituary in the daily Berner Zeitung.
	   After studying physics at the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich, Oeschger in 1955 obtained a doctorate from the University
of Bern. He went on to become a professor at the university, and in
1992 was made professor emeritus of physics.
	   He researched climate changes over thousands of years by
analyzing air bubbles trapped in layers of polar ice in Greenland
and Antarctica.
	   Oeschger's work showed that carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere have increased over the last 200 years. He warned of the
effects of human activity on the planet's climate.
	   He developed a number of methods for extracting data from the
ice, including radiocarbon dating. He also invented the ``Oeschger
counter,'' a device for measuring small quantities of natural
radiation.
	   Oeschger was honored for his work last December by the American
Geophysical Union. In 1996, he received the University of Southern
California's Tyler Prize.
	   A memorial service will take place Wednesday at the Petruskirche
in Bern.

Swiss report on wartime refugee policy delayed again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The publication of a report
investigating Swiss refugee policy during World War II is likely to
be further delayed, the president of the panel compiling it said
Monday.
	   The study by the committee of independent historians set up to
investigate Switzerland's wartime past was originally expected this
fall, but had already been put back to next spring due to the
complexity of the task.
	   ``The report will be published in the course of next year,''
said Jean-Francois Bergier, who chairs the panel.
	   He said it would be difficult to publish it in spring, but
declined to give a new date.
	   The report on refugee policy follows the panel's reports on
Swiss gold dealings with Nazi Germany, published in November and
May.
	   The government-appointed panel of historians based in
Switzerland, the United States and Israel is to study other aspects
of Switzerland's wartime past. It aims to produce a final report on
all its investigations in 2001.
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied
Italy, wartime Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews. But it
turned away an equal number, many of them to a certain death.

Former top official says 1999 budget is ``phoney''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former top government official on Monday
assailed the Cabinet's budget for next year as a ``phoney''
document that would only aggravate Russia's economic crisis.
	   Former First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov said the
unrealistic budget would further fuel inflation and erode the
ruble's value.
	   Fyodorov predicted that the ruble next year would drop by at
least 40 percent from its current level of 21 to the dollar, while
inflation would amount to a minimum of 60 percent, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``There is concern that the situation will get out of hand
within the next few months,'' Fyodorov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar, and forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year _
targets most experts consider unrealistic.
	   Fyodorov said the government's sole response to the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse was ``the banal idea of
printing extra money'' to pay off huge debts.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top officials have
said the government had been careful in printing new cash, for fear
of fueling inflation. They warned, however, that the Cabinet would
have to turn to large-scale money-printing if foreign lenders fail
to release new loans.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have urged
Russia to pass a tenable budget as a key condition for providing
more aid.
	   The government has already factored in dlrs 7.2 billion in
foreign loans, although they may not come. It also expects to pay
only about one half of the dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt
payments maturing next year, although no agreement with creditors
has been reached yet.
	   Fyodorov called the budget a ``fiction'' and criticized the
parliament for giving it a quick initial approval last week. ``The
irresponsibility of parliament in passing the draft budget in first
reading is obvious,'' he said.
	   Government statistics, released on Monday, underscored the depth
of Russia's crisis.
	   Imports are likely to decrease by 25 percent this year compared
to 1997, Russian customs chief Valery Draganov said at a news
conference.
	   Imports fell drastically as the ruble's devaluation has made
them increasingly expensive and unaffordable for many Russians.
Exports also have fallen by 17 percent, mostly due to the decrease
in world prices for oil, Russia's main export item.
	   Russia's Gross Domestic Product appears to have fallen deeper
than expected. The GDP fell by 3.3 percent during the first nine
months of the year, instead of 3 percent as reported earlier, the
State Statistics Committee said.

Bodies of foreign hostages to be handed over to Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with bodies to be flown to Britain on Tuesday, graf
3. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A convoy bearing the bodies of four foreigners who
were beheaded in Chechnya earlier this month left Monday for the
nearby country of Azerbaijan, where the bodies were to be handed
over to British envoys, a news report said.
	   The convoy of medical vehicles, accompanied by Chechnya's Deputy
Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev and Deputy Prosecutor General
Magomed Magomadov, was to travel across the Russian region of
Dagestan, which separates Chechnya and Azerbaijan.
	   The handover was set to take place in the Azerbaijani capital,
Baku, on Tuesday, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news
agency. The bodies were to be flown to Britain the same morning,
Interfax reported.
	   The handover was originally planned for Monday, but appeared to
have been delayed by the sides' disagreement on where it should
take place.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock,
said Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian
capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said the
separatist republic considered the proposal ``unacceptable'' and
wanted the bodies to be handed over in Azerbaijan, Interfax
reported.
	   Chechnya, which had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from
Russia, adamantly tries to assert its independence from Moscow. No
country has recognized its sovereignty.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday evening in the
village of Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital,
Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday,
according to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   British officials confirmed that the bodies had been identified
by Chechen experts. But Britain has been unable yet to get an
independent confirmation of their identity, Haddock said, according
to Interfax.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   A mourning service for the four was held Monday in the church of
St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly
Muslim Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since Chechnya's independence war ended.

Autopsy shows Czech player died of acute heart failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRAUBING, Germany (AP) _ Preliminary autopsy results show a
36-year-old Czech player who collapsed during a weekend game
against Straubing died of acute heart failure, police said Monday.
	   Juroslaw Hauer of the Selb ice hockey team collapsed on the ice
Sunday evening close to the end of the first period, said police in
Straubing, about 100 kilometers (63 miles) northeast of Munich.
	   He died despite immediate attempts by club doctors to revive him
and intensive treatment by an emergency doctor for more than an
hour in the locker room of the Straubing club.
	   According to police, the autopsy results thus far show Hauer was
the victim of so-called heart still-stand, traceable to previous
damage to the left heart chamber from a heart muscle infection.
	   Toxicology tests were still being completed, a police statement
said.
	   The Straubing prosecutor's office is investigating the death.
	   Both first division South teams expressed sadness and shock at
the death and canceled games scheduled for Tuesday.

Cypriot president leaves for crucial missile talks in Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides left
for Athens Monday for talks on the deployment of Russian missiles
in Cyprus, an issue likely to affect the survival of his
government.
	   The Socialist EDEK party, which holds the ministries of defense
and education in Clerides' cabinet, has warned that it will
withdraw from the government if the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
are not deployed as planned.
	   Other opposition parties maintain Clerides should himself
resign, following his promise to do so if the missiles fail to
arrive.
	   Clerides refused to make any comments to reporters before
leaving Cyprus, saying he will only speak to the media after
briefing the policy-making Greek Cypriot National Council on his
return from Athens Wednesday.
	   He previously maintained that he would agree to the cancellation
of the deployment of the missiles only if Turkey accepted his
demilitarization proposal, or if there was progress in the
U.N.-sponsored talks for the reunification of the island.
	   Clerides' decision to order the missiles two years ago has
raised tension on the war-divided island, with Turkey threatening
to take military action to stop their deployment.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously last week
called for a reduction of weapons and troops in Cyprus and the
resumption of the talks.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded after a
short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Greece, which has a joint defense agreement with Cyprus, has
made it clear that it is against the deployment of the missiles in
Cyprus _ to avoid a clash with Turkey, a fellow NATO ally. One
proposal being considered by Greece is the deployment of the
missiles on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, however, has said that
Greece will support Cyprus if it decides to go ahead with the
deployment, expected in the next few weeks.

NBA casts big shadow over this year's Euro all-star game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ If the NBA lockout does wipe out the whole season
as threatened, then Wednesday's European All-Star contest could be
the best ball played on the planet this term.
	   The rosters are full of former NBA players like Pedrag
Danilovic, long-time Boston Celtic Dino Radja, one-time Laker David
Rivers plus some new faces that could appear in the big show in the
near future.
	   ``There's nobody hear that couldn't play in the NBA,'' said
Svetislav Pesic, coach of the West team.
	   If talk of the NBA always exists when the top European players
gather, then this year the world's top basketball league casts a
particularly big shadow at the all-star game.
	   FIBA, European basketball's governing body, is experimenting
during the game with rules like the 24-second clock that will bring
it closer to the American version.
	   There's also a buzz about NBA players who may try to bolt to a
top European club because of the owner-players wrangle.
	   A number of the big European clubs are searching for a good
foreigner to beef up their team for the European playoffs. But the
official cancellation of the NBA season could come too late.
	   The FIBA deadline to sign a player that can suit up for the Euro
League, the continent's premier competition, is Jan. 4 -- three
days before NBA commissioner David Stern has said he will cancel
the whole season if the lockout isn't resolved.
	   Italy's Kinder Bologna, the Euro League winner last season, is
one of the clubs scrambling to find a top foreign player as a
running mate to Danilovic, the former Miami Heat player.
	   ``We want those (NBA) players, but we can't wait. They would
have to come now,'' said Roberto Brunamonti, club vice-president.
	   The only NBA products that could legally come to Europe now _
although some NBA players are mounting a challenge to this in court
_ are free agents or players that haven't signed a contract,
according to the agreement between USA basketball and FIBA.
	   But that does include a few big names like the NBA's top draft
pick, Michael Olowokandi, and former Portland Trailblazer's center
Arvydas Sabonis.
	   The big center, long a dominant player in Europe before
departing for the NBA, has already agreed to terms with Zalgiris of
Kaunas in his homeland of Lithuania.
	   There had also been hopes European basketball could seize on the
NBA problems to popularize its home product. In many parts of
Europe, the names of Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal still
possess far more magic than the local stars.
	   But the bonus from the lack of NBA games hasn't appeared to
materialize. FIBA still hasn't found a pan-European TV station that
will broadcast the contest across the continent.
	   ``It's a real sad story for everyone,'' said FIBA spokesman
Marcos Beltra. ``It's sad because the NBA helps promote the game,
on the other hand, this could be good exposure for our game. But it
doesn't look like this is the case.''
	   FIBA is particularly miffed that the third edition of the
all-star game won't be broadcast live anywhere in Germany, Europe's
biggest market and where the central offices of the organization
are located.
	   The new rules that will be used at the all-star game include the
24-second clock, more TV timeouts and playing four quarters of 10
minutes, instead of two halves.
	   The European game, like its NBA cousin, has suffered in recent
years from physcial defensive play. The new rules are designed to
promote a more wide-open show.
	   They also happen to bring the European game closer to the
NBA-style show.
	   ``We shouldn't talk about the NBA or FIBA, but globalization of
the game,'' said Beltra. ``This is an approach to get both worlds
together.

Russian foreign minister blames Albanians for Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians are primarily to blame for the
most recent outbreak of violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo,
Russia's foreign minister charged Monday.
	   ``The blame lies with those who provoked these conflicts _ first
of all the Kosovo Albanians, or, to be more exact, extremists and
separatists,'' Igor Ivanov said during a news briefing, Interfax
reported.
	   Fourteen people have died during four days of clashes in Kosovo
that began with an offensive by Serbian forces north of the
provincial capital of Pristina.
	   Russia has long sided with Serbs in the conflict in the
predominantly Albanian province.
	   Ivanov accused ``terrorists and separatists'' of provoking
conflict to derail peace negotiations in Kosovo. Serbs refer to
Albanian rebels as terrorists.
	   ``Their aim is clear: that Kosovo secede from Yugoslavia,''
Ivanov said. ``Russia and most of the international community
oppose this.''

Iran warns against foreign intervention in Caspian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami urged the
Caspian Sea nations Monday to steer clear of foreign intervention
in the development of their resources, the official news agency
reported.
	   The president's words were apparently aimed at the United
States, which has been lobbying hard for the construction of an oil
pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey.
	   Iran has proposed an alternative route for transporting Caspian
Sea oil that would be cheaper than the Turkish route. But the
United States is strongly opposed to the Iranian route for
political reasons.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency said that during a meeting with
the speaker of the Azerbaijani parliament, Murtuz Aleskerov,
Khatami said the states of the former Soviet Union had much to lose
from foreign intervention.
	   ``The good of the region should be provided by the regional
countries themselves, not by those coming from outside who place
their interests above those of the regional states,'' Khatami said.
	   The Azerbaijani government will play a major role in the
decision on the building of the Turkish-bound pipeline, which is
expected shortly.
	   Khatami also called for reaching a consensus among the Caspian
Sea states on the framework for the exploitation of the sea's
minerals. He reiterated that all five countries _ Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Russia and Iran _ should receive a fair
share of its resources.
	   Of the five nations bordering the Caspian, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan want the sea to be divided into
national sectors as they have oil resources near their shores.
	   But Russia and Iran, which have little or no oil near their
coasts, want the sea's resources to be shared by all.

	   STRAUBING, Germany (AP) _ Preliminary autopsy results show a
36-year-old Czech player who collapsed during a weekend game
against Straubing died of acute heart failure, police said Monday.
	   Juroslaw Hauer of the Selb ice hockey team collapsed on the ice
Sunday evening close to the end of the first period, said police in
Straubing, about 100 kilometers (63 miles) northeast of Munich.
	   He died despite attempts by club doctors to revive him and
intensive treatment by an emergency doctor for more than an hour in
the locker room of the Straubing club.
	   According to police, preliminary autopsy results show Hauer
suffered heart failure caused by earlier heart damage from an
infection.
	   Toxicology tests were still being completed, a police statement
said.
	   The Straubing prosecutor's office is investigating the death.
	   Both first division South teams expressed sadness and shock at
the death and canceled games scheduled for Tuesday.

Iraq says warplanes attack, four soldiers killed

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Western warplanes fired missiles Monday at
an Iraqi air defense site in the north, killing four Iraqi
soldiers, the government said in a statement.
	   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said U.S.
warplanes fired on an Iraqi target Monday in response to ``an act
of aggression'' against American aircraft.
	   The incident happened while U.S. fighter planes were enforcing a
``no-fly'' zone in northern Iraq, said Bridges. ``It was an act of
self defense,'' he added.
	   A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said American forces will continue to enforce no-fly
zones and ``take protective actions to protect our pilots.''
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
The zone was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after their
failed uprising against the Iraqi regime.
	   A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense said its planes
were not involved in the incident Monday. He was speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Seven other soldiers were injured and Iraqi air defenses fired
back in response, forcing the warplanes to flee, according to the
statement, which was attributed to an unnamed military spokesman
and distributed by the Information Ministry.
	   The casualties were the first reported by Iraq since a four-day
bombing campaign by American and British forces ended Dec. 19. Iraq
said 62 soldiers and at least 40 civilians died in those
airstrikes. It never gave a final civilian casualty count.
	   ``The murderers and criminals returned once again and violated
our national airspace,'' Monday's statement said. It added that
``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace at 10:25 a.m.
(0725 GMT) from Turkey.
	   Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with valor and forced them
to flee to their bases of evil and aggression in Turkey,'' the
statement said.
	   The statement said another wave of the planes entered Iraq at
1:37 p.m. (1037 GMT) and ``fired criminal missiles against one of
our sites in the area.''
	   These missiles, it said, killed four soldiers and wounded seven.
The statement was distributed to reporters by the Information
Ministry.
	   Earlier Monday, Iraq's trade minister said the country has no
immediate plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who help
distribute supplies to Iraqis under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program.
	   But Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said the two-year-old program was a
temporary measure and could not substitute for meeting Iraq's
demand of lifting U.N. sanctions, which limit its oil exports.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export
oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months _ when it expires in
May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq rejected continuation
of the oil-for-food program.
	   The program, which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to
export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicines for the 22
million Iraqis who have been hard hit by the sanctions.
	   In his remarks to APTN Sunday, Saleh set no date for expelling
the humanitarian workers, but complained that too little of the
money from the sale of oil went to the Iraqi people and too much to
administration.
	   On Monday, however, he said that the 400 U.N. workers
supervising the program would remain in Iraq as long as the program
continues.
	   U.N. workers monitor the program to ensure that the Iraqi
government does not divert any of the money for its own purposes.
	   Though Iraq desperately needs the goods, it has long feared the
program makes it easier for the world to allow the sanctions to
continue.
	   The U.N. sanctions _ which ban air travel to and from the
country, limit oil sales and bar most other financial transactions
_ cannot be lifted until the U.N. weapons inspectors certify that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Also Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for a
quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting
sanctions and again warned the United States against using force.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Lebanese bank has bought the private
Jordanian bank, Middle East Investment Bank, it was announced
Monday.
	   Societe General Libanaise European Bank will own 51 percent of
MEIB and increase its capital to 22 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs
31 million) from Jan. 1, the chairman of MEIB, Ali Hamdi Mango,
told the Associated Press.
	   Mango described the deal as a ``partnership agreement,'' but the
Societe General's effective take-over of MEIB is confirmed by the
fact that the Jordanian bank will change its name to Societe
General- Jordan.
	   Societe General will take control of its Jordanian subsidiary's
management for eight years, Mango said. After 2007, the management
will return to Jordanian hands.
	   The deal has its origins in the Jordanian Central Bank's
instruction to local banks to increase their capital to 20 million
dinars (dlrs 28 million) by 1999.
	   Owned by private shareholders, MEIB had a capital of 10 million
dinars (dlrs 14 million).
	   Banking sources said that Societe General Libanaise, which is 50
percent owned by Societe General of France, has bought the Jordan
bank as part of its strategy to expand its presence in the
Jordanian and Palestinian market in line with the regional peace
process.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's foreign investments are worth about 25
percent more than previously thought, a local newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Legislators who attended a meeting Sunday of the parliament's
financial and economic committee were told the assets of the Kuwait
Investment Authority were worth 15 billion dinars (dlrs 49.66
billion), the newspaper Al-Watan said.
	   Previously, the assets were thought to be worth dlrs 40 billion.
	   The report could not be confirmed as neither the KIA, which
manages the government's empire of foreign investments, nor the
Finance Ministry ever discloses the total value of the authority's
assets.
	   The KIA's funds are seen as a source of income for future
generations when oil, the backbone of Kuwait's economy, runs out.
	   The government has recently taken to using the KIA funds to
bridge its budget deficits.
	   The newspaper said that such a move was discussed at Sunday's
meeting, the newspaper said.
	   Because of low oil prices, Kuwait expects its net deficit to
reach more than 2.1 billion dinars (dlrs 6.95 billion) in the
current fiscal year that started July 1.
	   ____
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A Sudanese daily has put together a
petition to urge the government to lower the price of newspapers.
	   The editor-in-chief of Al-Wifaq newspaper, Ahmed Mudathir, told
the Associated Press on Monday that his company believed the
recently raised price would ``shrink the political awareness of our
people.''
	   Earlier this year, the Sudanese Council of Press and
Publications raised the price from 250 Sudanese pounds (11 U.S.
cents) to 400 Sudanese pounds (17 U.S. cents) and ordered the
newspapers to expand from eight pages to 12.
	   Most of the papers represented on the council are owned by, or
support, the military-backed government of Omar el-Bashir.
	   The new price means that a person who buys a newspaper every day
would spend 12,000 pounds (dlrs 5) in a month, which is equivalent
to almost 20 percent of the average worker's salary.
	   The petition calls on el-Bashir to order a reduction in the
price and page numbers ``to respect the rights of poor people to
read and receive political enlightenment.''
	   Mudathir, whose paper has expanded to 12 pages but still sells
for 250 pounds (11 U.S. cents), said that 115 influential persons
and low-income readers have signed the petition.
	   It will be presented to the president on Tuesday, he said.

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China
will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to fly over
the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world
flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
	   The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it postponed its
attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure its rivals,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson
and Per Lindstrand to respect previously agreed conditions.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and
is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard
and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry
spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
	   But even if China gives the go-ahead, the team said, weather
conditions mean the balloon can't launch from the alpine village of
Chateau d'Oex before Saturday.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The son of the Likud party's first prime
minister, Menachem Begin, and a staunch opponent of the
land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians, announced Monday
that he is breaking away from the party to run for prime minister.
	   Benjamin Begin, a 56-year-old geologist, served as science
minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but
quit the Cabinet after Netanyahu agreed to pull troops out of the
West Bank town of Hebron in January 1997.
	   His father, a founder of the hard-line Likud, set the precedent
of ceding territory with the return of the Sinai peninsula to Egypt
from 1978-82. The elder Begin, who died in 1992, had committed to
granting Palestinians a limited version of autonomy, but with a
continued Israeli military presence throughout the West Bank.
	   Although Begin's chances of becoming prime minister are remote,
he could weaken Netanyahu by splitting the hard-line vote and
forcing a second round.
	   In such a case, most hard-line groups would support Netanyahu
against a centrist or liberal candidate as the ``lesser evil,''
said Hanan Porat, a legislator from the National Religious Party.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
also running for prime minister on a centrist slate. Two senior
Likud figures and members of Netanyahu's Cabinet, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are
debating whether to leave the party.
	   Netanyahu denied that support for him within his party was
collapsing. ``The party is very solid and very unified around the
direction we have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he
said.
	   Yet on Monday, Netanyahu's government failed to garner enough
legislators to pass an ancillary bill necessary to allow passage of
a budget bill. Two members of the coalition abstained and others _
including senior Likud figures _ were absent from the chamber.
	   Legislators from Likud and the opposition Labor Party failed
Monday to reach agreement on a date for the elections. Labor
proposed May 11, and Likud suggested May 25. More meetings were
scheduled to try to reach a compromise by Tuesday.
	   President Ezer Weizman met with Netanyahu and opposition leader
Ehud Barak to push for elections at the earliest date possible.
	   It appeared unlikely that elections would be held before May 4,
the date by which Israel and the Palestinian Authority were to have
reached a permanent peace accord.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that day.
	   However, a Palestinian negotiator suggested Monday that Arafat
would not go through with the plan if such a declaration would help
Netanyahu get re-elected. The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu
of making excuses to get out of promises he made to them in peace
agreements.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour, a
Palestinian negotiator, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are looking for a peace partner, and at the moment there is
no Israeli peace partner,'' Asfour said, referring to the Netanyahu
government.
	   The Wye River peace agreement under which Israel was to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank by January has been suspended
since parliamentary support for Netanyahu collapsed last week.
	   During a Likud Central Committee meeting Sunday night, Netanyahu
said Labor was colluding with Arafat in order to topple him.
Netanyahu appeared confident and cheerful, a stark contrast to his
agonized equivocation last week. His apparent weakness unleashed a
week of furious speculation that he might not survive even as a
leader of the Likud.
	   That ended Sunday when Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, his chief
rival, decided to bow out after failing to enlist the support of
Mordechai.
	   The only remaining challenger is Uzi Landau, 55, the hard-line
chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee. Landau is unlikely to win, and has indicated he knows
it. He hopes to use his bid to force Netanyahu to make hard-line
pledges.

U.S. top monitor in Kosovo hopeful fighting can be contained

Albanian parliament seeks NATO action &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With both sides now respecting a
cease-fire, U.N. officials tried Monday to help civilians who fled
four days of fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in
northern Kosovo which left at least 14 people dead.
	   No clashes were reported Monday in the Serbian province,
according to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Jorgen Grunnet.
	   Grunnet said both sides were generally respecting a truce
negotiated Sunday by the American head of the OSCE peace
verification force, William Walker, which ended clashes around
Podujevo, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of here.
	   The fighting put new strains on an already fragile peace accord
negotiated in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke which ended seven months of fighting.
	   In neighboring Albania, the country's parliament called Monday
for NATO to intervene in Kosovo, saying that was the only way to
prevent a humanitarian disaster and open the way to a ``political
solution.''
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee
agency, Maki Shinohara, said humanitarian workers were trying to
locate up to 5,000 civilians who were believed to have fled
villages caught up in the fighting.
	   Shinohara said teams from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees had found three villages around Podujevo empty except for
fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   She said the civilians, mostly ethnic Albanians, had fled into
the snow-covered hills to escape the fighting, which broke out
Christmas Eve when Serb forces attacked rebel strongholds searching
for the killers of a Serb policeman.
	   ``So far the operations are normal,'' she said. ``We're sending
our convoys into other areas that we could reach ... We're not
being too optimistic but we do hope the situation will stabilize.''
	   She said last week's fighting was ``definitely ... a setback''
to efforts to restore peace to the province, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are battling for independence from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group reported Monday that a KLA
fighter wounded in the clashes Sunday had died, bringing the
four-day death toll to at least 14.
	   A spokesman for the top ethnic Albanian politician in Kosovo
warned that only a NATO military intervention could prevent further
fighting in the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the
overwhelming majority.
	   But Walker, head of the OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission,
called the fighting ``sporadic'' and said both sides ``are being
relatively cautious.''
	   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Ignor Ivanov blamed the
ethnic Albanians for provoking the violence to derail negotiations
on the province's longterm future.
	   ``The blame lies with those who provoked these conflicts _ first
of all the Kosovo Albanians, or, to be more exact, extremists and
separatists,'' Ivanov said during a news briefing, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Russia has long sided with Serbs in the conflict in the
predominantly Albanian province.
	   Despite the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes, neither side has shown a willingness to back off from
widely differing goals for the province.
	   The KLA insists on independence, while the Serbian government
says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   ``There is no hand in Serbia which would sign secession or
displacement of Kosovo from Serbia's constitutional order,''
Serbian Vice Premier Milovan Bojic was quoted Monday by the
government's Tanjug news agency.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began an
offensive against the rebels in February, and about 300,000 have
been driven from their homes.

SAfrican officials say faulty condoms stopped by new standards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Reacting to a report that
millions of substandard condoms have been imported into South
Africa, health officials on Monday said a new quality control
system was implemented months ago.
	   The Department of Health said it adopted World Health
Organization standards for testing condoms in August.
	   Officials decided to release the information Monday to stem
damage to a public education program that condoms are one of the
best ways to prevent the spread of HIV infections, said Dr. David
Coetzee, head of the department's HIV and AIDs control program.
	   ``We are very concerned'' about the damage, he said in a
telephone interview.
	   South Africa has one of the fastest-growing rates of HIV
infection in the world.
	   Johannesburg's Business Day newspaper reported on Monday that
South Africa did not adequately test imported condoms and had sent
back to an Indian manufacturer at least 4 million faulty condoms
earlier this year.
	   Coetzee said he knew of only 1 million condoms that had been
recalled. Imbeco, the Pretoria-based company that handles many of
the imports, was closed for business during the holiday period.
	   Since 1992, the Health Department has distributed for free about
95 percent of the condoms used in the country.
	   For next year, the department has ordered 140 million condoms,
which are being subjected to WHO standardized testing by the Bureau
of Standards, Coetzee said. There are about 12 million adult males
in South Africa.
	   The Bureau of Standards was also closed on Monday.
	   South Africa is a late comer to the AIDS epidemic after decades
of geographic isolation during apartheid. But it is fast catching
up with its neighbors. An estimated 3.2 million South Africans are
HIV positive, or about 12 to 14 percent of adults.
	   Until August, government-distributed condoms were subjected to
random testing, but a rigorous lot by lot testing of every batch
was not done, Coetzee said.
	   ``There have been times when condom testing was not as good as
what it should have been,'' Coetzee said.
	   He said the shortcomings prompted an investigation that started
in 1997 and culminated with the August 1998 adoption of more
stringent standards, which will apply to the next batch of imports.
	   ``In the future, every single batch distributed to South Africa
will be tested and that will be the major difference,'' Coetzee
said.
	   Answering criticism that plastic-wrapping failed to protect
latex condoms from heat degeneration, Coetzee said foil wrappers
were part of the new requirements.
	   He said new controls for storing and transporting condoms at
proper temperatures would also be introduced next year.

South Africans grab back the initiative against WIndies cricketers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with play ending for day; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa snatched the initiative
back as the West Indies crumbled to 246 for eight wickets before
bad light halted play early on the third day of the third test at
Kingsmead Monday.
	   A controversial catch dismissed Carl Hooper for two. The West
Indian vice-captain got an inside edge to Shaun Pollock, and
wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, diving to his left, picked up the ball
low down and clutched it to his body.
	   Hooper asked Boucher for confirmation of the fairness of the
catch, and, when he received it, walked. Later, television replays
suggested the ball may have hit the ground just as Boucher gloved
it.
	   The visitors now lead by just 132 runs with only two second
innings wickets still standing.
	   Herschelle Gibbs was the man who put the skids under the
tourists, taking two brilliant catches to revive the South
Africans, who had been put to the sword by a 160-run partnership
between Brian Lara (79) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (75).
	   Gibbs dove full-length to his left at square leg to hold onto a
low chance from Lara, who was playing his first pull shot of a
disciplined innings. David Terbrugge was the bowler, and it gave
him Lara's wicket for the second time in the match.
	   As seems to happen so often when one batsmen in a major
partnership is dismissed, Chanderpaul went soon afterwards,
spooning a simple caught-and-bowled chance back to Pollock.
	   Later, even more astonishingly, Gibbs turned and dived
full-length to hold a one-handed chance off Darren Ganga's mistimed
pull off Pollock, which had floated over the fielder's head.
	   It was his third catch in the innings, and he took another off
Pollock's bowling to get rid of Franklyn Rose, who skied a drive to
mid-on.
	   Pollock, in a spell of 11.5 overs, took four wickets for 27 runs
to be the best of the South African bowlers. As usual, the South
African pace battery was impressive, supporting each other
throughout. Allan Donald, in dismissing Rawl Lewis for a duck, took
his 250th test wicket in his 50th test, just two tests more than it
took the great Australian Dennis Lillee to reach the mark.
	   The West Indians seemed on the way to setting South Africa a
challenging target as they took their second inning score to 193
for two wickets at tea.
	   They led South Africa by 79 runs, and captain Lara seemed to
have finally come good on a tour characterised so far by lack of
application by the batsmen.
	   Lara and Chanderpaul batted through the first session of the
series, which did not see a wicket fall, scoring 102 runs between
them.
	   Although it was Chanderpaul who scored more freely than his
captain during the session, it was the discipline of Lara which was
impressive. He manfully resisted the urge to pull or hook each time
a short-pitched ball was presented to him, avoiding a stroke which
led to his downfall three times in the tests.
	   In the face of what could have become a run glut, the South
African bowlers remained disciplined and aggressive. Donald clipped
Lara's bat with a bouncer, and the ball could easily have flown to
the slip cordon.
	   Pat Symcox was unlucky to have an appeal for a pad-bat catch at
silly mid-off turned down. Replays showed Lara had definitely
gloved the ball. New man Terbrugge continued to impress with his
line and length, and bowled three consecutive maidens just
	   before tea.
	   Lara led the charge to try to drag his team back into the match
as they took lunch on 91 for two. Earlier, South Africa were
dismissed for 312, the first time either side has scored in excess
of 300 in this series.
	   This gave the hosts a 114-run lead, which was all but wiped out
by some sparkling strokeplay by Lara on 32 not out, and a typically
gritty undefeated 20 by Chanderpaul. Lara has looked in sublime
form, playing some breathtaking cover drives off all the bowlers.
	   Donald started the innings with pace and hostility, and he was
the first to strike. He removed Philo Wallace for one. Pollock was
unlucky to have Junior Murray caught off a no-ball, but the
wicketkeeper retreaded into an opening batsman was caught pulling
once too often, off the first ball of Jacques Kallis' first spell
of the second innings.
	   In dismissing South Africa in just 4.4 overs in the morning, and
ridding themselves of Jonty Rhodes for 87 and an obstinate Donald
for 13, the West Indies played themselves back into the match
especially with Lara looking so threatening.

Bulgaria's premier, former king meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's premier met Monday with its
former king, who is spending Christmas holidays in his homeland for
the first time after nearly 53 years abroad.
	   Simeon II and Premier Ivan Kostov dined at a government
residence, the state news agency BTA reported. No reporters were
allowed in on Simeon's request, the agency added.
	   Last Thursday Bulgaria's top prosecutor asked the Constitutional
Court to invalidate a 1946 referendum that abolished monarchy. It
is nor clear when the 12-judge panel will rule. Although Simeon has
been greeted enthusiastically on previous visits home, support for
a return to the monarchy is believed relatively small.
	   The government press office said that Kostov informed Simeon
about maintenance costs of two palaces, three hunting villas and
two country houses that the monarch is to be restored ownership of.
	   No figures of the costs were released. All places have served as
government residences since their nationalization by the
communists.
	   Simeon, a businessman, is expected to visit all of his former
houses and palaces before returning home to Madrid January 7.
	   Simeon, his wife and one of their five children are currently
staying at one of claimed palaces, Czarska Bistrica, in the alpine
Rila mountain, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Sofia.
	   Simeon acceded to the throne at the age of 6 in 1943, when his
father, Boris III, died, shortly after allying Bulgaria with Nazi
Germany.
	   He reigned under regencies until the referendum called by the
communists, whom the Soviet army installed in 1944. The ballot is
widely suspected of being rigged.

Death threats force Cameroon editor to flee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ The editor of a high profile newspaper
critical of the government has fled the country following of series
of death threats, the twice-weekly newspaper's publisher said
Monday.
	   Nyemb Popoli, editor-in-chief and political cartoonist for the
French-language Messenger, left the country after he was told he
would be hacked to death with a machete knife, said Pius Njawe, the
publisher of the Messenger.
	   Njawe was recently released early from prison, where he was
serving a two-year jail term for reporting that Cameroon's
President Paul Biya had a bad heart.
	   The Messenger has been the frequent target of government
reprisals for critical reporting, raising concerns that the threats
against Popoli may have links to the government.
	   Njawe said Popoli has been ``accused of being ridiculing top
state officials.''
	   Journalists are frequently harassed in Cameroon, where prominent
reporters and editors have been imprisoned for publishing
dispatches critical of the government.
	   The British Broadcasting Corp.'s former correspondent,
Cameroonian journalist Emmanuel Wotany, left the country in 1997
after he was attacked by unidentified assailants in his home.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli military court sentenced a
Palestinian to life imprisonment Monday for driving two suicide
bombers to a busy intersection, where they killed another 22
people.
	   On Jan. 22, 1995 _ a Sunday _ Abdel Halim Balbisy drove the
suicide bombers to the Beit Lid intersection north of Tel Aviv
where they blew themselves up, minutes apart, the court said.
	   The junction is heavily used by soldiers, and is especially
crowded Sunday mornings, when troops are returning from weekends at

Italian star says world championships are her priority
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Saying the 1999 World Ski Championships
were her priority, Deborah Compagnoni said Monday she was going to
skip some World Cup races next month to preserve her form and her
fragile knees for the February events in Vail, Colorado.
	   The Italian ski star, a triple Olympic and world champion, is
nursing a swollen knee and has already skipped two gate events in
Semmering, Austria.
	   She hurt her right knee, already operated on twice, in a spill
during a World Cup slalom at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, last week.
	   Compagnoni, winless so far this season, said she planned to
return to action in a giant slalom - her favorite event _ in
Maribor, Slovenia, on Saturday but added she might not start in the
slalom the next day.
	   She has skipped competition in Super-G and downhill races since
1995.
	   ``I must be cautious, I must preserve my health and avoid undue
risks in those races in which I'm not properly trained,'' she said
during a press conference at the site of a men's World Cup
downhill, near her native village of Santa Caterina.
	   ``The World Championships in Vail are my season target,'' she
said.
	   In Colorado, the 28-year-old skier will defend the world slalom
and giant slalom titles captured at Sestriere in 1997.
	   Compagnoni is the most successful Italian woman skier but her
career has often been crippled by injuries and diseases.
	   Her most recent misfortunes included back trouble, which
hampered her preparation for the current ski season. She is
especially short of training in slalom.
	   The only Italian woman skier with a personal trainer and coach,
Compagnoni said she was impressed by the recent strong showing of
Austrian skiers in technical events.
	   Talking about doping _ a major issue in many sports _ Compagnoni
said she did not see any ``abnormal muscular growth'' among women
skiers but urged severe and random anti-doping tests in skiing _
both on blood and urine samples.
	   Compagnoni, who has been a successful model for bras and pasta
advertising recently, also voiced support Monday for a campaign on
behalf of Afghan women.

Former top official says 1999 budget is ``phony''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS lead and headline to CORRECT spelling of phony &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former top government official on Monday
assailed the Cabinet's budget for next year as a ``phony'' document
that would only aggravate Russia's economic crisis.
	   Former First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov said the
unrealistic budget would further fuel inflation and erode the
ruble's value.
	   Fyodorov predicted that the ruble next year would drop by at
least 40 percent from its current level of 21 to the dollar, while
inflation would amount to a minimum of 60 percent, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``There is concern that the situation will get out of hand
within the next few months,'' Fyodorov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar, and forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year _
targets most experts consider unrealistic.
	   Fyodorov said the government's sole response to the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse was ``the banal idea of
printing extra money'' to pay off huge debts.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top officials have
said the government had been careful in printing new cash, for fear
of fueling inflation. They warned, however, that the Cabinet would
have to turn to large-scale money-printing if foreign lenders fail
to release new loans.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have urged
Russia to pass a tenable budget as a key condition for providing
more aid.
	   The government has already factored in dlrs 7.2 billion in
foreign loans, although they may not come. It also expects to pay
only about one half of the dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt
payments maturing next year, although no agreement with creditors
has been reached yet.
	   Fyodorov called the budget a ``fiction'' and criticized the
parliament for giving it a quick initial approval last week. ``The
irresponsibility of parliament in passing the draft budget in first
reading is obvious,'' he said.
	   Government statistics, released on Monday, underscored the depth
of Russia's crisis.
	   Imports are likely to decrease by 25 percent this year compared
to 1997, Russian customs chief Valery Draganov said at a news
conference.
	   Imports fell drastically as the ruble's devaluation has made
them increasingly expensive and unaffordable for many Russians.
Exports also have fallen by 17 percent, mostly due to the decrease
in world prices for oil, Russia's main export item.
	   Russia's Gross Domestic Product appears to have fallen deeper
than expected. The GDP fell by 3.3 percent during the first nine
months of the year, instead of 3 percent as reported earlier, the
State Statistics Committee said.

Son of Menachem Begin announces he is running for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS first reference to Benjamin Begin; UPDATES throughout
with background, quotes and failure to pass ancillary budget bill &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The son of the Likud party's first prime
minister, Menachem Begin, and a staunch opponent of the
land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians, announced Monday
that he is breaking away from the party to run for prime minister.
	   Benjamin Begin, a 56-year-old geologist, served as science
minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, but he
quit the Cabinet after Netanyahu agreed to pull troops out of the
West Bank town of Hebron in January 1997.
	   His father, a founder of the hard-line Likud, set the precedent
of ceding territory with the return of the Sinai peninsula to Egypt
from 1978-82. Israel had captured the peninsula in the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   The elder Begin, who died in 1992, had committed to granting
Palestinians a limited version of autonomy, but with a continued
Israeli military presence throughout the West Bank.
	   Although Benjamin Begin's chances of becoming prime minister are
remote, he could weaken Netanyahu by splitting the hard-line vote
and forcing a second round.
	   In such a case, most hard-line groups would support Netanyahu
against a centrist or liberal candidate as the ``lesser evil,''
said Hanan Porat, a legislator from the National Religious Party.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
also running for prime minister on a centrist slate. Two senior
Likud figures and members of Netanyahu's Cabinet, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are
debating whether to leave the party.
	   Netanyahu denied that support for him within his party was
collapsing. ``The party is very solid and very unified around the
direction we have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he
said.
	   Yet on Monday, Netanyahu's government failed to garner enough
legislators to pass legislation necessary to allow passage of a
budget bill. Two members of the coalition abstained and others _
including senior Likud figures _ were absent from the chamber.
	   Legislators from Likud and the opposition Labor Party failed
Monday to agree on a date for the elections. Labor proposed May 11,
and Likud suggested May 25. More meetings were scheduled to try to
reach a compromise by Tuesday.
	   President Ezer Weizman met with Netanyahu and opposition leader
Ehud Barak to push for elections at the earliest date possible.
	   But it appeared unlikely that elections would be held before May
4, the date by which Israel and the Palestinian Authority were to
have reached a permanent peace accord.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that day.
	   However, a Palestinian negotiator suggested Monday that Arafat
would not go through with the plan if such a declaration would help
Netanyahu get re-elected. The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu
of making excuses to get out of promises he made to them in peace
agreements.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour, a
Palestinian negotiator, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We are looking for a peace partner, and at the moment there is
no Israeli peace partner,'' Asfour said, referring to the Netanyahu
government.
	   The Wye River peace agreement under which Israel was to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank by January has been suspended
since parliamentary support for Netanyahu collapsed last week.

Angolan rebels deny knowledge of crashed U.N. plane
</HEADLINE>

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The rebel group UNITA said Monday it had
no information about a United Nations-chartered cargo plane that
crashed in an area where rebels and the army are engaged in fierce
fighting.
	   The C-130 aircraft carrying 14 people crashed Saturday at Vila
Nova near the city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles)
southeast of the capital, Luanda, according to the U.N..
	   ``We don't know anything about it,'' UNITA Secretary-general
Paulo Lukamba Gato said by satellite telephone.
	   ``There's heavy fighting in all that area,'' he added.
	   The government says the plane crashed in a UNITA-controlled
area, and the U.N. has made a public appeal for the rebels to
guarantee safe passage for a search and rescue team.
	   Gato said he had not received any request for safe passage from
the U.N. and that he could not comment on the request until it was
presented directly to the UNITA leadership.
	   Gato denied the government's accusation that rebel forces
advancing on Huambo shot down the plane about 10 minutes after it
took off from the city.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N.
colors, and both sides were informed of the flight's schedule
before takeoff, according to the U.N..
	   The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a
Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   The U.N. Observer Mission in Angola, which is monitoring a 1994
peace accord that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels
and the government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting.
	   ``The government broke off dialogue with us, so now we're
talking with weapons,'' Gato said.
	   He said the fighting, which erupted Dec. 4, was ``specially
violent because of the sophisticated weaponry being used.'' He said
he had no information on the number of casualties.
	   The main battles have focussed on the central highland cities of
Huambo and nearby Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east,
which provide a traditional powerbase for UNITA, a Portuguese
acronym for the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop in Kuito said the government-held city
had been relatively calm since heavy shelling by UNITA last week
which reportedly killed some 200 people.
	   ``We are only hearing sporadic fire in the distance,'' Bishop
Jose Nambi said by phone.
	   The government said Monday its forces had knocked out UNITA's
forward artillery position in Ceilunga, a village 15 kilometers (9
miles) north of Kuito, at the weekend and killed 34 UNITA troops.
There was no information on government casualties.
	   The civil war first began after the vast southwest African
country's 1975 independence from Portugal.

Holiday cold takes lives in Russia, Hungary, Poland and Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ December cold has taken the lives of nearly 30
people in Europe during the Christmas holidays.
	   Most were homeless or elderly, but one Scottish teen-ager died
of hypothermia after leaving a party without a coat.
	   In Russia, where hundreds of people die of cold each year, nine
froze to death in Moscow during the past week, raising the number
of such deaths in the capital this winter to 69, city medical
officials said Monday.
	   In addition, 178 people received hospital care for hypothermia
and 30 were treated for frostbite during the same period, the
officials said.
	   Most of those who die this way in Russia are elderly people
living alone or alcoholics who pass out on the street at night.
	   In Hungary, where 30,000 people are homeless, 17 people died
over the Christmas holiday. A few cases involved drunks who fell
asleep before reaching home, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy told The Associated
Press. Temperatures in Hungary have dipped to 16-20 below Celsius
(plus 5 to minus 4 Fahrenheit) in parts of the country since cold
weather set in at the beginning of December.
	   The total dead of cold this winter in Hungary is 76, which is a,
police said.
	   In southeastern Poland, an 86-year-old woman was found lying in
a field Sunday night. The total cold-related deaths for the year is
162 _ most from the severe cold spell that started Nov. 16 and
ended about mid-December.
	   In Scotland, searchers found the body of an 18-year-old dental
nurse who disappeared after a Christmas Eve party in a village near
Perth on Christmas Eve. She had been dressed only in a pants suit
and shirt.
	   A post mortem determined she had died of hypothermia.

Schroeder's New Year's address makes MTV playlist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's first New
Year's address to the nation is sure to be a historic broadcast
Thursday _ for the first time, the music channel MTV plans to carry
it too.
	   MTV will even beat Germany's public stations by airing the
pre-taped address during an afternoon New Year's Eve special,
station officials said Monday.
	   The public stations traditionally broadcast the chancellor's New
Year's speech after their evening news programs.
	   MTV said the decision to run Schroeder's address was a reaction
to the positive response it got to its German election night
coverage in September.
	   MTV also plans to repeat the address in the evening, during its
``Dancefloor Mix'' show.

British electronics giant says merger expected in New Year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As part of Europe's defense integration, Britain's
General Electric Co. PLC said Monday that it will resume merger
talks in the new year with three potential partners, U.S. defense
giant Lockheed Martin, French electronics group Thomson-CSF and
British Aerospace.
	   Company spokesman Peter Craine said that an announcement about
the future of GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. industrial giant
General Electric Co., would be made ``as soon as we have brought
one of our sets of negotiations to a close. It is not entirely
within our hands.''
	   In January, analysts say that defense contractors throughout
Europe's NATO nations are expected to agree a series of
consolidation mergers, following the trend in the United States.
	   ``This is a process which is moving forward quite fast in the
industry. The person who moves first has the most choices,
certainly in Europe,'' said Craine.
	   Earlier this month, newspapers in Britain speculated that GEC
would finally merge with British Aerospace, creating a dlrs 39
billion defense group. Such an alliance would be the first
big-scale union in the European defense industry.
	   On Monday, the London-based Financial Times newspaper quoted
Thomson-CSF chairman as saying that the French government had given
its backing to a merger with Marconi Electronics, GEC's defense
arm, and had agreed to lower its stake in the French company.
	   To maintain flexibility, GEC has said it will consider a merger
with its civil or defense businesses, or both.
	   Marconi Electronics makes computer displays for U.S. F-16
fighters, and the European Tornado fighter-bomber and Eurofighter.
It also has a maritime division that makes torpedoes and sonar. In
1999, the Financial Times said it is forecast to have operating
profits of 430 million pounds (dlrs 690 million) on sales of about
5 billion pounds (dlrs 8 billion).
	   ``I have had intense and successful discussions with the French
government that make me fully convinced that if such a deal is
presented to it conditional upon a significantly reduced government
holding, there will be no problem on its part,'' the newspaper
quoted Denis Ranque as saying.
	   The French government holds a 40 percent share in the company,
the newspaper said, but would reduce this to below 10 percent to
complete a merger with GEC. The newspaper said that in a merger
between the two firms, Thomson, valued at 3.8 billion pounds (dlrs
6.1 billion) would likely be the junior partner.
	   ``The French option still actively under discussion,'' said
Craine.
	   Craine said other firms with which GEC held talks, such as U.S.
defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., could become involved in
talks again.
	   ``Once we get into active negotiations again, we might find the
list changes,'' Craine said.
	   On Dec. 22, GEC said it would separate its civil and defense
businesses, and on the 23 the company announced a 50-50 joint
venture with Italy's Finmeccanica to combine their ground, naval,
missile system and air traffic control activities. The new company
is to be called Alenia Marconi Systems, with annual revenue of
about dlrs 1.7 billion.
	   The companies said the venture will be the major supplier of
missile systems outside the United States.

Two die, four missing in yacht race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; corrects overline to make four missing, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ British sailor Glyn Charles was missing
and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while three others remained missing
in rough seas after nightfall Monday.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles
could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off
Sword of Orion on Sunday night.
	   ``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and
80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it.''
	   Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in
the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th.
	   Two sailors died after gale-force winds and high seas battered
the entrants.
	   Four members from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill were
winched to safety from a life raft before dark Monday.
	   Two more crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a
second life raft late Monday night, but three others who had been
aboard the life raft were still missing.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the life raft,'' a spokesman for
the authority said.
	   The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel
Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New
South Wales state town of Merimbula.
	   The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race
participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
	   Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the
yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free
himself from a safety harness. Their bodies were left on board the
boat but attempts were being made to recover them as soon as
possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. ``He loved
the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race.
Dad simply loved life.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning was one of the four
rescued.
	   ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into
the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned
thing capsized twice on these great seas at night which is bloody
frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard from
Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries on the yacht
Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast
snapped the boat's mast.
	   AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched
to safety in this year's race.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said.
	   ``They've got hand, leg, facial injuries, they really got
pounded yesterday.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of Gabo Island.
	   Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had
hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry
Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell told United States
television in Seattle. ``There was a point I didn't think I was
going to survive.''
	   ``(Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away
from me and I swam to him pretty quickly. I just threw my arms into
the harness and they hoisted me up.''
	   About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the
1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
	   The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's
winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday.

Finnish skier gets Italian award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORMIO, Italy (AP) _ Finland's Henna Karolina Raita on Monday
was awarded the ``Matteo Baumgarten'' prize for her outstanding
results as a skier and as university student.
	   Raita, a 23-year-old from Lathi who won the women's slalom title
in the European Cup, was given the 15 million lire (dlrs 9,400)
award as best skier-student of the year.
	   She was picked by the international jury of the prize, named
after an Italian student-skier of Bormio, the yearly site of a
men's World Cup downhill which will also host the World Cup finals
in 2000.

Kenyan cricket team turns professional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's national cricket team has turned
professional five months ahead of the Cricket World Cup after Kenya
Breweries Ltd. announced an annual sponsorship package Monday of 8
million shillings (dlrs 130,000).
	   ``We shall expect them to play without problems as we start our
World Cup built-up,'' said Jimmy Rayani, chairman of the Kenya
Cricket Association.
	   Cricket officials said some of the money will meet the salaries
of the 21 players and the technical bench, including the coach.
	   The sponsorship deal under Tusker brand beer will last for five
years and will be subject to renegotiation annually.
	   KCA said it will start its World Cup buildup between March 19-27
with a team from Bangladesh, the current International Cricket
Committee trophy holder.
	   In last the World Cup, Kenya upset West Indies by 73 runs. The
East African nation also beat India by 69 runs during the Coca Cola
tournament in India which featured the hosts and Bangladesh.
	   Kenya Breweries, which has reverted to its former name, East
African Breweries, is fighting to stave off competition from South
Africa Breweries, who entered the Kenyan market this year.
	   The Kenyan brewers have invested about dlrs 2.5 million in
soccer and cricket.

New coach appointed for Russia's soccer team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Oleg Romantsev, who resigned two years ago as
coach of Russia's national soccer team, was reappointed to the job
Monday, news reports said.
	   The team has seen a long succession of coaches during the past
few years, with each resigning or getting fired over some
embarrassing loss. Each time, soccer officials have sought to rev
up the team's sluggish performance.
	   Romantsev stepped down in July, 1996, three weeks after the
squad was sent home from the European Championship after the first
round.
	   His successors hardly did better. Russia's last coach, Anatoly
Byshovets, was sacked earlier this month, after just five months in
the job, over Russia's loss to Iceland in European Championship
qualifiers in October.
	   Russia's Soccer Union decided Monday to reappoint Romantsev, 44,
as coach of the national team, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The decline of Russia's soccer performance has been accompanied
by corruption, power struggles and violence that have plagued the
soccer union in recent years.
	   The Russian soccer team has not qualified for the World Cup
since 1994.

Cruzeiro gets last chance at title against Palmeiras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A long and frustrating season for
Cruzeiro finally ends Tuesday when the team faces Palmeiras in the
third and deciding game of soccer's Mercosur Cup.
	   After a grueling schedule of 80 games and heartbreaking losses
in the finals of Brazil's two biggest tournaments, this is
Cruzeiro's last chance to win a major title this year.
	   ``We're in a process of intense physical and psychological
decline,'' Cruzeiro coach Levir Culpi said. ``The players are
starting to lose their edge.''
	   They'll try to hold it together for one more game, long enough
to salvage the elusive title.
	   ``It's sad to think we still have a game to play, two days away
from 1999,'' said midfielder Valdir. ``Ninety more minutes and the
season is over.''
	   It could have been over on Sunday. Cruzeiro, a 2-1 winner in the
first-leg game, needed only a tie to win the first Mercosur Cup.
But Palmeiras came from behind for a 3-1 victory to force a third
game.
	   The momentum now seems to be with Palmeiras, which again will
play before its raucous hometown fans.
	   Eliminated from the Brazilian national championship by Cruzeiro
in the quarterfinals, Palmeiras has worked off the rust from two
weeks of idleness and is again the feared ``Green Machine.''
	   With a star-laden roster and a deadly air game, Palmeiras
shrugged off a quick goal by Cruzeiro and dominated Sunday's game.
All-stars Oseas, Paulo Nunes, Alex and Junior Baiano took turns
bedeviling the Cruzeiro defense.
	   The only doubt for Tuesday is star fullback Cleber, who was
injured Sunday. If he can't play, Aguinaldo or Roque Junior will
start, Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said.
	   Cruzeiro, which sagged visibly in the second half Sunday, also
must find replacements for key starters. Injured fullback and team
captain Wilson Gottardo, who played only one period Sunday, was
listed as doubtful. Playmaker Djair was under examination for a
suspected ankle fracture, while striker Fabio Junior complained of
a twisted knee.
	   A loss on Tuesday would crown a year of near-misses for
Cruzeiro. The team lost the final of the Brazil Cup to Palmeiras
and came up short in a riveting three-game final of the Brazilian
national championship, won by Corinthians.
	   The losses cost Cruzeiro a berth in next year's Libertadores
Cup, which it won in 1997.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (2340 GMT) on Tuesday at
Parque Antartica stadium.

U.S. top monitor in Kosovo hopeful fighting can be contained

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With both sides now respecting a
cease-fire, U.N. officials tried Monday to help civilians who fled
four days of fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in
northern Kosovo which left at least 15 people dead.
	   Thousands more fled into snow-covered hills to escape the
fighting, according to U.N. and ethnic Albanian sources.
	   No clashes were reported Monday in the Serbian province,
according to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Jorgen Grunnet.
	   Grunnet said both sides were generally respecting a truce
negotiated Sunday by the American head of the OSCE peace
verification force, William Walker, which ended clashes around
Podujevo, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of here.
	   The fighting put new strains on an already fragile peace accord
reached Oct. 12 between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting.
	   In neighboring Albania, the country's parliament called Monday
for NATO to intervene in Kosovo, saying that was the only way to
prevent a humanitarian disaster and open the way to a ``political
solution.''
	   And the province's leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, described the situation as ``very difficult and
dangerous.'' He urged the United States and European powers to step
up diplomatic efforts toward a lasting political settlement and
prevent ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serb forces.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by Rugova's party, claimed
15,000 people had been displaced by the fighting, which erupted
Christmas Eve when government forces attacked strongholds of ethnic
Albanian rebels searching for the killers of a Serb policeman.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Maki Shinohara,
estimated the number of displaced people at about 5,000 and said
humanitarian workers were trying to locate them to provide food,
blankets and other supplies.
	   Shinohara said teams from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees had found three villages around Podujevo empty except for
fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``So far the operations are normal,'' she said. ``We're sending
our convoys into other areas that we could reach ... We're not
being too optimistic but we do hope the situation will stabilize.''
	   She said last week's fighting was ``definitely ... a setback''
to efforts to restore peace to the province, where ethnic Albanian
rebels are battling for independence from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   The ethnic Albanian media center said the death toll from the
four days of fighting rose Monday to 15 with the death of a wounded
KLA fighter and the discovery of a civilian's body west of
Podujevo.
	   Despite the violence, Walker, head of the OSCE's Kosovo
Verification Mission, sought to dispel fears that the province was
on the brink of fullscale war. He called the fighting ``sporadic''
and said both sides ``are being relatively cautious.''
	   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Ignor Ivanov blamed the
ethnic Albanians for provoking the violence to derail negotiations
on the province's longterm future.
	   ``The blame lies with those who provoked these conflicts _ first
of all the Kosovo Albanians, or, to be more exact, extremists and
separatists,'' Ivanov said during a news briefing, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Russia has long sided with Serbs in the conflict in the
predominantly Albanian province.
	   Despite the Oct. 12 agreement, which averted the threat of NATO
airstrikes, neither side has shown a willingness to back off from
widely differing goals for the province.
	   The KLA insists on independence, while the Serbian government
says it will never let Kosovo go.
	   ``There is no hand in Serbia which would sign secession or
displacement of Kosovo from Serbia's constitutional order,''
Serbian Vice Premier Milovan Bojic was quoted Monday by the
government's Tanjug news agency.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed since Milosevic began an
offensive against the rebels in February, and about 300,000 have
been driven from their homes.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The government said it paid no ransom
for the release of a Lithuanian businessman who was kidnapped in
Chechnya more than 18 months ago, and finally brought home Monday.
	   Viktoras Grodis, 35, was immediately hospitalized. His health
was described as poor.
	   ``We really did not pay for releasing the businessman,''
Rimantas Sidlauskas of the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Grodis' captors had demanded 100,000 dollars ransom, or more
than the average Lithuanian earns in 36 years. They threatened to
cut off his head and send it to his wife.
	   Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius personally appealed to
Chechen leaders for Grodis' release, but refused to use public
funds for that.

Silver slippers stolen from 18th century image of the baby Jesus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ A thief made off with the silver slippers
of a 250-year-old church image of the baby Jesus during a feet
kissing ritual, news reports said Monday.
	   The slippers, measuring 7 centimeters (2.76 inches) and adorned
with a buckle and two emeralds, were stolen Saturday as worshippers
filed passed the image to kiss its feet in the hermitage of the
Roman Catholic Brotherhood of Our Lady of Charity, the state-owned
news agency EFE reported.
	   The image is attributed to the religious artist Duque Cornejo
who also sculpted the choir in the cathedral of this southern
Spanish city, the agency said.
	   Brother Manuel Serrano told EFE that the thief must have acted
quickly as the feet kissing faithful are watched over by members of
the brotherhood.
	   ``We don't think that it was an ordinary thief,'' the agency
quoted Serrano as saying on the grounds that only an art collector
would recognize their ``incalculable value.''

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The government said it paid no ransom
for the release of a Lithuanian businessman who was kidnapped in
Chechnya more than 18 months ago, and finally brought home Monday.
	   Viktoras Grodis, 35, was immediately hospitalized. His health
was described as poor.
	   ``We really did not pay for releasing the businessman,''
Rimantas Sidlauskas of the Foreign Ministry said.
	   Grodis' captors had demanded 100,000 dollars ransom, or more
than the average Lithuanian earns in 36 years. They threatened to
cut off his head and send it to his wife.
	   Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius personally appealed to
Chechen leaders for Grodis' release, but refused to use public
funds for that.

Most Russians say life was harder this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ To eight out of 10 Russians, 1998 was a harder
year than 1997, according to poll results issued Monday. Not
surprisingly, Russians said the country's economic crash was the
most important event of the year.
	   Only 3 percent of the 1,600 people polled nationwide by the
Public Opinion Fund said this year was easier than last year.
Eighty-two percent said it was harder, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The Public Opinion Fund compared the results to a similar poll
conducted 10 years ago, when Russia was still part of the Soviet
Union. Then, 79 percent said the year had been harder than the
previous one.
	   The pollsters did not list the margin of error. However, it was
almost certainly large enough that the results of the two polls a
decade apart were statistically indistinguishable.
	   In this year's poll, respondents were asked to name the three
most important events of the year. The top three were the Aug. 17
economic crash, named by 43 percent of respondents; the killing of
liberal political leader Galina Starovoitova (32 percent), and the
resumption of high inflation (30 percent).
	   They were followed by: Western air strikes against Iraq (25
percent); the introduction of new Russian rubles last January (22
percent); the dismissal of former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's government and the formation of Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko's government (16 percent); and the dismissal of
Kiriyenko's government and the formation of the current government
under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov (15 percent).
	   Besides the Iraq strikes, only one foreign event was named by a
significant number of people _ the U.S. scandal involving President
Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, named by 13 percent of
respondents.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Oleg Romantsev, who resigned two years ago as
coach of Russia's national soccer team, was reappointed to the job
Monday, news reports said.
	   The team has seen a long succession of coaches during the past
few years, with each resigning or getting fired over some
embarrassing loss. Each time, soccer officials have sought to rev
up the team's sluggish performance.
	   Romantsev stepped down in July, 1996, three weeks after the
squad was sent home from the European Championship after the first
round.
	   His successors hardly did better. Russia's last coach, Anatoly
Byshovets, was sacked earlier this month, after just five months in
the job, over Russia's loss to Iceland in European Championship
qualifiers in October.
	   Russia's Soccer Union decided Monday to reappoint Romantsev, 44,
as coach of the national team, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The decline of Russia's soccer performance has been accompanied
by corruption, power struggles and violence that have plagued the
soccer union in recent years.
	   The Russian soccer team has not qualified for the World Cup
since 1994.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A Turkish prosecutor indicted 47 members
of a pro-Kurdish party on Monday for staging a hunger strike in
support of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Prosecutor Talat Salk is seeking up to 7 1/2-year prison
sentences for members of the People's Democracy Party, including
its leader, Murat Bozlak.
	   The 47 were among thousands of party members who went on hunger
strikes to oppose Turkey's bid to extradite Ocalan from Italy for
trial.
	   Salk based his indictment on charges that the party leaders were
supporting a separatist armed organization.
	   Police rounded up hundreds of party members throughout Turkey
during the recent hunger strikes.
	   The party and its leaders are already fighting several other
court cases on charges ranging from making separatist propaganda to
belonging to Ocalan's outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK.
	   The PKK has been fighting for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

British electronics giant says merger expected in New Year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As part of Europe's defense integration, Britain's
General Electric Co. PLC said Monday that it will resume merger
talks in the new year with three potential partners, U.S. defense
giant Lockheed Martin, French electronics group Thomson-CSF and
British Aerospace.
	   Company spokesman Peter Craine said that an announcement about
the future of GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. industrial giant
General Electric Co., would be made ``as soon as we have brought
one of our sets of negotiations to a close. It is not entirely
within our hands.''
	   In January, analysts say that defense contractors throughout
Europe's NATO nations are expected to agree a series of
consolidation mergers, following the trend in the United States.
	   ``This is a process which is moving forward quite fast in the
industry. The person who moves first has the most choices,
certainly in Europe,'' said Craine.
	   Earlier this month, newspapers in Britain speculated that GEC
would finally merge with British Aerospace, creating a dlrs 39
billion defense group. Such an alliance would be the first
big-scale union in the European defense industry.
	   On Monday, the London-based Financial Times newspaper quoted
Thomson-CSF chairman as saying that the French government had given
its backing to a merger with Marconi Electronics, GEC's defense
arm, and had agreed to lower its stake in the French company.
	   To maintain flexibility, GEC has said it will consider a merger
with its civil or defense businesses, or both.
	   Marconi Electronics makes computer displays for U.S. F-16
fighters, and the European Tornado fighter-bomber and Eurofighter.
It also has a maritime division that makes torpedoes and sonar. In
1999, the Financial Times said it is forecast to have operating
profits of 430 million pounds (dlrs 690 million) on sales of about
5 billion pounds (dlrs 8 billion).
	   ``I have had intense and successful discussions with the French
government that make me fully convinced that if such a deal is
presented to it conditional upon a significantly reduced government
holding, there will be no problem on its part,'' the newspaper
quoted Denis Ranque as saying.
	   The French government holds a 40 percent share in the company,
the newspaper said, but would reduce this to below 10 percent to
complete a merger with GEC. The newspaper said that in a merger
between the two firms, Thomson, valued at 3.8 billion pounds (dlrs
6.1 billion) would likely be the junior partner.
	   ``The French option still actively under discussion,'' said
Craine.
	   Craine said other firms with which GEC held talks, such as U.S.
defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., could become involved in
talks again.
	   ``Once we get into active negotiations again, we might find the
list changes,'' Craine said.
	   On Dec. 22, GEC said it would separate its civil and defense
businesses, and on the 23 the company announced a 50-50 joint
venture with Italy's Finmeccanica to combine their ground, naval,
missile system and air traffic control activities. The new company
is to be called Alenia Marconi Systems, with annual revenue of
about dlrs 1.7 billion.
	   The companies said the venture will be the major supplier of
missile systems outside the United States.

East German ex-communists: Enough penance for Stalinist past
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ They have a loyal following in Germany's
struggling eastern states, help run state governments and recently
polled their best showing yet in national elections.
	   Now the former East German communists say it's time for the
nation to make its peace with them _ and the regime that once
killed citizens trying to flee to the West.
	   Yet the reaction to their latest call for an amnesty for
ex-communist officials shows how hard it is for the party to
overcome its past and join the political mainstream, almost 10
years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
	   Lawmakers of all stripes denounced the idea Monday, saying it
mocked the memory of victims who were shot at the Wall or hounded
by the Stasi, the communist secret police.
	   An amnesty would amount to a license to forget the past, said
Andreas Schmidt, a lawmaker from the conservative Christian
Democrats.
	   ``We are not done dealing with East Germany's history,'' said
Wolfgang Gerhardt, head of the liberal Free Democrats.
	   Vera Lengsfeld, a former East German dissident who divorced her
husband after finding out he reported on her to the Stasi, accused
the ex-communists of ``the rewriting of history.''
	   Shunned in the richer west, the ex-communist Party of Democratic
Socialism regularly wins about 20 percent of the vote in the east.
It appeals to jobless and others who feel second-class, including
former East German officials.
	   A key boost came in September national elections, where the
former communists scored 5.1 percent of the vote, their highest
since German unification in 1990. Flush with success, party
officials began talking up an amnesty.
	   PDS chief Lothar Bisky said over the weekend that the party
would introduce a bill in parliament next year to lift court
verdicts against former East German leaders, soldiers and judges.
It would also end current trials of such ex-communists.
	   Bisky, in an interview with The Associated Press, accused
prosecutors of seeking to make up for lax treatment of many
ex-Nazis after World War II by pursuing East German functionaries.
	   In contrast, the ex-communists say, an amnesty would promote
national healing.
	   But Bisky stepped back from an earlier call by a PDS lawmaker
for compensation for ex-communists who spent time behind bars after
unification.
	   All mainstream parties have voiced opposition to an amnesty,
making the PDS proposal unlikely to go anywhere in parliament.
	   But the party's fortunes look different on the local level.
	   In the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the PDS
are already mainstream. In October, the center-left Social
Democrats invited the ex-communists to join the state government,
returning them to power for the first time since the fall of
communism.
	   That came despite concerns from some Social Democrats that
helping the PDS gain credibility was a mistake, since they could
end up competing for the same left-wing voters.
	   Even a leader of the conservative Christian Democrats, Heiner
Geissler, recently warned his party against a ``blind and
fundamentalist'' anti-PDS course in the east, saying they had to
face the real political landscape.
	   But his proposal for a rapprochement has gone nowhere. ``He
stands completely alone in the party with this position,'' CDU
chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble reiterated Monday in a newspaper
interview.
	   Critics, especially conservatives, charge the PDS feeds on
eastern resentment and is merely a lobby for former pillars of an
oppressive regime.
	   Already, a PDS state lawmaker in Mecklenburg has admitted that
he was a Stasi informer in his youth.
	   Torsten Koplin, 36, told a Sunday newspaper he was ashamed. But
he added: ``I'm facing up to my personal history.''
	   Bisky also was facing a bit of history. He flew to Cuba on
Sunday to attend a ceremony to bury the remains of a German
girlfriend of Latin American left-wing revolutionary Che Guevara.

Angolan rebels deny knowledge of crashed U.N. plane
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The rebel group UNITA said Monday it had
no information about a U.N.-chartered cargo plane that crashed in
an area where rebels and the army are engaged in fierce fighting.
	   The C-130 aircraft carrying 14 people crashed Saturday at Vila
Nova near the city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles)
southeast of the capital, Luanda, according to the United Nations.
	   ``We don't know anything about it,'' UNITA Secretary-general
Paulo Lukamba Gato said by satellite telephone. ``There's heavy
fighting in all that area.''
	   The government says the plane crashed in a UNITA-controlled
area, and the United Nations has appealed to both the rebels and
the government to guarantee safe passage for a search and rescue
team.
	   Gato said he had not received the United Nation's request for
safe passage, and that he could not comment on the request until it
was presented directly to the UNITA leadership.
	   Gato denied the government's accusation that rebel forces
advancing on Huambo shot down the plane about 10 minutes after it
took off from the city.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N.
colors, and both sides were informed of the flight's schedule
before takeoff, the United Nations said.
	   The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a
Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   Eight of the passengers were members of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola, and two were employed by a private
communications company, Dinacom, which works with the United
Nations, Hamadoun Toure, a U.N. official in Luanda, said Sunday.
	   The observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994 peace accord
that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels and the
government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting.
	   ``The government broke off dialogue with us, so now we're
talking with weapons,'' Gato said. He added that he had no
information on the number of casualties from the fighting, which
erupted Dec. 4.
	   The main battles have focused on the central highland cities of
Huambo and Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east, which
provide a traditional powerbase for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop in Kuito said the government-held city
had been relatively calm since heavy shelling by UNITA last week
that reportedly killed some 200 people.
	   ``We are only hearing sporadic fire in the distance,'' Bishop
Jose Nambi said by phone.
	   The government said Monday its forces had knocked out UNITA's
forward artillery position in Ceilunga, a village 15 kilometers (10
miles) north of Kuito, over the weekend and killed 34 UNITA troops.
There was no information on government casualties.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.

Turkey's premier-designate receives conditional backing

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's latest premier-designate got the
backing of two key secular parties Monday in his efforts to form a
broad-based, coalition government, on condition that his government
stick to Turkey's secular principles.
	   The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate
support for Yalim Erez.
	   News reports said Virtue was holding out for a number of Cabinet
seats that reflected its standing as the largest party in
parliament.
	   ``We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' at this point,''
Virtue leader Recai Kutan said.
	   Erez denied that the two had discussed Cabinet posts.
	   Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying to form a coalition
government that would include Cabinet members from several parties,
including Virtue. The coalition would run the country only until
parliamentary elections set for April.
	   Erez took over efforts to form a government last week after
veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's
bickering center-left and center-right parties to join him in a
coalition that excluded the Islamic-oriented party.
	   Erez opened talks with various party leaders on Monday.
	   He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said
his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing.
	   ``As long as our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic
regime is taken into account, we will do our best to help form the
new government and ensure it gets a vote of confidence,'' Ecevit
said after his own talks with Erez.
	   Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed to any deal that
would bring Virtue to power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, the
Welfare Party, out of power last year.
	   Erez is supposed to talk Tuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller
and to Deniz Baykal, who leads a center-left party.
	   ``I am more and more optimistic after every meeting,'' Erez told
reporters after meeting with the party leaders.
	   Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a
coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over
allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank. Yilmaz is now acting
premier.

Real police catch phony police preying on tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police arrested three Romanians accused
of robbing tourists by posing as policemen, the state news agency
MTI reported Monday.
	   Identified only as Daniel D., Maricel S. and Cezar L., the three
were taken into custody Sunday after police fired a warning shot
when the three tried to flee.
	   The trio would pose as ``tourist police'' _ there is no such
thing in Hungary _ and would stop tourists and fine them on a
variety of trumped up charges.
	   Police had cruised the city in the wake of reports of the men's
activity, and caught them in the act on the Buda side of the Chain
Bridge, one of the best known Hungarian landmarks.

Russia's Lebed calls for restoration of death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Lebed, a top prospect to become the next
president of Russia, has called for a resumption of capital
punishment and an end to the jury system, a news report said
Monday.
	   Lebed also called for extending police officers' discretion to
shoot to kill, according to an interview with the newspaper
Izvestia. The article, scheduled for publication Tuesday, was
quoted by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia promised to eliminate the death penalty in 1996, when it
joined the Council of Europe, but has so far only enacted a
moratorium that prevents courts from carrying out capital
punishment sentences.
	   ``It is necessary to lift the moratorium on capital punishment
and expand the sphere of its application,'' Lebed said.
	   He conceded that such a move would hurt Russia's relations with
the Council of Europe, but said that the West should welcome
Russia's attempts to end rampant crime.
	   Opinion polls have consistently shown that most Russians support
capital punishment.
	   Involvement in organized crime groups should be made a
death-penalty offense, Lebed said, along with aggravated murder _
the only offense of this type that Russia has on the books now.
	   He also called for doing away with the jury system and having
professional judges hand down verdicts on suspects' guilt or
innocence, Interfax reported.
	   Lebed finished a strong third in Russia's 1996 presidential
election and is likely to run again in the next presidential
election, scheduled for 2000. He did a brief stint as Russia's
security chief in 1996 and now serves as governor of the huge
Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ American warplanes patrolling a ``no-fly
zone'' in northern Iraq fired at an Iraqi air defense site Monday
after coming under attack, U.S. officials said. Iraq said the
missiles killed four Iraqi soldiers and injured seven others.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the pilots only fired after
being fired upon. ``They attacked because they were attacked, and
they did the appropriate thing,'' he said in Washington.
	   However, the Iraq Information Ministry claimed its moves were
defensive and forced the ``evil'' warplanes to flee.
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over northern
Iraq that was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after their
failed uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   Monday's incident occurred just north of Mosul, according to the
Pentagon.
	   Major Tony Kemper, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-European Command
based near Stuttgart, Germany, said the planes were attacked by
Iraqi surface-to-air missiles.
	   ``The aircraft acted in self-defense and attacked the
ground-based missile launch site with HARM (High-Speed Anti
Radiation) missiles and precision-guide munitions,'' she said.
``There was no damage to coalition aircraft and all crew returned
safely to Incirlik airbase (in Turkey).''
	   She added that officials were still trying to assess the damage
to Iraqi forces.
	   Two Iraqi missiles were fired, a Turkish foreign ministry
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   ``There was a hostile Iraqi action, an act of aggression against
U.S. aircraft,'' Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said.
``The U.S. took appropriate action under their rules of
engagement.''
	   In London, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said its
planes were not involved in Monday's incident.
	   However, Bridges said, over the weekend two British tornado
planes reported seeing anti-aircraft fire from Iraqi sites about
five miles (eight kilometers) away. He had no further details about
that incident.
	   The casualties Monday were the first reported by Iraq since a
four-day bombing campaign by American and British forces ended Dec.
19. Iraq said 62 soldiers and at least 40 civilians died in those
airstrikes, but never gave a final civilian casualty count.
	   ``The murderers and criminals returned once again and violated
our national airspace,'' today's Iraqi statement said, adding that
``several enemy formations'' entered Iraqi airspace at 10:25 a.m.
from Turkey.
	   Iraqi air defenses ``confronted them with valor and forced them
to flee to their bases of evil and aggression in Turkey,'' the
statement said.
	   Another wave of Western planes entered Iraq at 1:37 p.m. and
``fired criminal missiles against one of our sites,'' it said,
adding that this killed four soldiers and wounded seven.
	   Earlier Monday, Iraq's trade minister said Iraq has no immediate
plans to eject 400 U.N. humanitarian workers who monitor an
oil-for-food program. In earlier statements, minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh said Iraq would not agree to extend the program and
therefore the U.N. workers would have to go home.
	   Saleh said the 2-year-old program was a temporary measure and
could not substitute for meeting Iraq's demand of lifting U.N.
sanctions, which limit its oil exports.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq will accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program _ which allows the country to export
oil worth dlrs 5.2 billion over six months _ when it expires in
May.
	   The trade minister spoke at a news conference he called to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said Sunday.
	   The program, which is an exception to trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows the country to
export limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicine for its 22
million people, who have been hard hit by the sanctions.
	   U.N. workers monitor the program to ensure that the Iraqi
government does not divert any of the money.
	   Also Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called for a
quick review of Iraq's weapons program as a condition for lifting
sanctions and again warned the United States against using force.

Son of Menachem Begin announces he is running for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS throughout; UPDATES with fresh quotes, Peres,
Shamir standing against direct Prime Minister elections &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In the third challenge to Benjamin
Netanyahu from a scion of his Likud party, the only son of Menachem
Begin on Monday declared his candidacy for prime minister.
	   Benny Begin's candidacy underscored the prime minister's growing
isolation in the party his father once led, although the younger
Begin lacks popular appeal.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
running for prime minister on a centrist slate. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are
debating whether to leave the Likud, possibly to join Meridor.
	   Netanyahu is also being challenged from within the party by Uzi
Landau, a hard-liner who, like Begin, opposes ceding further lands
to the Palestinians. Landau has little chance, but it is
practically unheard of for a sitting prime minister to be
challenged within his party.
	   Netanyahu denied that his support within the party was
collapsing.
	   ``The party is very solid and very unified around the direction
we have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he said Monday,
a day after the Likud rank and file cheered him as ``King of
Israel'' at a meeting of the party's central committee.
	   Yet on Monday, his government failed to garner enough
legislators to pass an ancillary bill necessary to allow passage of
a budget bill. Two members of the coalition abstained and others _
including senior Likud figures _ were absent from the chamber.
	   Netanyahu agreed to early elections last week when he could not
get a majority in parliament to back his security policies.
	   Likud hard-liners were outraged that he agreed to cede more
territory to the Palestinians at U.S.-brokered talks in Wye River,
Md. in October. Doves are exasperated with Netanyahu for freezing
Wye soon after the agreement, for what he says were Palestinian
violations.
	   All sides attack him for equivocating and lacking leadership.
	   Meridor has described Netanyahu's 2 1/2 years as prime minister
as ``the collapse of leadership and political culture.''
	   On Monday, two former prime ministers from opposing camps,
Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, jointly appealed to the Knesset to
repeal direct elections for the prime minister, a system introduced
in the 1996 elections that helped the telegenic Netanyahu to power.
	   Begin, Livnat, Landau and Meridor are all children of the
``fighting family'' _ the men and women who founded the Revisionist
movement in the 1930s, that counted out any compromise with the
Arabs.
	   Yet, in 1978, it was the late Menachem Begin _ the first Likud
prime minister _ who agreed to cede land for peace, signing over
the Sinai peninsula to Egypt.
	   But he refused to concede territory in the West Bank, part of
the biblical land of Israel, and committed only to limited autonomy
for the Palestinians, with full Israeli military control.
	   The younger Begin _ a wiry, sharp-tongued, geologist _ resigned
from his position as science minister in Netanyahu's Cabinet after
Netanyahu agreed to pull troops out of the West Bank town of Hebron
in January, 1997.
	   ``The reality is before us,'' Begin said, announcing his
candidacy. ``No peace, no security.''
	   Although Begin's chances of becoming prime minister are remote _
he could not name a single legislator who backed him _ he could
weaken Netanyahu by splitting the hard-line vote and forcing a
second round.
	   Netanyahu said Monday that support at the grassroots level would
win him victory at the polls this spring.
	   ``The majority of citizens identify with what we've been doing
... with our firmness on security, because they understand these
are the things that make a real peace process,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu is resisting holding elections before May 4, the date
by which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has pledged to
unilaterally declare statehood.
	   A Palestinian negotiator suggested Monday that Arafat would not
go through with the declaration if it would help Netanyahu get
re-elected. The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of making
excuses to get out of his promises.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour, a
Palestinian negotiator, told The Associated Press.
	   During a Likud Central Committee meeting Sunday night, Netanyahu
said reports that Arafat would back off the May 4 declaration was
proof that the opposition Labor party was colluding with Arafat in
order to topple him. Labor Party leader described that as
``incitement'' typical of Netanyahu's political style.

Trade group acknowledges some wines contaminated by pesticides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some of France's most prestigious wines may have
been contaminated by pesticides over the last decade, posing no
health hazard but affecting the taste, a top wine trade association
acknowledged Monday.
	   The Bordeaux Wine Board commented in a telephone interview after
an investigative report appeared in this week's L'Express, a
respected news magazine.
	   Since the problem became known in Champagne in 1982, many wine
professionals have tried to keep it a secret, L'Express reported.
	   A spokeswoman for the wine board acknowledged the problem but
claimed it affected only about one percent of wines tested in the
past two years, and had been corrected for all Bordeaux wines.
	   Sophie Girard said the public hasn't been informed because the
board preferred to ``help Bordeaux vintners resolve the problem,
rather than alarm the public about something that was relatively
minor.''
	   L'Express reported that trace quantities of chlorophenol, a
pesticide widely used to treat new wood, has seeped into wines from
Bordeaux, Burgundy, Beaujolais, and even champagnes.
	   The pesticides come from treated wood used in constructing new
storage facilities. Hundreds of top French labels, including
high-priced bottles from Margaux in Bordeaux, have been affected,
L'Express wrote.
	   Some buyers have returned contaminated wine to the vineyards
complaining of the bad taste, it said. The taste was often blamed
on bad corks.
	   Girard said that of the 1,344 wines chosen at random for
analysis in the past two years, 44 had a bad corky taste, and 11 of
those were due to pesticides.
	   ``It's very difficult to distinguish between the real taste of a
cork gone bad and the moldy taste left by the pesticide,'' she
said.
	   L'Express did not say what percent of wines it believed had been
affected. But it quoted wine researcher Pascal Chatonnet, who first
identified the cause of the offensive flavor, as saying that the
wood in 50 percent of the barrels tested in his private lab in 1996
was contaminated and had to be destroyed.
	   ``Today, we're down to 5 percent,'' he told L'Express.
	   Many vintners have solved the problem by tearing down their
warehouses, rebuilding with the more expensive, solid oak which
doesn't require treatment.
	   The National Interprofessional Office of Wines, a state-run
liaison group between the Agricultural Ministry and wine producers,
was unavailable for comment, but spokeswoman Laurence Mesnil said
she knew nothing about the pesticides.
	   According to L'Express, U.S. wine expert Robert Parker was among
the few to break the silence, but he used language decipherable
only by experts who know how to read between the lines.
	   Parker was unavailable for comment, but his assistant at the
Wine Advocate office in Bordeaux said the problem was common
knowledge among professionals in France.
	   ``It's something we're very concerned about,'' Hannah Agostini
said.

The tax man to carry cattle prods, Mace, handcuffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian tax man will be someone
to reckon with after parliament passed a controversial law Monday,
setting up a special force of revenuers with unusual investigative
rights, including covert surveillance.
	   An estimated 30 percent of Hungary's gross domestic product
comes from the black economy, and the government wants to find ways
of bringing them into the fold _ with cattle prods, if necessary.
	   The law passed on a 215 to 131 vote, with one abstention.
	   Members of the Criminal Directorate, as the special unit will be
called, will be issued cattle prods, Mace and handcuffs.
	   During its final session of the year, parliament approved the
1999 national budget, with 205 votes in favor and 145 against in
the 386-seat parliament. The total budget is 3.5 trillion forints
(dlrs 16 billion).
	   There is a projected deficit of 374.17 billion forints (dlrs 1.7
billion).

Liverpool hits back to beat Newcastle 4-2, Villa returns to top

	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Owen and KarlHeinz Riedle each scored
twice as Liverpool hit back from two goals down to beat Newcastle
4-2 in the Premier League on Monday.
	   Goals by Peruvian midfielder Nolberto Salano and Swedish forward
Andreas Andersson fired Ruud Gullit's team ahead at Anfield before
German midfielder Dietmar Hamann was sent off.
	   Liverpool, which has twice beaten Newcastle 4-3 in the last
three seasons, then hit back with four second half strikes with
Owen taking his personal tally for the season to 15 and six against
Newcastle during 1998.
	   Aston Villa returned to the top of the standings by edging lowly
Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 thanks to a headed strike by defender Ugo
Ehiogu five minutes from the end.
	   Another center-back, Gareth Southgate, fired Villa ahead after
seven minutes but Benito Carbone leveled a minute later for
Wednesday who had Yugoslav defender Dejan Stefanovic sent off for a
second yellow card in the 21st minute.
	   Chelsea can return to the top by beating Manchester United at
Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.
	   Arsenal moved up to third with a 1-0 win at struggling Charlton
thanks to a second half penalty by Dutch winger Marc Overmars.
	   But the Gunners lost Dennis Bergkamp and Nigel Winterburn
through injury and French World Cup midfielder Patrick Vieira was
sent off for lashing out at Charlton's Neal Redfearn.
	   Ian Wright's first goal in eight games but seventh of the season
helped West Ham gain a 2-0 victory over lowly Coventry. John
Hartson scored the other Hammers goal.
	   Chris Armstrong scored three times in 18 minutes for Tottenham
in a 4-1 crushing of Everton at White Hart Lane. Les Ferdinand
netted Spurs first before Ibrahima Bakayoko replied for the
Toffees.
	   In the matchup of the bottom two teams, Nottingham Forest and
Southampton tied 1-1, leaving Forest still in last place. New
Moroccan signing Hassan Kachloul fired Saints ahead with his second
goal in nine days but Steve Chettle leveled from the penalty spot.
	   Disappointing Paul Gascoigne was substituted soon after half
time and Middlesbrough lost 2-1 to Derby at Pride Park for its
second loss in three days.
	   Dean Sturridge, the focus of some transfer speculation early in
the day, gave County the lead before Jim Smith's team lost Costa
Rican star Paulo Wanchope for raising his arm against Andy Townsend
after a rough tackle by Boro's Irish international midfielder.
	   Danish forward Mikkel Beck leveled for Boro but Derby snatched
all three points through a late header by substitute Jonathan Hunt.
	   Some 41,000 saw Sunderland extend its lead atop the Division One
standings to eight points with a 2-0 victory over last place Crewe.
Second place Ipswich lost 1-0 at Wolves.

Four U.S. football coaches fired in offseason purge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The offseason purge of NFL coaches began quickly
Monday.
	   Within one hour, Dom Capers of Carolina, Dave Wannstedt of
Chicago,Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore and Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia
were fired, beginning what looks to be a postseason of coaching
casualties.
	   Capers and Rhodes, both former coaches of the year, have already
been mentioned for vacancies. Capers is a candidate for the
openings in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and Rhodes is a candidate
in Green Bay, where Mike Holmgren has the option of getting out of
his contract for a coach-general manager position elsewhere.
	   The biggest surprise may have been Wannstedt's dismissal in
Chicago, even though he finished 4-12 for the second straight year.
Wannstedt's team played hard every week and even owner Mike
McCaskey conceded that the team's talent level was lower than
needed to compete in the NFL.
	   ``We have a good nucleus of players and we need to increase the
talent level,'' McCaskey said.
	   Capers, the only coach the Panthers have had in their four
seasons, was fired two seasons after taking the team to the NFC
championship game in its second year. But Carolina finished 7-9
last year and 4-12 this season as it fell apart on the field and
within the locker room.
	   Rhodes also lasted four years, taking the Eagles to the playoffs
in his first two. But he fought with the front office from the
start and this season the team collapsed, falling to 3-13 with the
worst offense in the league.
	   Marchibroda came from Indianapolis to an unsettled situation in
Baltimore, taking over the Ravens the year after they moved from
Cleveland.
	   The team was 16-31-1 under Marchibroda, including 6-10 this
season. They won three straight games only once and never came
close to reaching the playoffs.
	   The firing left five vacancies _ June Jones of San Diego has
already taken the coaching job at the University of Hawaii. Among
other coaches whose jobs were in jeopardy were Dennis Erickson of
Seattle and Norv Turner of Washington _ although any move in
Washington wouldn't be made until the team is sold.
	   Bruce Coslet of Cincinnati is also on shaky ground after a 3-13
season, although the Bengals will probably keep him so they don't
have to pay the remaining years of his contract.
	   San Francisco's Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a contract
extension and could move on, perhaps to the expansion team in
Cleveland.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
dozens of yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday. At
least two sailors were killed as boats capsized or sank, and rescue
helicopters hoisted 50 others to safety.
	   Four other sailors were missing and at least one was presumed
drowned. Rescue boats battled 90 mph (145 kph) winds and 35-foot
(10-meter) waves to try to reach other competitors.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off the southern Australian coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney. Emergency flares
sent streams of red smoke into the air to help helicopters mark
find the orange life rafts in the storm.
	   The 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59
have been forced to seek shelter and several boats have been
abandoned, race officials said. Some 27 navy ships searched
Australia's southeast coast for stranded sailors after the calls of
``Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!'' came over the radio.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   Their bodies were left on board the boat but attempts were being
made to recover them as soon as possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British sailor Glyn Charles was washed off the Sword of Orion
yacht Sunday night and presumed drowned.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority, said it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could
survive more than 24 hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it,'' Poke said.
	   Six crew members from the Winston Churchill yacht were plucked
from two life rafts late tonight, but three others were missing.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the life raft,'' a spokesman for
the maritime authority said.
	   Maritime spokesman David Gray said many other sailors had
suffered injuries.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said. ``They really got pounded yesterday.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when his yacht rolled over. Campbell got
hypothermia after being in cold water for about 40 minutes. Senior
Constable Barry Barclay dropped into large swells from a helicopter
to rescue him Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell said on television.
``There was a point I didn't think I was going to survive.''
	   An American boat named Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last
year's winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the finish line
Tuesday.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast.

Bodies of foreign hostages to be handed over to Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British officials from embassy in Azerbaijan
going to meet convoy, graf 4. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A convoy bearing the bodies of four foreigners who
were beheaded in Chechnya earlier this month left Monday for the
nearby country of Azerbaijan, where the bodies were to be handed
over to British envoys, a news report said.
	   The convoy of medical vehicles, accompanied by Chechnya's Deputy
Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev and Deputy Prosecutor General
Magomed Magomadov, was to travel across the Russian region of
Dagestan, which separates Chechnya and Azerbaijan.
	   The handover was set to take place in the Azerbaijani capital,
Baku, on Tuesday, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news
agency. The bodies were to be flown to Britain the same morning,
Interfax reported.
	   Officials from the British Embassy in Azerbaijan went to the
border with Russia's Dagestan to meet the convoy, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The handover was originally planned for Monday, but appeared to
have been delayed by the sides' disagreement on where it should
take place.
	   A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, Mike Haddock,
said Britain wanted the handover to take place in the Russian
capital, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said the
separatist republic considered the proposal ``unacceptable'' and
wanted the bodies to be handed over in Azerbaijan, Interfax
reported.
	   Chechnya, which had fought a 1994-96 war for secession from
Russia, adamantly tries to assert its independence from Moscow. No
country has recognized its sovereignty.
	   The bodies of the four men were found Saturday evening in the
village of Chernorechiye, on the outskirts of the Chechen capital,
Grozny. Doctors confirmed the identities of the bodies Sunday,
according to Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   British officials confirmed that the bodies had been identified
by Chechen experts. But Britain has been unable yet to get an
independent confirmation of their identity, Haddock said, according
to Interfax.
	   The four men _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped Oct. 3,
and their severed heads were found by a roadside on Dec. 8.
	   A mourning service for the four was held Monday in the church of
St. Archangel Michael in Grozny, the capital of predominantly
Muslim Chechnya, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Authorities said the men, who were in Chechnya to set up a
cellular phone system, had been killed after a rescue attempt went
wrong.
	   The region, in the southern Caucasus, has seen a boom in crime
and kidnappings for ransom since Chechnya's independence war ended.

Four U.S. football coaches fired in offseason purge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The offseason purge of NFL coaches began quickly
Monday.
	   Within one hour, Dom Capers of Carolina, Dave Wannstedt of
Chicago,Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore and Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia
were fired, beginning what looks to be a postseason of coaching
casualties.
	   Capers and Rhodes, both former coaches of the year, have already
been mentioned for vacancies. Capers is a candidate for the
openings in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and Rhodes is a candidate
in Green Bay, where Mike Holmgren has the option of getting out of
his contract for a coach-general manager position elsewhere.
	   The biggest surprise may have been Wannstedt's dismissal in
Chicago, even though he finished 4-12 for the second straight year.
Wannstedt's team played hard every week and even owner Mike
McCaskey conceded that the team's talent level was lower than
needed to compete in the NFL.
	   ``We have a good nucleus of players and we need to increase the
talent level,'' McCaskey said.
	   Capers, the only coach the Panthers have had in their four
seasons, was fired two seasons after taking the team to the NFC
championship game in its second year. But Carolina finished 7-9
last year and 4-12 this season as it fell apart on the field and
within the locker room.
	   Rhodes also lasted four years, taking the Eagles to the playoffs
in his first two. But he fought with the front office from the
start and this season the team collapsed, falling to 3-13 with the
worst offense in the league.
	   Marchibroda came from Indianapolis to an unsettled situation in
Baltimore, taking over the Ravens the year after they moved from
Cleveland.
	   The team was 16-31-1 under Marchibroda, including 6-10 this
season. They won three straight games only once and never came
close to reaching the playoffs.
	   The firing left five vacancies _ June Jones of San Diego has
already taken the coaching job at the University of Hawaii. Among
other coaches whose jobs were in jeopardy were Dennis Erickson of
Seattle and Norv Turner of Washington _ although any move in
Washington wouldn't be made until the team is sold.
	   Bruce Coslet of Cincinnati is also on shaky ground after a 3-13
season, although the Bengals will probably keep him so they don't
have to pay the remaining years of his contract.
	   San Francisco's Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a contract
extension and could move on, perhaps to the expansion team in
Cleveland.

U.S. basketball commissioner makes `final' offer in secret meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE reference to when season of 45-50 games can
be salvaged &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The U.S. basketball commissioner says he has
made his ``final'' offer. If so, the rest of the NBA season may
indeed be canceled _ for the first time in North American
professional major leagues.
	   David Stern and union director Billy Hunter met for five hours
Sunday at a Denver hotel, with each side making concessions to try
to end the nearly 6-month lockout.
	   The league improved its proposal in several areas, and the union
offered further restrictions on the salaries of the highest-paid
players. Still, the concessions were not enough to make either side
happy and the talks broke up.
	   ``I really don't think there will be a season,'' said Jeffrey
Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer. ``We've gone as far as
we can go. We're done.''
	   No further talks are scheduled.
	   ``We're not that far apart. Whether we have a season or not is
up to them,'' Hunter said. ``We've shown a willingness to
negotiate.''
	   There remains time to save the season. The league's Board of
Governors will meet Jan. 7, and the commissioner has said he will
recommend canceling the remainder of the season if no accord is
reached by that date.
	   A deal must be made by mid-January to salvage a schedule of 45
to 50 games.
	   The dispute is threatening to cause the first cancellation of an
entire season for the first time in the history of North American
professional major leagues.
	   ``We advised the union that no further offers will be made,''
Stern said.
	   Hunter said the league was ``obviously in gloom-and-doom mode.
That's the spin they want to put on it.''
	   ``We offered a comprehensive proposal to the NBA,'' Hunter said.
``The NBA countered our proposal and we indicated to them that we
were willing to negotiate further, which unfortunately they were
unwilling to do at this time.''
	   The league improved its offer in several areas:
	   _On the percentage of revenue to be shared with players, the
league moved one point to 53 percent in year four, 53.5 percent in
year five and 54 in year six.
	   _The league agreed to keep the dlrs 1 million exception in its
current form, whereby it can be used once every two years to exceed
the salary cap to sign an additional player.
	   _Owners agreed to the union's proposed limit of a 10 percent
escrow tax on player salaries in years four, five and six of the
agreement.
	   _The NBA increased its proposed minimum and maximum salaries,
with the biggest increases for players with between seven and nine
years of experience.
	   _Owners offered a 25 percent raise for players under the rookie
scale who have their option picked up for a fourth year.
	   ``Unfortunately, this was not enough for the union,'' Stern
said.
	   The players changed their offer on a maximum salary to include
all players with less than 10 years' experience instead of seven
years' experience.
	   Hunter said the union moved on its desired percentages, asking
for 56 percent in year four and 57 percent in year six. He said the
league refused to budge off many of its demands, including an end
to opt-out clauses and sign-and-trade deals, changes to the group
licensing agreement and a loss of Larry Bird rights for any player
traded during the final year of his contract.

New coach appointed for Russia's soccer team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov's comments, grafs. 6-8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Oleg Romantsev, who resigned two years ago as
coach of Russia's national soccer team, was reappointed to the job
Monday, news reports said.
	   The team has seen a long succession of coaches during the past
few years, with each resigning or getting fired over some
embarrassing loss. Each time, soccer officials have sought to rev
up the team's sluggish performance.
	   Romantsev stepped down in July, 1996, three weeks after the
squad was sent home from the European Championship after the first
round.
	   His successors hardly did better. Russia's last coach, Anatoly
Byshovets, was sacked earlier this month, after just five months in
the job, over Russia's loss to Iceland in European Championship
qualifiers in October.
	   Russia's Soccer Union decided Monday to reappoint Romantsev, 44,
as coach of the national team, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a soccer fan who recently
promised to restore Russia's team to glory, called Romantsev to
congratulate him on the appointment, Interfax said.
	   ``Soccer is more than a sport. Soccer is our national heritage,
Russia's pride,'' Primakov was quoted as saying.
	   ``The victories of Russia's soccer team under your command will
make Russia stronger and help to consolidate it. We need sports
victories to raise the spirit of our people.''
	   The decline of Russia's soccer performance has been accompanied
by corruption, power struggles and violence that have plagued the
soccer union in recent years.
	   The Russian soccer team has not qualified for the World Cup
since 1994.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With both sides now respecting a
cease-fire, U.N. officials tried Monday to help civilians who fled
four days of fighting between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in
northern Kosovo that left at least 15 people dead.
	   Thousands more fled into snow-covered hills to escape the
fighting, according to U.N. and ethnic Albanian sources.
	   No clashes were reported Monday in the Serbian province,
according to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Jorgen Grunnet.
	   Grunnet said both sides were generally respecting a truce
negotiated Sunday by the American head of the OSCE peace
verification force, William Walker, which ended clashes around
Podujevo, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of here.
	   The fighting put new strains on an already fragile peace accord
reached Oct. 12 between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting.
	   In neighboring Albania, the country's parliament called Monday
for NATO to intervene in Kosovo, saying that was the only way to
prevent a humanitarian disaster and open the way to a ``political
solution.''
	   And Kosovo province's leading ethnic Albanian politician,
Ibrahim Rugova, described the situation as ``very difficult and
dangerous.'' He urged the United States and European powers to step
up diplomatic efforts toward a lasting political settlement and
prevent ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serb forces.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by Rugova's party, claimed
15,000 people had been displaced by the fighting, which erupted
Christmas Eve when government forces attacked strongholds of ethnic
Albanian rebels searching for the killers of a Serb policeman.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Maki Shinohara,
estimated the number of displaced people at about 5,000 and said
humanitarian workers were trying to locate them to provide food,
blankets and other supplies.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew touring the area of the
most recent fighting on Monday found villages deserted by civilians
but with Kosovo Liberation Army fighters in evidence.
	   Some of those who fled crowded homes in Bradas, a village about
30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) north of Pristina. Some, like
Hamida Degoli, complained of the difficulties of being on the run
on foot with snow deep in some places and temperatures far below
freezing.
	   ``We don't know what to do, we left everything behind,'' said
Degoli, 72, who made her way to Bradas from Velika Reka, about 10
kilometers (6 miles) away.
	   Nearby, in Lapastica village, a crowd of residents attended the
funeral of two ethnic Albanian guerrillas killed in the recent
fighting. About 50 Kosovo Liberation Army fighters were also
present, dressed in black and clutching automatic weapons.
	   A local commander eulogizing them said the two ``were a brave
example to our army.'' He did not identify himself to APTN.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
dozens of yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday. At
least two sailors were killed as boats capsized or sank, and rescue
helicopters hoisted 50 others to safety.
	   Four other sailors were missing and at least one was presumed
drowned. Rescue boats battled 90 mph (145 kph) winds and 35-foot
(10-meter) waves to try to reach other competitors.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off the southern Australian coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney. Emergency flares
sent streams of red smoke into the air to help helicopters mark
find the orange life rafts in the storm.
	   The 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59
have been forced to seek shelter and several boats have been
abandoned, race officials said. Some 27 navy ships searched
Australia's southeast coast for stranded sailors after the calls of
``Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!'' came over the radio.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   Their bodies were left on board the boat but attempts were being
made to recover them as soon as possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British sailor Glyn Charles was washed off the Sword of Orion
yacht Sunday night and presumed drowned.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority, said it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could
survive more than 24 hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it,'' Poke said.
	   Six crew members from the Winston Churchill yacht were plucked
from two life rafts late tonight, but three others were missing.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the life raft,'' a spokesman for
the maritime authority said.
	   Maritime spokesman David Gray said many other sailors had
suffered injuries.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said. ``They really got pounded yesterday.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when his yacht rolled over. Campbell got
hypothermia after being in cold water for about 40 minutes. Senior
Constable Barry Barclay dropped into large swells from a helicopter
to rescue him Campbell.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell said on television.
``There was a point I didn't think I was going to survive.''
	   An American boat named Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last
year's winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the finish line
Tuesday.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast.

Chernomyrdin meets with Luzhkov to propose alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Struggling to come out of political oblivion,
Russia's former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met Moscow's
powerful mayor Monday to suggest an election alliance _ a proposal
that was quickly rejected.
	   Chernomyrdin said he wanted Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who recently
formed a political party of his own, to consider pooling efforts in
December 1999 parliamentary elections.
	   However, Luzhkov rejected the idea even before their meeting.
``There will be no agreement on any alliance,'' he said.
	   Speaking to reporters after the two-hour meeting, Chernomyrdin
tried to put the best light on it, saying he and Luzhkov agreed to
``meet more often, synchronize our positions and solve problems.''
	   Unlike well-organized Communists, who dominate the current
parliament, centrist and liberal groups remain splintered, raising
doubts about their ability to effectively perform in the race.
	   Chernomyrdin's party has been in a particularly grave trouble
since President Boris Yeltsin dismissed him last March.
	   According to a poll conducted earlier this month by the
independent Public Opinion Foundation, only 1 percent of Russians
would vote for Chernomyrdin's party if the parliamentary elections
are held now, the Russian NTV network reported on Sunday. It didn't
cite the poll's margin of error.
	   Parties must clear a 5-percent barrier to get into the Duma. Our
Home Is Russia has the second-largest faction in the current lower
house, the State Duma.
	   Chernomyrdin, once considered the top candidate in the 2000
presidential election, has seen his own popularity plummet to near
zero since his ouster.
	   Yeltsin re-appointed Chernomyrdin in August after his successor,
Sergei Kiriyenko, sent the economy into a tailspin by devaluing the
ruble and defaulting on some debts.
	   The parliament, however, refused to accept Chernomyrdin and
ratified Yevgeny Primakov as Russia's new premier in September.
	   Since then, Chernomyrdin's party, Our Home Is Russia, has been
rapidly losing its status as a major political force, with regional
leaders and other officials fleeing it en masse.
	   Alexander Shokhin, the head of the party's parliament faction,
called on Chernomyrdin to resign as the party leader to prevent it
from a full collapse. Chernomyrdin responded by firing Shokhin last
week.
	   Chernomyrdin claimed that the party remains strong despite the
low ratings. ``Our regional branches remain active, none of them
has collapsed,'' he said in the television interview.
	   Luzhkov, one of Russia's leading politicians and a presidential
hopeful, has problems of his own. He enjoys broad support in Moscow
for the construction and business boom of recent years _
achievements that have been significantly eroded by the crisis.
Luzhkov's appeal in the provinces, where many resent the capital's
relative wealth, remains untested.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's major parties set May 17 as an
election date on Monday, a sign that a threat by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to declare statehood before then has receded and will
not influence the campaign.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had wanted to set the
elections for before May 4 in order to maximalize the threat of
Palestinian statehood in his hard-line campaign.
	   Netanyahu has recently played up Arafat's threat to declare
independence on May 4 _ the five-year deadline for a final peace
agreement, under the Oslo accords _ countering with a threat to
annex parts of the West Bank.
	   ``Arafat knows if he declares a Palestinian state unilaterally,
t means cancelling Oslo,'' Netanyahu threatened Sunday, opening the
elections campaign. Netanyahu sees statehood as posing a security
threat to Israel.
	   But Arafat, fearful of helping hard-liner Netanyahu to power,
indicated Monday he was backing down from his intention to declare
statehood on May 4.

	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of using emosuch emotive
issues to get out of his commitments according to a series of peace
agreements.
	   A Palestinian negotiator suggested that Arafat would not go
through with the declaration if it would help Netanyahu get
re-elected.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour told
The Associated Press.
	   A later elections date will also help contain the threat posed
to Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, the leader of the opposition Labor
party, by the emergence of a popular former general.
	   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former chief-of-staff, has been leading
both men in the polls _ largely because as a soldier, he was
prohibited from making political statements, and was able to remain
above the fray.
	   Shahak retired his uniform last week to declare his interest in
joining an as yet-unformed centrist party, and will now be expected
to proclaim a political platform.
	   Wherever he comes down _ on the peace process, on the economy,
and state-church relations _ he is liable to alienate voters who
might have supported him until now because of his telegenic charm
and his sterling military record. Barak and Netanyahu both hope
that a long elections campaign will shave support for Shahak in the
polls.

	   Earlier Monday, in the third challenge to Netanyahu from a scion
of his Likud party, the only son of Menachem Begin on Monday
declared his candidacy for prime minister.
	   Benny Begin's candidacy underscored the prime minister's growing
isolation in the party his father once led, although the younger
Begin lacks popular appeal.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
running for prime minister on a centrist slate. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat, are
debating whether to leave the Likud, possibly to join Meridor.
	   Netanyahu is also being challenged from within the party by Uzi
Landau, a hard-liner who, like Begin, opposes ceding further lands
to the Palestinians. Landau has little chance, but it is
practically unheard of for a sitting prime minister to be
challenged within his party.
	   Netanyahu denied that his support within the party was
collapsing.
	   ``The party is very solid and very unified around the direction
we have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he said Monday,
a day after the Likud rank and file cheered him as ``King of
Israel'' at a meeting of the party's central committee.
	   Yet on Monday, his government failed to garner enough
legislators to pass an ancillary bill necessary to allow passage of
a budget bill. Two members of the coalition abstained and others _
including senior Likud figures _ were absent from the chamber.
	   Netanyahu agreed to early elections last week when he could not
get a majority in parliament to back his security policies.
	   Likud hard-liners were outraged that he agreed to cede more
territory to the Palestinians at U.S.-brokered talks in Wye River,
Md. in October. Doves are exasperated with Netanyahu for freezing
Wye soon after the agreement, for what he says were Palestinian
violations.
	   ``The reality is before us,'' Begin said, announcing his
candidacy. ``No peace, no security.''
	   Begin, Livnat, Landau and Meridor are all children of the
``fighting family'' _ the men and women who founded the Revisionist
movement in the 1930s, that counted out any compromise with the
Arabs.
	   On Monday, two former prime ministers from opposing camps,
Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, jointly appealed to the Knesset to
repeal direct elections for the prime minister, a system introduced
in the 1996 elections that helped the telegenic Netanyahu to power.

Former top official says 1999 budget is ``phony''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russia saying it won't make Soviet debt payment
due Tuesday, other details, new grafs 11-14, tax evasion figures,
two bottom grafs. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former top government official on Monday
assailed the Cabinet's budget for next year as a ``phony'' document
that would only aggravate Russia's economic crisis.
	   Former First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov said the
unrealistic budget would further fuel inflation and erode the
ruble's value.
	   Fyodorov predicted that the ruble next year would drop by at
least 40 percent from its current level of 21 to the dollar, while
inflation would amount to a minimum of 60 percent, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   ``There is concern that the situation will get out of hand
within the next few months,'' Fyodorov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar, and forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year _
targets most experts consider unrealistic.
	   Fyodorov said the government's sole response to the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse was ``the banal idea of
printing extra money'' to pay off huge debts.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top officials have
said the government had been careful in printing new cash, for fear
of fueling inflation. They warned, however, that the Cabinet would
have to turn to large-scale money-printing if foreign lenders fail
to release new loans.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have urged
Russia to pass a tenable budget as a key condition for providing
more aid.
	   The government has already factored in dlrs 7.2 billion in
foreign loans, although they may not come. It also expects to pay
only about one half of the dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt
payments maturing next year, although no agreement with creditors
has been reached yet.
	   Fyodorov called the budget a ``fiction'' and criticized the
parliament for giving it a quick initial approval last week. ``The
irresponsibility of parliament in passing the draft budget in first
reading is obvious,'' he said.
	   Russia was also scheduled to pay dlrs 362 million in Soviet-era
debt by Tuesday _ but the government announced on Monday it will
not be paying because enough holders of the debt have permitted a
rescheduling.
	   Russia was to get permission from 95 percent of investors to
secure a rescheduling of the Principal Notes payments, but only
two-thirds have agreed so far.
	   Tatyana Golodyets, a spokeswoman for the government's foreign
debt agent Vneshekonombank, said Russia's proposed a
``non-essential'' amendment to the deal, which would lower the
support requirement to two-thirds of the debt holders.
	   The announcement is likely to provoke an intense legal battle
with the London Club of commercial creditors, and Western investors
are likely to declare Russia in default if it doesn't make the
payment, analysts have warned.
	   Government statistics, released on Monday, underscored the depth
of Russia's crisis.
	   Imports are likely to decrease by 25 percent this year compared
to 1997, Russian customs chief Valery Draganov said at a news
conference.
	   Imports fell drastically as the ruble's devaluation has made
them increasingly expensive and unaffordable for many Russians.
Exports also have fallen by 17 percent, mostly due to the decrease
in world prices for oil, Russia's main export item.
	   Russia's Gross Domestic Product appears to have fallen deeper
than expected. The GDP fell by 3.3 percent during the first nine
months of the year, instead of 3 percent as reported earlier, the
State Statistics Committee said.
	   Meanwhile, the tax police estimated Monday that tax evasion has
cost Russia 8.99 billion rubles (dlrs 440 million) in the first 11
months of this year.
	   Some 17,000 cases of tax evasion have been reported. Criminal
proceedings have been instituted against 5,625 tax dodgers, and
1,097 people have been convicted, the tax police said, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen kidnapped 16 Western
tourists Monday, including 12 Britons, two Americans and two
Australians, tribal leaders and security officials said.
	   They said about 10 armed tribesmen opened fire on a number of
policemen escorting a group of 17 tourists as they traveled in a
convoy of 15 vehicles near the southern town of Mawdiyah, in the
Abyan province.
	   Abyan is about 200 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital,
San`a.
	   No one was injured in the firefight, but a British tourist and a
Yemeni guide managed to escape, said the tribal leaders, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   The remaining 16 tourists were abducted and driven to an unknown
destination in Abyan, they added.
	   They gave no other details and said the kidnappers' demands were
not immediately known.
	   Security officials, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the kidnappings but could not provide any details.
	   British and American diplomats in San`a were not immediately
available for comment. Australia has no diplomatic representation
in San`a.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said they had heard of the
kidnappings from the British Embassy in Sana`a.
	   ``We are in close touch with the Yemen authorities in Sana`a and
London and we are seeking clarification about the incident,'' said
the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``We have made it clear that our top priority is the safe and
swift return of the hostages,'' he added.
	   Monday's abduction brings to 20 the total number of Westerners
held hostage in Yemen.
	   Members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe are holding four Germans _
three women and one man _ in the province of Marib, 170 kilometers
(105 miles) northeast of San`a. The tribesmen are pressing the
government to provide more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and
roads.
	   The Germans were seized on Dec. 7.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their hands. The hostages are usually treated well and
released unhurt.

Major parties agree to May 17 election date
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; UPDATES with decision going to law
committee tomorrow &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's major parties set May 17 as an
election date on Monday, a sign that a threat by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to declare statehood before then has receded and will
not influence the campaign.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had wanted to set the
elections for before May 4 _ Arafat's deadline _ in order to
maximize the threat of Palestinian statehood in his hard-line
campaign.
	   ``We agreed on the 17th of May,'' said Meir Shetreet, a senior
government legislator, after a day of negotiations with the
opposition Labor party. ``It must pass the law committee and the
Knesset next week, but there is wide support, so there's no reason
why it shouldn't.''.
	   Netanyahu has recently emphasized the threat of Palestinian
independence _ May 4 is the five-year deadline for a final peace
agreement, under the Oslo accords _ countering with a threat to
annex parts of the West Bank.
	   ``Arafat knows if he declares a Palestinian state unilaterally,
t means canceling Oslo,'' Netanyahu threatened Sunday, opening the
elections campaign. Netanyahu sees statehood as posing a security
threat to Israel.
	   But Arafat, fearful of helping hard-liner Netanyahu to power,
indicated Monday he was backing down from his intention to declare
statehood on May 4.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of using such emotive
issues to get out of his peace commitments.
	   A Palestinian negotiator suggested earlier in the day that
Arafat would not go through with the declaration if it would help
Netanyahu get re-elected.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour told
The Associated Press, when asked whether Arafat was still wedded to
a May 4 independence declaration.
	   Netanyahu said Sunday reports that Arafat would back off the May
4 declaration was proof that the opposition Labor party was
colluding with Arafat in order to topple him.
	   ``Arafat is considering postponing the declaration because of
the elections,'' Netanyahu told his Likud party's central
committee. ``He wants to hold final status discussions with a
left-wing goverment.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak described that as ``incitement''
typical of Netanyahu's political style.
	   A later elections date will also help contain the threat to both
major parties posed by the probable candidacy of a popular general.
	   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former chief-of-staff, has been leading
both Netanyahu and Labor party leader Ehud Barak in the polls _
largely because as a soldier, he was prohibited from making
political statements, and was able to remain above the fray.
	   Shahak retired his uniform last week to declare his interest in
joining an as yet-unformed centrist party.
	   Barak and Netanyahu both hope that a long elections campaign
will force Shahak to make his opinions clear, and shave his support
in the polls. The parties set June 1 as a run-off date if neither
candidate gets a clear majority.
	   Earlier Monday, in the third challenge to Netanyahu from a Likud
scion, the only son of Menachem Begin on Monday declared his
candidacy for prime minister.
	   Benny Begin's candidacy underscored the prime minister's growing
isolation in the party his father once led, although the younger
Begin lacks popular appeal.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
running for prime minister on a centrist slate. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat are
debating whether to leave the Likud, possibly to join Meridor.
	   Netanyahu is also being challenged from within the party by Uzi
Landau, a hard-liner who, like Begin, opposes ceding further lands
to the Palestinians. Landau has little chance, but it is
practically unheard of for a sitting prime minister to be
challenged within his party.
	   Netanyahu denied that his support within the party was
collapsing.
	   ``The party is very solid and very unified around the direction
we have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he said Monday.
	   Yet later the same day, his government failed to garner enough
legislators to pass an ancillary bill necessary to allow passage of
a budget bill. Two members of the coalition abstained and others _
including senior Likud figures _ were absent from the chamber.
	   ``This government is out of control,'' said Labor legislator
Avraham Shohat. ``It doesn't have a majority, it doesn't have a
finance minister, it doesn't have the ability to manage the country
financially and it doesn't have a budget.''
	   Netanyahu agreed to early elections last week when he could not
get a majority in parliament to back his security policies.
	   Likud hard-liners were outraged that he agreed to cede more
territory to the Palestinians at U.S.-brokered talks in Wye River,
Maryland in October. Doves are exasperated with Netanyahu for
freezing Wye soon after the agreement, for what he says were
Palestinian violations.
	   On Monday, two former prime ministers from opposing camps,
Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, jointly appealed to the Knesset to
repeal direct elections for the prime minister, a system introduced
in the 1996 elections that helped the telegenic Netanyahu to power.

Four U.S. football coaches fired in offseason purge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with quotes from Rhodes, Wannstedt &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The offseason purge of U.S. football coaches
began quickly Monday.
	   Within one hour, Dom Capers of Carolina, Dave Wannstedt of
Chicago,Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore and Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia
were fired, beginning what looks to be a postseason of NFL coaching
casualties.
	   Capers and Rhodes, both former coaches of the year, have already
been mentioned for vacancies. Capers is a candidate for the
openings in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and Rhodes is a candidate
in Green Bay, where Mike Holmgren has the option of getting out of
his contract for a coach-general manager position elsewhere.
	   The biggest surprise may have been Wannstedt's dismissal in
Chicago, even though he finished 4-12 for the second straight year.
His team played hard every week and even owner Mike McCaskey
conceded that the team's talent level was lower than needed to
compete in the U.S. National Football League.
	   ``This is a very disappointing day for me and my family,''
Wannstedt said at a news conference with McCaskey. ``I do respect
his decision for making what he feels is the best decision for the
organization.''
	   Wannstedt acknowledged that a number of mistakes in drafting and
signing free agents were made during his tenure.
	   ``We have a good nucleus of players and we need to increase the
talent level,'' McCaskey said.
	   Capers, the only coach the Panthers have had in their four
seasons, was fired two seasons after taking the team to the NFC
championship game in its second year. But Carolina finished 7-9
last year and 4-12 this season as it fell apart on the field and
within the locker room.
	   Rhodes also lasted four years, taking the Eagles to the playoffs
in his first two. But he fought with the front office from the
start and this season the team collapsed, falling to 3-13 with the
worst offense in the league.
	   ``When you don't win, changes have to be made. This is part of
the business,'' Rhodes said.
	   Marchibroda, meanwhile, came from Indianapolis to an unsettled
situation in Baltimore, taking over the Ravens the year after they
moved from Cleveland.
	   The team was 16-31-1 under Marchibroda, including 6-10 this
season. They won three straight games only once and never came
close to reaching the playoffs.
	   The firing left five vacancies _ June Jones of San Diego has
already taken the coaching job at the University of Hawaii. Among
other coaches whose jobs were in jeopardy were Dennis Erickson of
Seattle and Norv Turner of Washington _ although any move in
Washington wouldn't be made until the team is sold.
	   Bruce Coslet of Cincinnati is also on shaky ground after a 3-13
season, although the Bengals will probably keep him so they don't
have to pay the remaining years of his contract.
	   San Francisco's Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a contract
extension and could move on, perhaps to the expansion team in
Cleveland.

Armenia ready to resume negotiations over Nagorno-Karabakh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Armenia is prepared to resume negotiations with
Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, the
Armenian and Russian foreign ministers said Monday.
	   Meeting in the Russian capital, Igor Ivanov of Russia and Vardan
Oskanian of Armenia discussed the possibility of resuming talks
with the assistance of Russia and the Minsk Group of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds over the status of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a majority Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.
	   Ivanov said Russia was eager to help, and denied suggestions
that it had a strategic interest in preserving conflicts within the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose coalition of
post-Soviet nations.
	   ``Russia is not interested in the preservation of any conflict
situations on the territory of the CIS,'' Ivanov said, according to
ITAR-Tass. ``On the contrary, we are interested in their full and
final settlement, because this is in line with our national,
strategic, long-term interests, and we intend to promote it.''
	   Speaking about the prospects of negotiations with Azerbaijan,
Oskanian told reporters that ``the main question for us is to
resume talks on equal terms.''
	   ``We hope that we will be able to do this next year with the
help of the Minsk Group and Russia,'' he added.

	   SURAT, India (AP) _ Hindu radicals torched a bamboo church and
ransacked three others, according to local reports, while
Christians huddled in remote villages in the face of a wave of
religious violence that erupted on Christmas day.
	   Mobs set ablaze a church made of bamboo in Mulchand village, 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Surat, a prosperous town in Gujarat
state, police said.
	   Missionaries said attackers stormed three other churches and a
prayer hall in three villages in Dangs district, 140 kilometers (85
miles) south of Surat. Police were unable to confirm the attacks.
	   ``All three churches have been badly damaged,'' said the Rev.
T.V. Gaikwad, in Ahwa village, where the first attack took place on
Christmas Day. ``A mob with axes, iron bars and hammers attacked
the churches,'' he said.
	   Police arrested 38 people in connection with the attacks, State
Interior Minister Haren Pandya said.
	   While police guarded churches in cities, the small makeshift
chapels of wood, bamboo and brick common to Dang's 320 remote
villages were vulnerable to the attacks. Barely 100 policemen were
available to patrol the hilly and inhospitable terrain.
	   The area is 900 kilometers (550 miles) southwest of the capital,
New Delhi.
	   Hindus blamed Christians for the latest violence.
	   ``I'm not saying the attack by the Hindus didn't take place.
We're saying that ours was the reaction. They attacked us first,''
said Ashwin Modi, president of the Bajrang Dal, a tiny group often
known for enforcing its policies through violence.
	   ``We will not allow this to happen again. The next time they hit
us, the consequences will be dangerous,'' Modi said.
	   Members of two fringe right-wing Hindu parties that have been
blamed for most of the recent attacks say missionaries convert
poor, often illiterate tribal members to Christianity, promising
them jobs or giving them other inducements.
	   Christian leaders say the violence is politically motivated and
is being fanned by Hindu groups linked to the governing Bharatiya
Janata Party. They complain of inadequate protection by authorities
in Gujarat.
	   Christians make up just 2 percent of India's nearly 1 billion
people, while Hindus account for 80 percent and Muslims 12 percent.
	   India's Christians mostly live in the four southern states,
where such clashes were rare in the past. Attacks on Christians
have increased since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
came to power in New Delhi in March.
	   The latest violence erupted Dec. 25, when militants attacked two
Catholic schools, a hospital and three churches. More than 10
people were injured in a hail of stones. More mob attacks on
Christians and their institutions were reported over the weekend.
	   Members of the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad parties
_ Hindu right-wing groups closely linked to the ruling BJP_ held
rallies Monday across Gujrat to protest what they called forcible
conversion of low-caste Hindus.
	   ``Wake up Hindus!'' and ``Down with Christian missionaries!''
they chanted outside government offices.
	   Although Hindu and Muslim religious groups also run schools and
hospitals in remote villages, Christian missionaries have been
targeted for actively encouraging conversion to their religion.
	   ``We feel insecure,'' said Sister Carmen Borges, principal of
Deep Darshan school, near Mulchand, site of the latest attack.
	   Madhusudan Mistry of Eklavya Sanghathan, an organization that
fights for rights of the tribes, accused the state government of
supporting the Hindu militants.
	   Some Christians said they believe the Hindu parties fear
Christian activities could cost them votes.
	   ``We've put up schools, hospitals in remote villages.
Empowerment is a threat,'' the Rev. Cedric Prakash, director of the
St. Xaviers Social Service Society, said. ``Some villagers do
become Christians, but they are a minority. Basically people come
to our schools for education.''

Koznick wins her first World Cup race of the season

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) - Kristina Koznick of the United States
clinched her first World Cup victory of the season Monday, winning
the night slalom in Semmering.
	   Koznick, whose previous season-best had been second place in
slalom at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, Dec. 20, twisted her way around
the 58 gates down the Hirschenkogel course in a two-run combined
time of 1 minute, 40.49 seconds, beating Switzerland's Karin Roten
in second place by 0.84 seconds.
	   Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden clocked the third fastest time, coming
home in 1:41.37, 0.51 seconds ahead of Spela Pretnar of Slovenia.
	   The 23-year old American, runner-up in the World Cup slalom
standings last season, was second after the first run, trailing
Pretnar by 0.01 seconds. But she posted a brilliant second leg,
clinching her second career World Cup victory.
	   Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, also improved
considerably in the second run, jumping from fifth place to third.
	   The slalom standings leader, Swedish teen Anja Paerson, veered
off the course midway down the first run.
	   Trude Bakke of Norway, fourth after the first run, also didn't
finish, dropping out in the second leg.
	   Despite not starting in Monday's slalom, Alexandra Meissnitzer
of Austria has held on to her whopping lead atop the overall World
Cup standings, where she sits with 891 points.

Russia's population falls to 146.4 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's population fell by 311,000 in the first
10 months of this year and stood at 146.4 million on Nov. 1,
according to official figures released Monday.
	   The decline appeared to have slowed down compared to the same
period last year, when population shrunk by 335,200, according to
State Statistics Committee figures carried by the Interfax news
agency.
	   In January through October, 1.085 million babies were born,
compared to 1.069 million during the same period last year, and
1.654 million people died, compared to 1.689 million last year,
Interfax reported.
	   Nearly 440,000 migrants moved to Russia in the first eleven
months of this year, compared to 490,200 during the same period in
1997, and 174,500 Russians left the country, compared to 196,600

	   A look at the two no-fly zones the United States and its Gulf
War allies imposed on Iraq:
	   ___
	   SOUTHERN NO-FLY ZONE: Imposed by U.S., British and French forces
in August 1992 to protect Shiite Muslim Iraqis. President Saddam
Hussein's forces had crushed a Shiite uprising soon after the end
of the Gulf War in February 1991. In 1996, U.S. President Bill
Clinton extended the zone in response to Saddam's military
intervention in northern Iraq in support of one Kurdish faction
against another. The zone now covers the southern third of Iraq,
reaching the 33rd parallel, and touches the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   NORTHERN NO-FLY ZONE: In April 1991, the United States, France
and Britain declared a 19,000-square-mile (49,000-sq.-kilometer)
area of northern Iraq a haven for Kurds and imposed a no-fly zone
above the 36th parallel. U.S. and British warplanes still patrol
the skies of northern Iraq. France withdrew from the mission in
1996.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's population fell by 311,000 in the first
10 months of this year and stood at 146.4 million on Nov. 1,
according to official figures released Monday.
	   The decline appeared to have slowed down compared to the same
period last year, when population shrunk by 335,200, according to
State Statistics Committee figures carried by the Interfax news
agency.
	   In January through October, 1.085 million babies were born,
compared to 1.069 million during the same period last year, and
1.654 million people died, compared to 1.689 million last year,
Interfax reported.
	   Nearly 440,000 migrants moved to Russia in the first 10 months
of this year, compared to 490,200 during the same period in 1997,
and 174,500 Russians left the country, compared to 196,600 last
year, Interfax said.
	   The Soviet Union had more than 288 million people in all of its

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With both sides now apparently
respecting a cease-fire, U.N. officials turned their attention
Monday to helping civilians who fled four days of fighting between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians in northern Kosovo that left at least 15
people dead.
	   Thousands of refugees fled into snow-covered hills to escape the
fighting, according to U.N. and ethnic Albanian sources.
	   No clashes were reported Monday in the Serbian province, Jorgen
Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, said.
	   Grunnet said both sides were generally respecting a truce
negotiated Sunday by the American head of the OSCE peace
verification force, William Walker, which ended clashes around
Podujevo, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Pristina, the
provincial capital.
	   The fighting put new strains on an already fragile peace accord
reached Oct. 12 between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, which ended seven months of fighting.
	   In neighboring Albania, the country's parliament called Monday
for NATO to intervene in the embattled Serbian province, saying
that was the only way to prevent a humanitarian disaster and open
the way to a ``political solution.''
	   And Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova,
urged Western powers to step up diplomatic efforts toward a lasting
political settlement and prevent ``ethnic cleansing'' by Serb
forces.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed in fighting since
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic began an offensive against
the ethnic Albanian rebels in February, and about 300,000 people
have been driven from their homes. The majority of Kosovo's 2
million population are ethnic Albanians, and rebels are battling
for independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, run by Rugova's party, claimed
15,000 people had been displaced by the recent fighting, which
erupted Dec. 24 when government forces attacked strongholds of
ethnic Albanian rebels searching for the killers of a Serb
policeman.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Maki Shinohara,
estimated the number of displaced people at about 5,000 and said
humanitarian workers were trying to provide them with food,
blankets and other supplies.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew touring the area of the
most recent fighting on Monday found villages deserted by civilians
but housing some Kosovo Liberation Army fighters.
	   Some of those who fled crowded homes in Bradas, a village about
30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) north of Pristina. Some, like
Hamida Degoli, complained of the difficulties of being on the run
on foot with snow deep in some places and temperatures far below
freezing.
	   ``We don't know what to do, we left everything behind,'' said
Degoli, 72, who made her way to Bradas from Velika Reka, about 10
kilometers (six miles) away.
	   Nearby, in Lapastica village, a crowd of residents attended the
funeral of two ethnic Albanian guerrillas killed in the recent
fighting. About 50 Kosovo Liberation Army fighters were also
present, dressed in black and clutching automatic weapons.
	   The ethnic Albanian media center said the death toll from the
four days of fighting rose Monday to 15 with the death of a wounded
KLA fighter and the discovery of a civilian's body west of
Podujevo.
	   Despite the violence, Walker, head of the OSCE's Kosovo
Verification Mission, sought to dispel fears that the province was
on the brink of full-scale war. He called the fighting ``sporadic''
and said both sides ``are being relatively cautious.''
	   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Ignor Ivanov blamed the
ethnic Albanians for provoking the violence to derail negotiations
on the province's long-term future, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Russia has long sided with Serbs in the conflict in the
predominantly Albanian province.

Major parties agree to May 17 election date
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with date set for elections, quotes,
details &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's major parties set May 17 as an
election date on Monday, a sign that a Palestinian threat to
declare a state before then has receded and will not influence the
campaign.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had wanted to set the
elections for before May 4 _ Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat's
deadline for independence _ in order to maximize the threat of
Palestinian statehood in his hard-line campaign.
	   ``We agreed on the 17th of May,'' said Meir Shetreet, a senior
government legislator, after a day of negotiations with the
opposition Labor party. ``It must pass the law committee and the
Knesset next week, but there is wide support, so there's no reason
why it shouldn't.''.
	   Netanyahu has recently emphasized the threat of Palestinian
independence, countering with a threat to annex parts of the West
Bank.
	   ``Arafat knows if he declares a Palestinian state unilaterally,
it means canceling Oslo,'' Netanyahu said Sunday, referring to the
peace accord signed nearly five years ago. Netanyahu sees statehood
as posing a security threat to Israel.
	   But Palestinians, fearful of helping Netanyahu, indicated Monday
they were backing down from the threatened deadline.
	   ``The political leadership will decide on the issue of the
declaration of the Palestinian state in accordance with the
national interests of the Palestinian people,'' Hassan Asfour told
The Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu said Sunday reports that Palestinians' willingness to
hold off the declaration was proof that the opposition Labor party
was colluding with Arafat to topple him.
	   ``Arafat is considering postponing the declaration because of
the elections,'' Netanyahu told his Likud party's central
committee. ``He wants to hold final status discussions with a
left-wing goverment.''
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak described that as ``incitement''
typical of Netanyahu's political style.
	   A later elections date will also help contain the threat to both
major parties posed by the probable candidacy of a popular general.
	   Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former army chief-of-staff, has been
leading both Netanyahu and Barak in the polls _ largely because as
a soldier, he was prohibited from making political statements, and
was able to remain above the fray.
	   Shahak retired his uniform last week to declare his interest in
joining an as yet-unformed centrist party.
	   Barak and Netanyahu both hope that a long elections campaign
will force Shahak to make his opinions clear, and shave his support
in the polls. The parties set June 1 as a run-off date if neither
candidate gets a clear majority.
	   Earlier Monday, in the third challenge to Netanyahu from a Likud
scion, the only son of Menachem Begin on Monday declared his
candidacy for prime minister.
	   Benny Begin's candidacy underscored the prime minister's growing
isolation in the party Begin's father once led, although the
younger Begin lacks popular appeal.
	   Another Likud breakaway, former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, is
running for prime minister on a centrist slate. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Communications Minister Limor Livnat are
debating whether to leave Likud, possibly to join Meridor.
	   Netanyahu is also being challenged from within the party by Uzi
Landau, a hard-liner who, like Begin, opposes ceding further lands
to the Palestinians. Landau has little chance, but it is
practically unheard of for a sitting prime minister to be
challenged within his party.
	   Netanyahu denied that his support within the party was
collapsing.
	   ``The party is very solid and very unified around the direction
we have taken to bring Israel peace and security,'' he said Monday.
	   Yet later the same day, his government failed to garner enough
legislators to pass an ancillary bill necessary to allow passage of
a budget bill. Two members of the coalition abstained and others _
including senior Likud figures _ were absent from the chamber.
	   ``This government is out of control,'' said Labor legislator
Avraham Shohat. ``It doesn't have a majority, it doesn't have a
finance minister, it doesn't have the ability to manage the country
financially and it doesn't have a budget.''

New Year's on Mir: Tree, Santa and gifts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cosmonauts intend to have a traditional
New Year's celebration in space, including a tree, a weightless
Santa Claus and gifts, a Russian news agency reported Monday.
	   The report from the ITAR-Tass news agency did not explain how
the cosmonauts managed to get a tree into space, although a
collapsible plastic one could easily have been slipped into a cargo
ship. Nor did it say who would don the long robes and beard of
Grandfather Frost, Russia's Santa Claus.
	   Most Russians either ignore Christmas or hold primarily
religious observations on Jan. 7, the Russian Orthodox Christmas.
The major winter holiday remains New Year's, for which Russians
have adopted many practices associated with Christmas in the West.
	   The cosmonauts' families were allowed to send New Year's gifts
to Mir in October.
	   ``We have to ... write on them, `Do not open until Dec. 31,'''
said Maria Avdeyev, the wife of cosmonaut Sergei Avdeyev, who will
also be celebrating his 43rd birthday on Jan. 1.
	   The cosmonauts have stashed some delicacies for the holiday,
ITAR-Tass reported. Russian space agency rules prohibit cosmonauts
from bringing liquor aboard Mir, but it is apparently a rule that
was made to be broken, and vodka has found its way onto the space
station in the past.

Israeli allocations bill fails first reading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An ancillary bill required to pass Israel's
1999 budget failed to pass in parliament on Monday, another sign
that the government was crumbling.
	   Coalition members in the Knesset, reacted with shouts of dismay
at the surprising 55-55 vote. The coalition had delayed the reading
until its leaders were sure of its passage.
	   A surprised-looking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consulted
with colleagues at the cabinet table, as a Knesset official recited
the names of members who abstained or who were absent _ including
senior government figures.
	   The budget bill itself passed in a first reading in November and
must pass second and third readings by Dec. 31.
	   If the budget and ancillary bills do not pass by then, as
expected, the ministries will be allocated one-twelfth of their
1998 budget each month, adjusted for inflation.
	   The Knesset voted last week to dissolve itself and hold early
elections when hard-liners and doves united against Netanyahu's
peace policies. Elections have been set for May 17.

India, Sri Lanka to establish free trade area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Sri Lanka agreed Monday to set
up a free trade area and promote more ties between themselves.
	   The agreement was signed by Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga in New Delhi at the beginning of a two-day official
visit after she met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee.
	   The two sides also sign a memorandum of understanding to set up
an India-Sri Lanka Foundation that will promote exchanges in the
arts, culture, trade, commerce and science and technology, said
Dinesh Patnaik, a Foreign Ministry official.
	   The free trade agreement provides for elimination of customs
tariffs over several years.
	   India's Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, who signed the deal,
called it historic and pathbreaking. He said it would promote
economic equality through economic integration.
	   Last July, India announced steps to liberalize trade with six of
its neighbors, saying the move will increase their access to the
vast Indian market.
	   India's initiative came as the regional grouping of India, Sri
Lanka and five other countries seemed to be falling behind the
target of setting up a free trade zone in South Asia by 2001 on the
pattern of Europe.
	   Experts say the target date may have to be set back by up to
five years because of fears by Pakistan and smaller countries that
India would dominate their markets.
	   The current trade between India and Sri Lanka is heavily in
favor of India, with exports valued at dlrs 560 million and imports
just dlrs 42 million.
	   A meeting with Indian business leaders also is scheduled for
Tuesday before Kumaratunga flies back home later in the day.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The rebel group UNITA said Monday it had
no information about a U.N.-chartered cargo plane that crashed in
an area where rebels and the army are engaged in fierce fighting.
	   The C-130 aircraft carrying 14 people crashed Saturday at Vila
Nova near the city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles)
southeast of the capital, Luanda, according to the United Nations.
	   ``We don't know anything about it,'' UNITA Secretary-general
Paulo Lukamba Gato said by satellite telephone. ``There's heavy
fighting in all that area.''
	   The government says the plane crashed in a UNITA-controlled
area, and the United Nations has appealed to both the rebels and
the government to guarantee safe passage for a search and rescue
team.
	   Gato said he had not received the United Nation's request for
safe passage, and that he could not comment on the request until it
was presented directly to the UNITA leadership.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department issued a statement
offering its condolences and adding its call for a cease-fire to
aid search crews. The State Department also called on both sides to
provide security guarantees and support to the searchers.
	   Gato denied, 6th graf pvs

	   The C-130 aircraft carrying 14 people crashed Saturday at Vila
Nova near the city of Huambo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles)
southeast of the capital, Luanda, according to the United Nations.
	   ``We don't know anything about it,'' UNITA Secretary-general
Paulo Lukamba Gato said by satellite telephone. ``There's heavy
fighting in all that area.''
	   The government says the plane crashed in a UNITA-controlled
area, and the United Nations has appealed to both the rebels and
the government to guarantee safe passage for a search and rescue
team.
	   Gato said he had not received the United Nation's request for
safe passage, and that he could not comment on the request until it
was presented directly to the UNITA leadership.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department issued a statement
offering its condolences and adding its call for a cease-fire to
aid search crews. The State Department also called on both sides to
provide security guarantees and support to the searchers.
	   Gato denied the government's accusation that rebel forces
advancing on Huambo shot down the plane about 10 minutes after it
took off from the city.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N.
colors, and both sides were informed of the flight's schedule
before takeoff, the United Nations said.
	   The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a
Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   Eight of the passengers were members of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola, and two were employed by a private
communications company, Dinacom, which works with the United
Nations, Hamadoun Toure, a U.N. official in Luanda, said Sunday.
	   The observer mission, which is monitoring a 1994 peace accord
that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels and the
government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting.
	   ``The government broke off dialogue with us, so now we're
talking with weapons,'' Gato said. He added that he had no
information on the number of casualties from the fighting, which
erupted Dec. 4.
	   The main battles have focused on the central highland cities of
Huambo and Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east, which
provide a traditional powerbase for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop in Kuito said the government-held city
had been relatively calm since heavy shelling by UNITA last week
that reportedly killed some 200 people.
	   ``We are only hearing sporadic fire in the distance,'' Bishop
Jose Nambi said by phone.
	   The government said Monday its forces had knocked out UNITA's
forward artillery position in Ceilunga, a village 15 kilometers (10
miles) north of Kuito, over the weekend and killed 34 UNITA troops.
There was no information on government casualties.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Interior Ministry saying at least
30,000 registered so far for local elections; ADDS comments by
hard-line official. NO PICKUP. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ At least 30,000 candidates signed up Monday
_ on the first of day registration _ to run in Iran's municipal
elections, scheduled for Feb. 26.
	   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, which oversees the
elections, said the number did not cover registration throughout
the country and the total figure was probably as many as 50,000.
	   ``This echoed the nation's great enthusiasm for the event,''
said the spokesman, Jahanbakhsh Khanjani. His comments were carried
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   The registration is to last a week.
	   Balloting for mayors and municipal councils _ the first to be
held since the 1979 Islamic revolution _ will be the next contest
between hard-liners and moderates who support President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   The Interior Ministry will approve candidates from an
anticipated 800,000 applicants.
	   There are 10,000 municipalities in Iran, and voters will be
selecting mayors and governing councils. Upwards of 200,000 people
will be elected to manage local government affairs and advise the
central government on social and cultural activities.
	   A victory by moderate candidates would be seen as an endorsement
of Khatami and create a broad base of support for his efforts to
create a less restrictive society.
	   Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-liner and a senior member of the
influential Expediency Council, urged Iranians to put aside
``political prejudices and factionalism'' and take part in
February's elections.
	   ``All the sympathetic and self-sacrificing people who have tried
to protect the achievements of the Islamic revolution... should now
enter the election arena honestly in order to serve our decent
people and the Islamic system,'' Rezaei told IRNA.
	   He called on judicial and executive institutions to ``provide an
environment conducive to the people's participation'' in the
elections.
	   The Expediency Council acts as consultative and advisory body to
the government and leadership.
	   Since Khatami's election in May 1997, hard-liners have resisted
his efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and to
reduce Islamic strictures on average Iranians _ reforms that seem
to have widespread public support.
	   Moderates hope the municipal elections will produce a huge
turnout similar to the one that gave Khatami his own victory.
	   In the 1997 presidential vote, 30 million of Iran's 38.5 million
eligible voters cast ballots, 20 million of them for Khatami.
	   In last October's elections for the Assembly of Experts, a
hard-line council vetted the would-be candidates, and many
moderates were not allowed to run.
	   Moderates gained just 13 of the assembly's 86 seats in October.

16 Westerners taken hostage by tribesmen in Yemen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen kidnapped 16 Western
tourists Monday, including 12 Britons, two Americans and two
Australians, tribal leaders and security officials said.
	   They said about 10 armed tribesmen opened fire on police
officers escorting a group of tourists as they traveled in a convoy
near the southern town of Mawdiyah, in the Abyan province.
	   No one was injured in the firefight. A British tourist and a
Yemeni guide managed to escape, the tribal leaders said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The remaining 16 tourists were abducted and driven to an unknown
destination in Abyan, they said. Abyan is about 200 kilometers (175
miles) south of the capital, San`a.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to take the law
into their hands. The hostages are usually treated well and
released unhurt.
	   The kidnappers' demands were not immediately known, tribal
leaders said.
	   Security officials, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the kidnappings but could not provide details.
	   British and American diplomats in San`a were not immediately
available for comment. Australia has no diplomatic representation
in San`a.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was in touch
with Yemeni authorities.
	   ``We have made it clear that our top priority is the safe and
swift return of the hostages,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Monday's abduction brings to 20 the total number of Westerners
held hostage in Yemen.
	   Members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe are holding four Germans _
three women and one man _ in the province of Marib, 170 kilometers
(105 miles) northeast of San`a. The tribesmen are pressing the
government to provide more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and
roads.
	   The Germans were seized Dec. 7.

3 Greeks in speedboat retrace 6,500-mile route of explorer 22
</HEADLINE>
centuries ago &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Arriving two months late and chilled to
their toes, three adventurers stepped off their inflatable
speedboat Monday evening in Stockholm, the end of a voyage that
began in Salonica last August and retraced the route of another
Greek explorer 22 centuries ago.
	   ``We experienced a lot of emotions: hunger, hate, fear,'' said
Kamilo Nollas, 29, a photographer. ``We learned a lot about
ourselves.''
	   The idea of the trip was to follow in the footsteps of an
explorer named Pitheas who did it two centuries before the birth of
Christ. With Nollas were lifelong friends Vladimiros Levidis, 27, a
painter, and Alexis Daras, 25, a photographer.
	   Casting off Aug. 28 in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, things
looked easy.
	   ``We started in summer. It was like a holiday,'' Nollas said in
a telephone interview. ``We swam in beaches in Italy, France,
Portugal, Spain.''
	   The 6,500-nautical mile journey was expected to take about two
months. But bad weather slowed them down a little, and engine
problems forced a delay of another two weeks.
	   By the time they made their way to Scandinavia, it was December
and they were pressing ahead 100 to 150 miles a day in order to
arrive before yearend.
	   If the cold was disagreeable, Nollas was philosophical. In early
December, the Baltic Sea was icy. Their late arrival coincided with
an unexpected thaw.
	   ``We could not have made it through ice,'' he said. ``So in
spite of everything, we were lucky.''

Koznick wins her first World Cup race of the season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) - Kristina Koznick of the United States
clinched her first World Cup victory of the season Monday, winning
the night slalom in Semmering.
	   Koznick, whose previous season-best had been second place in
slalom at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, Dec. 20, twisted her way around
the 58 gates down the Hirschenkogel course in a two-run combined
time of 1 minute, 40.49 seconds, beating Switzerland's Karin Roten
in second place by 0.84 seconds.
	   Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden clocked the third fastest time, coming
home in 1:41.37, 0.51 seconds ahead of Spela Pretnar of Slovenia.
	   The 23-year old American, runner-up in the World Cup slalom
standings last season, was second after the first run, trailing
Pretnar by 0.01 seconds. But she posted a brilliant second leg,
clinching her second career World Cup victory.
	   Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, also improved
considerably in the second run, jumping from fifth place to third.
	   The slalom standings leader, Swedish teen Anja Paerson, veered
off the course midway down the first run.
	   Trude Bakke of Norway, fourth after the first run, also didn't
finish, dropping out in the second leg.
	   Despite not starting in Monday's slalom, Alexandra Meissnitzer
of Austria has held on to her whopping lead atop the overall World
Cup standings, where she sits with 891 points.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Officials on Monday sought to determine
why a natural gas pipeline exploded over the weekend, killing 12
people as it sent flames racing through a poor neighborhood in
northern Colombia.
	   Eighty people were injured in the blast in Arroyo de Piedra, a
village 410 miles (680 kilometers) from Bogota in Atlantic State.
The massive explosion destroyed dozens of simple homes, sent debris
flying and downed telephone and power lines.
	   ``You have to see it. There's nothing left,'' Alvaro Arrieta,
the municipal manager in the nearby town of Larauco, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview Monday. ``The bodies were
totally charred. A lot of people ran and are too scared to
return.''
	   Five of the dead were children, consumed in fires unleashed by
the explosion which left a huge crater where houses once stood.
	   Dozens of burn victims remained hospitalized on Monday, 21 of
them in critical condition, including eight children, said Dr.
Misael Ortiz of the state health department.
	   ``Everything was transformed into an inferno ... In reality, I
don't know how we're still alive,'' said survivor Robinson Pacheco,
quoted in El Tiempo newspaper Monday. Pacheco said he dragged his
mother and daughter-in-law toward nearby hills, outrunning the
shooting flames and smoke.
	   Pipeline officials said the explosion appeared accidental. They
had ruled out sabotage by leftist rebels, who often dynamite crude
oil pipelines to protest foreign exploitation of Colombia's natural
resources.
	   ``We don't know precisely what happened. We are investigating
but there's no concrete result,'' Antonio Celia, president of the
Promigas pipeline company told Radionet radio Monday.
	   Celia said it was the first accident ever on the 15-year-old
facility carrying natural gas from northeastern Guarija State to
cities and towns across the Caribbean coast. The steel-encased
pipeline was ``in a perfect state of maintenance and operation''
before the blast, Celia said.
	   Residents of the affected neighborhood drew their gas from
pipeline, which ran five feet (1 1/2 meters) underground and passed
within 33 feet (10 meters) of Arroyo de Piedra, the company said.
	   Gov. Rodolfo Espinosa pledged to provide temporary shelter, food
and medicine for the victims. He promised state aid to rebuild
dozens of wood and cement-block homes damaged or destroyed in the
explosion. An estimated 134 people were left homeless.

Satisfaction, frustration mark second anniversary of Guatemalan

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Former guerrilla Virginia Cardona Lopez
has prospered from peace.
	   She finished her high school education, has had career training
and was given a small parcel of land in southern Guatemala, all
part of a benefit package given to 5,200 guerrillas who demobilized
after a peace agreement ended Guatemala's 36 years of civil war.
	   Yet Cardona still worries about people begging in the street and
children looking for foods scraps in the garbage.
	   As Guatemala marks the agreement's second anniversary Tuesday,
there is satisfaction that the peace has held but also frustration
that many have failed to see the promised social and economic
benefits _ despite dlrs 1.9 billion in international aid.
	   ``One of the principal reasons I took up arms and went to the
mountains was poverty,'' Cardona said. ``I was struggling for a
change of life ... not just for me, but for all the people of
Guatemala.''
	   The main beneficiaries of the peace accords have been former
combatants like Cardona. She spent 19 years as a soldier, courier
and medic for the Guatemalan Army of the poor, one of four groups
in the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, the leftist rebel
front. The group, known as the URNG, is now an opposition political
party.
	   Also benefiting were about 10 organized groups representing
46,000 people who left their homes to escape the violence. They
have bought community farms in what has become Guatemala's greatest
land reform in 50 years. Yet, thousands still wait for land.
	   Plans to strengthen civilian control of the military, improve
the judicial system and increase spending for health, education and
security also haven't been realized. They depend on constitutional
changes that haven't been passed and taxes that haven't been
collected.
	   The peace process has stagnated, said URNG Secretary-General
Jorge Soto.
	   ``While the government has been willing, and has wanted to
advance the peace program, the accords have met with obstacles from
all sides,'' he said. ``Instead of resolving them, the government
has yielded to them.''
	   The government's peace secretary, Raquel Zelaya, said she
expects constitutional reforms to be implemented by August, three
months before national elections.
	   Despite the delays, the peace accords have brought ``incredible
changes,'' she said. The violence that left an estimated 200,000
people missing or dead has ended, and the political process has
opened to people who never participated, such as women and Indians,
she said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
dozens of yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday. At
least two sailors were killed as boats capsized or sank, and rescue
helicopters hoisted 50 others to safety.
	   Four other sailors were missing and at least one was presumed
drowned. Rescue boats battled 90 mph (145 kph) winds and 35-foot
(10-meter) waves to try to reach other competitors.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off Australia's southeast coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney. Emergency flares
sent streams of red smoke into the air to help helicopters find the
orange life rafts in the huge swells.
	   The 725-mile (1166 kilometers) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59
have been forced to seek shelter and several boats have been
abandoned, race officials said.
	   Some 27 navy ships searched Monday for stranded sailors after
the calls of ``Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!'' came over the radio.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and crew members Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   Their bodies were left on the boat but attempts were being made
to recover them as soon as possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British Olympic sailor Glyn Charles was washed off the Sword of
Orion yacht Sunday night and presumed drowned.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety
Authority, said it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could
survive more than 24 hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a
superman if he makes it,'' Poke said.
	   Six crew members from the Winston Churchill yacht were plucked
from two life rafts late tonight, but three others were missing.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the life raft,'' a spokesman for
the maritime authority said.
	   Maritime spokesman David Gray said many other sailors were
injured, with dislocated shoulders, broken legs, cuts and bruises.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said. ``They really got pounded yesterday.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when his yacht capsized. Campbell was so
crippled by hypothermia that Senior Constable Barry Barclay had to
drop into the large swells from a helicopter to rescue him.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell said on television.
``There was a point I didn't think I was going to survive.''
	   An American boat named Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last
year's winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the finish line
Tuesday.
	   Forty boats were holed up in the mainland port of Eden Monday,
all with broken rigging and other signs of damage.
	   ``Everyone has been really quiet Monday since we heard about the
deaths,'' said Susie Graney from the 40-foot (12-meter) Lady
Penryhn.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ American warplanes patrolling a ``no-fly
zone'' in northern Iraq fired at an Iraqi air defense site Monday
after coming under attack, U.S. officials said. Iraq said the
missiles killed four Iraqi soldiers and injured seven others.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the pilots only fired after
being fired upon. ``They attacked because they were attacked, and
they did the appropriate thing,'' he said in Washington.
	   However, the Iraq Information Ministry claimed its moves were
defensive and forced the ``evil'' warplanes to flee.
	   U.S. and British jets patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over northern
Iraq that was set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds after their
failed uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   Monday's incident occurred just north of Mosul, according to the
Pentagon. Mosul is about 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of
Baghdad.
	   Major Tony Kemper, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-European Command
based near Stuttgart, Germany, said the planes were attacked by
Iraqi surface-to-air missiles.
	   ``The aircraft acted in self-defense and attacked the
ground-based missile launch site with HARM (High-Speed Anti
Radiation) missiles and precision-guide munitions,'' she said.
``There was no damage to coalition aircraft and all crew returned
safely to Incirlik airbase (in Turkey).''
	   She added that officials were still trying to assess the damage
to Iraqi forces.
	   U.S. pilots said the Iraqis launched three missiles and used
radar to lock onto U.S. planes, said a U.S. defense official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The Americans scored at least two
direct hits against the anti-aircraft site, the official said.
	   British planes were not involved in the incident, according to a
spokesman for the British defense ministry in London.

Iraq describes U.S. attack as ``aggressive and vicious act''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States of
``aggressive and vicious'' behavior Monday after U.S. warplanes
fired on its anti-aircraft guns, killing four soldiers.
	   The U.S. attack came two days after Baghdad announced it would
fire at Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   The Iraqi casualties were the first since the United States and
Britain ended four nights of airstrikes on Dec. 19. Iraq says those
raids killed 62 Iraqi soldiers and at least 40 civilians.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. pilots
opened fire in self-defense: ``They attacked because they were
attacked, and they did the appropriate thing.''
	   The incident occurred as Baghdad sought to draw on Arab sympathy
for the Iraqi people, which had emerged in widespread protests
against the U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   Iraqi delegates to a Arab Parliamentary Union meeting in Amman
Sunday had pressed the conference to call for Arab states to
violate the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq. And Baghdad was hoping
that a meeting of the Arab League, expected in Cairo on Wednesday,
would give it significant support.
	   But the Arab legislators did little more than repeat
condemnation of the airstrikes, and the Arab League postponed its
meeting to January.
	   An Iraqi military spokesman said that in Monday's clash, Western
aircraft ``approached one of our air defense weapons sites ... and
fired criminal missiles.''
	   ``These criminal and vicious actions led to the martyrdom of
four of our valiant soldiers and the wounding of seven others,''
the unidentified spokesman told the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   The spokesman said the aircraft came in two waves. Iraqi air
defenses ``confronted'' the first group ``with all valor and
capability.''
	   The second wave of warplanes ``fired criminal missiles against
one of our sites,'' killing four soldiers and wounding seven, the
spokesman said.
	   In Turkey, where the U.S. bases its planes for the northern
no-fly zone, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that according to
preliminary information, Iraq fired two missiles at the American
aircraft.
	   In Washington, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said the
clash took place near Mosul, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of
Baghdad.
	   In Stuttgart, Germany, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-European
Command, Maj. Tony Kemper, said the U.S. planes fired anti-radar
missiles and precision-guide munitions.
	   Monday's incident was the third time that Iraq has claimed to
have been attacked by Western planes since the airstrikes. The
United States and Britain have denied their planes had any role in
the earlier alleged attacks.
	   The United States and its allies set up the northern no-fly zone
to protect Kurds rebels after the 1991 Gulf War. The southern zone
was established in 1992 to protect Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   Earlier Monday, Iraq's trade minister said the country has no
immediate plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who check the
distribution of supplies under a U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program.
	   Mohammed Mehdi Saleh added, however, that the 2-year-old program
was a temporary measure and could not substitute for a lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq would accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program, which expires in May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq would reject a
continuation of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said in the Sunday interview.
	   The program allows Iraq to export dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over
six months. It is an exception to the sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   WEST ALLIS, Wisconsin (AP) _ Catherine Raney, who won both the
3,000 and 5,000 meter races, and Tim Hoffmann captured overall
titles in the U.S. Allround Speedskating Championships Monday.
	   Raney, an 18-year-old from Elm Grove, Wis., had a winning time
of 7:47.24 in the 5,000 to secure the women's Allround title at the
Pettit National Ice Center.
	   Hoffmann, of Waukesha, Wisconsin, placed first in the overall
standings despite not winning any of the four races over two days
of competition. Hoffmann finished third in both the 10,000 and
5,000 meter races.
	   Rebecca Sundstrom of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, won the women's 1,500
Monday in 2:04.58 while KC Boutiette of Tacoma, Washington claimed
the men's 1,500 with a time of 1:51.57. Jondon Trevena of Fort
Collins, Colorado, won the 10,000 in 14:25.95.
	   Some of the top skaters did not compete because they are more
concerned with qualifying for the World Allround Championships in
Hamar, Norway Feb. 6-7.
	   In past years the top overall finishers in the U.S. Allround
qualified for the world meet, but this year there is an added round
of regional qualifying.
	   U.S. skaters will compete here Jan. 8-10 against Canadian
skaters for six spots for men and six for women.
	   The U.S. Sprint Championships, for skaters who compete at 500
and 1,000 meters, will be Saturday and Sunday in Roseville,
Minnesota.

Registration opens for municipal elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Interior Ministry saying at least
30,000 registered so far for local elections; ADDS comments by
hard-line official. NO PICKUP. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ At least 30,000 candidates signed up Monday
_ on the first of day registration _ to run in Iran's municipal
elections, scheduled for Feb. 26.
	   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, which oversees the
elections, said the number did not cover registration throughout
the country and the total figure was probably as many as 50,000.
	   ``This echoed the nation's great enthusiasm for the event,''
said the spokesman, Jahanbakhsh Khanjani. His comments were carried
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   The registration is to last a week.
	   Balloting for mayors and municipal councils _ the first to be
held since the 1979 Islamic revolution _ will be the next contest
between hard-liners and moderates who support President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   The Interior Ministry will approve candidates from an
anticipated 800,000 applicants.
	   There are 10,000 municipalities in Iran, and voters will be
selecting mayors and governing councils. Upwards of 200,000 people
will be elected to manage local government affairs and advise the
central government on social and cultural activities.
	   A victory by moderate candidates would be seen as an endorsement
of Khatami and create a broad base of support for his efforts to
create a less restrictive society.
	   Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-liner and a senior member of the
influential Expediency Council, urged Iranians to put aside
``political prejudices and factionalism'' and take part in
February's elections.
	   ``All the sympathetic and self-sacrificing people who have tried
to protect the achievements of the Islamic revolution... should now
enter the election arena honestly in order to serve our decent
people and the Islamic system,'' Rezaei told IRNA.
	   He called on judicial and executive institutions to ``provide an
environment conducive to the people's participation'' in the
elections.
	   The Expediency Council acts as consultative and advisory body to
the government and leadership.
	   Since Khatami's election in May 1997, hard-liners have resisted
his efforts to grant more freedom to the press and the arts and to
reduce Islamic strictures on average Iranians _ reforms that seem
to have widespread public support.
	   Moderates hope the municipal elections will produce a huge
turnout similar to the one that gave Khatami his own victory.
	   In the 1997 presidential vote, 30 million of Iran's 38.5 million
eligible voters cast ballots, 20 million of them for Khatami.
	   In last October's elections for the Assembly of Experts, a
hard-line council vetted the would-be candidates, and many
moderates were not allowed to run.
	   Moderates gained just 13 of the assembly's 86 seats in October.

Survey shows Le Pen would profit from party's split
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A survey published Monday shows that far-right
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen would get more than twice the votes of his
rival, Bruno Megret, if the two were to compete in an election.
	   The feud between the two leaders of the National Front has
divided the party. It now appears likely that the far-right
movement will present two lists in June 1999 elections for the
European Parliament _ one headed by Le Pen, and one headed by
Megret.
	   A survey published Monday in the Liberation newspaper showed
that in such a case, Le Pen, the party's founder and leader for
more than a quarter-century, would get 10 percent of the vote, and
Megret four percent.
	   In a statement, Megret said he wasn't worried.
	   ``Commentators who are drawing consequences from such an
unrealistic survey are showing simply that, in this crisis, the
establishment has chosen Le Pen because they consider him a less
dangerous adversary,'' Megret said.
	   He said the survey had ``no significance,'' coming as it does
before a special party congress in late January called by Megret
backers to determine the party's future.
	   Le Pen, 70, has kicked Megret, 47, his longtime No. 2 man, out
of the party.
	   The survey indicated that Le Pen maintains a strong degree of
support among the traditional backers of the party he founded in
1972. The National Front generally garners about 15 percent of the
national vote.
	   The survey, by the CSA agency, polled a cross-section of 1,975
voters. No margin of error was given, but such polls usually have a
margin of error of 2 to 3 percent.

their toes, three adventurers stepped off their inflatable
speedboat Monday evening in Stockholm, the end of a voyage that
began in Salonica last August and retraced the route of another
Greek explorer 22 centuries ago.
	   ``We experienced a lot of emotions: hunger, hate, fear,'' said
Kamilo Nollas, 29, a photographer. ``We learned a lot about
ourselves.''
	   The idea of the trip was to follow in the footsteps of an
explorer named Pitheas who did it two centuries before the birth of
Christ. With Nollas were lifelong friends Vladimiros Levidis, 27, a
painter, and Alexis Daras, 25, a photographer.
	   Casting off Aug. 28 in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, things
looked easy.
	   ``We started in summer. It was like a holiday,'' Nollas said in
a telephone interview. ``We swam in beaches in Italy, France,
Portugal, Spain.''
	   The 6,500-mile (10,500-kilometer) journey was expected to take
about two months. But bad weather slowed them down a little, and
engine problems forced a delay of another two weeks.
	   By the time they made their way to Scandinavia, it was December
and they were pressing ahead 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240
kilometers) a day in order to arrive before yearend.
	   If the cold was disagreeable, Nollas was philosophical. In early
December, the Baltic Sea was icy. Their late arrival coincided with
an unexpected thaw.
	   ``We could not have made it through ice,'' he said. ``So in
spite of everything, we were lucky.''

Koznick wins her first World Cup race of the season

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with more details, quotes &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEMMERING, Austria (AP) - Kristina Koznick of the United States
clinched her first World Cup victory of the season Monday, winning
the night slalom in Semmering.
	   Koznick, whose previous season-best had been second place in
slalom at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, Dec. 20, twisted her way around
the 58 gates down the Hirschenkogel course in a two-run combined
time of 1 minute, 40.49 seconds, beating Switzerland's Karin Roten
in second place by 0.84 seconds.
	   Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden clocked the third fastest time, coming
home in 1:41.37, 0.51 seconds ahead of Spela Pretnar of Slovenia.
	   Koznick, runner-up in the World Cup slalom standings last
season, was second after the first run, trailing Pretnar by 0.01
seconds. But she posted a brilliant second leg, clinching her
second career World Cup victory.
	   ``I love night skiing,'' Koznick said, adding that her only
other World Cup victory was also a night slalom, in Are, Sweden,
last season.
	   Linked to Austria through her former coach, Koznick praised the
Semmering crowd and said skiing at night always reminds her of her
home-slope in Minnesota, where she used to practice every night
after doing her homeworks.
	   With the American team decimated by injury and retirements,
Koznick is the only skier on the team to have stepped on the World
Cup podium.
	   The 23-year old American, a native of Burnsville, Minnesota,
struggled at home during early season races in Park City, Utah, and
Mammoth Mountain, California, finishing 15th and 27th.
	   But she has slowly got into a top shape and hopes for a podium
finish in the alpine skiing World Championships at Vail Colorado,
in January.
	   ``It would be nice to win, but of course it's not only my
goal,'' she said.
	   Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, also improved
considerably in the second run, jumping from fifth place to third.
	   ``I'm happy with the third place, It's my best slalom result
this season,'' she said, adding that her main goal remains a
victory at Vail.
	   The slalom standings leader, Swedish teen Anja Paerson, veered
off the course midway down the first run.
	   Trude Bakke of Norway, fourth after the first run, also didn't
finish, dropping out in the second leg.
	   The winner of Sunday's giant slalom, home-crowd favorite Anita
Wachter, finished in a disappointing thirteenth, paying for
deteriorating snow conditions as she started from the 19th
position.
	   Despite not starting in Monday's slalom, Alexandra Meissnitzer
of Austria has held on to her whopping lead atop the overall World
Cup standings, where she sits with 891 points.
	   Martina Ertl of Germany is second with 566 points, followed by
Renate Goetschl of Austria with 485.

Italy's lotto prognosticators use killings of three policemen to
</HEADLINE>
guess lucky numbers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Italy's police unions criticized three
newspapers Monday for carrying a betting supplement that drew on
the bombing deaths of three policemen to come up with calculations
for lucky lotto numbers.
	   The lucky numbers were superimposed on a photo of the bodies one
of three policemen killed in Wednesday's bombing in the northern
city of Udine. The insert was carried by three papers in Italy's
northeast.
	   ``The incomprehensible choice offends good taste, the
sensibility and piety of the people, the sadness that has followed
this tragedy and, not least, the feelings of all the colleagues''
of the fallen men, said an open letter from one of the police union
officials, Franco Maccari, condemning the choice of lotto picks.
	   Lotto-mad Italians often turn to advice from experts in a
centuries-old Neapolitan system _ known as the ``smorfia',' or
``smirk'' _ for interpreting dreams and events for the lucky
numbers they portend.
	   In the past, interpreters had drawn on such disasters as this
month's building collapse in Rome, which killed 27 people, and the
death of Princess Diana, the management of the three papers said in
a statement Monday.
	   ``It's not a choice of the papers but, unfortunately, the cruel
laws of the smorfia,'' the statement said.
	   The three slain policemen were responding to a triggered burglar
alarm at a store when a bomb placed at the shop exploded.
Authorities believe the store owner had been targeted by an
extortion racket.

Study says `immortality enzyme' in cells does not cause cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP ) _ Appearing forever young is everybody's dream.
But, biologists wonder, what good is immortality if all those extra
years are accompanied by cancer?
	   That's the quandary posed by the discovery earlier this year
that a body substance called telomerase is an ``immortality
enzyme'' that encourages cells to keep dividing indefinitely
instead of dying with age.
	   Scientists theorized that telomerase could be used to slow the
aging process. At the same time, some feared that the enzyme could
cause cancer by letting cell division run amok.
	   Now, new experiments by the same University of Texas team of
researchers have concluded that such fears are groundless.
	   The researchers watched human cells divide hundreds of times in
test tubes and concluded that telomerase does not by itself turn
healthy cells into malignant ones. In fact, they said the enzyme
may offer promising new ways to treat cancer.
	   ``Telomerase does not cause cancer progression,'' said Woodring
Wright of the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, a co-author
of the study, published Tuesday in the January issue of the journal
Nature Genetics. ``The abnormalities seen in cancer are due to
other mutations.''
	   Other researchers said the experiment is too limited to
exonerate telomerase.
	   They said that while telomerase may not cause cancer by itself,
it appears to play a fundamental role in the growth of cancerous
cells, even if the cancer itself is triggered by, say, radiation or
a virus.
	   ``There is no simple statement that telomerase is irrelevant to
cancer,'' said Ronald DiPinho of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
of Harvard University. ``It's a very complex subject.''
	   Thomas Cech, a 1989 Nobel laureate and biochemistry professor at
the University of Colorado, said the Texas researchers looked only
at the effects of adding telomerase to a normal cell, not what
happens when telomerase is blocked in a cancer cell.
	   A year ago, Wright and colleague Jerry Shay published research
demonstrating that telomerase enables cells to keep on dividing and
avoid the normal process of aging and death.
	   Normally, human cells divide about 75 times over a lifetime. But
each time a cell divides, the telomere, or the protective end of a
chromosome, erodes. Eventually, the telomere becomes too short to
protect the chromosome. When that happens, the cell can no longer
divide and eventually dies.
	   By the time a person is an adult, most of their healthy cells no
longer contain any telomerase. But 90 percent of cancer cells have
been found to have telomerase, raising suspicions that telomerase
is linked to cancer.
	   In test-tube experiments, Wright and Shay showed that normal
cell death can be avoided by inserting a gene that instructs the
cell to produce telomerase.
	   As of late December, the cells had divided as many as 220 times
beyond their typical lifespan, and none exhibited cancerous traits
such as abnormalities in chromosomes, the researchers said.
	   At least a dozen pharmaceutical companies are in the early
stages of developing drugs that would shut down telomerase and
starve cancer of the tumor growth substance critical to its
survival.
	   Telomerase also is being considered for use in unclogging blood
vessels, restoring circulation involved in some forms of blindness,
and accelerating the healing of skin grafts.

Two reported kidnapped in disputed Georgian region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Georgian guerrillas kidnapped two Abkazhians in
the troubled Ghali district of eastern Abkhazia, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   Ghali police chief Beslan Bei said the Georgian Security
Ministry had promised to help him track down the missing
Abkhazians, who were not identified, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   It was not clear when or why the two people were kidnapped.
Abkhazian security officials said nine Abkhazians are being held
hostage in Georgia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   There have been frequent clashes in and around Abkhazia, a
disputed Georgian region that was the site of a 1992-93 war of
secession in which Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian
government troops.
	   Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the Ghali district
since 1994, attempting to enforce the terms of the truce that ended
the war.

Grain, soybean futures prices fall in quiet trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices fell in quiet
trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
	   Soybean futures prices fell as the market reacted to the U.S.
Agriculture Department's weekly export report which showed little
export business and dismal prospects in the future. There also was
concern about favorable growing conditions in South America.
	   Corn futures prices also were affected by growing conditions in
South America and the possibility of future competition from
Argentina for export business. The market also was nervous about
the liquidation getting underway in the hog industry and the
likelihood of decreased demand for feed grain.
	   There was little news in the wheat market, which was slightly
lower at the close of trading. Losses were limited by the
expectation the federal government will begin making wheat
purchases as part of the U.S. commitment to provide food assistance
to several countries.
	   Wheat futures for March delivery settled a 1-4 cent lower at
dlrs 2.82 1-2 a bushel; March corn was 1 1-2 cents lower at dlrs
2.19 1-4 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at dlrs 1.08 a bushel;
January soybeans were 4 3-4 cents lower at dlrs 5.43 1-4 a bushel.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations mission in Angola has
picked up an SOS morse code signal from a U.N.-chartered plane that
crashed near a war zone in the central highlands, raising hopes
that some of the 14 people on board may have survived, a U.N.
spokesman said Monday.
	   Hamadoun Toure said the United Nations is increasing pressure on
the government and the rebel group UNITA to call a cease-fire and
allow in a rescue team.
	   ``This may be last be our last chance to rescue innocent U.N.
peacekeepers,'' Toure said by phone.
	   The C-130 aircraft crashed Saturday at Vila Nova near the city
of Huambo, about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda.
	   U.N. communications specialists cannot tell whether the signals
_ identified as coming from the plane _ are being sent manually or
if they are just automatic transmissions, according to Toure.
	   The 10 passengers on board included three Angolans, two
Russians, an Australian, an Egyptian, a Cameroonian, a Zambian and
a Namibian. The crew was made up of a South African, an Angolan, a
Bolivian and a Filipino.
	   Eight of the passengers were members of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Angola which was overseeing implementation of the
country's collapsed 1994 peace deal.
	   Two others were employed by a private communications company,
Dinacom, which works with the United Nations, Toure said.
	   The plane, owned by TransAfric, was painted with the U.N.
colors, and both the government army and rebels were informed of
the flight's schedule before the aircraft took off from Huambo.
	   The government says the plane was shot down by rebel forces and
that it crashed in a UNITA-controlled area.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato denied his troops
shot at the plane and said he had no information about its
location.
	   ``We don't know anything about it,'' Gato said by satellite
telephone. ``There's heavy fighting in all that area.''
	   Gato said he had not received any U.N. request for safe passage
to the area, and that he could not comment on the request until it
was presented directly to the UNITA leadership.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department issued a statement
offering its condolences and adding its call for a cease-fire to
aid search crews. The State Department also called on both sides to
provide security guarantees and support to the searchers.
	   The U.N. observer mission, deployed to monitor the peace accord
that halted a two-decade civil war between the rebels and the
government, has been unable to stop the renewed fighting.
	   ``The government broke off dialogue with us, so now we're
talking with weapons,'' Gato said. He added that he had no
information on the number of casualties from the fighting, which
erupted Dec. 4.
	   The main battles have focused on the central highland cities of
Huambo and Kuito, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the east, which
provide a traditional powerbase for UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
	   The U.N. Security Council has expressed dismay at Angola's
apparent slide back to civil war. The country has been ravaged by
conflict since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975.

Auto parts maker to cut 1,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) _ Auto parts maker SPX Corp. is cutting
1,000 jobs, or about 7 percent of its work force, as it integrates
the operations of General Signal Corp., which it acquired in July.
	   The company will close about 25 manufacturing, sales and
administrative facilities, including the former General Signal
headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, SPX said in a statement
Monday.
	   The dlrs 2-billion deal created a company with about 14,000
employees and dlrs 2.5 billion in sales in the industrial and
automotive businesses.
	   The job cuts will come from the closings, an early retirement
program and other actions, SPX said. SPX will take a dlrs 210
million to dlrs 250 million fourth quarter charge, before taxes, to
cover the costs. SPX spokesman Charles Bowman refused to elaborate
on details of the cuts and where they will be made.
	   At the time of the merger, SPX said it expected to achieve
annual cost savings of dlrs 55 million to dlrs 60 million, starting
in the first quarter of 1999. However, on Wednesday, SPX said it
expected about dlrs 20 million of costs associated with the
restructuring will be incurred next year.
	   Despite the costs, SPX chairman and chief executive officer John
Blystone said the company remains confident it will earn dlrs 4.85
a share, excluding items, in 1999.
	   Earlier this year, SPX attempted a dlrs 3 billion hostile
takeover of Branford, Connecticut-based Echlin Corp. but was outbid
by Dana Corp. of Toledo, Ohio.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
dozens of yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Sunday and
Monday. At least two sailors were killed as boats capsized or sank,
and rescue helicopters hoisted 50 others to safety.
	   Four other sailors were missing and at least one was presumed
drowned. Rescue boats battled 90 mph (145 kph) winds and 35-foot
(10-meter) waves to try to reach other competitors.
	   Early Tuesday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)
said that one of the three missing from a life raft from the
stricken vessel Winston Churchill may have been found.
	   It said a person had been spotted in seas off the New South
Wales south coast and that a helicopter crew was attempting to
rescue the man.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off Australia's southeast coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney. Emergency flares
sent streams of red smoke into the air to help helicopters find the
orange life rafts in the huge swells.
	   The 725-mile (1,166 kilometers) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59
have been forced to seek shelter and several boats have been
abandoned, race officials said.
	   Some 27 navy ships searched Monday for stranded sailors.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and crew members Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   Their bodies were left on the boat but attempts were being made
to recover them as soon as possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British Olympic sailor Glyn Charles was washed off the Sword of
Orion yacht Sunday night and presumed drowned.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the maritime safety authority, said
it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24
hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a superman if he makes it,''
Poke said.
	   Six crew members from the Winston Churchill yacht were plucked
from two life rafts late Monday, but three others were missing.
	   Jim Lawler, Mike Bannister and John Dean, all from Sydney, were
washed out of a liferaft early Monday, rescue officials said.
	   ``We are unsure about what has happened to the other three, it
appears they were washed out of the life raft,'' a spokesman for
the maritime authority said.
	   Maritime spokesman David Gray said many other sailors were
injured, with dislocated shoulders, broken legs, cuts and bruises.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said. ``They really got pounded yesterday.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when his yacht capsized. Campbell was so
crippled by hypothermia that Senior Constable Barry Barclay had to
drop into the large swells from a helicopter to rescue him.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell said on television.
``There was a point I didn't think I was going to survive.''
	   American maxi yacht Sayonara, the 1995 winner, was nearing the
finish line on the Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning and
was expected to take line honors.
	   Although its early speed had in on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.
	   Brindabella was expected to finish second.
	   Sayonara has its owner, Larry Ellison, aboard. Ellison is chief
executive officer and founder Oracle Corp., one of the largest
computer technology firms in the world with 8 billion US dlrs in
annual revenue.
	   Forty boats were holed up in the mainland port of Eden Monday,
all with broken rigging and other signs of damage.
	   ``Everyone has been really quiet Monday since we heard about the
deaths,'' said Susie Graney from the 40-foot (12-meter) Lady
Penryhn.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast. (djp)

Bill forcing religious councilors to swear allegiance to Orthodox
</HEADLINE>
passes reading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A bill that would force members of religious
councils to swear allegiance to Israel's Orthodox chief rabbinate _
whatever their religious affiliation _ received preliminary
approval Monday in parliament.
	   The bill, sponsored by ultra-Orthodox legislators, seeks to
circumvent a recent Supreme Court ruling that ordered religious
councils in three cities to accept Reform and Conservative
candidates as members.
	   The bill, approved by 51 legislators and rejected by 46 in the
120-member Knesset, must pass two more readings to become law.
	   The Supreme Court last month ordered Religious Affairs Minister
Eli Suissa, a member of an Orthodox Jewish political party, to
recognize Reform and Conservative candidates who were elected to
the local religious councils as full members.
	   Swearing allegiance to Chief Rabbinate would imply acceptance of
its Orthodox tenets, and the bill's sponsors hope that would keep
away the non-Orthodox.
	   But Reform movement leader Uri Regev suggested that even if the
bill were to become law, Reform and Conservative councilors might
take the oath in any case, just to secure their place on the
councils.
	   ``If the law passes, the Reform and Conservative candidates will
not be prevented from serving on the councils,'' he said.
	   The Orthodox regard the bible as the revealed word of God. They
see the modernization's of Reform and Conservative movements as
diluting and even undermining Judaism.
	   The two modern movements have small followings, but placing them
outside the fold could alienate the Jewish community in the United
States, where they have substantial followings.
	   Religious councils are appointed by municipalities, and in
recent years, parties that campaign against religious coercion have
nominated Conservative and Reform representatives to the councils.
	   The councils oversee the supervision of kosher eating
establishments and have the power to license ritual baths.
	   Their powers are less important to the Reform and Conservative
movements then the symbolism of being allowed membership.
	   Before the Supreme Court ruling, Orthodox officials had
disobeyed the orders of lower courts, and had forcibly removed
elected officials from council meetings.
	   Labor party legislator Ofir Pines described the bill as ``a slap
in the face of the high court of justice.''

Comden and Green write new dialogue for Met's `Fledermaus'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP Arts and Entertainment Review &QL; 
 &UR; By MARY CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Metropolitan Opera's ``Die Fledermaus'' is
funnier than ever, with a new book and English dialogue by musical
comedy lyricists Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
	   As in traditional versions, Falke is a buddy of the hot-headed
Gabriel von Eisenstein who is heading to jail. Now called Dr.
Fledermaus, the friend propels the plot to repay Eisenstein for a
practical joke.
	   The Comden-Green team has also transformed Eisenstein into a
Viennese newspaper publisher who, on New Year's Eve 1899, is in
trouble for punching a music critic who disparaged his
soprano-wife, Rosalinde. And the duo depict Falke as a psychiatrist
who, in the last scene, changes his name to Sigmund Freud.
	   These changes allow new jokes, replacing those that Met
audiences know too well. And one bigger change is cutting the
last-act drunk scene by Frosch, the jailer of Bratwurst Prison. The
success of the non-singing role depends on the actor. Max Wright,
an actor in film, television and Broadway, handled the shortened
part nicely.
	   The last act's funniest visual joke remains. After midnight,
when Frosch pulls the page marking the 31 off his wall calendar, he
uncovers 32.
	   Though the dialogue for ``Fledermaus'' is in English, the
singing is in German. So, for their first operatic assignment,
Comden and Green stuck to the general plot, which swirls along with
Johann Strauss' lilting waltzes.
	   Rosalinde was performed ravishingly by Carol Vaness; surely no
critic would disparage her. Baritone Bo Skovhus, handsome and
upbeat vocally, made his Met debut on Christmas Eve as Eisenstein.
Though he's Danish, his English is American.
	   Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz charmingly sang their maid, Adele, who
beguiles Eisenstein at Prince Orlofsky's New Year's Eve party.
Rosalinde, introduced as a Hungarian countess, beguiles him even
more. The would-be philanderer, of course, doesn't recognize either
of them.
	   Jochen Kowalski as Prince Orlofsky has mastered looking bored _
the problem that made the prince a psychiatric patient in Comden
and Green's conceit. He's a countertenor, which works well vocally.
(A mezzo-soprano will eventually sing the role, standard since the
premiere in 1874.) Tenor Michael Schade was properly self-absorbed
as a former lover of Rosalinde, who launches into arias, favoring
``Ritorna vincitor'' from ``Aida.''
	   In one joke for music insiders, Rosalinde protests: She doesn't
want to sing opposite a tenor any more; Ernestine Schumann-Heink
could sing Pinkerton. Actually, Schumann-Heink sang Orlofsky in
``Fledermaus'' in 1894 in Hamburg, with Gustav Mahler conducting.
	   Comden and Green's first joke is for conductor Patrick Summers,
who began his Met debut with the overture to ``Pagliacci.'' Just as
in that opera, a baritone stepped in front of the curtain. Earle
Patriarco performed Dr. Fledermaus, who establishes himself as a
psychiatrist by blaming the conductor's start of the wrong opera on
a dream he had last night. And his theories about dreams, he
bragged, were ``spreading like hot strudel.''
	   David Kneuss brought new staging to the beautiful Gunther
Schneider-Siemssen sets, and Robert La Fosse offered new
choreography.
	   No famous surprise guests appeared at Prince Orlofsky's party.
That tradition wasn't followed; the new speaking parts were
surprise enough.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
dozens of yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Sunday and
Monday. At least three sailors were killed as boats capsized or
sank, and rescue helicopters hoisted 50 others to safety.
	   Three other sailors were missing and at least one was presumed
drowned. Rescue boats battled 90 mph (145 kph) winds and 35-foot
(10-meter) waves to try to reach other competitors.
	   Early Tuesday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)
said that one of the three missing from a life raft from the
stricken vessel Winston Churchill may have been found. But rescue
officials later found the man dead in the water.
	   Authority spokesman David Gray said an Australian Navy Seahawk
helicopter winched the body from the sea.
	   ``The Navy Seahawk winched a middle-aged male who was
deceased,'' Gray said. ``He is presumed to be from the Winston
Churchill.''
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off Australia's southeast coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney. Emergency flares
sent streams of red smoke into the air to help helicopters find the
orange life rafts in the huge swells.
	   The 725-mile (1,166 kilometers) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59
have been forced to seek shelter and several boats have been
abandoned, race officials said.
	   Some 27 navy ships searched Monday for stranded sailors.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and crew members Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   Their bodies were left on the boat but attempts were being made
to recover them as soon as possible, rescue officials said.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British Olympic sailor Glyn Charles was washed off the Sword of
Orion yacht Sunday night and presumed drowned.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the maritime safety authority, said
it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24
hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a superman if he makes it,''
Poke said.
	   Six crew members from the Winston Churchill yacht were plucked
from two life rafts late Monday, but two others were missing.
	   Jim Lawler, Mike Bannister and John Dean, all from Sydney, were
washed out of a liferaft early Monday, rescue officials said. They
did not reveal which of the three men was found dead in the water
on Tuesday morning.
	   Maritime spokesman David Gray said many other sailors were
injured, with dislocated shoulders, broken legs, cuts and bruises.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said. ``They really got pounded yesterday.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   American John Campbell was rescued by a police helicopter after
being swept overboard when his yacht capsized. Campbell was so
crippled by hypothermia that Senior Constable Barry Barclay had to
drop into the large swells from a helicopter to rescue him.
	   ``I was definitely worried,'' Campbell said on television.
``There was a point I didn't think I was going to survive.''
	   American maxi yacht Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the
finish line on the Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to
take line honors.
	   Although its early speed had in on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.
	   Brindabella was expected to finish second several hours behind.
	   Sayonara had its owner, Larry Ellison, aboard. Ellison is chief
executive officer and founder Oracle Corp., one of the largest
computer technology firms in the world with 8 billion US dlrs in
annual revenue.
	   Forty boats were holed up in the mainland port of Eden Monday,
all with broken rigging and other signs of damage.
	   ``Everyone has been really quiet Monday since we heard about the
deaths,'' said Susie Graney from the 40-foot (12-meter) Lady
Penryhn.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast. (djp)

Iraq describes U.S. attack as ``aggressive and vicious act''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States of
``aggressive and vicious'' behavior Monday after U.S. warplanes
fired on its anti-aircraft guns, killing four soldiers.
	   The U.S. attack came two days after Baghdad announced it would
fire at Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over northern
and southern Iraq.
	   The Iraqi casualties were the first since the United States and
Britain ended four nights of airstrikes on Dec. 19. Iraq says those
raids killed 62 Iraqi soldiers and at least 40 civilians.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. pilots
opened fire in self-defense: ``They attacked because they were
attacked, and they did the appropriate thing.''
	   The official Iraqi news agency later quoted an army spokesman as
saying a ``an enemy plane'' had been shot down by Iraqi forces
during the exchange.
	   ``We declare that our air defense batteries almost certainly
shot down an enemy plane and search is underway for the plane's
wreckage and the pilot,'' the spokesman reportedly said. ``It's
possible that the American authorities did not announce the
shooting down of the plane so they give their pilot a chance to
escape, if he is alive, or give their agents an opportunity to
retrieve his body, if he's dead.''
	   But U.S. officials said all U.S. planes has returned safely.
	   	   ``It's totally not true,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the
White House's National Security Council. ``This is just more
propaganda from Saddam Hussein.''
	   British officials also said that all of their planes had
returned safely.
	   The incident occurred as Baghdad sought Arab sympathy for the
Iraqi people, which had emerged in widespread protests against the
U.S.-British airstrikes.
	   Iraqi delegates to an Arab Parliamentary Union meeting in Amman
Sunday had pressed the conference to call for Arab states to
violate the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq. But the Arab legislators
did little more than repeat condemnation of the airstrikes.
	   An Iraqi military spokesman said earlier that Monday's initial
clash began when Western aircraft ``approached one of our air
defense weapons sites ... and fired criminal missiles.''
	   ``These criminal and vicious actions led to the martyrdom of
four of our valiant soldiers and the wounding of seven others,''
the unidentified spokesman told the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   The spokesman said the aircraft came in two waves. Iraqi air
defenses ``confronted'' the first group ``with all valor and
capability.''
	   The second wave of warplanes killed four soldiers and wounded
seven, the spokesman said.
	   U.S. pilots said the Iraqis launched three missiles and used
radar to lock onto U.S. planes, said a U.S. defense official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The Americans scored at least two
direct hits against the anti-aircraft site, the official said.
	   In Washington, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said the
clash took place near Mosul, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of
Baghdad.
	   In Stuttgart, Germany, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-European
Command, Maj. Tony Kemper, said the U.S. planes fired anti-radar
missiles and precision-guided munitions.
	   The United States and its allies set up the northern no-fly zone
to protect Kurdish rebels after the 1991 Gulf War. The southern
zone was established in 1992 to protect Shiite Muslim rebels.
	   Earlier Monday, Iraq's trade minister said the country has no
immediate plans to eject U.N. humanitarian workers who check the
distribution of supplies under a U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program.
	   Mohammed Mehdi Saleh added, however, that the 2-year-old program
was a temporary measure and could not substitute for a lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
	   ``Iraq will not live forever with the oil-for-food program. So,
our demand is ... to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Saleh did not say whether Iraq would accept a renewal of the
current phase of the program, which expires in May.
	   The trade minister made the remarks at a news conference to
clarify comments he made Sunday in an interview with Associated
Press Television News in which he said Iraq would reject a
continuation of the oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq refuses the continuation of this project and demands
lifting of sanctions, and this means the ouster of U.N. teams which
supervise it'' he said in the Sunday interview.
	   The program allows Iraq to export dlrs 5.2 billion in oil over
six months. It is an exception to the sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Four U.S. football coaches fired in offseason purge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Erickson being fired in second and fourth graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The offseason purge of NFL coaches began quickly
Monday.
	   Within one hour, Dom Capers of Carolina, Dave Wannstedt of
Chicago, Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore and Ray Rhodes of
Philadelphia were fired.
	   Seattle's Dennis Erickson was also fired, a Seahawks' source
said.
	   Capers and Rhodes, both former coaches of the year, have already
been mentioned for vacancies. Capers is a candidate for the
openings in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and Rhodes is a candidate
in Green Bay, where Mike Holmgren has the option of getting out of
his contract for a coach-general manager position elsewhere.
	   All were expected because all had losing seasons except
Erickson, whose Seahawks went 8-8 for the third time in his
four-year tenure. They were 7-9 the other year, prompting owner
Paul Allen, who has spent millions on free agents, to make the
change.
	   The biggest surprise may have been Wannstedt's dismissal in
Chicago, even though he finished 4-12 for the second straight year.
His team played hard every week and even owner Mike McCaskey
conceded that the team's talent level was lower than needed to
compete in the NFL.
	   ``This is a very disappointing day for me and my family,''
Wannstedt said at a news conference with McCaskey. ``I do respect
his decision for making what he feels is the best decision for the
organization.''
	   Wannstedt acknowledged that a number of mistakes in drafting and
signing free agents were made during his tenure.
	   ``We have a good nucleus of players and we need to increase the
talent level,'' McCaskey said.
	   Capers, the only coach the Panthers have had in their four
seasons, was fired two seasons after taking the team to the NFC
championship game in its second year. But Carolina finished 7-9
last year and 4-12 this season as it fell apart on the field and
within the locker room.
	   Rhodes also lasted four years, taking the Eagles to the playoffs
in his first two. But he fought with the front office from the
start and this season the team collapsed, falling to 3-13 with the
worst offense in the league.
	   ``When you don't win, changes have to be made. This is part of
the business,'' Rhodes said at a news conference with Eagles owner
Jeffrey Lurie.
	   Marchibroda, meanwhile, came from Indianapolis to an unsettled
situation in Baltimore, taking over the Ravens the year after they
moved from Cleveland.
	   The team was 16-31-1 under Marchibroda, including 6-10 this
season. They won three straight games only once and never came
close to reaching the playoffs.
	   The firing left five vacancies _ June Jones of San Diego has
already taken the coaching job at the University of Hawaii. Among
other coaches whose jobs were in jeopardy were Dennis Erickson of
Seattle and Norv Turner of Washington _ although any move in
Washington wouldn't be made until the team is sold.
	   Bruce Coslet of Cincinnati is also on shaky ground after a 3-13
season, although the Bengals will probably keep him so they don't
have to pay the remaining years of his contract.
	   San Francisco's Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a contract
extension and could move on, perhaps to the expansion team in
Cleveland.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Islamic militants kidnapped 16 Western
tourists in southern Yemen Monday, including 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians, security officials said.
	   They said the kidnappers, who belong to the Islamic Jihad
extremist group, were demanding the release of their leader Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested by Yemeni authorities two weeks
ago.
	   Tribal leaders said about 10 gunmen ambushed a convoy of five
vehicles carrying a group of 17 tourists traveling near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, in the Abyan province. They opened fire
on a number of policemen escorting the tourists.
	   No one was injured in the firefight, but the group's British
tour leader and a Yemeni guide managed to escape, said the tribal
leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The remaining 16 tourists were abducted and driven to an unknown
destination in Abyan province, about 200 kilometers (175 miles)
south of the capital, San`a.
	   The British tourists included six women and six men. The
remaining tourists were two American women and two Australian men.
	   Security officials in Abyan, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said al-Atwi's arrest was part of a crackdown on Islamic
extremists who had taken the law into their hands by enforcing
strict Islamic rules on the population of southern Yemen.
	   They said vigilantes belonging to the group flogged men for
selling and drinking alcohol _ which is forbidden in Islam _ and
women for ignoring the Islamic dress code.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, said the officials. The kidnappers
are also demanding the release of another of their leader who is
also in jail. The security sources did not identify the second
leader.
	   Britain's Press Association said the tourists were traveling
with the British tour company Explore in conjunction with a local
operator in San`a.
	   ``The British tourists are all young but I cannot say any
more,'' PA quoted the operator, Yahya al-Haifi, as saying.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was in touch
with Yemeni authorities.
	   ``We have made it clear that our top priority is the safe and
swift return of the hostages,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Foreign Office advised British nationals traveling to Yemen
should ``keep in touch with developments'' during their stay.
	   Monday's abduction brings to 20 the total number of Westerners
held hostage in Yemen.
	   Members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe are holding four Germans _
three women and one man _ in the province of Marib, 170 kilometers
(105 miles) northeast of San`a. The tribesmen are pressing the
government to provide more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and
roads.
	   The Germans were seized on Dec. 7.

FIFA president concerned about too much money influence on soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The chairman of the International Soccer
Federation, Joseph Blatter said in a year-end magazine article that
said he's concerned about soccer being flooded with too much money,
watering down its real value as a people's sport.
	   In the article that appears in Monday's editions of Germany's
sports weekly Kicker, and titled ``My Warning to Soccer,'' Blatter
also says he is also concerned by the influence of business and
television on soccer.
	   ``Even when I am fully aware of the rules of supply and demand
in the market, we must still ask ourselves whether too much money
comes into play, whether the players have lost their moderation and
become too egoistic and influential?''
	   ``Is not the influence of industry, television, yes even
politics meanwhile too great?'' Blatter writes.
	   He also questions whether soccer, because of its popularity, has
not become a tool of the powerful and strong.
	   While his thoughts won't be gladly received by sponsors and big
companies who are planning to take over major soccer clubs, such as
BSkyB's proposed big to take over Manchester United, Blatter said
they have to be faced.
	   ``We have to ask ourselves what we can do about it? Who's behind
it? What recourse do we have?'' Blatter said. ``One thing is very
clear: if top soccer continues its current path, then it is not a
good thing.''
	   He said soccer must get back to the joint interests of all ``and
that means the game itself,'' which he added is what really binds
overall interests.
	   Soccer has only become so big and meaningful ``because it is
universal, in that it had place for the great and small, the
powerful and the weak. ''
	   If that principle of solidarity falls, then soccer's future
looks bleak, Blatter said.
	   ``In the end the fan decides. If he no longer goes to the
stadium, or doesn't watch it on television, then there is no longer
a viewers rating, and also no more television money,'' Blatter
said.
	   ``Then the interest is gone, and children move away from
soccer,'' the FIFA chief said.
	   ``Believe me, I will do everything in my function as FIFA
chairman to keep for soccer its essential basic worths.''

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Islamic militants kidnapped 16 Western
tourists in southern Yemen Monday, including 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians, security officials said.
	   They said the kidnappers, who belong to the Islamic Jihad
extremist group, were demanding the release of their leader Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested by Yemeni authorities two weeks

	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Owen and KarlHeinz Riedle each scored
twice as Liverpool hit back from two goals down to beat Newcastle
4-2 in the Premier League on Monday.
	   Goals by Peruvian midfielder Nolberto Salano and Swedish forward
Andreas Andersson fired Ruud Gullit's team ahead at Anfield before
German midfielder Dietmar Hamann was sent off.
	   Liverpool, which has twice beaten Newcastle 4-3 in the last
three seasons, then hit back with four second half strikes with
Owen taking his personal tally for the season to 15 and six against
Newcastle during 1998.
	   Aston Villa returned to the top of the standings by edging lowly
Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 thanks to a headed strike by defender Ugo
Ehiogu five minutes from the end.
	   Another center-back, Gareth Southgate, fired Villa ahead after
seven minutes but Benito Carbone leveled a minute later for
Wednesday who had Yugoslav defender Dejan Stefanovic sent off for a
second yellow card in the 21st minute.
	   Chelsea can return to the top by beating Manchester United at
Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.
	   Arsenal moved up to third with a 1-0 win at struggling Charlton
thanks to a second half penalty by Dutch winger Marc Overmars.
	   But the Gunners lost Dennis Bergkamp and Nigel Winterburn
through injury and French World Cup midfielder Patrick Vieira was
sent off for lashing out at Charlton's Neal Redfearn.
	   Ian Wright's first goal in eight games but seventh of the season
helped West Ham gain a 2-0 victory over lowly Coventry. John
Hartson scored the other Hammers goal.
	   Chris Armstrong scored three times in 18 minutes for Tottenham
in a 4-1 crushing of Everton at White Hart Lane. Les Ferdinand
netted Spurs first before Ibrahima Bakayoko replied for the
Toffees.
	   In the matchup of the bottom two teams, Nottingham Forest and
Southampton tied 1-1, leaving Forest still in last place. New
Moroccan signing Hassan Kachloul fired Saints ahead with his second
goal in nine days but Steve Chettle leveled from the penalty spot.
	   Disappointing Paul Gascoigne was substituted soon after half
time and Middlesbrough lost 2-1 to Derby at Pride Park for its
second loss in three days.
	   Dean Sturridge, the focus of some transfer speculation early in
the day, gave County the lead before Jim Smith's team lost Costa
Rican star Paulo Wanchope for raising his arm against Andy Townsend
after a rough tackle by Boro's Irish international midfielder.
	   Danish forward Mikkel Beck leveled for Boro but Derby snatched
all three points through a late header by substitute Jonathan Hunt.
	   Blackburn made it five games undefeated since the arrival of new
manager Brian Kidd by scoring a 1-1 tie at Leicester. Scottish
international Kevin Gallacher fired Rovers ahead in the 38th minute
but veteran Leicester defender Steve Walsh replied a minute before
half time.
	   Some 41,000 saw Sunderland extend its lead atop the Division One
standings to eight points with a 2-0 victory over last place Crewe.
Second place Ipswich lost 1-0 at Wolves.

Pro-Israeli militiamen evacuate positions in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Facing mounting human losses,
Israeli-backed militiamen on Monday abandoned an area near the
southern mountain town of Jezzine which had been a frequent target
of Lebanese guerrilla fire, officials said.
	   The retreat was for military reasons, said officials of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army , speaking on customary condition
of anonymity. They did not elaborate.
	   The SLA, a 2,500-man local force armed and paid by Israel, has
since July lost more than a dozen men to ambushes and roadside
bombs planted by guerrillas near Jezzine, about 20 kilometers (12
miles) north of the Israeli border.
	   Lebanese security officials said the SLA pulled back Monday from
two outposts near the previous front line at Kfar Falous, east of
this southern provincial capital.
	   The SLA pullback came amid renewed talks in Jerusalem of an
Israeli withdrawal from Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. The
talks were resumed after Lebanese guerrilla rockets injured 13
Israeli civilians in northern Israel last week in retaliation for
an Israeli air raid in eastern Lebanon that killed a Lebanese
mother and her six children.
	   Lebanese guerrillas are leading a battle to oust the SLA and
about 1,500 Israeli soldiers from a border area of southern Lebanon
that Israel occupies.
	   Israeli troops have no positions in Jezzine, the northernmost
mountain area jutting from the enclave. However, the Israeli
military provides the SLA in Jezzine with the crucial firepower to
maintain its control over the area.

Five US football coaches fired in offseason purge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to add details; ADDS byline; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In what may be the biggest one-day purge in NFL
history, five coaches were fired Monday less than 24 hours after
their seasons ended.
	   One-sixth of the league's coaches were dismissed: Ray Rhodes of
Philadelphia, Dom Capers of Carolina, Ted Marchibroda of Baltimore,
Dave Wannstedt of Chicago and Dennis Erickson of Seattle.
	   With the exception Erickson, who was three time zones away, word
of four of the firings came within an hour.
	   ``I think it's disgusting. Some of the better coaches in the NFL
got fired today,'' said Miami's Jimmy Johnson, a close friend of
Wannstedt, who was his defensive coordinator in Dallas.
	   ``I know we're highly paid, but it's a shame when coaches' jobs
are dependent on injuries, skyboxes, people in the stands and
officiating calls. ... It doesn't give me a good feeling about our
profession when I see things like I saw this morning.''
	   At least one owner seemed to agree that firing the coach is a
way to address mistakes made by many others.
	   ``In hindsight there would be a lot of things that we didn't get
done as well as we wanted to,'' Carolina owner Jerry Richardson
said. ``I'm not dumping it all on Dom.''
	   Chicago owner Mike McCaskey, whose team finished 4-12 the last
two seasons under Wannstedt, seemed to confirm what Johnson was
saying.
	   ``It hurts to see empty seats, people who've already paid for
those seats choosing not to show up,'' he said.
	   All the fired coaches knew what was coming or sensed it long
before the dismissals were announced. In fact, this may have been a
record day in a record year _ there could be as many as 10 or 11
vacancies this year, approaching the 11 new coaches after the 1996.
	   There was one common denominator in the firings: All the coaches
had losing seasons except Erickson, who was 8-8 this year for the
third time in four seasons in Seattle despite millions spent on
free agents.
	   ``We are 3-13,'' Rhodes said in the days leading to his firing.
``A new coach will be in here shortly.''
	   And a lot of other places as well.
	   There already are seven vacancies: Monday's five, plus the
expansion Cleveland Browns and San Diego, where June Jones, who
replaced Kevin Gilbride in midseason, has chosen to take the job at
the University of Hawaii rather than take a shot at the permanent
job with the Chargers.
	   There will be more.
	   Norv Turner in Washington is on shaky ground and Cincinnati's
Bruce Coslet may be as well.
	   Also, the Mike Holmgren scenario won't be played out until Green
Bay is eliminated from the playoffs _ the Packers' coach is free to
pursue a head coach-general manager slot and would be the first
choice of almost everybody.
	   And San Francisco's Steve Mariucci still hasn't signed a
contract extension because he's unsure about the team's future with
Carmen Policy and Dwight Clark now running the new Browns in
Cleveland.

India, Sri Lanka to establish free-trade area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Sri Lanka signed a free-trade
agreement Monday that will eliminate customs tariffs between the
countries over several years.
	   The countries also agreed to set up a foundation to promote
exchanges in the arts, culture, trade, commerce, science and
technology.
	   India's Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh signed the deal in New
Delhi with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who is on a
two-day official visit.
	   Singh said the agreement would promote economic equality between
the countries. Current trade between them heavily favors India,
which has exports to its island neighbor valued at dlrs 560 million
and imports worth just dlrs 42 million.
	   Last July, India announced steps to liberalize trade with six of
its neighbors, saying the move would increase their access to the
vast Indian market.
	   Monday's signing came as the projected South Asian regional
free-trade zone, patterned after the European Union, seemed to be
falling behind its 2001 target date.
	   Experts say the date might have to be set back by up to five
years because of fears by Pakistan and smaller countries that India
would dominate their markets.

Seven die, eight injured in Peru fireworks explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Seven people died and eight were injured
Monday when a clandestine fireworks factory under a slum shopping
gallery in downtown Lima exploded and burned, firefighters said.
	   Firefighters found the burnt bodies of five women and two girls
in the basement of the building, where fireworks were being made
and stored for sale during the holiday season.
	   ``There was a powerful explosion and people were sent flying
through a back wall,'' said Lima fire department chief Victor
Potesta.
	   Shopkeepers above the storeroom rushed to save their merchandise
as the blaze consumed the wood-and-adobe gallery. Flames poured
from the gallery's windows and rounds of firecrackers popping could
be heard, witnesses said.
	   It took firefighters two hours to extinguish the fire, Potesta
said.
	   The decaying, one-story building, which covered half a city
block in the downtown slum, was filled with shops lining narrow
alleyways.
	   Lima's municipal authorities had banned the sale of fireworks
during the holiday season after similar accidents in previous
years, but merchants continued to sell them illegally, storing the
fireworks in clandestine warehouses.
	   A short circuit in the aging wiring likely started a fire that
set off the explosion, Potesta said.
	   Among the injured were two firefighters, a police officer and
four children, Potesta said.

Hungarian tax agents to carry cattle prods, Mace, handcuffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian taxman will be a force to
be reckoned with now _ after Parliament passed a controversial law
Monday creating a special unit that will be issued cattle prods,
Mace and handcuffs.
	   An estimated 30 percent of Hungary's gross domestic product
comes from the black market, and the government wants to find ways
of bringing smugglers and other tax cheats into the fold.
	   Members of the Criminal Directorate, as the special unit will be
called, will have unusual investigative rights, including covert
surveillance.
	   The law passed 215 to 131, with one abstention.
	   During its final session of the year, parliament approved the
1999 national budget, with 205 votes in favor and 145 against in
the 386-seat parliament. The total budget is dlrs 16 billion, with
a projected deficit of dlrs 1.7 billion.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ December cold has taken the lives of nearly 30
people in Europe during the Christmas holidays.
	   Most were homeless or elderly, but one Scottish teen-ager died
of hypothermia after leaving a party without a coat.
	   In Russia, where hundreds of people die of cold each year, nine
froze to death in Moscow during the past week, raising the number
of such deaths in the capital this winter to 69, city medical
officials said Monday.
	   In addition, 178 people received hospital care for hypothermia
and 30 were treated for frostbite during the same period, the
officials said.
	   Most of those who die this way in Russia are elderly people
living alone or alcoholics who pass out on the street at night.
	   In Hungary, where 30,000 people are homeless, 17 people died
over the Christmas holiday. A few cases involved drunks who fell
asleep before reaching home, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy told The Associated
Press. Temperatures in Hungary have dipped to 16-20 below Celsius
(plus 5 to minus 4 Fahrenheit) in parts of the country since cold
weather set in at the beginning of December.
	   The total dead of cold this winter in Hungary is 76, police
said.
	   In southeastern Poland, an 86-year-old woman was found lying in
a field Sunday night. The total cold-related deaths for the year is
162 _ most from the severe cold spell that started Nov. 16 and
ended about mid-December.
	   In Scotland, searchers found the body of an 18-year-old dental
nurse who disappeared after a Christmas Eve party in a village near
Perth on Christmas Eve. She had been dressed only in a pants suit
and shirt. A post mortem determined she had died of hypothermia.
	   Although temperatures have not been particularly low in England
and Ireland, rain and gale-force winds have claimed the lives of
two men, and a third was missing and feared dead.
	   A 26-year-old man died when a falling tree crushed his car near
the village of Maam Cross, in County Galway, Ireland.
	   In Devonshire, southern England, search teams found the body of
a 44-year-old man who was swept away while watching flood waters at
his home. It is thought he accidentally stumbled into the river.
	   In Brighton, southern England, coastguard officials on Sunday
called off the search for a 28-year-old man swept into the sea by a
30 foot (9 meter) wave as he walked along a beach with his
girlfriend and her son.
	   More gales were expected in Britain over the next few days.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ With rebels advancing on Sierra
Leone's capital, West African diplomats met with U.S. and British
delegations on Monday and called for greater Western support for
the country's embattled government.
	   The emergency diplomatic push came as West African nations sent
more reinforcements to the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, to try
to fend off rebel forces reportedly only 12 miles (20 kilometers)
from the city.
	   Two battalions of Nigerian soldiers flew into Freetown late
Sunday night to reinforce the West African coalition army known as
ECOMOG supporting Sierra Leone's government, Sierra Leone Foreign
Minister Sam Banya told reporters at the talks on Monday.
	   Several hundred Gambian troops were also expected to join the
ECOMOG force.
	   The Economic Community of West African States, which directs the
intervention force, said the war threatens peace and stability in
the region. In a statement released after the talks, ECOWAS called
on other African countries to send more troops ``immediately'' to
Sierra Leone and asked the West for military equipment and
supplies.
	   Led and largely financed by Nigeria, the West African force also
includes troops from Ghana and Guinea. Several countries, including
the Ivory Coast have promised troops, but so far have failed to
deliver.
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. and Britain sent military vehicles
and other equipment to ECOMOG.
	   The latest buildup followed surprise advances by the rebels, who
Banya accused of recruiting mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso
and the Ukraine. ECOWAS, which spearheaded Monday's meeting, also
said the rebels had hired mercenaries and foreign governments had
provided the renegades with weapons.
	   Although Kabbah's government says it remains open to
negotiations with the insurgents, the rebels have rejected talks
and vowed to storm the capital unless Kabbah resigns.
	   Fighting was reportedly continuing Monday in the central town of
Makeni, where rebels claimed to have captured the town from ECOMOG
forces.
	   Although declining to say who controlled Makeni, Banya said all
of Makeni's several thousand residents had fled. ECOMOG officials
said intervention troops had made a tactical withdrawal from the
town.
	   Foreign ministers and officials from seven West African
countries were present. Delegations from Washington, London and the
United Nations were also attending the meeting, where military and
diplomatic measures were being debated.
	   The U.S. delegation was led by Howard F. Jeter, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's special envoy to Sierra Leone and Liberia. The
British delegation was led by High Commissioner to Sierra Leone
Peter Penfold and Evan Jones of the Foreign Office.
	   Lansana Kouyate, ECOWAS general secretary, stressed that while
ECOWAS was trying to open a dialogue with the rebels, the first
priority was to end the rebel threat posed to civilians.
	   Kabbah's government had offered to negotiate with the rebels and
proposed an amnesty for their troops on the condition they lay down
their arms. The renegades have rejected talks and vowed to storm
the capital unless Kabbah resigns.
	   ``The rebels must cease fighting immediately, lay down their
arms and accept President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government as the
sole legitimate government,'' the ECOWAS statement said.
	   Witnesses and aid workers have accused the rebels of vicious
massacres, kidnappings and mutilations of villagers in a campaign
aimed at wreaking revenge against the government and spreading
rebel influence through fear.
	   Rebel leaders have denied the charges.

Iraq keeps pumping oil despite bombings, actually increases

exports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraqi oil exports surged last week,
primarily because the four-day U.S. and British bombing campaign
cut domestic demand for crude, U.N. figures showed Monday.
	   Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization continued to export oil
through the attack, reaching 2.5 million barrels a day, the figures
showed. Exports have recently averaged between 1.6 million and 1.8
million barrels a day.
	   Iraq closed all refineries during the bombing, cutting domestic
consumption and prompting Baghdad to hike exports to a level close
to its estimated production capacity.
	   Iraq is barred from freely selling oil on the open market
because of sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Iraq is allowed to export up to dlrs 5.26 billion worth of oil
over 180 days under the U.N. ``oil-for-food'' program. Proceeds are
used primarily for food, medical supplies and to compensate Gulf
War victims.
	   The United States and Britain launched a four-day missile
campaign Dec. 16 because of Iraq's alleged obstruction of U.N.
weapons inspectors. The inspectors must certify Iraq has destroyed
its weapons of mass destruction before the oil embargo is lifted.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ With rebels advancing on Sierra
Leone's capital, West African diplomats met with U.S. and British
delegations on Monday and called for greater Western support for
the country's embattled government.
	   The emergency diplomatic push came as West African nations sent
more reinforcements to the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, to try
to fend off rebel forces reportedly only 12 miles (20 kilometers)
from the city.
	   Two battalions of Nigerian soldiers flew into Freetown late
Sunday night to reinforce the West African coalition army, known as
ECOMOG, supporting Sierra Leone's government, Sierra Leone Foreign
Minister Sam Banya told reporters at the talks on Monday.
	   Several hundred Gambian troops were also expected to join the
force.
	   The Economic Community of West African States, which directs the
intervention force, said the war threatens peace and stability in
the region. In a statement released after the talks, ECOWAS called
on other African countries to send more troops ``immediately'' to
Sierra Leone and asked the West for military equipment and
supplies.
	   Led and largely financed by Nigeria, the West African force also
includes troops from Ghana and Guinea. Several countries, including
the Ivory Coast, have promised troops, but so far have failed to
deliver.
	   Earlier this year, the United States and Britain sent military
vehicles and other equipment to ECOMOG.
	   The latest buildup followed surprise advances by the rebels, who
Banya accused of recruiting mercenaries from Liberia, Burkina Faso
and Ukraine. ECOWAS, which spearheaded Monday's meeting, also said
the rebels had hired mercenaries and foreign governments had
provided the renegades with weapons.
	   Although Kabbah's government says it remains open to
negotiations with the insurgents, the rebels have rejected talks
and vowed to storm the capital unless Kabbah resigns.
	   Fighting was reportedly continuing Monday in the central town of
Makeni, where rebels claimed to have captured the town from ECOMOG
forces.
	   Although declining to say who controlled Makeni, Banya said all
of Makeni's several thousand residents had fled. ECOMOG officials
said intervention troops had made a tactical withdrawal from the
town.
	   Foreign ministers and officials from seven West African
countries were present. Delegations from Washington, London and the
United Nations were also attending the meeting, where military and
diplomatic measures were being debated.
	   The U.S. delegation was led by Howard F. Jeter, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's special envoy to Sierra Leone and Liberia. The
British delegation was led by High Commissioner to Sierra Leone
Peter Penfold and Evan Jones of the Foreign Office.
	   Lansana Kouyate, ECOWAS general secretary, stressed that while
ECOWAS was trying to open a dialogue with the rebels, the first
priority was to end the rebel threat posed to civilians.
	   ``The rebels must cease fighting immediately, lay down their
arms and accept President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government as the
sole legitimate government,'' the ECOWAS statement said.
	   Witnesses and aid workers have accused the rebels of vicious
massacres, kidnappings and mutilations of villagers in a campaign
aimed at wreaking revenge against the government and spreading
rebel influence through fear.
	   Rebel leaders have denied the charges.

Saudi Arabia's 1999 budget includes dlrs 11.7 billion deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia on Monday announced its
1999 budget, including an unprecedented dlrs 11.733 billion deficit
projection.
	   The deficit is dlrs 3 billion more than it was expected.
	   Saudi Information Minister Found al-Farsi announced the budget
after a cabinet session chaired by King Fahd. Saudi Arabia's fiscal
year coincides with the calendar year.
	   The deficit, which is projected to hit an all-time high, is
largely attributed to declining oil prices on the global market.
	   Petroleum growth fell by 43.8 percent, al-Farsi said. Saudi
currently produces 8.5 million barrels of oil per day.
	   Al-Farsi said global economic developments and a 35 percent drop
in international oil prices have led to a ``decline in the
petroleum sector.''
	   He said the country's private sector was preforming well,
realizing a 2.12 percent growth rate.
	   State revenues were projected at 121 billion riyals (dlrs 32.266
billion), down from 178 billion riyals (dlrs 47.5 billion) of the
previous fiscal year.
	   The new budget forecasts expenditures of 165 billion riyals
(dlrs 44 billion), a 31 billion-riyal (dlrs 8.28 billion) drop from
the previous fiscal year.
	   The budget was drawn up ``in light of difficult international
economic circumstances,'' al-Farsi said.
	   He said that while the government will attempt to streamline
spending, it will ``continue the same expenditure rate as 1998 on
social services, health and education and... projects currently
underway.''
	   Describing the Saudi economy as ``stable,'' al-Farsi said there
was growth in the industrial sector which would provide Saudis with
employment and investment opportunities.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ December cold has taken the lives of nearly 30
people in Europe during the Christmas holidays.
	   Most were homeless or elderly, but one Scottish teen-ager died
of hypothermia after leaving a party without a coat.
	   In Russia, where hundreds of people die of cold each year, nine
froze to death in Moscow during the past week, raising the number
of such deaths in the capital this winter to 69, city medical
officials said Monday.
	   In addition, 178 people received hospital care for hypothermia
and 30 were treated for frostbite during the same period, the
officials said.
	   Most of those who die this way in Russia are elderly people
living alone or alcoholics who pass out on the street at night.
	   In Hungary, where 30,000 people are homeless, 17 people died
over the Christmas holiday. A few cases involved drunks who fell
asleep before reaching home, Lt. Col. Hedi Nagy told The Associated
Press. Temperatures in Hungary have dipped to 16-20 below Celsius
(plus 5 to minus 4 Fahrenheit) in parts of the country since cold
weather set in at the beginning of December.
	   The total dead of cold this winter in Hungary is 76, police
said.
	   In southeastern Poland, an 86-year-old woman was found lying in
a field Sunday night. The total cold-related deaths for the year is
162 _ most from the severe cold spell that started Nov. 16 and
ended about mid-December.
	   In Scotland, searchers found the body of an 18-year-old dental
nurse who disappeared after a Christmas Eve party in a village near
Perth on Christmas Eve. She had been dressed only in a pants suit
and shirt. A post mortem determined she had died of hypothermia.
	   Although temperatures have not been particularly low in England
and Ireland, rain and gale-force winds have claimed the lives of
two men, and a third was missing and feared dead.
	   A 26-year-old man died when a falling tree crushed his car near
the village of Maam Cross, in County Galway, Ireland.
	   In Devonshire, southern England, search teams found the body of
a 44-year-old man who was swept away while watching flood waters at
his home. It is thought he accidentally stumbled into the river.
	   In Brighton, southern England, coastguard officials on Sunday
called off the search for a 28-year-old man swept into the sea by a
30 foot (9 meter) wave as he walked along a beach with his
girlfriend and her son.
	   More gales were expected in Britain over the next few days.

Ellison arrives first in tragic race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ United States billionaire Larry
Ellison, in tears after battling through the horror of the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, said he had never experienced worse
conditions at sea.
	   Ellison, the founder and chief executive of computer giant
Oracle, won his second Sydney-to-Hobart race but arrived in Hobart
early Tuesday to a funereal atmosphere.
	   Asked if he'd come back again, Ellison said, ``My first reaction
is not if I live to a thousand years. But who knows?''
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Ellison said it was an extraordinarily difficult as his yacht
battled ``right through the eye of a hurricane'' and his crew heard
by radio of the deaths in the battered fleet.
	   At least three sailors have died and three others are missing in
the worst tragedy to hit the race in its 54-year history.
	   Sayonara crossed the finishing line to a subdued welcome by a
smaller-than-usual spectator fleet and dockside crowd. The 23-man
crew aboard the maxi were safe, except for one who had a broken
ankle.
	   A welcome celebration was postponed and the trophy presentation
was delayed until January 2.
	   ``That's as tough as it gets,'' said Sayonara's helmsman Chris
Dickson. ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big
thing and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done.''

Sixteen Western tourists taken hostage in Yemen.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Australian foreign office in graf

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Islamic militants kidnapped 16 Western
tourists in southern Yemen Monday, including 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians, security officials said.
	   They said the kidnappers, who belong to the Islamic Jihad
extremist group, were demanding the release of their leader Saleh
Haidara al-Atwi, who was arrested by Yemeni authorities two weeks
ago.
	   Tribal leaders said about 10 gunmen ambushed a convoy of five
vehicles carrying a group of 17 tourists traveling near the
southern town of Mawdiyah, in the Abyan province. They opened fire
on a number of policemen escorting the tourists.
	   No one was injured in the firefight, but the group's British
tour leader and a Yemeni guide managed to escape, said the tribal
leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The remaining 16 tourists were abducted and driven to an unknown
destination in Abyan province, about 200 kilometers (175 miles)
south of the capital, San`a.
	   The British tourists included six women and six men. The
remaining tourists were two American women and two Australian men.
	   Security officials in Abyan, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said al-Atwi's arrest was part of a crackdown on Islamic
extremists who had taken the law into their hands by enforcing
strict Islamic rules on the population of southern Yemen.
	   They said vigilantes belonging to the group flogged men for
selling and drinking alcohol _ which is forbidden in Islam _ and
women for ignoring the Islamic dress code.
	   The group, which has no more than 200 members, also ran a
military camp in southern Yemen, said the officials. The kidnappers
are also demanding the release of another of their leader who is
also in jail. The security sources did not identify the second
leader.
	   Britain's Press Association said the tourists were traveling
with the British tour company Explore in conjunction with a local
operator in San`a.
	   ``The British tourists are all young but I cannot say any
more,'' PA quoted the operator, Yahya al-Haifi, as saying.
	   British and American diplomats in Yemen could not immediately be
reached for comment. Australia does not have an embassy in Yemen.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was in touch
with Yemeni authorities.
	   ``We have made it clear that our top priority is the safe and
swift return of the hostages,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Foreign Office advised British nationals traveling to Yemen
to ``keep in touch with developments'' during their stay.
	   In Canberra, a spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade said they were in close contact with their embassy in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and that they would dispatch a diplomat to
Yemen ``as soon as possible.''
	   Monday's abduction brings to 20 the total number of Westerners
held hostage in Yemen.
	   Members of the Bani Dhabyan tribe are holding four Germans _
three women and one man _ in the province of Marib, 170 kilometers
(105 miles) northeast of San`a. The tribesmen are pressing the
government to provide more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and
roads.
	   The Germans were seized on Dec. 7.

Mexican Indians arrested in killing of U.S. correspondent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Philip True, Mexico City correspondent for
the San Antonio Express-News, was killed by two Huichol Indians
because they didn't want their picture taken, officials said
Monday.
	   Horacio Vega, homicide investigator with the Jalisco state
attorney general's office, told a news conference the suspects had
confessed to strangling True earlier this month to prevent him from
taking their photo.
	   Vega said the suspects, both Huichol Indians, became angry at
True's alleged attempt to photograph them, and later stole True's
camera and other belongings. They were identified as Juan Chivarras
de la Cruz, 28, and Miguel Hernandez de la Cruz, 24.
	   The suspects are charged with homicide and robbery, and could
face jail sentences of up to 50 years if found guilty. Mexico does
not have a death penalty.
	   Police continue searching for Chivarras's wife, Yolanda, who
apparently witnessed the murder, Vega said.
	   True, 50, disappeared while hiking alone through a remote region
of the Sierra Madre Occidental, where he was spending vacation time
and pursuing a story on the Huichol Indian culture.
	   His body was found Dec. 16 in a shallow grave in west-central
Jalisco state. An autopsy performed Dec. 17 in Guadalajara, the
state capital, determined True had been strangled as many as 10
days before his body had been found.
	   A second autopsy was conducted Dec. 19 by the federal attorney
general's office and supervised by a U.S. forensic expert hired by
the FBI.
	   The results of the second autopsy have not been released, but
the attorney general's office said in a statement Monday it would
share its conclusions with state officials ``in due time''.
	   Officials said the suspects had been arrested by soldiers
Saturday in the region where True had been killed and they were
flown that day to a Guadalajara prison.
	   In a story proposal submitted earlier this year to his editors,
True said the Huicholes, unlike other indigenous groups in Mexico,
``have retained a certain joy in their life.''
	   ``A day near a Huichol community is marked by the nearly
constant sound of children laughing and playing,'' True wrote.
``This kind of joy gives them a certain integrity in their being
that allows them to welcome in strangers.''

Pope thanks Castro for allowing Christmas celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has thanked Cuban leader
Fidel Castro for allowing Christmas to be celebrated as an official
holiday on the Communist-run island.
	   ``I want to express to you my deep appreciation for the decision
to give back to Christmas its holiday character for all Cubans,
conforming to tradition,'' the pope said in a telegram to Castro,
whom he wished a happy holiday.
	   The telegram was sent Dec. 23 but only disclosed by the Vatican
on Monday.
	   In November, the Cuban government declared Christmas an official
holiday, and this year allowed the local Roman Catholic Church the
rare privilege of broadcasting a national greeting on state radio.
	   In his telegram, the pope said he was praying so that ``with the
collaboration of all the citizens, this noble country, always
present in my heart, can consolidate its way toward a more
prosperous, just and fraternal society.''
	   John Paul met with Castro when he visited the island in January.
During that pilgrimage, the pontiff called for an end to the U.S.
economic embargo on Cuba.
	   The Christmas message by Cuba's top Catholic leader, Cardinal
Jaime Ortega, further testified to warmer relations between Havana
and the church.
	   Although the government declared itself atheist in 1962,
Christmas remained an official holiday until 1969.

moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the United States of
``aggressive and vicious'' behavior Monday after U.S. warplanes
fired on its anti-aircraft guns, killing four soldiers. The U.S.
attack came two days after Baghdad announced it would fire at
Western aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq. The Iraqi casualties were the first since the United
States and Britain ended four nights of airstrikes on Dec. 19. Iraq
says those raids killed 62 Iraqi soldiers and at least 40
civilians. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S.
pilots opened fire in self-defense. (IRAQ)
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Gale-force winds and high seas battered
dozens of yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Sunday and
Monday. At least three sailors were killed as boats capsized or
sank, and rescue helicopters hoisted 50 others to safety. Three
other sailors were missing and at least one was presumed drowned.
Rescue boats battled 90 mph (145 kph) winds and 35-foot (10-meter)
waves to try to reach other competitors. Early Tuesday, the
Australian Maritime Safety Authority said that one of the three
missing from a life raft from the stricken vessel Winston Churchill
may have been found. But rescue officials later found the man dead
in the water. Authority spokesman David Gray said an Australian
Navy Seahawk helicopter winched the body from the sea. ``The Navy
Seahawk winched a middle-aged male who was deceased,'' Gray said.
``He is presumed to be from the Winston Churchill.''
(AUSTRALIA-YACHTING-SYDNEY-HOBART)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's major parties set May 17 as an
election date on Monday, a sign that a Palestinian threat to
declare a state before then has receded and will not influence the
campaign. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had wanted to set the
elections for before May 4 _ Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat's
deadline for independence _ in order to maximize the threat of
Palestinian statehood in his hard-line campaign. ``We agreed on the
17th of May,'' said Meir Shetreet, a senior government legislator,
after a day of negotiations with the opposition Labor party. ``It
must pass the law committee and the Knesset next week, but there is
wide support, so there's no reason why it shouldn't.'' Netanyahu
has recently emphasized the threat of Palestinian independence,
countering with a threat to annex parts of the West Bank.

	   SURAT, India (AP) _ Hindu radicals torched a bamboo church and
ransacked three others, according to local reports, while
Christians huddled in remote villages in the face of a wave of
religious violence that erupted on Christmas Day. Mobs set ablaze a
church made of bamboo in Mulchand village, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
south of Surat, a prosperous town in Gujarat state, police said.
Missionaries said attackers stormed three other churches and a
prayer hall in three villages in Dangs district, 140 kilometers (85
miles) south of Surat. Police were unable to confirm the attacks.
Police arrested 38 people in connection with the attacks, State
Interior Minister Haren Pandya said. (INDIA-CHRISTIAN ATTACK)
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Islamic militants kidnapped 16 Western
tourists in southern Yemen Monday, including 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians, security officials said. They said
the kidnappers, who belong to the Islamic Jihad extremist group,
were demanding the release of their leader Saleh Haidara al-Atwi,
who was arrested by Yemeni authorities two weeks ago. Tribal
leaders said about 10 gunmen ambushed a convoy of five vehicles
carrying a group of 17 tourists near the southern town of Mawdiyah,
in the Abyan province. They opened fire on a number of policemen
escorting the tourists. No one was injured in the firefight, but
the group's British tour leader and a Yemeni guide managed to
escape, said the tribal leaders, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The British tourists included six women and six men. The
remaining tourists were two American women and two Australian men.

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Most U.S. stocks fell Monday in sleepy
holiday-season trading, although it was business as usual in the
red-hot Internet group, which drove the Nasdaq market to another
new high. The Dow Jones industrial average barely finished higher,
rising 8 points to 9,226, but extended its winning streak to seven
sessions. The Dow has gained 436 points in that time, and now sits
150 points from the Nov. 23 record of 9,374.27. Decliners
outnumbered advancers in the lifeless session as many investors
stayed home for an extended holiday break. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's telephone price wars hit new lows
Monday, with giant Deutsche Telekom planning to offer calls for
next to nothing and a big rival going even further: short chats for
free. Telekom, which is still mostly state-owned, said its 1999
rate cuts would beat the private competitors, who have taken about
15 percent of Germany's phone market since it was liberalized a
year ago. Although details have yet to be settled, Telekom intends
to slash its lowest, late-night rate for long-distance calls within
Germany in half, to 6 pfennig (less than 4 cents) a minute. Not to
be outdone, rival MobilCom said it will extend its Christmas Day
promotional offer _ free calls anywhere in Germany _ to all of
1999. The catch: calls must be made between 7 p.m. and midnight and
last less than a minute. (GERMANY-PHONE WARS)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's president on Monday urged
oil-producing countries to move quickly to shore up weak world oil
prices, which are harming Iran's economy, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported. President Mohammad Khatami
``deplored the indifference shown by certain countries regarding
the falling oil prices,'' the agency said. ``This is not
acceptable,'' he was quoted as saying. Iran is at odds with other
OPEC members, which have accused Tehran of failing to cut its
production as much as it agreed to earlier this year. (IRAN-OIL)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Banks halted fresh loans to LG Semicon
Co. Monday, accusing it of resisting a promised merger that would
create the world's second-largest computer memory chip maker. South
Korea's government wants LG Semicon to merge with Hyundai
Electronics Industry Co. to cut out overlapping investments by the
country's computer chip makers and boost their competitiveness.
Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest
conglomerates, agreed in September to merge their chip-making
subsidiaries. But talks have stalled because of a dispute over who
should take control of the merged company. (SKOREA-INDUSTRY
SHAKEUP)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Some of France's most prestigious wines may have
been contaminated by pesticides over the last decade, posing no
health hazard but affecting the taste, a top wine trade association
acknowledged Monday. The Bordeaux Wine Board commented in a
telephone interview after an investigative report appeared in this
week's L'Express, a respected news magazine. Since the problem
became known in Champagne in 1982, many wine professionals have
tried to keep it a secret, L'Express reported. A spokeswoman for
the wine board acknowledged the problem but claimed it affected
only about one percent of wines tested in the past two years, and
had been corrected for all Bordeaux wines. (FRANCE-CONTAMINATED
WINES)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Sri Lanka signed a free-trade
agreement Monday that will eliminate customs tariffs between the
countries over several years. The countries also agreed to set up a
foundation to promote exchanges in the arts, culture, trade,
commerce, science and technology. India's Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh signed the deal in New Delhi with Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, who is on a two-day official visit. Singh
said the agreement would promote economic equality between the
countries. Current trade between them heavily favors India, which
has exports to its island neighbor valued at dlrs 560 million and
imports just dlrs 42 million worth. (INDIA-SRI LANKA)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even with after-Christmas shoppers jamming into
stores, it's still unclear whether this holiday season will shape
up to be as strong as many had anticipated. U.S. merchants said
Monday that the weekend's buying frenzy lifted sales, but few
expected the post-holiday rush to make up for a disappointing
season. Especially troubled were department stores, which used big
bargains to entice shoppers before and after Christmas, but still
failed to get the sales they needed to boost the bottom line.
That's a big letdown for those counting on a surge after Christmas
to offset what's been a tough holiday season. Last year, big
post-Christmas gains boosted sales to respectable levels.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Heather Locklear, Mike Tyson, Patti Davis
and Ronald Reagan, slippers of Jesus scuplture, and Maya Angelou,
Romanian tourist police, and the Times Square New Year's ball. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Unlike the vampy woman-about-town she's played
for seven seasons on ``Melrose Place,'' new mom Heather Locklear
gets itchy if she's away from home for even a night these days.
	   ``We'll go out together, to dinner, and both say, `We miss our
baby. We have to go see our baby,''' said Ms. Locklear, who is
married to Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora. Their daughter, Ava,
was born 15 months ago.
	   Ms. Locklear, 37, said in the next issue of USA Weekend magazine
that she's particularly appreciative of her family after her first
marriage to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee failed.
	   ``You have to have a bad one to appreciate a good one,'' she
said.
	    &UR; ____ &QC; 
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ The topic was Mike Tyson and the radio talk show
host wasn't concealing his distaste for the ex-heavyweight champ's
move to the southwestern state of Arizona.
	   ``He's a convicted rapist who has shown no repentance,'' the
host said. ``Ten thousand people have moved to Phoenix since Mike
Tyson did and 99 percent of them have been better citizens than he
has.''
	   The callers, though, weren't so sure.
	   The Mike Tyson they saw wasn't the felon who went berserk in the
ring and bit Evander Holyfield's ears. Or the Mike Tyson who
pleaded no contest to attacking two men following a fender-bender
involving his wife.
	   They saw a Mike Tyson who a few days earlier had handed out
turkeys to poor families. They saw a Mike Tyson who visited
teen-age inmates and paid for the funeral of a 2-year-old girl shot
to death during a burglary.
	   More important, they saw Mike Tyson succeeding in a somewhat
desperate, last-ditch attempt to rehabilitate his image.
	   ``You may not like him but he's doing things other people
won't,'' one caller said. ``Besides, he's a celebrity. And we need
more celebrities.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CORDOBA, Spain (AP) _ A thief made off with the silver slippers
of a 250-year-old sculpture of the baby Jesus during a feet kissing
ritual, news reports said Monday.
	   The 7-centimeter (three-inch) slippers, adorned with two
emeralds, were stolen Saturday as worshippers filed passed the
image to kiss its feet in the hermitage of the Roman Catholic
Brotherhood of Our Lady of Charity, the state-owned news agency EFE
reported.
	   The piece is attributed to the religious artist Duque Cornejo
who also sculpted the choir in the cathedral of this southern
Spanish city, the agency said.
	   Brother Manuel Serrano told EFE that the thief must have acted
quickly as the feet kissing faithful are watched over by members of
the brotherhood.
	   ``We don't think that it was an ordinary thief,'' the agency

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ronald Reagan's daughter gave him chocolates,
nature photo books and a snow globe for Christmas this year. She
wishes she could give him more time and peace from Alzheimer's
disease.
	   ``I'm not sure if my father still understands Christmas, but I'm
certain he understands giving,'' Patti Davis wrote in Sunday's New
York Times Magazine.
	   The former U.S. president will be 88 on Feb. 6.
	   Reagan tore open the chocolates at his desk.
	   ``Those are all for you, Dad. You don't have to share them with
anyone,'' his son Michael told him.
	   ``Oh, good,'' the former president responded, playfully pulling
the sweets toward him.
	   ``When my brother and I leave, I ask him who was given the
greater gift, our father or us,'' Ms. Davis wrote. ``He doesn't
need to answer me; we both know.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For author-turned-filmmaker Maya Angelou, making
a movie gave her a chance to use silence to say something.
	   Angelou makes her directorial debut in ``Down in the Delta,''
which opened last weekend and tells the story of an American black
family, divided between North and South. Two characters are trapped
in silence _ one by Alzheimer's and one by autism.
	   The movie opened over the weekend.
	   Angelou tapped into her own experience of being sexually
assaulted, an episode that left her speechless for six years.
	   ``For years I thought of my whole body as an ear,'' Angelou
said. ``When I write, I can't use silence. A person reading a book
doesn't want to encounter three or four pages of nothing. With
film, though, I could use silence to tell volumes.''
	   Angelou, a professor at Wake Forest University, North Carolina,
has written several books of poetry and the best seller ``I Know
Why the Caged Bird Sings.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Beware of Hungary's ``tourist police.''
	   Police arrested three Romanians accused of robbing tourists by
posing as policemen, the state news agency MTI reported Monday.
	   The trio would pose as ``tourist police'' _ there is no such
thing in Hungary _ and would stop tourists and fine them on a
variety of trumped up charges.
	   The three were taken into custody Sunday after police fired a
warning shot when they tried to flee. Police caught them in the act
on the Buda side of the Chain Bridge, one of the best known
Hungarian landmarks.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Out with the old ball, in with the new.
	   Officials announced Monday that the Times Square New Year's Eve
ball will be retired after it ushers in the new year one last time
Dec. 31 with its trademark minute-long descent down.
	   A new ball made of crystal will be in place for next December's
drop during the city's millennial celebration, to be seen on
television sets around the world.
	   The current ball, made of aluminum and weighing more than 500
lbs (225 kilos), is six-feet (two meters) in diameter, illuminated
by a 10,000-watt Xenon lamp, 180 75-watt halogen lamps, 144 glitter
strobe lights and 12,000 rhinestones.
	   The Millennial ball, to be completed by Waterford Crystal at its
headquarters in Ireland, is still in the planning stages.
	   This year's New Year's Eve celebration is expected to attract
500,000 people to Times Square and will feature three giant video
screens and a pyrotechnic display.

At least four dead in yacht race
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four sailors were confirmed dead after
two more bodies were hauled from the sea Tuesday in the worst
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race in history.
	   Two dead men, believed to be from the veteran cutter Winston
Churchill, were winched from a swell of about 3-meters (9-feet)
while another member of the crew was still missing. Rescuers also
called off the search for Briton Glyn Charles, presumed drowned.
	   Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea, who found the two bodies two
miles apart, said they were both found face down and were picked
out by nets.
	   ``It wasn't so difficult because the seas had abated a bit but
we were just lucky to find the second body,'' Lea told The
Associated Press in Eden.
	   ``The chances of the third man being found alive are slim, but
I'd never give up hope.''
	   The three members of the veteran cutter Winston Churchill went
missing after six of their crew mates were plucked from two life
rafts in the huge 10-meter (30-feet) seas of Bass Strait.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off Australia's southeast coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney.
	   The 725-mile (1,166 kilometers) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59
have been forced to seek shelter and several boats have been
abandoned, race officials said.
	   Some 27 navy ships were also searching for stranded sailors.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and crew members Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British Olympic sailor Charles was washed off the Sword of Orion
yacht Sunday night and after more than 26 hours at sea the rescue
officials gave up on him.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the maritime safety authority, said
it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24
hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a superman if he makes it,''
Poke said.
	   Maritime spokesman David Gray said many other sailors were
injured, with dislocated shoulders, broken legs, cuts and bruises.
	   ``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got
knocked down. A lot of them rolled over _ one rolled over twice,''
Gray said. ``They really got pounded yesterday.''
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   While two others were picked up from another life raft late
Monday, Winning only found out three of his crew were missing as he
gave a television interview Tuesday.
	   ``I just heard what you said in your intro there, that a couple
of fellows were reported washed off. That's the first I've heard of
that,'' Winning told the television reporter.
	   American maxi yacht Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the
finish line on the Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to
take line honors.
	   Although its early speed had in on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.
	   Brindabella was expected to finish second several hours behind.
	   Sayonara had its owner, Larry Ellison, aboard. Ellison is chief
executive officer and founder Oracle Corp., one of the largest
computer technology firms in the world with 8 billion US dlrs in
annual revenue.
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Sayonara helmsman Chris Dickson said, ``That's as tough as it
gets.''
	   ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big thing
and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast.

Tendulkar hits first century against New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar
hammered a sparkling unbeaten 111 to put India in the box seat in
the second cricket test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve
Tuesday.
	   Tendulkar's 17th test century guided India to 290 for four at
lunch. The visitors enjoy an overall lead of 146 runs and are well
placed to force a 1-0 lead in the three test series.
	   Tendulkar turned the match around after New Zealand had squeezed
out a 144-run lead, hitting 352 in reply to India's first innings
208.
	   Tendulkar, resuming the day on 42, smashed three successive
boundaries off left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori to reach his 50.
	   India, starting at 179 for three, lost Saurav Ganguly for 48
after an 88-run third wicket stand with Tendulkar in 96 minutes.
	   Ganguly's dismissal to off-spinner Paul Wiseman checked India's
search for quick runs.
	   But skipper Mohammad Azharuddin, 38 not out, was equal to the
task and with Tendulkar, set eyes on setting New Zealand a 300-plus
target late on the fourth day.
	   Tendulkar, smashed Vettori for a straight six to reach his first
century against New Zealand in five tests. It was the third time in
his 63-match career Tendulkar has reached a century with a six.
	   His century included a dozen boundaries and two sixes and came
off just 123 balls.
	   New Zealand bowlers continued to struggle for line and length in
extremely windy conditions.
	   Azharuddin followed up his first innings' unbeaten 103 with a
78-ball knock with three boundaries and added 90 for the fifth
wicket in just 96 minutes.
	   Wiseman has taken 2-83 in 17 overs.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ There's a few in every crowd: the ones
who stay away from New Year's parties. So it will be when most of
Western Europe joins the euro on Friday.
	   The 11 countries taking part in the single currency are united
in their belief that it will be an economic boon, but the four
stay-at-homes have varied reasons for not taking part.
	   Greece has its nose pressed against the window: it wants in but
wasn't invited. Britain and Denmark declined to go _ either because
they're prudent or squares, depending on whom you ask _ and Sweden
just couldn't decide.
	   The euro is being phased in gradually. It won't be used as cash
before 2002 and until then will be a sort of virtual money, used
for some credit card purchases, denominating stock prices, for
international transactions and for paychecks in some multinational
companies.
	   Because of the long phase-in period, the effects of staying
outside the system may take some time to show up.
	   ``The effects of the euro will come gradually, so I don't see
any major disadvantages'' to staying out in the near term, said
Jonas Fryckman, an economist with Industrifoerbundet, the Swedish
federation of industries.
	   Being outside the euro means that companies will still have to
absorb the costs and risks of exchanging currencies when buying or
selling goods in neighboring countries. That shouldn't be a problem
for world players like Swedish telecommunications giant LM
Ericsson, but economists are more concerned about the effect on
smaller companies.
	   A recent survey by the Swedish industrial group found that only
a fifth of the country's small and medium-sized companies had made
any preparations to help them compete in the euro bloc. These
companies were especially worried that not being part of the euro
would make it more difficult for them to make purchases or sales at
competitive prices.
	   To have small companies go out of business would get less notice
than troubles at giants such as Ericsson, but the cumulative
effects could be substantial.
	   The effect could be especially severe in Sweden, whose currency,
the krona, is not part of the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism under
which currencies are allowed to fluctuate only within narrow bands.
The krona has swung by some 16 percent against the German mark, the
group's strongest currency, this year.
	   Greece's drachma is tied to the exchange rate mechanism, thus
making the potential of it fluctuating against the euro negligible.
Analysts say the major danger of the euro era for Greece is that
the drachma could come under severe speculative pressure in the
event of a global financial crisis, forcing the government to
intervene heavily to prop up the currency.
	   But Greece is determined that that danger won't last for long.
The country is eager to participate in the euro, but was denied
admission to the first round because it did not meet strict
economic criteria, such as a modest inflation rate. This fall,
Greece had an inflation rate of 5 percent, the highest in the EU.
	   Greece is keeping a firm hand on its economy in order to meet
standards that would guarantee a euro invitation. The inflation
rate is expected to drop to 2 percent by the end of 1999, well
within euro criteria. Joining the system is the government's top
priority.
	   ``For us, 1999 is the most critical year to capitalize on the
efforts and sacrifices,'' Prime Minister Costas Simitis said
recently.
	   For Britons and Danes, 1999 is a year to sit back and watch what
happens. Both countries negotiated opt-outs from the 1992
Maastricht treaty that committed EU countries to the single
currency, reflecting wide public distrust of the idea. The Danish
opt-out came only after voters shocked the EU by refusing the
ratify the treaty in a referendum.
	   Sweden's governing Social Democrats favor joining the euro, at
least in theory, but are shy about putting the issue before voters
in a referendum _ an almost-mandatory move in non-authoritarian
Scandinavian countries _ because polls show low support among
voters, only about 40 percent in favor.
	   In Britain, support for the euro is the lowest of any of the
stay-away countries, just 29 percent according to a poll conducted
in December. And although London is one of the world's most
globally-minded financial cities, it's also the home of some the
euro's most vocal critics.
	   ``There is a tremendous amount of hype,'' said trade policy
expert Brian Hindley of the London School of Economics.
	   Even so, a majority of Britain's big business leaders support
the Labor Party government's policy of adopting the euro early next
century if it works well.

Proposed Internet bank would target gays, lesbians
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PENSACOLA, Florida (AP) _ When banks refused to finance his
planned gay and lesbian resort, Steven Dunlap scrapped that idea
and decided to start a financial institution that would welcome
homosexuals instead of spurn them.
	   The result is G and L Bank _ the initials stand for gay and
lesbian _ expected to open here in the spring pending final
approval from federal regulators, said Dunlap, the bank's chairman.
	   Not only would it be the only bank in the United States catering
specifically to homosexuals, it would be one of the first operating
primarily via the Internet.
	   ``The whole deal is to take banking away from you having to go
to the bank and let us bring the bank to you,'' Dunlap said. He
envisions gays and lesbians as an entry market but not the bank's
sole customer base.
	   ``Just like Federal Express is doing to overnight delivery, I
expect to be the No. 1 brand name in the Internet banking arena,''
Dunlap said. ``You're going to sort of forget, potentially, what
this G and L stands for.''
	   Bold talk, but Dunlap, 42, has some unique business credentials
to back it up.
	   He went from selling watermelons outside his father's appliance
store in Jonesboro, Arkansas, at age 8 to retirement in his early
30s after developing a series of novelty products. They include
Nightcrawlers, children's house shoes with eyes that light up to
guide youngsters through the dark, and Pet Peeves, talking collars
for cats and dogs.
	   He made his real fortune, however, by selling millions of
Moonies. The chubby doll-size figures attach to car windows with
suction cups like the ubiquitous Garfield-the-cat stick-ons, but
with a risque difference.
	   ``You squeezed the bulb and the little guy dropped his pants and
mooned people,'' Dunlap said. ``I got rich off of it and I quit.''
	   He moved in 1990 from Memphis, Tennessee, to Navarre Beach,
about 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Pensacola, planning nothing
more than to sit on the sugar-white beach and write a book about
fad products.
	   However, after noticing that thousands of homosexuals congregate
on area beaches every Memorial Day weekend, he decided the Florida
Panhandle could support a small gay and lesbian resort. Dunlap and
a motel developer drew up a plan and took it to local bankers about
six years ago.
	   ``You could just see the color run out of their faces,'' Dunlap
recalled. ``My personal impression and observation was that they
did not want anything to do with the financing solely because it
was a ... 'gay and lesbian' business.''
	   Dunlap, himself gay, figured if that was happening here it also
was happening to others elsewhere. Creating a bank for such a
geographically widespread market niche would have been difficult at
best before the Internet.
	   ``The Internet now allows us to deliver to this community
without having bricks and mortar,'' Dunlap said. ``It actually
allows me to put a bank branch in every house where there is a
computer.''
	   Internet banking remains in its infancy, however, so G and L has
had to do extensive research and development. That effort is headed
by G. Kay Griffith, G and L's president.
	   Ms. Griffith, 53, originally from Columbus, Ohio, worked for
major bank groups in California and Florida and was president of
Admiralty Bank in Palm Beach County until 1994 when she formed a
consulting company in Fort Lauderdale. She closed the business
after taking the G and L job in March.
	   ``There were a few moments when I candidly sat and said, 'Hmmm,
there are going to be questions asked about me,''' said Ms.
Griffith, who is heterosexual. ``But that took only about a
second.''
	   She had always been interested in civil rights and the
opportunity to be part of such a pioneering effort was too
attractive to pass up.
	   The bank's 11-member staff is almost equally split between
homosexuals and heterosexuals. Staffing at its Pensacola
headquarters is expected to increase to about 25 employees after
opening.
	   The Office of Thrift Supervision, a branch of the Treasury
Department, does not permit disclosure of an exact opening date or
capitalization until its national savings bank charter is approved.
	   Potential customers, however, are lining up.
	   Michele Johnson, a Houston retail manager, learned about G and L
from a newspaper article. She has had no problems herself but wants
to bank with G and L because she has heard horror stories from
other homosexuals who tried to open joint accounts at conventional
banks.
	   ``You know, the looks, the cold shoulders, people not really
wanting to do that and making you jump through all the hoops,'' she
said.

	   How does online drug ordering work?
	   Customers first type their credit-card information into a
computer.
	   They're typically asked to waive the site's liability if they
experience health problems. Then they fill out a questionnaire of
health information.
	   The Viagra sites alone differ dramatically in what health
questions they ask, and what prices they charge.
	   One site asks one question only: Do you take nitroglycerin or
other ``nitrates''? Taking Viagra with those drugs can kill. But

Another site asks about those additional health problems, including
whether would-be Viagra users recently had a ``myocardial

	   U.S. sites typically charge a ``consultation fee'' for a doctor
to read those questionnaires, an effort to fulfill requirements
that only doctors prescribe medication. The sites waive that fee if
the doctor denies the customer the drug. If the drug is shipped,
the customer pays the consultation fee, anywhere from dlrs 35 to
dlrs 85, plus the drug's cost _ at one U.S. site, dlrs 105 for 10
Viagra pills.
	   Foreign sites typically say they don't require a prescription _
hence no consultation fee and fewer health questions. One Viagra
site advertises a trial-run of just two Viagra tablets for dlrs 58.
Another advertises 30 Viagra pills for dlrs 620.

Unlike his beloved Pilgrims, American historian is ordered out
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Nearly four centuries after it
took in the Pilgrims, the Netherlands has ordered the United
States' foremost expert on the early American settlers to leave.
	   Dr. Jeremy Bangs, founder of a new Pilgrim museum in the
medieval city of Leiden, has been caught in the Dutch government's
immigration crackdown, a response to an unprecedented wave of
refugees pressing for permission to stay.
	   For Bangs, the order to leave by Jan. 15 is thick with irony.
The former chief curator of Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth,
Massachusetts, has been chronicling how the Pilgrims, before
boarding the Mayflower to what is now the United States, spent 11
years in a Holland that proudly declared in 1609 it ``refuses no
honest people free entry.''
	   The Netherlands' refusal to grant him a residency permit, Bangs
contends, will force the closure of the only museum focusing on the
Pilgrims' little-known years in exile here.
	   ``I'm not a refugee. I'm a historian,'' Bangs, 52, said Monday.
``They can expel me. They can just appear and deport me. It's
incredible. People are shocked, and my own mood is souring.''
	   The Justice Ministry, which oversees immigration policy, earlier
this month rejected Bangs' application for new residency papers,
saying the historian needed a work permit.
	   Officials also refuse to recognize Bangs' financial support,
expenses and health insurance through the New England Historic
Genealogical Society as an adequate source of income.
	   ``If he can't prove he has enough income, that's a problem,''
said Justice Ministry spokesman Victor Holtus.
	   Bangs, who has authored 10 books about the Pilgrims, was told he
could not apply for a work permit because he is officially
considered an employee of the museum he opened in November 1997 on
the Thanksgiving holiday, which dates back to the Pilgrims. Only
employers can apply.
	   ``The whole thing just makes me furious,'' said Jane Fiske,
editor of the Register of the New England Historic Genealogical
Society, which publishes Bangs' research. ``Jeremy is a genius.
He's one of a kind. I don't know of anybody else who can do what
he's doing.''
	   Bangs' Leiden American Pilgrim Museum is in a typical
Pilgrim-style 16th century one-room house in the heart of Leiden,
25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Amsterdam.
	   It was an instant hit in the town that offered refuge to 100
Pilgrims and still holds yearly Thanksgiving Day services in the
main church. Since it opened, more than 2,600 people have visited
the cramped museum cluttered with Pilgrim-era tools, pottery and
furniture.
	   Hoping to save the museum, supporters worldwide are writing
letters to Queen Beatrix and Cabinet ministers on behalf of Bangs,
his wife and their dog.
	   Even the Ministry of Culture has said that Bangs' work ``serves
an essential interest of the Netherlands.''
	   But the Justice Ministry has refused to budge. It is struggling
to contain a record of nearly 50,000 illegal immigrants who have
streamed into the affluent country in 1998 from Turkey, Afghanistan
and the former Yugoslavia.
	   ``Nobody could be more politically harmless than Jeremy,'' Fiske
said. ``You know, I used to be proud of my own Dutch heritage. But
not anymore.''

Vikings, Broncos have that super look
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If the Minnesota Vikings win the Super Bowl,
they may look back to Nov. 1 as the most important day of the
season.
	   That's when they lost for the only time this season _ 27-24 in
Tampa. The loss allowed them to concentrate on the rest of the
season without the pressure of trying to go unbeaten. The Denver
Broncos carried such a burden in starting 13-0.
	   So make the Vikings the favorite to win the Super Bowl as they
enter the playoffs relaxed and relatively healthy. And make the
Jets a decent bet to upset the Broncos for the American Football
Conference title because Bill Parcells has his team peaking
perfectly for the postseason.
	   Forget the big-name teams _ the 49ers, Packers and Cowboys, all
Super Bowl winners this decade. At best, they have an outside
chance to reach the conference title game, but little chance of
winning in Minnesota.
	   ``I was hoping for a little more momentum,'' Green Bay coach
Mike Holmgren said after the Packers stumbled to a 16-13 win
against Chicago on Sunday.
	   ``We didn't function as well as I'd have liked. We were a little
sloppy, but we won the game and that's what I was hoping for going
into the playoffs.''
	   A look at the playoffs by conference.
	    &UR; American Football Conference &LR;  &QC; 
	   Denver (14-2) remains the favorite.
	   The Broncos will be home, where they've won 24 straight
regular-season games. They also got some of their momentum back by
beating the Seahawks 28-21 on Sunday.
	   But it could get a little scary for Denver if the Jets come to
Mile High for the AFC title game. Parcells has been to three Super
Bowls and he's had all three of those teams (the 1986 and 1990
Giants and the 1996 Patriots) playing their best at season's end,
just the way his team is playing now.
	   ``Damn! What kind of coach is he, really?'' asked Keyshawn
Johnson after the Jets beat the Patriots 31-10 Sunday, dominating
them in a game that meant more to New England.
	   ``You take a team from 1-15 to 12-4 to the postseason to the AFC
East championship. It's crazy.''
	   Actually, there was a midway point _ 9-7 last year in Parcells'
first season with the Jets. And it's not really crazy given
Parcells' style _ assembling a hard-working group of veterans who
set the tone for younger players.
	   Johnson himself is an example, a high-profile, high-talent
youngster who Parcells has transformed into a Pro Bowler from a
``me-first'' player who wrote an autobiography titled ``Just Give
Me the Damn Ball'' after an uninspired rookie season.
	   Denver remains the favorite to return to the Super Bowl.
	   The home field, John Elway and Terrell Davis do that for the
Broncos. And Mike Shanahan is in Parcells' class as a coach _ he
did a marvelous job avoiding the post-Super Bowl letdown that
plagues most champions.
	   It would hard to go beyond the AFC's top two.
	   Buffalo is probably the scariest because Doug Flutie has
demonstrated he can perform the same kind of miracles in the NFL as
in Canada and at Boston College. On Saturday, they go to Miami,
where the Dolphins will be without one of their key defensive
players, Jason Taylor, who broke his collarbone in Atlanta on
Sunday.
	   New England and Jacksonville, the other two AFC entries, will
meet Sunday with either backup quarterbacks or damaged quarterbacks
_ Drew Bledsoe has a broken finger and Mark Brunell has a sprained
ankle. The winner goes to Mile High Stadium or the Meadowlands,
which probably means the winner goes no farther.
	    &UR; National Football Conference &LR;  &QC; 
	   Which opening game is more interesting, Green Bay at San
Francisco or Arizona at Dallas?
	   Probably the first, simply because the teams involved are in the
dying dynasty category. The 49ers' front office is in turmoil and
its defense is terrible; the Packers have a lot of injuries and
Brett Favre is having an off-year.
	   But the second game has its charms _ the Cardinals haven't won a
playoff game in 51 years and have lost 16 of the last 17 games
they've played with Dallas, including 38-10 and 35-28 this year.
	   Whichever team advances has little chance _ Dallas was the first
team ever to go 8-0 in the NFC East, but was 2-6 against everyone
else, and eventually the Cowboys will have to play outside their
division.
	   Can San Francisco or Green Bay win in Atlanta or Minneapolis?
	   Unlikely.
	   This is the first year a team with a dome has home-field
advantage, and that can make a huge difference in big games. Still,
the Packers were reasonably competitive at Minnesota this year _
they were done in by two early turnovers and couldn't catch up
although they were in the game until the final minutes.
	   Can Atlanta win at Minnesota?
	   Maybe.
	   The Falcons have demonstrated they can dominate the Rams,
Panthers, Saints, Colts and other underlings. Their impressive wins
were 41-10 in New England and 31-19 over the 49ers at home. Their
loss to the Jets should contain an asterisk _ Steve DeBerg was at
quarterback for Chris Chandler.
	   But this will be the first playoff experience for most of them
and winning in Minnesota may be too much.
	   Prediction?
	   A month ago, it was easy _ Vikings-Broncos.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A fire at an oil refinery killed
four workers and injured eight others, a spokesman said Monday.
	   The fire broke out just before noon Sunday at the Gabriel Passos
Refinery in Betim, an industrial suburb of Belo Horizonte, 210
miles (340 kms) north of Rio.
	   Fifty workers were in the refinery when the fire began, possibly
caused by leaking gasoline, refinery spokesman Rodrigo Moreira
said.
	   One worker was burned to death instantly and three others died
in the hospital of injuries, Moreira said. Eight remained
hospitalized, three critically.
	   The refinery, which belongs to the federal oil company
Petrobras, was undergoing maintenance and operating below capacity
of 152,000 barrels of oil a day.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A distraught mother who buried her
newborn baby alive said Monday she wants her baby back.
	   The baby girl, who remains in critical condition in a Brasilia
hospital, spent Christmas Eve in a plastic bag in which her mother
had buried her under a mound of dirt, police said.
	   ``I don't know how I could have done this,'' a sobbing Marinete
Liberalina de Souza told reporters. ``I want to fight for her. I
don't want to give her to anyone.''
	   The baby, known as Vitoria in the Brazilian press, was born a
month premature after de Souza, a 22-year-old maid, took medication
to induce an abortion.
	   After the birth, de Souza left the infant on her doorstep for
some 13 hours before burying her. Baby Vitoria then spent 10
minutes underground before being rescued by a suspicious neighbor,
said police spokeswoman Roselena Carneiro.
	   De Souza claimed she abandoned the baby because she didn't have
the financial means to care for her. She remains in jail on charges
of attempted murder and faces between six and 20 years in prison.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A former admiral during
Argentina's military rule was arrested Monday, the fifth officer
detained this year for kidnapping babies during the seven-year
military dictatorship.
	   Ruben Franco, the last naval admiral before the military junta's
fall in 1983, was detained after being questioned in federal court.
	   Federal judge Adolfo Bagnasco said Franco's testimony is crucial
to pending cases against two former leaders of the dictatorship,
Jorge Videla and Emilio Massera. Both are currently under house
arrest.
	   Two other former top-ranking officials, retired admirals Jorge
Vanek and Jose Supissich, are also sequestered at home.
	   Argentine judges are investigating whether a systematic plan
existed for the illicit adoption of more than 200 children born to
dissidents in captivity during Argentina's 1976-83 ``dirty war.''
	   Prosecutors contend the children, born to women who eventually
were murdered, were then given to military officials to be raised.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Seven people critically wounded in an
explosion at a sugar processing plant are not expected to survive,
hospital officials said Monday.
	   Four workers were killed in Saturday's blast at the Ingenio San
Antonio plant in northwestern Nicaragua. The explosion occurred
while the workers tried to fix a broken pump.
	   The injured were flown to a hospital in the capital city
Managua, 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of the plant.
	   Hospital officials said the injured have second and third degree
burns on almost 100 percent of their bodies.
	   ___
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Preliminary tests show half the
inmates in Puerto Rican prisons are infected with hepatitis C, a
serious liver disease, Puerto Rico's health department said Monday.
	   Health Secretary Carmen Feliciano confirmed a report by El Nuevo
Dia newspaper that 49 percent of inmates _ 5,695 of 11,530 _ tested
in August carried the virus.
	   She told reporters that a second round of tests to verify
results has not been completed, and added officials suspect many of
the inmates were already infected when they were imprisoned. Many
were drug users who could have been infected by sharing needles
before they were imprisoned, Feliciano said.
	   ``At this moment, we cannot arrive at the conclusion that this
is an outbreak,'' she said. ``We don't know which ones are serious
and which are chronic, nor can we conclude whether they were
contaminated inside or outside the prison.''
	   Hepatitis C is most commonly transmitted through intravenous
drug use. Hepatitis B and C, the more serious of the three
hepatitis strains, cause liver damage as well as jaundice, fatigue,
abdominal pain and nausea. In some cases, they can cause liver
failure and death.
	   There are about 13,000 people in Puerto Rico's prisons, which
are plagued by riots and gang warfare.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Energy Regulatory Commission
authorized Monday the construction of a 42.7 megawatt power plant
in southeastern Quintana Roo state.
	   The said in a press release that Wartsila Diesel and Associates,
a unit of Finland-based Wartsila NSD Corp., will invest about dlrs
34 million in the project.
	   The power plant is expected to supply electricity to more than
100 hotels in the Caribbean resort of Cancun.
	   The plant will be located in the Puerto Morelos industrial park.
Construction is expected to be completed in the year 2000.
	   The project is led by Energia de Quintana Roo, a utility formed
by the municipality of Benito Juarez, where the industrial park is
located, Wartsila Diesel and local concerns Desarrollos Hidraulicos
de Cancun and Greco Maya.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ When the door to Tango 1 swings
open after touching down on foreign soil, President Carlos Menem
descends from the official jet shadowed by a woman half his age.
	   She's been dubbed ``Lady Zu'' after wowing audiences in Britain
and Japan. She's even upstaged Menem during a historic state visit.
	   The woman who looks young enough to be Menem's daughter is in
fact his daughter: 27-year-old Zulema.
	   After a very public and bitter divorce from his wife in 1991,
Menem turned to Zulema to accompany him abroad. Now Zulema is
adding sparkle to his decade in office, which ends in December
1999.
	   While Zulema doesn't travel in any official capacity, she has
been dubbed ``La Primera Damita'' _ Spanish for ``The Little First
Lady.'' She isn't entirely comfortable with the label.
	   ``I don't consider myself the First Lady,'' she told reporters
in December while accompany her father on a state visit to Japan.
	   Her ability to capture foreign audiences reminds many of Eva
Peron, Argentina's most famous first lady. Zulema's middle name,
Eva, was bestowed in her memory.
	   When her father paid a state visit to Britain in November, the
press trailed her as she strolled London's streets in head-to-toe
black leather. Her short skirts left England's upper crust
speechless. Swapping chocolate bon bons and flirty smiles with
Prince Andrew, Zulema sparked short-lived rumors of a budding
romance.
	   The first Argentine president to visit Britain since the 1982
Falkland Islands war, Menem laid a wreath for Britain's 255 slain
soldiers at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. But it was Zulema who
defined the moment of reconciliation between onetime foes when she
was photographed brushing away a tear behind dark sunglasses.
	   Zulema's lasting impression prompted an Argentine war veterans
group to ask the British government to allow her to travel to the
South Atlantic archipelago with Argentines who lost young men
buried there. Britain hasn't responded to the request.
	   Asked about the spotlight on his daughter, Menem responds as a
proud father would, telling the Argentine magazine Gente that
Zulema ``is very accessible and simple, and that's the best way to
make an impression.''
	   In mid-December, Zulema landed on the cover of the popular
magazine as one of the 100 most prominent Argentines of the year.
	   Zulema's exploits abroad have brought her publicity at home as
magazines report on everything from her ``perfect'' body to her
taste for expensive suits.
	   Her role is not unique in Latin America. The 23-year-old
daughter of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimor is a frequent
companion on his state visits.
	   Fujimori named his daughter First Lady four years ago, after an
acrimonious divorce from Susan Higuchi. A Boston University
graduate who heads the Foundation for Peru's Children, the daughter
Keiko Sofia usually avoids contact with the press.
	   In Argentina, not all are impressed by the spotlight on Zulema.
	   ``Listen, she's the president's daughter and that makes this all
very interesting,'' said Laura Garcia, a 40-year-old housewife.
``But someone her age should have a real job.''

USOC commission convenes to begin Salt Lake bid probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Officials from the 2002 Winter Games
organizing committee will not be in attendance when a U.S. Olympic
Committee panel probing bribery allegations holds its first meeting
on Tuesday in Washington, D.C.
	   But the Salt Lake Organizing Committee will be closely
monitoring the special commission, which will examine the methods
used by Salt Lake bid committee officials to obtain the games.
	   No agenda for the meeting has been released, but it probably
will involve planning and scheduling for the commission's actions
over the coming weeks. A press briefing is scheduled for Tuesday.
	   Former Senate majority leader George Mitchell, the co-chair of
the USOC ethics committee, was appointed by USOC president Bill
Hybl to chair the special commission, which is expected to review
any past improprieties and make recommendations for rules on future
bid and selection processes.
	   ``The USOC must respond quickly and credibly to the allegations
and issues,'' Hybl said in a statement Monday.
	   The panel plans to submit a report to the USOC by Feb. 28, and
any criminal activity uncovered will be referred to the Justice
Department, officials said.
	   ``We considered all the options, but it was clear that the USOC
needed to step forward quickly to provide independent oversight
review,'' Dick Schultz, executive director of the USOC.
	   The USOC probe is one of four investigations which will be under
way by January. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced
its intention to determine if SLOC's actions constituted violations
of federal law, including tax fraud or corruption laws.
	   The International Olympic Committee also has created a special
committee to probe the allegations and its organization's role in
the process, while an independent Salt Lake ethics committee will
examine the bid committee's actions.
	   The IOC's 11-member executive board plans to meet Jan. 24 to
review its investigation's findings. The USOC and the independent
local committee plan to finish their investigations by February.
	   The Justice Department's probe could last much longer and has
the potential to be the most damaging, because the Justice
Department has the power to subpoena witnesses and compel testimony
and to hand out indictments.
	   Salt Lake bid officials allegedly paid for scholarships for
relatives of International Olympic Committee members, provided IOC
members with free medical services, and gave numerous gifts in
violation of IOC rules.
	   SLOC officials say they will cooperate with all of the probes
and get back to preparing for the games.

Mexican Indians arrested in killing of U.S. correspondent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three new grafs at the end with statement from
newspaper. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Philip True, Mexico City correspondent for
the San Antonio Express-News, was killed by two Huichol Indians
because they didn't want their picture taken, officials said
Monday.
	   Horacio Vega, homicide investigator with the Jalisco state
attorney general's office, told a news conference the suspects had
confessed to strangling True earlier this month to prevent him from
taking their photo.
	   Vega said the suspects, both Huichol Indians, became angry at
True's alleged attempt to photograph them, and later stole True's
camera and other belongings. They were identified as Juan Chivarras
de la Cruz, 28, and Miguel Hernandez de la Cruz, 24.
	   The suspects are charged with homicide and robbery, and could
face jail sentences of up to 50 years if found guilty. Mexico does
not have a death penalty.
	   Police continue searching for Chivarras's wife, Yolanda, who
apparently witnessed the murder, Vega said.
	   True, 50, disappeared while hiking alone through a remote region
of the Sierra Madre Occidental, where he was spending vacation time
and pursuing a story on the Huichol Indian culture.
	   His body was found Dec. 16 in a shallow grave in west-central
Jalisco state. An autopsy performed Dec. 17 in Guadalajara, the
state capital, determined True had been strangled as many as 10
days before his body had been found.
	   A second autopsy was conducted Dec. 19 by the federal attorney
general's office and supervised by a U.S. forensic expert hired by
the FBI.
	   The results of the second autopsy have not been released, but
the attorney general's office said in a statement Monday it would
share its conclusions with state officials ``in due time''.
	   Officials said the suspects had been arrested by soldiers
Saturday in the region where True had been killed and they were
flown that day to a Guadalajara prison.
	   In a story proposal submitted earlier this year to his editors,
True said the Huicholes, unlike other indigenous groups in Mexico,
``have retained a certain joy in their life.''
	   ``A day near a Huichol community is marked by the nearly
constant sound of children laughing and playing,'' True wrote.
``This kind of joy gives them a certain integrity in their being
that allows them to welcome in strangers.''
	   Express-News editor Robert Rivard said in a written statement,
``the evidence surrounding their arrest, details they provided
investigators in their statements, and the recovery of Philip's
personal property all suggest the right suspects are in custody.''
	   ``Their explanation, while plausible to some degree, doesn't
explain their brutality, their decision to stage his murder as a
hiking accident, or the decision to rob him after he was killed,''
the statement added.
	   As to fears the arrest of the two Huichol Indians will lead to
cultural tensions among the indigenous community in the region and
U.S. citizens, Rivard's statement said: ``We hope Huichol
representatives will join us in condemning the murder, which we
regard as an isolated incident that in no way reflects upon the
larger community.''

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four sailors were confirmed dead and
two others presumed drowned after two more bodies were hauled from
the sea Tuesday in the worst Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race in
history.
	   Two dead men, believed to be from the veteran cutter Winston
Churchill, were winched from a swell of about 3-meters (9-feet). A
third man from Winston Churchill is missing while rescuers have
called off the search for Briton Glyn Charles, missing for more
than 36 hours.
	   Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea, who found the two bodies two
miles apart and 50 miles offshore early Tuesday, said they were
both found face down and were picked out by nets.
	   ``It wasn't so difficult because the seas had abated a bit but
we were just lucky to find the second body,'' Lea told The
Associated Press in Eden. ``The chances of the third man being
found alive are slim, but I'd never give up hope.''
	   The three members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler, Mike
Bannister and John Dean, went missing after six of their crew mates
were plucked from two life rafts in the huge 10-meter (30-feet)
seas of Bass Strait.
	   Sea Hawk helicopter pilot Nic Trimmor, who rescued two survivors
in the second raft, said the three were washed away by a single
wave after hanging on grimly.
	   ``They got hit by numerous big waves, but one wave in particular
threw three of them out and they were unable to recover these three
back into the life raft,'' Trimmor said.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off Australia's southeast coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney.
	   The 725-mile (1,166 kilometers) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Only two deaths had previously been
recorded in the race.
	   Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59 have been forced to seek
shelter and several boats have been abandoned, race officials said.
	   Some 35 military and civilian aircraft and 27 navy ships were
involved in the search for stranded sailors.
	   Two Australian sailors were killed when the 40-foot (12-meter)
boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the
New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce
Guy and crew members Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British Olympic sailor Charles was washed off the Sword of Orion
yacht Sunday night.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the maritime safety authority, said
it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24
hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a superman if he makes it,''
Poke said.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   While two others were picked up from another life raft late
Monday, Winning only found out three of his crew were missing as he
gave a television interview Tuesday.
	   ``I just heard what you said in your intro there, that a couple
of fellows were reported washed off. That's the first I've heard of
that,'' Winning told the reporter.
	   American maxi yacht Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the
finish line on the Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to
take line honors ahead of Brindabella.
	   Although its early speed had in on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.
	   Sayonara's owner, billionaire United States businessman Larry
Ellison, was one of several teary-eyed at the finish of the race.
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. It's a
tough crew, but the guys were choked up.''
	   Sayonara helmsman Chris Dickson said the 23-member crew was
thinking more about the sailors in trouble than the victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big thing
and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said. ``Anyone
who is not scared in those conditions is not human.''
	   Among the crew was Lachlan Murdoch, son of media magnate Rupert.
	   ``Everyone here is very saddened and it gives you mixed feelings
about being part of it all,'' Murdoch said.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early
Tuesday amid the annual year-end trading lull. Japanese stock
prices rose slightly.
	   The dollar bought 115.92 yen in early trading, down 0.20 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but marginally above its late New York
level of 115.90 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 44.37 points,
or 0.32 percent, to 13,753.43 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Monday, the average closed down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar changed little from its New
York level in the absence of major market-moving news.
	   At one point in New York, the dollar gained some ground on
Monday following news that tensions between the United States and
Iraq had heated up again. But the currency failed to hold on to the
gains.
	   U.S. warplanes fired missiles Monday at an Iraqi air defense
site in the northern part of the country. The attack came two days
after Baghdad announced it would fire at Western aircraft
patrolling the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. pilots
opened fire in self-defense.
	   On the stock market, share prices started slightly higher in
thin trading as many participants have taken off for the New Year
holidays.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.76 points
to 9,226.75 at Monday's close.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 2.97 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,082.86. The
TOPIX closed down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early trading. On Monday, it finished at 1.685
percent and its price settled at 100.93 yen.

Stern wants players to vote, union says no

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The commissioner of the U.S. National Basketball
Association wants the players to vote on his ``final'' offer to end
a 6-month lockout by owners. But the union won't allow it.
	   That's where things stood Monday on Day 181 of the NBA lockout.
And if nothing changes for another 10 days, David Stern says the
entire basketball season will be canceled.
	   ``We do not anticipate any further negotiations between now and
January 7,'' the commissioner said. ``If the players have something
to tell us, we'll take it back to our (labor) committee, but the
likelihood is that the season will be canceled Jan. 7.''
	   The league and the union held separate media conference calls,
each side settling into the familiar roles of optimists (players)
vs. pessimists (owners).
	   Stern, in some of his strongest and most sarcastic remarks of
the lockout, said the players' ``runaway'' negotiating committee
will be to blame if there is no agreement by Jan. 7. That's the
date of a Board of Governors meeting at which Stern predicted there
will be an overwhelming majority of owners voting to cancel the
entire season.
	   Union director Billy Hunter, still confident that a deal is
possible, called for a resumption of talks between both sides'
negotiating committees.
	   ``I'm convinced that if that does happen, there's a strong
possibility that an agreement could be reached,'' Hunter said.
``We've done everything that we believe is conceivable, and we have
been earnest in our efforts to make a deal. It comes down to horse
trading, and if they are inclined to trade further, we have ample
time to save the season.''
	   The sides met for several hours Sunday outside Denver, with the
talks breaking off after each side made several concessions.
	   Allan Houston of the Knicks said the owners' moves were paltry.
	   ``To me, it's like putting garbage in the oven and putting sugar
on it,'' he said.
	   Stern said it was his ``final'' offer, and he campaigned to have
the entire union membership _ about 415 players _ vote on it.
	   He also predicted the league will survive a canceled season if
it comes to that.
	   ``The NBA will open next year,'' he said. ``It may not have the
same players, it may not have the same ticket prices and it may not
have the same television revenue. But it will be a league and it
will survive for a long time, and it will continue to grow and
recoup itself. It will have suffered tremendously, but it will live
to entertain another day and ultimately thrive.''

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ United States billionaire Larry
Ellison, in tears after battling through the horror of the
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, said he had never experienced worse
conditions at sea.
	   Ellison, the founder and chief executive of computer giant
Oracle, won his second Sydney-to-Hobart race but arrived in Hobart
early Tuesday to a funereal atmosphere.
	   Asked if he'd come back again, Ellison said, ``My first reaction
is not if I live to a thousand years. But who knows?''
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said. ``It's been a very emotional experience
to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot
of us are upset.''
	   Ellison said it was an extraordinarily difficult journey as his
yacht battled ``right through the eye of a hurricane'' and his crew
heard by radio of the deaths in the battered fleet.
	   Sayonara finished the race in two days, 20 hours, three minutes
and 32 seconds, but missing the record time was irrelevant to the
shaken crew, which included media magnate Rupert Murdoch's son
Lachlan.
	   ``Guys were knocked down time and time again, but kept getting
up to do what had to be done to keep us alive,'' Ellison said.
``It's a tough crew, but the guys were choked up. We were learning
of people dying.''
	   At least four sailors have died and two others are missing,
presumed drowned, in the worst tragedy to hit the race in its
54-year history.
	   Sayonara crossed the finishing line to a subdued welcome by a
smaller-than-usual spectator fleet and dockside crowd. The 23-man
crew aboard the maxi were safe, except for one who had a broken
ankle.
	   A welcome celebration was postponed and the trophy presentation
was delayed until January 2.
	   ``That's as tough as it gets,'' said Sayonara's helmsman Chris
Dickson. ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big
thing and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done.''
	   New Zealander Dickson, who said he has experienced similar
conditions in the Whitbread Around the World race, was unsure if he
would attempt this event again.
	   ``Anyone who is not scared in those conditions is not human,''
Dickson said. ``For a long time in Bass Strait we were not racing.
Nor was anyone else.''
	   Murdoch, chief executive of family-owned Australian newspaper
business News Limited, said the race was a great tragedy which the
crew was still trying to absorb.
	   ``Everyone here is very saddened and it gives you mixed feelings
about being part of it all,'' Murdoch said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four sailors were confirmed dead and
two others presumed drowned Tuesday in the worst Sydney-to-Hobart
yacht race in history.
	   Two of the dead, believed to be from the veteran cutter Winston
Churchill, were winched from a swell of about 3-meters (9-feet). A
third man from the cutter was missing while rescuers have called
off the search for Briton Glyn Charles, missing for more than 36
hours.
	   Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea, who found the two bodies two
miles (1.2 kilometers) apart and 50 miles (31 kilometers) offshore
early Tuesday, said they were both found face down and were picked
out by nets.
	   ``It wasn't so difficult because the seas had abated a bit but
we were just lucky to find the second body,'' Lea told The
Associated Press in Eden. ``The chances of the third man being
found alive are slim, but I'd never give up hope.''
	   The three members of the Winston Churchill _ Jim Lawler, Mike
Bannister and John Dean _ went missing after six of their crew
mates were plucked from two life rafts in the huge 10-meter
(30-feet) seas of Bass Strait.
	   Sea Hawk helicopter pilot Nic Trimmor, who rescued two survivors
in the second raft, said the three were washed away by a single
wave after hanging on grimly.
	   ``They got hit by numerous big waves, but one wave in particular
threw three of them out and they were unable to recover these three
back into the life raft,'' Trimmor said.
	   Five-story masts snapped like toothpicks and swamped boats
wallowed in roiling seas Monday off Australia's southeast coast,
about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney.
	   The 725-mile (1,166-kilometer) race continued despite the worst
tragedy in its 54-year history. Only two deaths had previously been
recorded in the race, which began in 1945.
	   Of the 115 yachts that entered, 59 have been forced to seek
shelter and several boats have been abandoned, race officials said.
	   Some 35 military and civilian aircraft and 27 navy ships were
involved in the search for stranded sailors.
	   Two Australian sailors died when the 40-foot (12-meter) boat
Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95 kilometers) off the New
South Wales town of Merimbula. Killed were the yacht's
owner-skipper Bruce Guy and crew members Phil Skeggs.
	   Guy suffered an apparent heart attack during one of the boat's
two rollovers and Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself
from his safety harness.
	   ``Dad loved sailing,'' said Guy's son, Mark. ``He loved the
competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad
simply loved life.''
	   British Olympic sailor Charles was washed off the Sword of Orion
yacht Sunday night.
	   Robin Poke, a spokesman for the maritime safety authority, said
it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24
hours in the wild seas. ``He will be a superman if he makes it,''
Poke said.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   While two others were picked up from another life raft late
Monday, Winning only found out three of his crew were missing as he
gave a television interview Tuesday.
	   American maxi yacht Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the
finish line on the Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to
take line honors ahead of Brindabella.
	   Sayonara's owner, billionaire U.S. businessman Larry Ellison,
was one of several teary-eyed at the finish of the race.
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' said Ellison, chief executive officer and founder of
Oracle Corp.
	   Sayonara helmsman Chris Dickson said the 23-member crew was
thinking more about the sailors in trouble than the victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big thing
and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ When the door to Tango 1 swings
open after touching down on foreign soil, President Carlos Menem
descends from the official jet shadowed by a woman half his age.
	   She's been dubbed ``Lady Zu'' after wowing audiences in Britain
and Japan. She's even upstaged Menem during a historic state visit.
	   The woman who looks young enough to be Menem's daughter is in
fact his daughter: 27-year-old Zulema.
	   After a very public and bitter divorce from his wife in 1991,
Menem turned to Zulema to accompany him abroad. Now Zulema is
adding sparkle to his decade in office, which ends in December
1999.
	   While Zulema doesn't travel in any official capacity, she has
been dubbed ``La Primera Damita'' _ Spanish for ``The Little First
Lady.'' She isn't entirely comfortable with the label.
	   ``I don't consider myself the First Lady,'' she told reporters
in December while accompanying her father on a state visit to
Japan.
	   Her ability to capture foreign audiences reminds many of Eva
Peron, Argentina's most famous first lady. Zulema's middle name,
Eva, was bestowed in her memory.
	   When her father paid a state visit to Britain in November, the
press trailed her as she strolled London's streets in head-to-toe
black leather. Her short skirts left England's upper crust
speechless. Swapping chocolate bon bons and flirty smiles with
Prince Andrew, Zulema sparked short-lived rumors of a budding
romance.
	   The first Argentine president to visit Britain since the 1982
Falkland Islands war, Menem laid a wreath for Britain's 255 slain
soldiers at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. But it was Zulema who
defined the moment of reconciliation between onetime foes when she
was photographed brushing away a tear behind dark sunglasses.
	   Zulema's lasting impression prompted an Argentine war veterans
group to ask the British government to allow her to travel to the
South Atlantic archipelago with Argentines who lost young men
buried there. Britain hasn't responded to the request.
	   Asked about the spotlight on his daughter, Menem responded as a
proud father would, telling the Argentine magazine Gente that
Zulema ``is very accessible and simple, and that's the best way to
make an impression.''
	   In mid-December, Zulema landed on the cover of the popular
magazine as one of the 100 most prominent Argentines of the year.
	   Zulema's exploits abroad have brought her publicity at home as
magazines report on everything from her ``perfect'' body to her
taste for expensive suits.
	   Her role is not unique in Latin America. Keiko Sofia, the
23-year-old daughter of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, is a
frequent companion on his state visits.
	   Fujimori named his daughter First Lady four years ago, after an
acrimonious divorce from Susan Higuchi. A Boston University
graduate who heads the Foundation for Peru's Children, Sofia
usually avoids contact with the press.
	   In Argentina, not all are impressed by the spotlight on Zulema.
	   ``Listen, she's the president's daughter and that makes this all
very interesting,'' said Laura Garcia, a 40-year-old housewife.
``But someone her age should have a real job.''

Pilot taken back in time

<TEXT>
	   MERIMBULA, Australia (AP) _ Navy pilot Tanzi Lea peered down
into mountainous seas and was carried back 20 years to the 1979
Fastnet race where 15 sailors perished.
	   Lea was the pilot of a navy Sea King helicopter which hauled two
dead sailors out of Bass Strait on Tuesday, bringing the death toll
from the Sydney-to-Hobart race to four confirmed with two others
presumed drowned.
	   He was a member of Britain's Royal Navy during the Fastnet
rescue off the southwest coast of Ireland where only 85 yachts
finished out of 303 starters because of high winds and punishing
waves.
	   ``The seas were as big as I saw during rescues in the Fastnet
race 20 years ago,'' Lea told The Associated Press after arriving
back in this New South Wales town with the two bodies Tuesday.
``Under those circumstances you've got to be careful and act
prudently.''
	   Lea, now with the Australian navy, was involved throughout this
search and rescue process. He said the weather was at its worst
Monday and Sunday but had calmed considerably by the time his
helicopter reached the bodies Tuesday.
	   ``A big depression formed quickly and although a change was
expected I don't think people thought it would be this bad,'' Lea
said.
	   The two dead men were believed to be from the veteran cutter
Winston Churchill. Another crew member is missing while six others
were carried to safety.
	   Two of the men saved were in a life raft which had its bottom
torn away by heavy seas. A wave knocked their three mates out of
reach.
	   Shane Pashley, a navy diver, reached the two crew members who
had managed to hang onto the remnants of their life raft.
	   ``We winched the first guy up who was absolutely exhausted, the
waves were crashing over the top of the raft which made it very
difficult as I was continually dragged under the water,'' Pashley
said.
	   ``Once we'd winched him up we put him on the floor of the
aircraft and turned the heaters up because he was suffering from
exposure.''
	   The harness was sent down for the second survivor but it snagged
on the life raft. He was eventually hauled aboard the helicopter.
	   ``One bloke said he knew where the other guys were but we
couldn't do anything as we were nearly out of fuel,'' Pashley said.
``They were just really tired and very thirsty, one of the guys was
only wearing a spray jacket and shorts.''
	   Pashley, like most Australians, has vivid memories of the rescue
of English yachtsman Tony Bullimore, who showed unrestrained joy
after being found following four days alone at sea in early 1997.
	   But there was no great sense of celebration for Pashley.
	   ``There were no Tony Bullimore-style kisses,'' he said. ``They
were just done.''

Hussain digs in against Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England's Nasser Hussain scored a
gritty half-century Tuesday to push the tourists to a 104-run lead
at lunch on the fourth day of the fourth test against Australia at
the MCG.
	   England was 174 for five in its second innings with Hussain
unbeaten on 50 and Graeme Hick not out 30.
	   Hussain came to the wicket after Australian paceman Glenn
McGrath clean bowled nightwatchman Dean Headley for one with an
off-cutter.
	   England skipper Alec Stewart fell shortly after for 52,
following a first innings century, when he prodded forward to a
Stuart MacGill leg-spinner and was caught at short point by Michael
Slater for 52.
	   Mark Ramprakash was fifth down when debut player Matthew
Nicholson brought one back off the seam to bowl the Englishman for
14.
	   Hick was aggressive in supporting Hussain, who registered his
third half-century of the series with a mixture of cautious defense
and shrewd placement. Their partnership was worth 47 at the lunch

China's legislature approves first national securities law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After years of debate and bureaucratic
infighting, the top committee of China's legislature approved
Tuesday a national law to police the country's freewheeling
securities markets.
	   The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted
the law on the last day of a six-day session. The law will take
effect July 1, 1999, Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   It said the 12-chapter, 214-article law governs all aspects of
the securities industry, from the issue and trading of stocks to
purchases of listed companies, registration and accounts settlement
agencies, government regulatory bodies and penalties for violating
the law.
	   The new law retains a prohibition already in force against
foreign investors buying shares in China's A-share market, which is
open only to domestic investors, Xinhua said.
	   The securities industry will be separated into two tiers, with
brokerages required to separate their own trading accounts from
those of their clients. Securities firms are also to be kept
separate from banking, trust and insurance businesses, it added.
	   The report said legislators had drawn lessons from the financial
turmoil afflicting other Asian markets in formulating the law.
	   At least five earlier draft versions of the law had been debated
and rejected during the past six years, mainly due to disagreements
between the various bureaucracies responsible for enforcing market
regulations.
	   The regional crisis may have finally pushed the legislature into
approving the law, which codifies and unifies a hodgepodge of
regulations already in force.
	   The new law is expected to help prevent the frequent trading
irregularities and bouts of volatility that have troubled the stock
exchanges and other financial markets since their inception in the
early 1990s.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks higher in morning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Tuesday
morning amid the annual year-end trading lull. Japanese stock
prices were mixed.
	   The dollar bought 115.28 yen at midday, down 0.64 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 115.90
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 16.71
points, or 0.01 percent, to 13,692.35 to close the morning session.
On Monday, the average finished down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar dipped as traders took profits
after the U.S. currency was boosted earlier in the session by
commercial demand, traders said.
	   At one point in New York on Monday, the dollar gained some
ground following news that tensions between the United States and
Iraq had heated up again.
	   U.S. warplanes fired missiles Monday at an Iraqi air defense
site in the northern part of the country. The attack came two days
after Baghdad announced it would fire at Western aircraft
patrolling the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. pilots
opened fire in self-defense.
	   On the stock market, share prices were mixed in thin trading as
many participants have taken off for the New Year holidays.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.76 points
to 9,226.75 at Monday's close.
	   Bearish factors such as the unwinding of cross-shareholdings and
higher interest rates for housing loans were dampening market
sentiment, investors said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 0.73 points, negligible in percentage terms,
to 1,080.62. The TOPIX closed down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent,
the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.845 percent from Monday's close at 1.685 percent,
driving its price down to 99.87 yen from 100.93 yen.

Internet drugs _ no doctor visit needed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-US-Internet Drugs-Glance &QL;

 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With a few computer keystrokes _ and without
ever seeing a doctor _ Americans can buy powerful prescription
drugs that include some not approved for sale in this country.
	   Supporters say consumers are savvy enough to buy medicines over
the Internet. But health experts fear the growing trend could
endanger, even kill, patients. Several states are investigating Web
sites, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has raided at least
one Internet doctor as the government struggles with how to control
drugs in cyberspace both here and abroad.
	   ``Consumers are taking a huge risk. ... They may be risking
their lives,'' warns William Hubbard of the Food and Drug
Administration. ``We're very concerned about this.''
	   Yet some state regulators say they've never heard of the myriad
Web sites that post such ads as: ``Need Viagra? No prescription? No
problem!''
	   How easy are such purchases? An Associated Press reporter bought
from a British Web site a controversial diet drug that the U.S.
government has not yet decided is safe. The unmarked brown envelope
bearing a month's supply of Xenical cleared U.S. Customs. The
unseen British pharmacist had no way to know the reporter had
exaggerated her weight by 30 pounds (14 kilos) to qualify for the
drug.
	   A Viagra site promised to ship the little blue impotence pill
after an AP reporter answered just one health question _ and
disclosed she was a woman.
	   ``That's very, very dangerous,'' said consumer advocate Dr.
Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen, saying both were drugs for which
the ``patient'' did not medically qualify.
	   ``There is a reason that some of these drugs have to be
prescribed,'' added Larry Lessly, director of Nevada's Board of
Medical Examiners, which recently barred over-the-Internet sales
unless Nevada doctors also see the patients. ``People shouldn't
just willy-nilly take them.''
	   Colorado publicly reprimanded one doctor for selling Viagra over
the Internet; Connecticut, Wyoming and Nevada ordered one Web site
to stop selling in those states, and at least eight other states
are investigating complaints.
	   North Carolina is probing Web sales of a computer program that
teaches patients to diagnose their own problems and then pick a
medication from foreign Web sites.
	   ``Get self-prescribed medications without a doctor's
prescription'' including ``experimental ... or unapproved drugs not
yet available in the U.S.,'' the site promises. Patient
testimonials declare success at buying controlled substances such
as narcotic painkillers.
	   ``It's a do-it-yourself doc-in-a-box,'' complained Dave Work of
North Carolina's Board of Pharmacy.
	   The government determines which drugs need prescriptions _
because they're for serious medical problems and can cause serious
side effects.
	   Yet U.S. Web sites tout: Viagra, highly risky for certain men;
Valtrex, which treats genital herpes but can kill patients with
weak immune systems; Meridia, a diet drug that requires doctor
monitoring because it can raise blood pressure, and the diet drug
phentermine, a controlled substance considered too dangerous for
whole groups.
	   Spotted on foreign sites: stimulants, tranquilizers,
antidepressants, antibiotics and drugs for epilepsy, dementia,
diabetes and hypertension.
	   ____
	   The Internet is making huge inroads in medicine, as doctors
e-mail patients, online pharmacies mail refills and patients turn
to medical journals now available 24 hours a day.
	   But it also has opened a Pandora's box: Almost anyone can set up
shop as an expert.
	   ``'I'm not a doctor, but I'm playing one on the Internet' is
probably our worst nightmare,'' said Mark Herr of New Jersey's
Division of Consumer Affairs.
	   Foreign drug sellers who don't need prescriptions in their own
country can target Americans. And U.S. doctors and pharmacists,
too, are selling to unseen Internet users across the country.
	   It is illegal for doctors to prescribe for patients in a state
where they're not licensed to practice. Licensed doctors also must
meet standards of care that in most states require a patient
relationship to prescribe drugs. But the rules were written before
the Internet, so states aren't sure how to apply them in cyberspace
_ and how to police ever-changing Web sites.
	   ``It is a huge problem. We just don't have the resources to deal
with all of them,'' said Mark Stafford of the Kansas Board of
Healing Arts, which last month sued two Web sites to stop Internet
Viagra sales in Kansas.
	   ____
	   On the other side is veteran pharmacist William Stallknecht, who
runs a popular Web site from his Pill Box Pharmacy in San Antonio,
Texas. He says patients should be free to choose certain drugs
without the hassle or embarrassment of in-person doctor visits.
	   ``Patients have rights,'' said Stallknecht, who sells Viagra,
the anti-baldness pill Propecia and the antihistamine Claritin over
the Internet. ``We take the care necessary'' by requiring online
health questionnaires reviewed by staff doctors.
	   Stallknecht says he ships 30 to 40 Viagra Internet orders a day
and his doctors reject about 10 percent of applicants for health
risks.
	   But critics say online questionnaires can't substitute for a
doctor's exam. Asks consumer advocate Wolfe: How many men refused
Viagra by local doctors turn to the Web? How many women wanting to
lose a quick five pounds exaggerate their weight to buy a diet
drug?
	   ``The question we have is whether ... you can believe what a
patient says in a questionnaire,'' said Steven Davis, Utah's chief
licensing investigator.
	   As for foreign sites, the FDA has warned several to quit selling
here and has complained to other governments. It tries to stop
shipments at the border but is largely unsuccessful, said Hubbard.
A Web site in Holland merely moved after the FDA complained to
Dutch regulators. Plus, the drugs are shipped in unmarked packages.

China's legislature approves first national securities law

into alleged illegal transactions at a major brokerage, grafs

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After years of debate and bureaucratic
infighting, the top committee of China's legislature on Tuesday
approved a national law to police the country's freewheeling
securities markets.
	   The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted
the law on the last day of a six-day session. The law will take
effect July 1, 1999, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   It said the 12-chapter, 214-article law governs all aspects of
the securities industry, from the issue and trading of stocks to
purchases of listed companies, registration and accounts settlement
agencies, government regulatory bodies and penalties for violating
the law.
	   The new law retains a prohibition already in force against
foreign investors buying shares in China's A-share market, which is
open only to domestic investors, Xinhua said. Foreign investors
remain limited to the smaller, less active B-share market.
	   The securities industry will be separated into two tiers, with
brokerages required to separate their own trading accounts from
those of their clients. Securities firms are also to be kept
separate from banking, trust and insurance businesses, it added.
	   The report said legislators had drawn lessons from the financial
turmoil afflicting other Asian markets in formulating the law.
	   At least five earlier draft versions of the law had been debated
and rejected during the past six years, mainly due to disagreements
between the various bureaucracies responsible for enforcing market
regulations.
	   The regional crisis may have finally pushed the legislature into
approving the law, which codifies and unifies a hodgepodge of
regulations that have been loosely enforced.
	   Legislative debate over the securities law led to late revisions
firming regulations prohibiting state-owned companies or listed
companies from trading shares, the newspaper China Securities News
reported Tuesday.
	   Investors who own 30 percent or more of a listed company's
shares will be required to issue a takeover notice to all
shareholders, the paper said.
	   The new law is expected to help prevent the frequent trading
irregularities and bouts of volatility that have troubled the stock
exchanges and other financial markets since their inception in the
early 1990s.
	   In the latest case, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
is investigating alleged illegal transactions by the investment
banking unit of Shenyin Wanguo Securities Co., the country's second
biggest brokerage, company officials told Dow Jones Newswires
Monday.
	   The probe could result in a suspension of Shenyin Wanguo's
underwriting credentials, a lucrative source of income, as well as
a shakeup among the firm's management, they said.

Delphi lays off 15 percent of Singapore plant workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S.-based Delphi Automotive Systems, the
world's largest vehicle components maker, laid off 15 percent of
its plant workers in Singapore, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The plant was temporarily closed Monday, and all 1,500 employees
were called in to hear the details. Termination notices were given
to 229 workers in small groups, said Delphi spokesman John
Anderson.
	   Interviews were set up with 11 other multinational companies and
23 job offers were made to the retrenched employees by early
afternoon.
	   Anderson said employees were told early in December that Delphi,
which is being spun off from General Motors early next year, would
be restructuring in Singapore and retrenchments could be expected.
	   ``We have been working hard to avoid this type of restructuring
since April 1995, redeploying workers instead, and adopting hiring
freezes,'' Anderson said. Short shifts, a weekend shift and a third
shift were introduced ``in an effort to balance things out,'' he
said.
	   There is no union at the plant, but the company dealt with the
National Trade Unions Council, he said. No offer was made to freeze
or reduce pay in order to save jobs, as the government has
suggested to some unions during Singapore's worst economic crisis
in a decade.
	   The plant, previously run by the Delco company, has been
operating in Singapore for 20 years.

American Express to set up brokerage in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. financial services company American Express
Co. plans to establish a securities company in Japan next year, a
company spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The company has applied to the Finance Ministry for permission
to set up the venture under new rules that make it easier to launch
a brokerage in Japan, said company spokemsan Mitsuo Inagaki.
	   American Express hopes to sell investment funds to individual
investors, but the company has not yet decided on its range of
products, Inagaki said.
	   The move comes as many foreign financial institutions launch or
expand operations in Japan to take advantage of the country's ``Big
Bang'' financial deregulation reforms.
	   American Express applied to set up its new company under a rule
change implemented this month that eases the cumbersome approval
process for new brokerages, Inagaki said.
	   Last year, American Express established an investment-advisory
business in Tokyo in its first step toward full-fledged asset
management operations in Japan.

Two U.S. servicemen arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese police have arrested two U.S. Air Force
servicemen stationed near Tokyo on suspicion of attempting to kill
a 39-year-old Japanese by hitting him with a car, a police
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Takeyasu Kasai, spokesman of Tokyo's Fussa Police, identified
the two arrested as Senior Airman Anthony Udy, 25, and Airman
Arthur Tuttle, 21 _ both assigned to Yokota Air Base in western
Tokyo.
	   Hometowns for the two were not immediately known, Kasai said.
	   Police allege both men hit Yasutoshi Ishizuka in the face while
walking on a street near the base early Monday morning. When
Ishizuka called police on a portable phone, a car driven by Udy hit
him from behind, Kasai said.
	   Ishizuka suffered a broken left leg, and his injuries will
require two months of treatment, Kasai said.
	   Police later found the two airmen were drunk at the time and on
their way to the base after drinking, the spokesman said. Police
are investigating what led to the two airmen's alleged initial
attack on Ishizuka.
	   Sgt. Stephen Clutter, spokesman for Yokota Air Base, said the
base will express regret over the incident and cooperate fully with
the Japanese police investigation.
	   There are 47,000 U.S. military service people stationed in Japan
under a mutual security treaty.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks drop in morning session
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS stock percentage movement in 3rd graf from `0.01
percent' to `0.12 percent', reference to Monday's stock closing;
UPDATES overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Tuesday
morning amid the annual year-end trading lull. Japanese stock
prices were mixed.
	   The dollar bought 115.28 yen at midday, down 0.64 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 115.90
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 16.71
points, or 0.12 percent, to 13,692.35 to close the morning session.
On Monday, the average fell 88.89 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar dipped as traders took profits
after the U.S. currency was boosted earlier in the session by
commercial demand, traders said.
	   At one point in New York on Monday, the dollar gained some
ground following news that tensions between the United States and
Iraq had heated up again.
	   U.S. warplanes fired missiles Monday at an Iraqi air defense
site in the northern part of the country. The attack came two days
after Baghdad announced it would fire at Western aircraft
patrolling the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. pilots
opened fire in self-defense.
	   On the stock market, share prices were mixed in thin trading as
many participants have taken off for the New Year holidays.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.76 points
to 9,226.75 at Monday's close.
	   Bearish factors such as the unwinding of cross-shareholdings and
higher interest rates for housing loans were dampening market
sentiment, investors said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 0.73 points, negligible in percentage terms,
to 1,080.62. The TOPIX closed down 3.07 points, or 0.28 percent,
the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.845 percent from Monday's close at 1.685 percent,
driving its price down to 99.87 yen from 100.93 yen.

Mother of Japanese quintuplets goes home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese woman who gave birth to quintuplets last
month has been released from the hospital, but the babies will
remain hospitalized for a few more months, news reports said
Tuesday.
	   The four girls and one boy were delivered by Caesarean section
in Shizuoka Prefecture, 150 kilometers (94 miles) west of Tokyo,
the Tokyo Shimbun and Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspapers said.
	   An official at the Shizuoka Red Cross Hospital said she could
not comment on the reports.
	   The babies _ who each weighed between 700 grams and 800 grams (1
pounds, 12 ounces and 2 pounds) at birth _ were healthy, but
doctors wanted to keep them under constant care for a few more
months, the newspapers reported.
	   The 30-year old mother had been taking fertility drugs and said
she was surprised but ``overjoyed'' to find out she was pregnant
with five babies, Tokyo Shimbun reported.
	   Earlier this month, a woman in the United States gave birth to
octuplets, one of whom died of heart and lung failure. A woman in
China last week gave birth to sextuplets. Two of the babies died.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A frantic rescue operation was scaled
back Tuesday after authorities hauled out the bodies of two sailors
killed in stormy waters during the deadliest Sydney-to-Hobart yacht
race on record.
	   Four bodies have been recovered. British sailor Glyn Charles,
33, was washed off the Sword of Orion yacht Sunday night and
declared drowned on Tuesday, becoming the fifth fatality, said
Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Brian Hill. Race
officials said Charles had represented Britain in the Star Class at
the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he finished 11th.
	   The two bodies found Tuesday were from the 56-year-old cutter
Winston Churchill and one of their colleagues was still missing.
	   Two other sailors were found dead Monday when the 40-foot
(12-meter) boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95
kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula: the yacht's
owner-skipper Bruce Guy and crew member Phil Skeggs.
	   ``We have found two deceased people today and we're still
looking for the missing man, but it's becoming more and more
difficult,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   While 35 civilian and military aircraft and a similar number of
boats set out on searches Tuesday, the force had been scaled back
to eight aircraft by 2:30 p.m. local time (0330GMT).
	   There had been only two reported deaths previously in the
54-year history of Australia's greatest yacht race. The 725-mile
(1,166-kilometer) race starts the day after Christmas and attracts
top class sailors and yachts from around the world.
	   Of the 115 yachts that entered this year, 59 were forced to seek
shelter and several boats were abandoned, race officials said.
There was no list of the approximately 1,000 sailors who set off in
the race.
	   As Australia mounted one of its largest maritime rescue
operations ever, military helicopters hovered over 35-foot
(10.5-meter) swells to hoist about 50 other sailors to safety off
Australia's southeast coast, 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of
Sydney.
	   Many of the sailors were injured _ with broken bones, dislocated
shoulders, cuts on the face and hands _ from being struck by broken
rigging or tossed upside down when their boats capsized.
	   American Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer and founder
of Oracle Corp., won his second race when his maxi yacht Sayonara
arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, Tuesday morning. Oracle is one of the
largest computer technology firms in the world, with dlrs 8 billion
in annual revenue.
	   The 23-member crew arrived at Constitution Dock to a funereal
atmosphere, rather than the usual mood of celebration.
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said of the raging seas which peaked Sunday
and Monday. ``It's been a very emotional experience to get here.
This is not what this is supposed to be about. It's a tough crew,
but the guys were choked up.''
	   Sayonara helmsman Chris Dickson said the crew was thinking more
about the sailors in trouble than the victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big thing
and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said. ``Anyone
who is not scared in those conditions is not human.''
	   The two dead men were winched from a swell of about 3-meters
(9-feet) Tuesday. The first came out just before Sayonara docked in
Hobart and the second just after.
	   Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea, who found the two bodies two
miles (3.2 kilometers) apart and 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore
early Tuesday, said they were both found face down and were picked
out by nets.
	   ``It wasn't so difficult because the seas had abated a bit but
we were just lucky to find the second body,'' Lea told The
Associated Press. ``The chances of the third man being found alive
are slim, but I'd never give up hope.''
	   The three members of the Winston Churchill, Jim Lawler, Mike
Bannister and John Dean, went missing after six of their crew mates
were plucked from two life rafts in the huge 10-meter (30-feet)
seas of Bass Strait.
	   Officials have yet to say which of the men are dead and who is
missing.
	   Sea Hawk helicopter pilot Nic Trimmor, who rescued two survivors
in the second raft, said the three were washed away by a single
wave after hanging on grimly.
	   ``They got hit by numerous big waves, but one wave in particular
threw three of them out and they were unable to recover these three
back into the life raft,'' Trimmor said.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   While two others were picked up from another life raft late
Monday, Winning only found out three of his crew were missing as he
gave a television interview Tuesday.
	   ``I just heard what you said in your intro there, that a couple
of fellows were reported washed off. That's the first I've heard of
that,'' Winning told the reporter.
	   Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the finish line on the
Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to take line honors
ahead of Brindabella.
	   Although its early speed had it on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.
	   The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, was
in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman was washed overboard and
presumed drowned.
	   In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injuries after a gale
snapped his boat's mast.

Reports: Thai court overturns convictions in hotel collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai appeals court has overturned the
convictions of 14 out of 15 people sentenced for negligence in the
1993 collapse of a provincial hotel that killed 147 people, local
papers reported Tuesday.
	   Only Bampen Phanrat-issara, the architect and engineer who
oversaw construction of an extension to the hotel, had his 20-year
sentence upheld by the court, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Relatives of those who were killed, and some of the 227 injured,
said they would petition the Supreme Court to review the lower
court's decision and reinstate the sentences of the 14, who are
hotel executives and government officials, the Post said.
	   The Royal Plaza Hotel in Nakhorn Ratchasima, 210 kilometers (130
miles) northeast of Bangkok, collapsed on Aug. 13, 1993. The
construction of three new stories on top of the original three was
blamed for the disaster.
	   The government officials convicted of negligence and malfeasance
in the case were responsible for approving the construction and
engineering plans submitted by Bampen.
	   Nakhorn Ratchasima was ill-prepared to deal with the disaster,
lacking rescue equipment needed to pull people out of the rubble.
Many remained trapped under debris for days before dying.
	   Identifying those who perished was made problematic because
rescue workers looted wallets and other identification from the
bodies.

Jaguars 21, Steelers 3

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Rookie Jonathan Quinn made huge
strides in his second career start Monday night. Still, the
Jacksonville Jaguars would love to see him return to the bench next
week.
	   Starting for the second straight game in place of the injured
Mark Brunell, Quinn threw for a touchdown and ran for one as the
Jaguars defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-3.
	   With the Steelers (7-9) already eliminated from the playoffs and
the Jaguars (11-5) having secured the AFC Central title, this was
billed as a meaningless game to close the 1998 season.
	   The Jags had other thoughts, knowing a loss would have made them
only the third division winner in NFL history _ joining the 1969
Rams and 1943 Redskins _ to enter the post-season on a three-game
losing streak.
	   ``It was very, very important for us to win tonight,'' said
coach Tom Coughlin. ``We talked all week about the confidence and
momentum that would feed from a win. If you studied the faces of
the teams that won and lost (Sunday), you could see the
difference.''
	   Quinn's 10-for-19, 192-yard performance helped the Jaguars hit
the playoffs on a high note.
	   Next, however, they wait and hope the ankle Brunell sprained
four weeks ago is better by Sunday's playoff game against the New
England Patriots.
	   ``Quinn, he stepped up tonight, he prepared well all week,''
said tailback Fred Taylor. ``Just to come in and win this one
tonight and build a little confidence going into the playoffs, I
think that's great.''
	   The Jaguars kept Pittsburgh out of the end zone, but their
20th-ranked run defense still allowed 139 yards to Jerome Bettis,
who will have surgery Wednesday to clean out his ailing left knee.
	   The knee couldn't prevent Bettis from totaling 104 yards by
halftime and surpassing the century mark for the eighth straight
time on Monday night, extending his own record.
	   Kordell Stewart had another subpar game, finishing 17-for-37 for
174 yards and two interceptions. Unlike the last two games, coach
Bill Cowher let him finish.
	   Still, the Steelers couldn't avoid their first sub-.500 record
since they finished 7-9 in 1991, which was also the last time they
failed to win the AFC Central.
	   The game began under a thick, pea-soup fog that cleared as the
first half progressed. By the time the half was over the Jaguars
had a 14-3 lead.
	   Quinn's first scoring play came after he escaped a collapsing
pocket and spun toward his left into the end zone for a 15-yard run
helped by a great block downfield from receiver Jimmy Smith.
	   On the next drive, Quinn hit Keenan McCardell for a 64-yard
gain, then converted on a 9-yard screen pass to Taylor for a
touchdown.
	   Taylor scored again in the third quarter on a 12-yard run to
finish the season with 17 touchdowns, tied for second in the league
this season with Minnesota Vikings rookie Randy Moss.
	   Pittsburgh was held to fewer than 10 points for the third time
in the last four weeks, and Stewart had his sixth
multi-interception game of the season. The Steelers closed the year
on a five-game losing streak, their longest since 1988.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A frantic rescue operation was scaled
back Tuesday after authorities hauled out the bodies of two sailors
killed in stormy waters during the deadliest Sydney-to-Hobart yacht
race on record.
	   Four bodies have been recovered. British sailor Glyn Charles,
33, was washed off the Sword of Orion yacht Sunday night and
declared drowned on Tuesday, becoming the fifth fatality, said
Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Brian Hill.
	   Race officials said Charles had represented Britain in the Star
Class at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he finished
11th.
	   The two bodies found Tuesday were from the 56-year-old cutter
Winston Churchill and one of their colleagues was still missing.
	   Two other sailors were found dead Monday when the 40-foot
(12-meter) boat Business Post Naiad capsized 60 miles (95
kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula.
	   They were identified as the yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and
crew member Phil Skeggs.
	   ``We have found two deceased people today and we're still
looking for the missing man, but it's becoming more and more
difficult,'' Hill told The Associated Press.
	   While 35 civilian and military aircraft and a similar number of
boats set out on searches Tuesday, the rescue force had been scaled
back to eight aircraft by 2:30 p.m. local time (0330GMT).
	   There had been only two reported deaths previously in the
54-year history of Australia's greatest yacht race. The 725-mile
(1,166-kilometer) event starts the day after Christmas and attracts
top class sailors and yachts from around the world.
	   Of the 115 yachts that entered this year, 59 were forced to seek
shelter and several boats were abandoned, race officials said.
There was no list of the approximately 1,000 sailors who set off in
the race.
	   Australia mounted one of its largest maritime rescue operations
ever. Military helicopters hovered over 35-foot (10.5-meter) swells
to hoist about 50 other sailors to safety off Australia's southeast
coast, 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Sydney.
	   Many of the sailors were injured _ with broken bones, dislocated
shoulders, cuts on the face and hands _ from being struck by broken
rigging or tossed upside down when their boats capsized.
	   American Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer and founder
of technology giant Oracle Corp., won his second race when his maxi
yacht Sayonara arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, Tuesday morning.
	   The 23-member crew arrived at Constitution Dock to a funereal
atmosphere, rather than the usual mood of celebration.
	   ``It was just awful, I've never experienced anything remotely
like this,'' Ellison said of the raging seas which peaked Sunday
and Monday. ``It's been a very emotional experience to get here.
This is not what this is supposed to be about. It's a tough crew,
but the guys were choked up.''
	   Sayonara helmsman Chris Dickson said the crew was thinking more
about the sailors in trouble than the victory.
	   ``Being here first is nice but being here at all is a big thing
and we're thinking about those who are still out there, not
thinking too much about how we've done,'' Dickson said. ``Anyone
who is not scared in those conditions is not human.''
	   On Tuesday, the two dead men were winched from a swell of about
3-meters (9-feet). The first came out just before Sayonara docked
in Hobart and the second just after.
	   Navy helicopter pilot Tanzi Lea, who found the two bodies two
miles (3.2 kilometers) apart and 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore
early Tuesday, said they were both found face down and were picked
out by nets.
	   ``It wasn't so difficult because the seas had abated a bit but
we were just lucky to find the second body,'' Lea told The
Associated Press. ``The chances of the third man being found alive
are slim, but I'd never give up hope.''
	   The three members of the Winston Churchill _ Jim Lawler, Mike
Bannister and John Dean _ went missing after six of their crew
mates were plucked from two life rafts in the huge 10-meter
(30-feet) seas of Bass Strait.
	   Officials have yet to say which of the men are dead and who is
missing.
	   Sea Hawk helicopter pilot Nic Trimmor, who rescued two survivors
in the second raft, said the three were washed away by a single
wave after hanging on grimly.
	   ``They got hit by numerous big waves, but one wave in particular
threw three of them out and they were unable to recover these three
back into the life raft,'' Trimmor said.
	   Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning, who was rescued off
one of the life rafts, told of a frantic struggle to stay alive.
	   ``After we got into the life raft and became separated from the
others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at
night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you,'' Winning said.
	   ``You have got four of us underneath this little canopy and the
next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent
another night out there.''
	   While two others were picked up from another life raft late
Monday, Winning only found out three of his crew were missing as he
gave a television interview Tuesday.
	   ``I just heard what you said in your intro there, that a couple
of fellows were reported washed off. That's the first I've heard of
that,'' Winning told the reporter.
	   Sayonara, the 1995 winner, crossed the finish line on the
Derwent River at Hobart on Tuesday morning to take line honors
ahead of Brindabella.
	   Although its early speed had it on track for Morning Glory's
1996 record, fading winds meant it finished about five hours
outside the mark.
