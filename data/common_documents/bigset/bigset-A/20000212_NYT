BUSH AND McCAIN IN AIR WAR, TO THE DELIGHT OF DEMOCRATS 
(UPDATES with McCain pulling ads in 9th graf) 
 (rk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Dick Harpootlian, the chairman of the South
Carolina Democratic Party, sounded as giddy as a lottery winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an electronic charnel house,'' Harpootlian said gleefully
of the attack ads with which the leading Republican presidential
candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, have been bludgeoning each other on the airwaves here all
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush and McCain have not only taken the gloves off,'' he said,
``they've put the brass knuckles on. I am one happy camper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader is witness to a primary election media
campaign unlike any this state has seen. After observing the
niceties in New Hampshire, Bush and McCain have for a week been
accusing each other on television and radio of hypocrisy,
untrustworthiness and being in the pocket of lobbyists and other
Washington guardians of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   One even compared the other to President Clinton, which most
Republicans would consider the foulest of all possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Harpootlian may be getting more of a kick out of it
than most people. ``In one Bush ad, they refer to McCain as a pawn
of the left-wing labor bosses,'' he said. ``I had such a hysterical
giggling jag I had to pull the car over.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics with a bite is not unknown in South Carolina, the state
that was home to one of the masters of negative campaigning, the
Republican strategist Lee Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say South Carolinians invented hardball politics,
but they're certainly used to them,'' said Blease Graham, a
political scientist at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And even as McCain sought Friday to end the barrages by pulling
all his attack ads in South Carolina, and calling on Bush to do the
same, the two camps continued to trade accusations over who had
done more harm to the political process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both sides had new commercials on the air Thursday that
portrayed each as the victim of the other's viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was
not trustworthy, that's over the line,'' Bush says in his new TV
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The new McCain advertisement, called ``Courage,'' depicts the
senator as a hero taking enemy fire. ``Now they're coming after him
here in South Carolina because John McCain will take the government
away from the special interests and give it back to you,'' the
announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   As the crucial Feb. 19 primary here approaches, the shrillness
of the cycle of attack-and-response has all but drowned everything
else out. The two camps have already poured at least $5 million
into television and radio in the state, the heaviest media blanket
anyone can recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we had budgeted for January and February, we
have exceeded that,'' said Debbie Johnson, sales manager for
political advertising for WIS in Columbia, one of the state's
largest television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, too, has been a conduit for attack. Bush has been running
three attack-style commercials on radio, including the spot that
had Harpootlian cackling, in which the state attorney general,
Charlie Condon, says that ``big labor comes out a big winner'' in
McCain's proposals for revamping campaign finance, because the
proposals ``would give union bosses and the liberal media more
control over elections.''
</P>
<P>
   And right-to-life groups have initiated an assault on McCain. A
spot running frequently on the radio has a man and a woman
discussing the horrors that might befall the U.S. Supreme Court if
former Sen. Warren Rudman, a ``very pro-abortion'' New Hampshire
Republican who serves as McCain's campaign chairman, was to be
named attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want someone like that helping pick Supreme Court
judges,'' the woman says. ``I'm pro-life!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then don't vote for John McCain,'' the man advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't. I'm voting for George Bush,'' the woman replies.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the confrontation may make the race rawer and more
compelling _ ``Lee Atwater had a famous statement; he called it
`taking the bark off,''' Graham said _ but it's beginning to make
Republicans nervous. As in any pitched battle, there is the worry
of collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for Democrats,'' Harpootlian observed, ``is that
when these guys get done with each other, there is not going to be
much left.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is what Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican
Leadership Council, says has him dismayed. The centrist group,
based in Washington, helped head off a bruising television war in
New Hampshire by putting on a series of commercials there warning
Steve Forbes not to engage in the type of negative advertising that
he had done in 1996 against Bob Dole. Dole's campaign never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   It's deja vu in Charleston and Spartanburg and Beaufort. ``We
wish they would both stick to their positive agendas,'' Miller
said. ``We don't want a damaged nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina may have turned nasty for the Republicans, said
Graham, because the candidates suddenly had to differentiate
themselves in a hurry. McCain, for instance, had spent months
meeting voters in more than 100 town hall meetings across New
Hampshire. ``We don't have a tradition of town meetings, and we are
three times the size of New Hampshire,'' Graham said. ``It requires
much more of a reliance on media and impersonal contacts; these
candidates were making up for lost time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood may also be the result of the split in two
intensively competitive factions of South Carolina Republicanism.
Former Gov. Carroll Campbell is backing Bush, while Rep. Lindsay
Graham is a frequent presence in television and radio spots for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outside South Carolina say privately that the media
strategies being employed in the state could come back to haunt the
eventual nominee. In particular, they say, they worry that the
introduction of anti-abortion groups into the fight could, for
instance, force Bush to move too far to the right and risk
alienating middle of the road and independent voters, who are
likely to be decisive in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant, said that the senator
had made his point in answering Bush's attacks. ``You couldn't not
respond,'' he declared, adding that now the campaign would move on.
``The fact is that's run its course, that's done its job,'' he said
of McCain's recent spots.
</P>
<P>
   But even if McCain's call for a truce leads to a lasting peace,
the bad taste left by the commercials may take time to dissipate.
``Since the New Hampshire primary, Bush's campaign has turned
completely negative, with a hatchet job du jour from the governor
and his attack dogs,'' Howard Opinsky, a McCain campaign spokesman
said Friday. And this was after his candidate pledged in New York
to adopt a more positive campaign posture. .
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush, who was said to have been stung by the accusation
that he was like the president in untrustworthiness, were not
sounding particularly conciliatory either. ``That's one of the
oldest tricks in the book,'' Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush,
said of McCain's renunciation of attack ads. ``Just because it is
not up on the air doesn't mean voters have forgotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ends up on television in the next week, Harpootlian
intends to enjoy the show. He is a bit incredulous, in fact, that
he gets to watch the battering from the sidelines. ``Usually,'' he
said, ``they save it for us.''

 HISTORIC $2.1 BILLION BOND TO BENEFIT STATE, LOCAL PARK SYSTEMS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Citing 12 years of widespread neglect,
environmentalists and business groups are asking voters in March to
approve the largest park bond in state history.
</P>
<P>
   At $2.1 billion, Proposition 12 would dramatically increase
financial aid to city and county parks as well as the 268 parks
owned by the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first park bond on the ballot since 1994, when voters
rejected a similar $2 billion proposal. If passed, Proposition 12
would be the first new bond money for parks since the 1988 approval
of more than $770 million.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the cost of paying off the bond is prohibitive and
that the measure is riddled with pork barrel projects sought by
individual legislators.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters say well-maintained parks _ in urban centers or
in the wild _ are critical to the quality of life of present and
future Californians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has grown dramatically in 12 years and we've not
invested in parks and open space and our wildlife corridors are
being hurt by that,'' said Rusty Areias, director of the state
Department of Parks and Recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best economy of our lifetime _ the most sustained
period of growth in the history of this country _ it seems logical
we would want to pass Proposition 12 and repair past
irresponsibility,'' Areias said.
</P>
<P>
   The park bond's money would be spent in four broad areas:
</P>
<P>
   -- State parks _ $545 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- City, county and park districts _ $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Land, watershed and wetlands purchases _ $355 million.
</P>
<P>
   -- Playground safety, urban creeks, zoos, museums, aquariums and
soccer fields _ $427 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the state has consistently underfunded the money
needed to maintain the 1.3 million acres of parks, 1,455 historic
buildings, 3,000 miles of trails and 18,000 campsites it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some 2,600 piers, roads, trails, roofs, campgrounds, picnic
sites, sewer systems and structures dating back to the Civil War
and earlier are rotting, rusting, buckling, leaking, sagging and
crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis has already given the state park system $157
million to restore aging campsites and dilapidated structures.
</P>
<P>
   Money in the bond for state parks is mainly targeted for the
rehabilitation, restoration and improvement of existing parks. But
$50 million can be spent to purchase new state parklands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years we have not been able to take advantage
of acquisitions because of our deferred maintenance,'' Areias said.
``The new money goes a long way for us, but some people say just to
upgrade and repair the parks we have now could cost $1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also $15 million to spruce up Golden Gate Park, but
finding it requires a careful search. Buried in the dense pages of
the bond is this nugget:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sum of ($15 million) to a city for rehabilitation,
restoration or enhancement to a city park that is over 1,000 acres,
that serves an urban area of over 750,000 population in northern
California and that provides recreational, cultural and scientific
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond also contains $15 million to restore the Immigration
Center on Angel Island and another $10 million for the California
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Bay, $2 million is earmarked for the Delta Science
Center in Oakley and another $2 million for the Arroyo del Valle
Children's Day Camp in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   There is also $30 million for the San Francisco Bay Area
Conservancy, which acquires lands next to the bay. Another $25
million is budgeted for the Bay Ridge Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The website supporting Proposition 12 _  &UR; www.parks2000.org  &LR; _
shows how much various cities and counties would be entitled to
under the grant programs created by the bond.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County, for example, could receive nearly $8.9 million
while Berkeley could get $1.4 million and Oakland more than $4.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara County and the city of Santa Clara could each
receive more than $10 million, according to the website.
</P>
<P>
   Vallejo and Vacaville could receive over $1 million while Santa
Rosa and Sonoma County could pocket $1.7 million.

EDITORIAL: NORTHERN IRELAND'S REVERSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES thruout) 
 (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army's delays in spelling out a clear plan
for turning in its vast store of hidden weapons led Britain to take
the regrettable but necessary step yesterday of suspending Northern
Ireland's 10-week-old power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of that promising experiment in local self-government
last December was one of the most significant achievements produced
by the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement. For more than two months,
representatives of the province's main Protestant and Catholic
parties, including the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, worked
side-by-side on a regular and constructive basis.
</P>
<P>
   Though British rule has temporarily resumed, the Good Friday
agreement and its hope for a fair and lasting peace remain alive. A
last-minute pro- posal on weapons from the IRA led Gen. John de
Chastelain, the man in charge of the disarmament process, to speak
optimistically of a ``real prospect'' for eventual agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Ireland and the political parties representing most of
Northern Ireland's Catholics and Protestants have worked tirelessly
to induce the IRA to end the disarmament impasse. Friday night the
IRA finally proposed a process for putting its arms ``beyond use''
to achieve the disarmament provisions of the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That is a welcome advance, but would not have been enough for
David Trimble, who leads Ulster's main Protestant party, to win
endorsement from his party's ruling council Saturday for remaining
in the government. If Trimble and his party had withdrawn, local
rule would have been more seriously and lastingly damaged than it
is likely to be if the current government suspension proves brief.
If the peace effort is to succeed, London and Dublin also need the
continued involvement of Sinn Fein and its leader, Gerry Adams. The
longer the government remains suspended, the more difficult Adams'
position is likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   All of Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups must disarm. Of
these, the IRA is the most important, and has been the most
intransigent. Everyone, the IRA included, now acknowledges that the
arms issue must be resolved. The way to do that is for the IRA to
present a firm timetable for destroying its explosives, hand
grenades, assault rifles and pistols. The time to do so has come.

 STATE BOND WOULD RAIN CASH ON WATER PROJECTS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The largest water bond in state history _ bigger
even than the bond that financed construction of the California
Aqueduct _ awaits voters on the March ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to capitalize on voter optimism stemming from a strong
economy, backers of the initiative are seeking nearly $2 billion
for a smorgasbord of flood control, water conservation and habitat
protection projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like the transportation issue in this state.
There's a lot of unmet water-related needs that will be satisfied
with the proceeds of this bond,'' said Tom Hannigan, director of
the state Department of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposition 13 will move toward more environmental
restoration,'' Hannigan said. ``This will also help create better
facilities for water conservation, so you can save agricultural
water and then use it for urban purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond is roughly $200 million larger than the $1.75 billion
measure barely approved by voters in 1960 to build the State Water
Project, the linchpin of California's water delivery system.
</P>
<P>
   That engineering feat included construction of Lake Oroville on
the Feather River and the 500-mile California Aqueduct to move
water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The new water bond creates nothing of that magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Just over $1 billion of the $1.97 billion contained in
Proposition 13 is devoted to water projects, including $250 million
for improvements in the San Francisco Bay-San Joaquin Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Those include strengthening the levee system, reducing drainage
from abandoned mines and spending $120 million for fish screens to
reduce the number of migratory fish killed each year by water
diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Another $40 million is devoted to creating a salmon migration
barrier to divert fish from the  &LR; South Delta pumping plants.
</P>
<P>
   The bond also earmarks $70 million for projects around the state
to improve water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Another $232 million is slated for flood protection, including
$70 million for levee work.
</P>
<P>
   Flood control projects in Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, Santa Clara
and Sonoma counties will receive part of another $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat restoration and watershed protection account for another
$253 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the watershed protection projects are $2 million for Clear
Lake and $1 million for the Russian River.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents object to the bond based on the cost of paying it back
over 25 years. Interest and principal on the measure over that time
will bring the total to $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The projects would be far cheaper, opponents contend, if the
state paid for them out of annual revenue, which in recent years
has been running surpluses averaging $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The last water bond passed by voters was in 1996. It contained
$995 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of that money has been spent or set aside for
specific projects, still unspent as of June 1999 was $415 million
for Bay-Delta ecosystem preservation and other improvements.

VALENTINE'S SPENDING UP A BUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Once upon a time, a dozen deep-red roses on
sturdy stems was the standard for saying L-O-V-E on Valentine's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it's just a starting point for increasingly more
people, florists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Husbands, wives, boyfriends and girlfriends have been spending
as much as $800 to perk up roses with an array or other flowers,
even miniature trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked. This year they're spending more money than they
ever have before,'' said Marty Lavitt, owner of The Wild Flower, a
florist for the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy a Volkswagen, you can buy a Cadillac. They're
buying Rolls-Royces,'' Lavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen roses, by comparison, sell from $60 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   None of the florists was complaining about the unexpected
windfall of cash-flush shoppers, as business heated up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already started. This year is shaping up pretty good,''
said Kim Liebman, whose family owns West Hills Flower Shoppe.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors from the Los Angeles Flower Market delivered no fewer
than 150 dozen long-stem roses to the West Hills florist Friday.
Liebman said she has more on order if sales of large bouquets
remain brisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely spending more this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Liebman said lovers are getting a great value because this
year's varieties are better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality is good. The attractiveness of the roses is
great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cut roses come primarily from Ecuador, Mexico and Colombia.
California growers, primarily in San Diego, Santa Barbara and
Ventura counties and the Bay Area, make up much of the domestic
production.
</P>
<P>
   Many flowers sold in the Los Angeles area come through the Los
Angeles Flower Market, where some 100 vendors operate. Flowers also
are shipped by air and come through Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Although roses are a traditional gift to express feelings,
lavender is a rare favorite in demand this year because some
domestic growers have closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the places that sell them don't have as many of them.
We got them this morning and we sold out,'' said Richard Rouse,
co-owner of Dee's Flowers in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Smokey Robinson, who lives in nearby Encino, bought a
bunch of the lavender variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always puts in a special order for them,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Red remains the most popular, signifying romantic love.
</P>
<P>
   White is the next favorite, signifying pure, spiritual love.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow often is the third pick, signifying joy and gladness.
</P>
<P>
   Red and white together is another popular choice, signifying
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants roses,'' Lavitt said. ``You can't pay your
rent with them, you can't eat with them. They're symbolic of
people's love and happiness.''

GORE BASKS IN HIGH CALIFORNIA APPROVAL RATING, WHILE BRADLEY
TO  STRUGGLES TO GET BACK INTO THE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Looking for a knockout blow in California, Vice
President Al Gore focused on gay rights, women's issues and the
nation's high-tech economic future as he campaigned in the state
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue what needs to be done to keep prosperity
coming and make sure nobody gets left behind,'' Gore told 150
workers at Covad, a San Jose Internet firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in the South Bay for this weekend's state Democratic
convention in San Jose. He's slated to address the nearly 3,000
delegates Saturday morning, just after a speech by former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spent the day campaigning in Seattle before flying into
San Jose for the convention. He continued to slam Gore for what he
sees as the vice president's half-hearted or belated support for
such issues as abortion rights, gun control and campaign finance
reform, all charges Gore denies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has been hitting Gore hard and plans to continue to
emphasize his differences with the vice president, said Gale
Kaufman, Bradley's California advisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the issue of gun control and many others, there is a real
difference,'' she said. ``We have the strong programs and core
values that it takes to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's speech could provide a very visible stage for
Bradley's ongoing assault on the vice president, but he's likely to
be speaking to a crowd that heavily favors Gore. Bradley, whose
backers don't include many of the Democratic party faithful who
will be attending the convention, plans to stage a rally at a
nearby hotel to put the spotlight on his own supporters.

   With this week's Field Poll showing the vice president leading
Bradley in California by more than a 4-to-1 ratio, Gore looked to
put a lock on the state with his three-day campaign swing. At stop
after stop, he showcased the support he has among the Democratic
leadership and the various interest groups that form a strong base
of the party's backers.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his tour, he was joined by California Gov. Gray
Davis, a long-time friend and supporter who hosted a
television-friendly late-night reception and rally for Gore last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one in the country better qualified to be
president,'' Davis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When the vice president arrived in Los Angeles Thursday, he was
greeted at the airport by about a dozen black ministers,
politicians and community leaders. Later in the day, during a
speech on health care at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, he
specifically thanked leaders of the two giant health-care workers
unions for their support. On Thursday and again last night, he
attended receptions sponsored by women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning in West Hollywood, he received the endorsement of
the 350,000-member Human Rights Campaign, which called him ``the
lesbian and gay community's best friend ever in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, the group's executive director, said Gore is
favored over Bradley because the vice president ``is deeply, deeply
committed to uniting our country'' and has long championed gay
rights issues, ``both in word and deed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a personal endorsement that provided the day's most
dramatic moment for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the West Hollywood stop, Judy Shepard, whose son, Matthew,
was beaten and left to die on a Wyoming fence in an apparent hate
crime, fought back tears to thank the vice president for his and
his family's kindness in the wake of her son's 1998 death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you will use your power wisely to create a safer
world for all people, including our gay sons and daughters,''
Shepard said, her voice cracking. ``It is because of our shared
vision of an America free of descrimination and hate-motivated
violence that I offer my support to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights and opposition to hate crimes is not just an
election-year issue, Gore promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Human Rights Campaign) endorsement is about more than
just votes,'' he said. ``It's about the fundamental ideas of
fairness and nondiscrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wave of endorsements and high-level support for Gore
in California, Bradley's campaign shows no signs of quietly
slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   The contested primary has been good for the party, said Joe
Andrew, chair of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has reminded people what the Democratic Party
stands for,'' he said. ``Both Gore and Bradley were 30 points
behind (Republican frontrunner George W.) Bush last fall. Now they
both are even or ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, the state party chairman, also said he thought the
battle for the nomination was good _ but for his preferred
candidate, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It energized his campaign and candidacy,'' Torres said. ``It
made him focus on the issues that are really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disputes and intra-party bickering, party spokesman
Bob Mulholland suggested Friday that Democrats at the convention
focus on the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president of the United States will be speaking to us
tomorrow,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's new, racially inclusive census might have seemed
tailor made for Michael Gelobter.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a white Jewish father and an African-Bermudan mother,
Gelobter lives in Harlem with his wife, Sharron Williams, a black
woman whose Caribbean background melds African and Indian
influences. Creating their own cultural road map as they go, the
couple embrace the range of their heritages and those of friends,
marking Passover, for example, with an African-American Latino
seder.
</P>
<P>
   But when the census invites Gelobter, for the first time, to
name all the races that describe him, he will do what he has always
done and claim just one: black. Checking more than one race, he
contends, would undermine the influence of blacks by reducing their
number as a distinct group and so most likely diluting public
policies addressing their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The census forms that will be mailed to most Americans in April
_ the count began last month in Alaska, where the winter chill
tends to keep people at home and easier to tally _ offers a nod to
the nation's increasing diversity. No longer will the Census Bureau
instruct respondents to ``select one'' race to describe themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will tell them to mark one or more of 14 boxes
representing six races and subcategories that apply _ white, black,
American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian Indian, other Asian, and
Pacific Islander _ or to check ``some other race.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Gelobter, many people, indeed most, who could claim
more than one race are not expected to do so, demographers and
census officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, demographers say, is habit: Americans are
simply unaccustomed to the option. More profoundly, however, the
change is fueling a weighty debate about the meaning of race, in
which interpretations of history, politics and experience
frequently overshadow the simpler matter of parentage.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after Loving vs. Virginia struck down the last laws
barring interracial marriage, the new change in the census and the
ensuing controversy have become a barometer of the complexity of
American attitudes toward race, and their contradictions. With the
six racial categories offering 63 possible combinations of racial
identity, which government demographers will tabulate as distinct
groups, the census could provide a remarkably meticulous racial
profile of American society.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the debate stand those who see the revision as a
tactic to divide blacks at a time when affirmative action and other
remedies to discrimination are under attack. Opposing them are
multiracial Americans who resent having to identify with just one
part of their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his perception that the change could diminish blacks'
influence, Gelobter, a 38-year-old professor of environmental
policy at Rutgers University, said that claiming a multiracial
identity would link him to a bitter, freighted history of privilege
for blacks who could cite some white lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Frederick Douglass have checked white and black?''
Gelobter said. ``Should W.E.B. Du Bois have checked white and
black? He practically looked white.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisions people make, while personal, will echo through
public policy. The Justice Department uses racial data from the
census to analyze voting patterns and evaluate redistricting
proposals under the Voting Rights Act. The department's special
investigations division uses such data to look into accusations of
racial profiling by law-enforcement officers. And city and state
planners study the information to direct help to needy communities
and predict population trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to come up with an area of our work where we
wouldn't have, at one point or another, a need to have census
information broken down by race,'' said Anita Hodgekiss, deputy
assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has not determined how it will classify
people who check more than one race, Hodgekiss said. The racial
data the census provides is so crucial to developing civil rights
policy and directing government aid that some groups like the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are
urging people of both black and white parentage to identify
themselves as only black. The Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund has made a similar request of people who are part
white and part Asian.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the change remains hazy, however, since it is not
known how many people will claim more than one race. In census
dress rehearsals in a variety of places around the country in 1998,
only 2 percent of those surveyed checked more than one race, said
Jorge del Pinal, a spokesman for the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Demographers are bracing for an avalanche of data, and others
predict a raft of court cases challenging redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help us,'' said Joseph Salvo, director of the New York
City Planning Department's population division, who sits on a
national committee advising the Census Bureau about the coming
count. ``This is being worked out as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of people checking multiple races are
expected to be in metropolitan areas like New York with large
immigrant populations, but Salvo said there was no way to predict
that number. In Sacramento, the only city in the dress rehearsal,
5.4 percent of people answering the survey claimed more than one
race.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ann Rockquemore, a sociologist at Pepperdine University,
polled 250 college students who had one black parent and one white,
and found that those reared in middle-class or affluent white
neighborhoods tended to identify as biracial, while those who had
grown up in black communities generally considered themselves
black.
</P>
<P>
   How will nonblacks of mixed race answer the census? There is
little more than anecdotal evidence. But some experts note that
checking options like Asian and white or American Indian and
Pacific islander does not carry the same historical baggage that
mixed-race blacks confront in deciding whether to say they are
part-white.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wasmuth, a white man whose wife is Filipino, said the last
time he filled out the census form, in 1990, he ignore the rules
and checked white and Asian boxes to describe his daughters. This
year he will do the same. ``People are beginning to say, `I'm a
mixture, and I don't have to choose one or the other,''' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Wade, 34, an industrial electronics technician from
Brooklyn, wishes he could avoid descriptions altogether. His father
is half-black and half-white, and his mother is East Indian and
white.
</P>
<P>
   When applications ask his race, and none of the boxes fit, Wade
said, ``the first thing I feel is excluded. Then sometimes I feel
that I should not be in a position where I have to state my race.''
He said that in this year's census he would check all the boxes
that described his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do as a country is get rid of these stupid
boxes altogether,'' said Charles Byrd, who runs a Web site, Inter
Racial Voice.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1990 census, about 10 million Americans seemed to agree.
They did not identify themselves as members of any race, said Margo
J. Anderson, author of ``The American Census: A Social History''
(Yale University Press, 1988). A quarter-million ignored the
government's instructions and identified themselves as belonging to
more than one race in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first head count in 1790, Anderson said, the census
has played an important, if subtle, role in reflecting
preoccupations and shaping social thought. Over the last century,
the government devised questions to reveal the country's ethnic
makeup. In the 1910 census, the government asked people their
mother tongue, looking for Yiddish as then answer in order to tally
the number of Jewish immigrants. ``The changes in questions always
come about because of the social issues of the day,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Graham, head of Project Race, a civic group that like Byrd
unsuccessfully pushed for a separate ``multiracial'' box for the
census, said she wanted a category that would accurately define her
children. ``Think of when you open a newspaper and see pie
charts,'' said Graham, who lives in Tallahassee, Fla. ``We wanted a
slice of the pie that says multiracial.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is white, is married to a black man. When she
testified before Congress, she brought along 14 pages detailing
crimes against interracial families. Without a single statistical
category for interracial people, she argued, those crimes remain
obscured in the thicket of hate crimes generally. Graham said she
did not want to hide her children's black heritage, but to nurture
their entire identity. ``Nobody can tell me my children are more
black than white,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the change describe it as a passport to
denial, and a reflection of prejudice. ``The only reason it isn't
fair to make them choose one race is because of what it means to be
black in America,'' said Wendy Thorpe-Cruz, who is black and
teaches multiculturalism in a high school equivalency program in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe-Cruz, 43, said she feels the sting of racism every day:
white women who clutch their purses when she passes and white men
she dated who dared not introduce her to their parents. ``In order
to understand why people are asking for the biracial category,
every white person would have to be black for a year,'' Thorpe-Cruz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Karp, the founder and director of an ``intellectual salon''
for blacks and Jews at Yale University called the Chai Society,
acknowledged a gap between his ideal, ``a world in which there are
no boxes,'' and his decision to identify himself as exclusively
black on the census. Karp, whose father is white and Jewish and
whose mother is black, said, ``It's a contradiction we're forced to
live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Karp noted that in America, the black label tended to
incorporate other races, including white and American Indian, while
white meant the absence of other races. Socially, he said, ``black
Americans get identified with their poorest members. Success is
seen as the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up and leaned forward. ``I am also the black
experience,'' he said.

 CHARLES SCHULZ' HOMETOWN PLANS A PEANUTS MONUMENT  &HT;     By STEVE RUBENSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Charlie Brown and Snoopy, who bid a final
farewell Sunday, have got plans. They will spend the summer posing
for their very own bronze statue.
</P>
<P>
   It's the least we can do, said just about everyone in Santa
Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   The beloved Peanuts comic strip, drawn by the even more beloved
Charles Schulz, makes its last Sunday appearance with another sweet
farewell letter typed by Snoopy on his manual typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up is hard to do and saying goodbye to Peanuts is
harder. Last month, Snoopy said goodbye to readers of the daily
strip. This time, Snoopy is saying goodbye in the glory of full
Sunday color.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Santa Rosa has tried to figure out how to say thank
you to Schulz, the 77-year-old barber's son who lives in the hills
west of town and who has drawn every word and picture in every
Peanuts strip for 49 years until failing health forced him to cap
the ink bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Should there be a street named in Schulz's honor? Discreet
inquiries were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``No street,'' said Mayor Janet Condron. ``He didn't want a
street. He's such a private person.''
</P>
<P>
   What about a statue of Schulz in front of the courthouse or City
Hall?
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want that, either,'' the mayor said. ``We asked. He
doesn't want a lot of recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls were commissioned. Surveys were taken. Citizens clipped
coupons and mailed them in. The ideas with the most support were
some sort of fountain or a kids' playground full of climbing
equipment in the shape of Peanuts characters.
</P>
<P>
   But Schulz himself said the idea that appealed to him was a
metal sculpture _ not of himself, but of his alter ego, Charlie
Brown, and of Snoopy, the most famous beagle in history.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the City Council votes to cough up $150,000, which
almost everyone in town figures to be a slam dunk, the two
likenesses will be cast in bronze by sculptor Stan Pawlowski, a
longtime pal of the cartoonist, and installed this fall in Railroad
Park by the rusty old tracks _ a bit off the beaten track and out
of the limelight, just the sort of quiet spot that Schulz might
find comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Schulz said a series of small strokes that ensued
after abdominal surgery for colon cancer in November left him
unable to draw and impaired his vision and speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, one day, it's taken. It's gone. I can't do
it,'' he told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter to Santa Rosa, which adores its most
favorite son, even if times and tastes have eclipsed Snoopy and
Company just a bit. In the Santa Rosa Plaza shopping center, there
was only one store with Peanuts memorabilia for sale _ and it was a
nostalgia store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the Peanuts items would be flying out of here, but
it hasn't really happened yet,'' said April Wise from behind the
counter at Nostalgic Classics.
</P>
<P>
   The big display at the entrance was not Peanuts but Pokemon.
Wise was apologetic, but business is business.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Santa Rosa, even people who did not look like
they were Peanuts readers turned out to be Peanuts readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Peanuts a lot,'' said Andrew Rossini, dressed in
raggedy, jaggedy leather garments and wearing his cat, Vivian, on
his shoulder. ``There aren't any grown-ups in the strips, and
that's one of the best things about it.''
</P>
<P>
   His pal Harmony Green, who wore spiky purple hair, said she
always liked Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll like it if they build a statue and I'll like it if they
don't build a statue,'' she said. ``What does a statue have to do
with it?''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the only display in town honoring the Peanuts gang
is a small glass display case inside the convention and visitors
bureau. There is a Snoopy piggy bank and a Snoopy hockey puck and a
few stuffed Peanuts characters, and that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical tributes are not really Mr. Schulz's style,'' said
Laura Whiting, the director of the bureau, who has been working on
the statue project.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the statue really should have Schulz in it, standing
next to Charlie Brown, like the statue in the middle of Disneyland
that has a giant bronze Walt Disney holding hands with Mickey
Mouse. That idea was suggested to Schulz and shot down quicker than
a biplane in the sights of the Red Baron.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the only thing Schulz would ever let the city do for
him, said Mayor Condron, was to install a few speed bumps on the
street leading to his famous ice rink. Those were approved faster
than just about any speed bumps in history.
</P>
<P>
   The ice rink, built by Schulz in 1969 and commonly regarded as
the benchmark against which other ice rinks are held, sits on the
northwest edge of town, next door to Snoopy's Gift Shop, which
stocks every Peanuts item on the market and, strangely enough, not
a single Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   On display, along with $30 pewter Peanuts toothbrush holders and
$15 silk Peanuts boxer shorts and $390 solid gold Charlie Brown
charms, is a 10-foot-high get-well card, addressed to Schulz and
crammed full of the signatures of practically every soul capable of
holding a pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You made my childhood a little sweeter,'' said one scribbled
tribute, wedged between drawings of giant hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by, gazing at the card, said if any get-well card can
make its recipient get well, they hoped this one does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they ought to forget about the statue and just erect the
card in the middle of the park,'' said one woman. ``It says how
everyone feels around here.''

JET STREAM'S DIP EXPECTED TO BRING SERIES OF STORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Packing up to two inches of rain, a powerful
eastern Pacific storm will soak the Los Angeles region today,
followed by another downpour late Sunday that could last into the
Monday morning commute, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's soaking will signal that the rainy season finally has
arrived in Los Angeles, despite La Nina. Forecasters said the jet
stream has moved far enough south to deliver a series of storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it will stay on the wet side for the next two
weeks or so,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist Gary
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   While gardeners reveled in the belated wetness, golfers might be
in for a disappointment: Today's rounds at the Los Angeles Women's
Championship in Simi Valley and the Buick Invitational in La Jolla
could be postponed if it rains too hard.
</P>
<P>
   For hillside dwellers, a flash flood watch was issued for
Glendale and Ojai, where wildfires denuded hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles city firefighters braced for flooding, passing out
sandbags to residents and preparing to deploy swift-water rescue
teams at stations around the city today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything indicates that this will be the most significant
storm we've had this season,'' said NWS meteorologist Dennis
Tussey.
</P>
<P>
   Today's storm is expected to bring one to two inches of rain
along the coast and in valleys, and up to four inches in the
foothills and mountains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the storm was expected to arrive before daybreak
today, giving way to steady rain in the morning and scattered
showers throughout the day, Tussey said.
</P>
<P>
   After a reprieve tonight and into Sunday, a second, smaller
storm is expected to arrive with one-quarter to one-half inch of
rain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those on-and-off-again showers, now forecast at 30 percent
probability, could last into Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However much rain falls, it is sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   The season-to-date total, as measured at the University of
Southern California, was just 2.24 inches, compared with 9.05 in a
normal year, Tussey said.
</P>
<P>
   With the heavy cloud cover this weekend, temperatures will vary
little from overnight lows in the low 50s to highs in the mid- to
upper 50s.
</P>
<P>
   In the local mountains, the snow level should drop to about
5,000 feet, giving the mountains and ski resorts from six to 10
inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would help us so much,'' said Samantha Teofilo,
promotions manager for Big Bear Mountain Resort, where the 18-inch
to 36-inch snow base has mostly been machine-made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will paint the picture of winter: snow in the trees, on the
homes, smoke coming from the chimneys,'' Teofilo said, noting that
conditions have been cold enough but too humid for the past two
weeks to make snow.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bear Mountain and other resorts expect a big weekend turnout
of skiers, even with the prospect of heavy snow today.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles Basin, the strong rains are expected to keep
public works crews busy handling flooding on streets and hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking closely at hillsides, any clogged catch
basins that might be reported and any known flood zones,'' said
Tonya Durrell, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of
Public Works.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters are preparing by offering residents free sandbags
at any city fire station.
</P>
<P>
   Free sand, enough to fill up to 25 sandbags, will be available
to individuals at nine city Bureau of Street Services yards today,
between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One group particularly looking forward to the rain is green
thumbs, from backyard tomato growers to professional landscapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty it means we can now turn the water off and let
the rain take over,'' said Ben Weissbach, owner of Green Diamond
Landscaping, which primarily serves homeowners associations. ``For
property owners it lets them cut down on their water bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep-rooted vegetation like trees will benefit greatly from the
rain, given the drought-like conditions that have persisted in this
second consecutive La Nina year of less-than-expected rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now gone two years with a minimal amount of water,''
Weissbach said. ``Just a fraction of an inch here, a fraction
there. When the rain comes, it will be great.''

 CHURCH WON'T PUNISH MINISTERS AT LESBIANS' `HOLY UNION'  &HT;     By JASON B. JOHNSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Sixty-eight Methodist clergy members who took part
in the wedding of a lesbian couple in Fairfield last year will not
be tried for participating in the ceremony, Methodist officials
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While not explicitly endorsing the ``holy union'' ceremony
between Jeanne Barnett and Ellie Charlton, church leaders
determined that the act did not merit punishment. Pastors could
have been dismissed from the church had they been tried and
convicted in a church tribunal for defying their denomination's ban
on such ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by an investigative committee of the
California-Nevada Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church
is likely to send shock waves throughout other religious
communities dealing with the rise of gay power in their
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference at the conference's headquarters,
Bishop Melvin Talbert read the verdict and said the strength of the
Methodist faith is in its diversity and willingness to accept
differing viewpoints while maintaining strong beliefs in Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of a conservative faction within the conference
blasted the ruling and said his group will seek permission to break
away from the conference for its acceptance of ``sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Greg Smith, the pastor of Sacramento's Hope United
Methodist Church, said many congregations will never accept
same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a day that could lead to division, even a breaking up of
our discipline,'' said Smith. ``It's a very sad day for the
California-Nevada conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his group will seek to form a separate conference
within the Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   The decision brought smiles to the faces of Charlton, 64, and
Barnett, 69, and the clergy members who performed their ceremony.
At a separate press conference, they thanked the committee and
Talbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely pleased,'' Barnett added with a smile and a
pat of Charlton's hand. ``The commission worked very hard to cover
both sides and to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the clergy who participated in the ceremony said they
would be open to performing similar weddings in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to go against what would seem logical,'' said
Carol Carter of the Wesley Methodist Church of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just so proud. We think this is a great time for us
today,'' said Pastor Hubert Ivery of the El Cerrito Methodist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be a United Methodist today. Today, you're seeing
the church at its best,'' said Alan Jones, director of the San
Francisco United Methodist Mission.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy also used the event as an opportunity to speak out
against Proposition 22. The measure on the March 7 ballot seeks to
ban same-sex unions by declaring that only a union between a man
and a woman can be recognized as a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy members said they would have continued to defy their
church's ban on same sex unions and possibly would have performed
more ceremonies even if the committee had voted to put them on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the church's ruling, Talbert said they had to
weigh the rules in the church's Book of Discipline vs. their wider
duty to the faithful and the mission of the church.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of METHODIS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  He said the issue caused divisiveness, and ``we confess that our
differences of opinion have resulted in divisions among us. Each
person is of value in the eyes of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbert said that no further action would be pursued. He said
the dispute over same-sex marriage must now be taken up by the
national Methodist leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not resolve the issue,'' Talbert said, adding that
he hoped that the controversy would not break up the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has 93,000 members in California and Nevada.
Talbert said clergy and members of about 21 churches have met to
voice their opposition to the ceremony and they wish to leave the
organization. There are more than 380 congregations in the
California-Nevada region.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our denomination there is room for diversity,'' said
Talbert. ``There is room for a difference of opinion.''

 METHODIST CLERGY AT LESBIAN `WEDDING' WON'T BE PUNISHED  &HT;     By JASON B. JOHNSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ In a move that is likely to reverberate through
other religious communities, Methodist officials said Friday they
will not hold church trials for 68 pastors who participated in a
same-sex wedding ceremony in Fairfield last year.
</P>
<P>
   While not explicitly endorsing the ``holy union'' ceremony
between Jeanne Barnett and Ellie Charlton, church leaders
determined that the act did not merit punishment. Pastors could
have been dismissed from the church had they been tried and
convicted in a church tribunal for defying their denomination's ban
on such ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by an investigative committee of the
California-Nevada Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church,
one of the nation's largest Christian denominations, will be
watched closely by other religious communities struggling to
resolve the issues of same-sex marriage and the ordination of gay
clergy.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference at the conference's headquarters,
Bishop Melvin Talbert read the verdict and said the strength of the
Methodist faith is in its diversity and willingness to accept
differing viewpoints while maintaining strong beliefs in Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that the decision did nothing to end the
controversy that has rocked the church for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of a conservative faction within the conference
blasted the ruling and said his group will seek permission to break
away from the conference for its acceptance of ``sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Greg Smith, the pastor of Sacramento's Hope United

same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a day that could lead to division, even a breaking up of
our discipline,'' said Smith. ``It's a very sad day for the
California-Nevada conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his group will seek to form a separate conference
within the Methodist church, which has 8.5 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The decision brought smiles to the faces of Charlton, 64, and
Barnett, 69, and the clergy members who performed their ceremony.

FBI SAYS INTERNET VANDALS USED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COMPUTER, 
 LEFT SLOPPY CLUES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JAXON VAN DERBEKEN, TODD WALLACK and STACY FINZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The vandals who jammed CNN's Web site this week used a desktop
computer at the University of California at Santa Barbara in a
sloppy attack that left vital clues, FBI officials said Friday.
<P>
   That revelation came as Stanford University and UCLA confirmed
that their computers also were used in the recent attacks against
some of the nation's biggest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cyberspace assaults have exposed the vulnerability of even
the most sophisticated sites and come during a time of explosive
growth in online commerce as consumers turn to the Internet for
everything from automobiles to ZZ Top concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, federal agents scrambled to obtain warrants in
California and Oregon to search computers that may have been used
to overload Yahoo, Amazon.com, eBay, E-Trade, CNN.com, ExciteAtHome
and others, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts theorize the vandals hacked their way into hundreds of
computers and installed software programmed to bombard targeted Web
sites with requests for information _ thus clogging their systems
and denying access to legimate users for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wednesday _ when the San Jose-based online auction house
eBay fought off a second attack and traffic at ExciteAtHome slowed
to a crawl _ the Net has returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation gained speed after it was discovered
that the UC-Santa Barbara computer was used in the CNN.com attack.
Stanford officials also announced that a computer system at an
off-campus research center near Monterey was used against Yahoo on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And officials at UCLA reported that some campus computers were
used in assaults against unspecified sites. University officials
don't know how many computers were used in the attack but said they
are ``confident the hackers are not based on campus.'' They
declined to say when the attacks happened.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Charles Neal, head of the FBI's computer crime
squad in Los Angeles, said the attack on CNN.com through the UCSB
site was ``sloppy'' and left behind several traceable log files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those might point back to (the culprit). We hope to find
that,'' Neal said. `'It's among the better clues we have to
identify him (and) where he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Although those responsible may have left electronic
fingerprints, it remained unclear Friday how many people are
responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are following leads in California and Oregon and would
not identified who is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite new clues, many high-tech experts say finding those
responsible could be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be really impossible to track a hacker, especially if
they know what they're doing,'' said one computer crime specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, authorities were sifting through information from the
UCSB break-in. Hackers often use university or large business
computer systems to carry out cyber-vandalism because it's easier
to hide in their large volume of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sugar, acting director of the Office of Information
Technology at UCSB, said there are indications the computer was
broken into through the Internet by someone off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Schmidt, a network programmer at the university who first
detected the break-in, said a desktop computer in a research lab
was electronically broken into by a hacker sometime before Tuesday
night's attack on CNN.com. He said the intruder entered the
computer at least twice. After gaining entry to the system, the
hacker returned to install software designed to carry out the
attack, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt noticed an abnormality in the university's computer
traffic after checking the system from home at 11:32 p.m. Tuesday.
After further investigation, Schmidt realized what was happening
and contacted CNN the next morning. CNN then notified the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a great effort to hide their presence,'' Schmidt
said of the hackers.
</P>
<P>
   A computer system at Stanford was briefly involved in Monday's
attack on Yahoo, said Stephen Hansen, a campus security officer.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers sent a flurry of questions to Stanford, each
asking for a short response, Hansen said. But the return addresses
were all forged to make it look as if they were coming from Yahoo,
so that's where the Stanford system sent its answers.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the attackers sent the information requests to Stanford's
router, which direct bits of data on computer networks, and asked
it to forward them to every computer, printer and other device
linked to the network, instead of a single computer. Since there
are dozens of devices on the network, each request from the
attacker generated dozens of responses, all of which were sent to
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers also sent similar requests to hundreds of other
college or corporate computer networks linked to the Internet,
creating a tidal wave of traffic that overwhelmed Yahoo for hours
and kept real users from reaching the site. Experts said it is a
type of denial-of-service attack known as Smurfing.
</P>
<P>
   But Hansen said the Stanford research center's computer network
has a relatively slow connection to the Internet, so it could do
only limited damage. And he said administrators cut off the attack
after a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo probably didn't even notice,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen also said he doubts investigators will be able to uncover
any clues leading to the attackers at Stanford because the
addresses were forged. He said it would have been necessary to run
a trace while the attack was in progress in order to catch those
responsible.

 BUSH AND McCAIN BATTLE TO CLAIM THE HIGH GROUND  
 (Updates with McCain pulling ads in 3rd graf.) 
(previously budgeted as BUSH-REFORM)  
 (See also SC-TV-BLITZ)  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Capping a week of ceaseless attacks in the
Republican presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush on Friday recited
a litany of what he said were contradictions between Sen. John
McCain's words and actions, while McCain pledged to end television
advertisements that belittle Bush's character.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning and raising money in New York City, said he
wanted a truce because he was so dismayed by the negative turn the
contest had taken. He challenged Bush to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will run no attack, response or any kind of negative
advertising for the rest of this campaign,'' &UR;  &LR; said McCain who later
pulled his attack ads in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain released two television commercials early this week that
compared Bush's level of honesty to that of President Clinton and
that signaled an increasingly bitter air war.
</P>
<P>
   Bush implied that he would not change his strategy, saying he
had not run any truly negative commercials comparable with
McCain's. He also dismissed McCain's gesture as a political ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old Washington trick, the bait-and-switch trick,''
Bush said. ``He runs an ad for 18 days defining me for something
I'm not, then all of a sudden says, `OK, let's all quit.' I'm going
to make sure people understand exactly what I believe, exactly
where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's charges and countercharges reflected the importance of
the Feb. 19 primary in South Carolina to both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchanges also demonstrated each candidate's desire to
grab hold of the news coverage of the campaign, portray himself as
the person of greater integrity and muffle his opponent's words
with an even stronger, more aggrieved voice.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's vow came as he released a commercial that highlighted
his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and Bush released a
commercial that lambasted McCain's campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is tough,'' Bush says in the advertisement, ``but
when John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was
untrustworthy, that's over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's pledge also came as one new poll suggested that his
unfavorable ratings among South Carolina voters had grown since he
began likening Bush with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past week, the two men have traded accusations,
including insinuations in a Bush commercial that McCain accepted
favors from people who wanted his help in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Kiawah Island on Friday morning, Bush
summarized his case and made cutting mention of a McCain
fund-raiser in Washington on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, he passed the plate amongst the lobbyists and the
special interests that he rails against,'' Bush said. ``I can just
hear him now, `Give 'em hell and pass the hors d'oeuvres.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that several newspapers had reported McCain's
opposition to donations from political action committees, but that
McCain had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of such
contributions. Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain, said that
those newspaper reports had mischaracterized McCain's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man that stood up and said, `I'm the only one who
can stand next to Al Gore on a stage and talk about campaign
funding reform,''' Bush said on Kiawah Island. ``What I'm reminding
people of is that he isn't the only one. I'm better suited to
campaign against Al Gore on campaign funding reform because I
haven't said one thing and done another.''

OU's Najera fosters hoops awareness in Mexico
<TEXT>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ If you sit down and talk to Eduardo Najera, his
accent is barely detectable after spending one year in San Antonio
and almost five years in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   He's pretty much your typical college senior, except taller, of
course, with his muscular 6-8 frame.
</P>
<P>
   What isn't typical about Najera is his reckless abandon as a
basketball player and his boundless determination to make the most
of the opportunity he worked so hard to earn since leaving
Chihuahua, Mexico, when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
   Najera (pronounced Na-ha-ra) is closing out his career with the
Oklahoma Sooners as one of the best power forwards in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been the best years of my life, not only as a
player, but also as a student,'' Najera said of his time at OU. ``I
came here as a boy, but I'll leave here as a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera enters today's important Big 12 game against Oklahoma
State averaging 19.3 points and 9.6 rebounds for an OU team that
likely is headed back to the NCAA Tournament after making it to the
Sweet 16 last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is the clear inspirational leader of the team because every
OU player knows what Najera has overcome to be where he is today.
He also is an inspirational leader to the youth of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Najera is well on his way to becoming the Michael Jordan of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eduardo is a national hero, which is amazing when you
understand how much the country is soccer-driven'' said Roberto
Gonzalez of Basketball Mexicano, a private corporation that
promotes youth basketball in Mexico. ``It's hard for me to describe
just how big he has become, but Eduardo can do for basketball in
Mexico what Fernando Valenzuela did for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a statement would have seemed ludicrous when Najera came to
Texas for his senior year of high school, hoping to earn a
scholarship to play college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about coming,'' Najera said. ``I had a long talk
with my father and told him I wanted to get a good education and be
the best I could be in basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera's father, who works for the Mexican government in the
water department, got financial help from the Mexican Basketball
Federation and Basketball Mexicano to send Najera to Cornerstone
Christian Academy in San Antonio. And guess how much English Najera
spoke when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``None. Not a word,'' he said. ``It was really hard for me to
adjust to everything, especially the language. But I picked it up
quickly. The toughest thing was having the confidence to talk to
people. I thought they might make fun of the way I talked.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera lived with John and Sandra Schieffer in San Antonio, and
they became his second family. Their daughter, Kristen, 11, calls
Najera her ``big brother,'' and Najera said she probably helped him
learn English more than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Schieffers were very good to me,'' Najera said. ``They are
just like my family now. They call me about once a week, and they
try to go to the games we play in Texas. They are the ones who
helped me make all the important decisions. They told me the right
thing to do, and they helped me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the moment Najera stepped on the court for
Cornerstone that he had the ability to play major-college
basketball, but the difficult part would be doing the things he
needed to do to qualify academically.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a college entrance exam is difficult and stressful for
most high school students, so imagine taking it in a language you
had just started to learn.
</P>
<P>
   His ACT score was not high enough to qualify the first time he
took it, but he still enrolled as a part-time student at OU, hoping
he could eventually learn enough English to earn an NCAA qualifying
score. His second and third attempts were too low, and Najera was
ready to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so frustrating,'' Najera said. ``I just didn't
understand what I was reading. I had to study every day, and there
were a few times when I just wanted to quit and forget the whole
thing. But the Schieffers helped me and encouraged me. I kept
trying, and my dream came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on his fourth try, Najera became an academic qualifier.
Duke recruited him, but he didn't want to go that far away from
home. Najera also felt a loyalty to OU coach Kelvin Sampson, who
stood by Najera while he was struggling to pass his entrance test.
Sampson says recruiting Najera was one of the best decisions he
ever made as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed is a special player and a special person,'' Sampson said.
``He is so outgoing and vibrant that he just attracts people. And
there are not many players like him. He's a hoss, and I think he
finally has started to realize he can be a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed is the player in our league who most influences his team's
outcome. I can't say who the best pro prospect is, but when the
(NBA) scouts ask me about Ed, I say, `What do you need? He can do
anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the scouts like is the fact Najera, 23, has gotten
better every year. He averaged seven points per game as a freshman,
10.5 as a sophomore and 15.5 as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   It's also impressive that Najera consistently holds his own with
some of the best power forwards in college basketball. The Big 12
is loaded at that position with players such as Gabe Muoneke of
Texas and Marcus Fizer of Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Najera is a player who is extremely hard to guard because he
can do so many things,'' said Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy. ``He
can shoot from the perimeter, and he can be very physical inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera is one of only five Mexican nationals who play Division I
basketball, but he is not the only one at OU. His roommate is
backup center Victor Avila, who also attended Cornerstone Christian
a year after Najera.
</P>
<P>
   But Najera is the one Mexican player in the spotlight, and he
knows it. TV Azteca, a Mexican television network, covered the
Sooners' home game against Texas on Jan. 31, and four Mexican
newspapers sent reporters to cover Najera's every move.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar to the way Hideo Nomo was covered in Japan during
his first season as a pitcher with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to set a good example so more Mexican players will
get an opportunity to come play in the U.S.,'' Najera said. ``Every
time I step on the court, I think about that. The things I do on
and off the court reflect on Mexico, and I understand that. I use
that as motivation in everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera needs only six more hours to receive his degree in
sociology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get my degree no matter what happens with the
NBA,'' Najera said. ``I know that's important to my parents, and I
know the Schieffers want that for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also important because of the kids in Mexico who look
up to me. I like being a role model. There's nothing wrong with
that. If kids look up to you, you have to show them and tell them
what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Najera said he's the lucky one, but he believes there are other
quality basketball players in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some other players in Mexico that have the talent
and skills to play Division I basketball, but they don't have
enough help to get here,'' Najera said. ``If I do play pro ball, I
want to do something to help those kids. They just need an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing pro ball appears to be a given at this point. Najera
likely will be a first-round NBA draft choice this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always dreamed about the NBA, and I made it one of my
goals,'' Najera said. ``But I knew when I came to Oklahoma I would
have to improve my game a lot every year before that would become a
possibility. I wanted to be sure and make my last year my best
year.''

AIRCRAFT INSPECTIONS REVEAL PROBLEMS IN TAIL PARTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inspections of 1,100 airliners ordered by the
Federal Aviation Administration revealed further problems Friday in
tail parts that are suspected to have had a role in the crash of an
Alaska Airlines plane last week.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines canceled 12 flights Friday so it could complete
additional inspections of the mechanism that moves the horizontal
stabilizer on Boeing MD-80 series jets.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA ordered the airline, a unit of the Alaska Air Group in
Seattle, and other airlines in this country to inspect the
mechanism on MD-80 and similar jets. Metal shavings were found on
the jackscrew of a horizontal stabilizer on an Alaska Airlines
MD-83 that crashed last week and on two other Alaska jets.
</P>
<P>
   Two other airlines said they were looking into problems with the
stabilizers on their airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday night
that it was investigating three additional airplanes, a total of
five, that had reported finding filings or shavings in or around
the horizontal stabilizer jackscrews.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines replaced a jackscrew assembly on one of its
DC-9 aircraft after inspectors found what they thought might have
been an irregularity with the part. Delta Air Lines said it was
removing two of its MD-90 aircraft from service for closer
inspection after ``residue was discovered just below the
tail-mounted horizontal stabilizer'' on the planes, said Peggy
Estes, a Delta spokeswoman.

IRA SUBMITS DISARMAMENT PLAN AFTER NEW GOVERNMENT IS SUSPENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct verb tense in 2nd graf.)  
(mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The government of Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland that held out the tantalizing promise of an end to the
British province's dangerously polarized political life came to a
halt Friday after only ten weeks in operation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a promising late development, the Irish Republican Army
came up with a long-awaited plan for dismantling its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, cited the
conflict over paramilitary arms as the reason for suspending the
power-sharing administration in Belfast and reimposing rule from
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has dogged the process, it has sapped confidence in the
institutions and we really have got to resolve it once and for
all,'' he said of the weapons issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in a last-minute surprise, the head of the independent panel
on disarmament, Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, reported to the
British and Irish governments that IRA contacts had presented him
with a broad outline that he said showed ``the real prospect of
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was far different in tone and content from the
panel's conclusions of two weeks ago that reported no signs of any
IRA cooperation in beginning to disarm and led to Britain's action
shutting down the government.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said Friday night that the
government welcomed the disclosure as a ``development of real
significance'' and that it ``will form the basis of our continuing
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson was acting under legislation enabling Britain to take
back direct rule of Ulster; it was rushed through Parliament during
the week and became law Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The event represented the gravest threat to the unaccustomed
political stability that Ulster has experienced since the signing
of the April 1998 peace settlement, but officials tried to dampen
fears over the consequences for the longer term and to play up the
importance of the IRA offer.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator and the
education minister in the new government, said his party would not
walk away from the pact because it believed it was still ``the only
show in town.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the first minister of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, cautioned people against judging Friday's development a
``terminal crisis. It is not that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the difficulties we might have,'' Trimble said,
``no one should regard that as being the end of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he had taken his decision with reluctance but saw
it as the only way of preserving fragile political structures in
Belfast for future revival. Suspending the government Friday, he
claimed, was the only way to spare it being threatened with total
collapse when Trimble meets with members of his party council in
Belfast on Saturday.

NBA developing into a fun-for-all
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fun is watching Steve Francis, with all of his
rookie innocence and abandon, come down the court making decisions
at roughly the speed of a motorcycle rider with the throttle
wide-open.
</P>
<P>
   Will he go right or left, through his legs or behind his back on
the dribble? Will he slither through the tiniest crack in the
defense for a sneaky layup? Or will he go right over the top and
throw down a slam dunk with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer?
</P>
<P>
   Fun is watching Kobe Bryant, so full of himself and yet so empty
still of any discipline to his game, race across the floor like a
panicky man trying to cross a crowded freeway and get off a shot
that defies description.
</P>
<P>
   Fun is watching Latrell Sprewell beating defenses with his
quickness and instincts as he makes us forget the ugliness of his
past.
</P>
<P>
   Fun is little Allen Iverson darting among the giants and Jason
Kidd staying always ahead of the pack and Jason Williams doing his
21st-century versions of Pistol Pete Maravich's old tricks as he
whips another no-look pass to Chris Webber as they rocket toward
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   One year after the first work stoppage in league history gave
the sport a black eye, it's not only the NBA that's back but the
fun as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a difference to the games this year that is easy
to see. They are faster, quicker, far more entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than two elephants wrestling, the NBA experience this
season has been more like dueling cheetahs.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rule changes and stricter calls by the referees
given credit for why the product has so quickly become more
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is much more basic _ coaching.
</P>
<P>
   The sideline generals who had been choking off the creativity
for too long, are once more letting it breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The rules committee might have done away with the
backing-it-down isolation play in the low post and the officials
might be doing their determined best to get rid of hand-checking.
</P>
<P>
   But still, it is the control freaks in the designer suits who
are making it all possible just by not trying to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich, of course, was nudged along the path of
enlightenment by the early-season losses of Charles Barkley and
Hakeem Olajuwon. So he turned loose the frisky colt in Francis, and
the young herd of the Rockets has followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, as they discovered on their surprising trip to the
NBA Finals, can run to glory. Sacramento sizzles. Phoenix will
phly.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere in the league is the trend toward openness more
openly apparent than in Miami, where iron-fisted Czar Riley has
suddenly become Laid-back Pat again.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bad Boys of Detroit who first played the beat-'em-up
style of ball on their way to back-to-back titles in 1989 and '90.
But it was Riley, who steadily took the game to new depths of
plodding ugliness when he made his jump from the Lakers to New York
and groomed his team with Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley to be
like his moussed hair _ stiff and unbending.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the 1994 Finals between the Rockets and the
Knicks that was almost like watching basketball in slow motion, and
then when fled to Miami, he quickly turned the sheer entertainment
factor of a Heat game to lukewarm, at best.
</P>
<P>
   And sports being the copycat business that it is, so many of the
others followed until the game was virtually in danger of stopping
in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   They called meetings. They changed rules. They handed out edicts
to the men with the whistles. But it was the coaches who had to
change and, to their begrudging credit, it appears they have.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the numbers around the league in the first half of the
season. Scoring is up because shots are up, and final scores like
126-116 and 117-112, which had once been thought to have gone the
way of the buffalo, are back roaming the prairies and the box
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a year ago, in the aborted lockout season, Riley's
Heat broke the 100-point barrier only four times in 55 games,
including playoffs. Now see that the Heat broke 100 in its first
five games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are playing most of the time with the pedal to the
metal and already have hit the century mark 21 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   All, of course, is not perfect. There is too much fighting and
trash-talking, not enough pros capable of hitting the open
15-footer, Dennis Rodman is returning and Larry Bird is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us who do love the game and all it can be, at
least the suits have given us the fun back.

   Another university's computer system was identified Friday as a
conduit in the attacks that blocked several leading Web sites
earlier this week, but network officials and law enforcement
authorities reported no new intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   Network administrators at the University of California at Santa
Barbara said in interviews that they had found evidence that
software had been remotely planted in a campus desktop computer
that may have been used in an attack on Tuesday against CNN.com,
the Web site of the Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Tuesday night we discovered signs of anomalous network
traffic,'' said Kevin Schmidt, a campus network administrator. ``On
Wednesday morning we figured out we had at least some role in the
CNN denial-of-service attack.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a computer security official at Stanford University
said the computer system there had also been used in blocking
access to the Web sites by overwhelming them with data.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
focusing on undisclosed places in California and Oregon as the
source of the attack on its Web site. But FBI officials in
Washington and on the West Coast would not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that it had obtained e-mail
messages sent by engineers at Yahoo, another target this week, to
other Internet companies indicating that the attacks had been
sophisticated and that the attackers had had some knowledge of the
internal workings of the networks.

CLINTON IMPOSES TARIFFS ON STEEL IMPORTS THAT EXCEED QUOTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton imposed punitive tariffs Friday
on steel imports valued at $410 million, answering pleas from steel
makers and labor unions but raising tensions with South Korea,
Brazil, Germany, Japan and other major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   The tariffs apply to wire rod, often used to make hangers and
nails, as well as steel pipe, used to transport water and gas. The
duties, which take effect immediately, will sharply raise the price
of steel imports that exceed a quota pegged at 1998 import levels.
The United States says it was flooded with steel imports in 1998
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decided to impose the tariffs after the International
Trade Commission, an independent U.S. agency that monitors the
effects of trade, was split over whether to recommend the duties.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that the duties were mandated by
U.S. law and were consistent with World Trade Organization rules,
which in some circumstances allow a country to defend domestic
producers against a sudden rise in imports.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will strain relations with several important
trading partners at a sensitive time. The administration has been
trying to jump-start global trade talks after they collapsed in
Seattle late last year. Japan, the European Union and developing
countries have complained that while the United States preaches
fair trade, in practice it often falls back on protectionist
measures when vocal domestic industries cannot compete.
</P>
<P>
   The steel industry and steel unions had pressed the Clinton
administration to take action to protect the domestic steel
industry for two years. The decision had been delayed for months,
leading to speculation that the administration was deeply divided
about what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned about the delay,'' said James English,
an executive at the United Steelworkers of America. ``Our focus is
on helping the steel industry to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   English said the union was pleased with the administration's
remedies on steel pipe imports. But he said he was disappointed
that Clinton had not imposed higher tariffs on wire rod.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few U.S. workers are employed making wire rod and
steel pipes. The administration estimated the numbers at 4,000 and
1,300 respectively. The companies that will benefit from the
tariffs protection are mostly small- and medium-sized producers,
the administration official said. Birmingham Steel Corp.,
Northwestern Steel and Wire Co. and Keystone Consolidated
Industries are among the companies that produce wire rod.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have put pressure on Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore to rein in imports of a wide variety of steel products,
especially from Japan. Gore, who is seeking the Democratic
presidential nomination, has actively courted labor's support. An
administration official denied that the decision was made for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has a right to safeguard its industries and to impose
temporary relief to address serious injury,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The action places a 10 percent duty on wire rod and a 19 percent
surcharge on line pipe, with the duties phased out over three
years. The duties will hit only those imports that exceed the 1998
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is by far the largest producer of steel pipe
exported to the United States, followed by South Africa and Turkey.
Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Germany and Brazil are among the big
exporters of wire rod.
</P>
<P>
   While the duties will effectively raise prices of these goods
for companies in the United States, they will not drastically
affect steel prices overall. The United States imported nearly $14
billion in steel last year. The goods affected by the duties are
valued at one-thirtieth of that number.

CINCINNATI GOES GAGA OVER GRIFFEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Some were hungry. Others desperately needed a
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   All were shivering and chapped, as the wind whipped off the Ohio
River across the barren parking-lot plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Worth it?
</P>
<P>
   What, you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. was back in town.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't matter that the sprawling, all-day line Friday outside
the Cinergy Field ticket office was hundreds deep and barely seemed
to move, nor that Griffey already had been flown back to his
Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing to hit town since chili mac was for sale.
Everyone wanted a piece of Reds baseball at its most majestic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband has said for years if Griffey ever came here, we'd
have to get divorced, because he'd be at the ballpark all the
time,'' said Kate Gearding. ``Well, here I am, buying him tickets,
enabling him.''
</P>
<P>
   She was smiling. Soaring, even. As was every baseball soul in
town. There are no other kinds here.
</P>
<P>
   Sour as was Seattle over the departure of its greatest pro
sports icon, Cincinnati was joyous times 10.
</P>
<P>
   Gearding's husband, Ray, normally a dedicated auditor for Arthur
Andersen who lately has been working steadily past 10 p.m., rushed
home by 5 o'clock Thursday all lathered to watch the wall-to-wall
TV coverage of an epochal moment for the oldest professional
franchise in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   What he experienced was a frenzy that was about one yellow
submarine short of a full Beatle:
</P>
<P>
   -- Hundreds of fans met Griffey at the airport, from where he
was driven to the stadium by Carl Lindner, the tottering
80-year-old team owner, in his Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stadium fireworks were ignited. For the start of Griffey's
indoor news conference. Believed to be a world pyrotechnic first.
</P>
<P>
   -- On one TV station, the popular show ``Friends'' was bumped
off the air. On another station, the same fate befell Ted Koppel's
``Nightline'' for a wrap-up show. Yet another station's newscast
contained a weather segment comparing the baseball season climates
of Seattle and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper devoted an eight-page
special section to Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   -- Radio station WLW began a ``Grif-a-thon'' Wednesday in which
listeners were asked to pledge non-cash goods and services to help
close the gap between the Reds' contract offer and his market
value. Among the offerings: Cars from dealers; a free pony and
riding lessons for his kids; lawn-mowing and snow-shoveling for
life; 150 pounds of sausage; free legal and computer services; a
lifetime supply of fresh-baked biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati wanted Griffey the Younger more resolutely than water
wants its own level.
</P>
<P>
   After spewing what he identified as his own ``explosive,
pandering rhetoric'' that invoked the names Caesar, Patton,
MacArthur and Eisenhower, as well as the creations of the Eiffel
Tower and Golden Gate Bridge, all in a hysterical effort to
analogize about Griffey's return to Cincinnati, WLW air personality
Bill Cunningham calmed down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a thousand years, Cincinnati will shine as the brightest
star,'' he intoned, heavily. ``Griffey has lit a thermonuclear
fuse, fallout from which will cover the town forever and ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Bill. Please. A moment of sober reflection, fergawdsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. I was born and raised in Cincinnati, which is the best
baseball town in America,'' he said. ``We have gone through a
drought for some time where we haven't had the kind of
personalities of which we can be most proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oracle,'' he said, ``has returned to Delphi.''
</P>
<P>
   Argh. Hold it, Bill. Talk to the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody else say something rational, before the entire Ohio
River valley hyperventilates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Griffey is,'' said Gearding, the soon-to-be-divorced ticket
buyer, ``one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Danger averted.
</P>
<P>
   Truth found.
</P>
<P>
   stars
</P>
<P>
   The thing about baseball and Cincinnati, Paul Smith said, is
that it goes long _ the Cincinnati Red Stockings began in 1869 with
a 130-game winning streak _ and deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's 50 degrees and not raining, the kids are out playing
ball,'' he said. ``The 5-year-olds start with T-ball, and it goes
from there. Baseball is such an important part of this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been the assistant baseball coach at Moeller High
School practically since the Big Red Machine was a humble pile of
sprockets. He and Mike Cameron, the head coach (no relation to the
new Mariners outfielder acquired for Griffey) have watched a couple
of generations of ballplayers come through the private Catholic
school with the renowned athletic reputation.
</P>
<P>
   None was more special than Junior. None more revered. Nowhere
was the week's news more celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking through the halls yeterday and saw this group of
usually listless kids,'' he said. ``They were talking about how
great it was that Kenny's coming back. They were actually
high-fiving each other, kids who never cared that they were at
Moeller or anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them said, `Wait till I tell my grandmother I'm going
to the same school that Ken Griffey Jr. went to.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 13 years with the Mariners organization, Griffey
always stayed knotted to his hometown. Besides the obvious
connections of his parents and grandparents, he followed the Reds
closely, as well as his old high school team. He seemed to trust
the relationships he made here more than those he made where he was
known only as a ballplayer, or at least as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The adult part has not been nearly as fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always tickled to see the kid come out in him,'' Smith
said. ``When he was here, you knew he was different than all the
rest, but he always enjoyed being a kid. If he ever loses that ...
''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Griffey, as he is wont to do with friends,
called Smith out of the blue with an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanna play golf?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, plane tickets arrived in the mail _ for
Arizona, where he joined Griffey for spring training and some hacks
in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great time,'' he said. ``He didn't have to do that,
but it was his way of saying thanks for the times he had here.''

</P>
<P>
   Back at the ballpark, there is a second queue. This one is for
season tickets. It is shorter, and more sheltered, under the top
deck of the parking structure.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Stoff, an executive assistant for a downtown
corporation, spent two hours trying to get through on the phone to
order tickets for herself. She gave up, only to get to work to
discover her bosses desperate to get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me there's nothing more important I could do,'' she
said. ``Stay here all day if I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   A guard managed the line, letting one buyer at a time in the
door to a waiting room in the Reds offices. Inside, the room
resembled an airport gate for an overbooked flight, although
everyone was much more agreeable. Men and women, old and young,
suits and overalls, are sprawled over couches and chairs. Some sit
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   All would have been elsewhere, but for Thursday's splendid news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held my 2-year-old daughter to the TV screen and pointed out
Griffey,'' said Julie Hagenmeier of nearby Fairfield. ``She smiled.
I think she understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that sounds silly, but I remember growing up here with
Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Pete Rose and Ken's dad. It was a
wonderful time, and I want my daughter to have that same kind of
experience. With Junior here, I think we will. I see no reason why
we won't be in the championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagenmeier was among those who called WLW's ``Grif-a-thon.'' She
runs a personal-services business that helps busy families with
grocery shopping, pet care, errand running, etc. Even though she
was well aware that Griffey can afford to pay for chores, she
volunteered her staff's services.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way Cincinnati is,'' she said. ``We're known
for looking after our own.''
</P>
<P>
   stars
</P>
<P>
   At this raw moment, it may be asking a lot for the legion of
Griffey fans in the Northwest to step out of their moss-caked
skins. But if it is possible to set aside the rancor of the last
few months, as well as the suspicions and cynicism created by
Griffey's own prevarications and selfish behavior, the return home
of a favored son from a popular family is about as sincere an
expression of joy as one is allowed to have in the increasingly
unhappy world of pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to Cincinnati. He didn't run away to New York or
Los Angeles. Unfortunately for Seattle, neither did he help to make
the Mariners whole.
</P>
<P>
   But he brought a fresh round of exuberance to some who enjoyed
him long before he ever hit the first of his 398 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In a downtown restaurant, Thad, the waiter serving lunch, heard
the visitor telling stories from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people in Seattle are sad,'' he said, ``but I think
they must understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home.''
</P>
<P>
   Has sports become too complicated for an answer that simple?

DALLAS STARS' REIGN OVER LA KINGS ENDS AT 22
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Roman Empire, the Cowboys' reign, singer Ricky
Martin's 15 minutes of fame... Yes, all things eventually come to
an end. Some just last longer than others. The end for the Stars'
unbeaten streak against the Los Angeles Kings came last night in a
3-2 loss that snaps a 22-game string of dominance which began long
before Martin began living La Vida Loca. The Kings' previous
victory against the Stars was April 6, 1995. In the 22 games since,
the Kings did just about everything except beat the Stars. In No.
23, they did just enough to beat them, snapping a four-game Stars
winning streak in the process. Last night's game had that usual
Kings-Stars feel. LA emerged breathing fire, holding a 2-0 lead
through 20 minutes. By the middle of the second period, the lead
was 2-1, and the Stars, as usually happens, looked to have survived
the onslaught and were slowly inching toward a victory. Stars-Kings
games have a tendency to follow form from that point. Something
happens to keep the Kings from winning. Only last night, that
``something'' was the reason they won. LA scored with four-tenths
of a second remaining in the second period. ``That third goal gave
them the break they needed,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``The
difference in the game was their physical players. This is really
typical of how all the games have gone. This time, they were on the
right side of the one-goal game.'' Kings winger Luc Robitaille
scored the goal. and was able to do so easily because Kings
defenseman Rob Blake was laying on top of Stars goalie Ed Belfour
when the pass went across the crease from center Jozef Stumpel to
Robitaille. The play was reviewed, but referees ruled that Blake
had been pushed into Belfour. And while Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk scored at 6:18 of the third period on a pass from Aaron
Gavey, the Robitaille goal did to the Stars what they usually do to
the Kings. ``We ran out of time,'' Gavey said. ``We had battled
back. It's unfortunate they scored a goal with .4 seconds, but we
had an entire period to come back and take it to them.'' Until the
Kings' goal, the second period had been one of the Stars' best in a
while. Gavey's goal at the 5:55 mark was one of their 15 shots that
period. The Stars took the play to the Kings, a polar opposite of
the first period when the Kings did all of the initiating. The
difference was the Kings had two goals to show for it. The Stars'
problems began while they had a two-man advantage for 76 seconds of
the first period but generated only two shots. The Kings had one in
one second out of the penalty box, and they scored on it. The play
began with a turnover at mid-ice. Kings winger Ziggy Palffy then
worked the give-and-go with Stumpel, who ended up with the puck
just shy of the crease. He deked Belfour down and then went high,
giving LA a 1-0 lead at 7:12 of the first period. On the second
goal, Kings defenseman Garry Galley skated right into it. He picked
up a loose puck near the blue line, skated in until he got between
the circles and blasted a shot that snuck in under the crossbar,
stick side. The Kings suddenly led 2-0, less than 15 minutes into
the game. ``We had our chances,'' Stars winger Mike Keane said.
``We were swarming at the end of the second and early in the third.
We battled back. I don't know if it was as lopsided as some people
say.'' If the streak had taught the Kings anything, though, it was
that they could always find a way to lose. Streaks have a way of
making teams think. The Stars said they didn't think about it. The
Kings said they couldn't help thinking about it. It was with this
in mind that Kings coach Andy Murray brought LA comedian Harris
Peete to yesterday's pregame skate. He played the role of Belfour,
complete with jersey. A little chubbier, a lot less agile than the
actual Belfour, the idea was to get them thinking they could beat
Belfour and, in the process, the Stars.

DAVIES SHOOTS EYE-OPENING ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  SIMI VALLEY _ Turns out, Laura Davies couldn't see her way to
an LPGA title last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not clearly, anyway. So on Thursday morning the unconventional
Davies rose early, drove more than an hour to Brea and had laser
surgery to correct her vision.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, she shot 5-under par to take the
opening-day lead of the Los Angeles Women's Championship on Friday
at the Wood Ranch Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   All those fuzzy edges around the cup, ball and club, were
suddenly gone. Dimples on a ball, what a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to just hit the ball and ask the caddie, `Where did
that one go?' '' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Under dark skies that threatened but never did erupt in rain,
Davies shot a 67 to take a one-stroke lead over three others _
Janice Moodie, Laura Philo and Moira Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   A downpour is forecast for today's second round, but tournament
organizers said play will continue in the rain unless the course
simply becomes unplayable.
</P>
<P>
   At least Davies will be able to look up and clearly see drops
falling. For Davies, it's a whole new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends would wave at me from across the green and I wouldn't
wave back,'' she said. ``They thought I was rude. I'd wave and
didn't know who the hell I was waving at.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies is the 36-year-old from England who has 17 career
victories but failed to win an LPGA tournament last year for the
first time in seven years. She came in second in three tournaments.
Of course, that was the Davies who now says she was ``seeing in a
haze.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Davies was playing in Wednesday's pro-am event, she
mentioned to a partner who'd had the surgery and was a member at
Wood Ranch, she also wanted the surgery. He put her in contact with
the club's general manager, David Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Foster had the surgery himself and set up the procedure for
several other club members at the Lazer Eye Center in Brea. A
couple of phone calls later, and Davies _ who loves to gamble _ had
surgery scheduled on the eve of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a chance and it paid off,'' she said. ``They told me
people walk out with 95 percent of their vision. I figured 95
percent was better than the rubbish I was used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies said she had the surgery at 3 p.m. and was back in Simi
Valley and asleep five hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled the patches off when I woke up and I could see
everything I couldn't see before,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've putted and chipped in some time. I can
see the break on the green. Before, it was a bit of a guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies birdied five holes and played the 72-par course without a
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Still wet from Thursday's rain, the fairways played better for
the long-ball hitters like Davies on the windless day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain helped the greens, but the fairways were pretty wet and
we didn't get any roll,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   None of those a stroke back _ Dunn, Moodie or Philo _ have won
an LPGA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Six others are backed up two strokes back _ Sherri Steinhauer,
Brandie Burton, Tina Barrett, Suzanne Strudwick, Mi Hyun Kim and
Jen Hanna. Burton is making a comeback after missing all of last
season following a pair of arthroscopic shoulder surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Highly regarded rookie Grace Park was 3 under after just four
holes but ended up one of six who finished 2 under. Defending
champion Catrin Nilsmark is one of nine who are four strokes back
of Davies.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, who's won eight tournaments in the past two seasons,
is grouped with Nilsmark. Pak would have finished 21 over in the
tour's opening tournament last month in West Palm Beach but failed
to sign her final card and was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Pak complained her game was bothered by new clubs, a
new swing _ and recent lazer surgery. Friday afternoon, TLC Lazer
Eye Centers announced Pak had been signed as a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA spokeswoman Connie Wilson said despite the weather,
organizers hope to complete the tour as scheduled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything we can to get it completed by Sunday,''
Wilson said.

LOS ANGELES: Perez said.  and GREGG GITTRICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By July 1998, the tips were coming from many sources, and Perez
said he had seen the FBI and Internal Affairs Division following
him. It became common knowledge around Rampart CRASH that he was
being investigated and the matter came up routinely in roll call
and was freely discussed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually discussed several different times. We had
discussed it as, `Listen, there's been rumors that Perez is being
followed. And apparently that's a good rumor. He's being
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Perez said, Hoopes sent an officer to roll call
with explicit orders to give a heads up to Perez and other
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The officer came to roll call and said: ``Listen, it's not a
rumor. It is definitely confirmed. Perez is being followed. So
let's be careful out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoopes could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, Perez said, the officers didn't know
exactly why he was being monitored and many assumed it was related
to a bank robbery by LAPD Officer David Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Perez admitted to ``getting a little upset'' about the
investigation into him and said he started talking about it during
roll call on an unspecified day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sgt. Dickerson interrupted me,'' Perez recalled. ``He goes,
`Look. Perez is pretty smart. If Perez is doing something wrong,
Perez is _ I'm assuming Perez is not doing whatever he was doing
wrong before, he isn't doing it now. So, just go there and, you
know, do your jobs. Be careful. You know, keep an eye open for
anybody that you may see following you or any vans and stuff like
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Perez, Hoopes and the other officers never told him
where they were getting the sensitive information about the
investigation or who had requested his files.
</P>
<P>
   Days before he was nabbed, Perez said a sergeant tipped him off
that investigators were asking when he was going to go on vacation.
The sergeant also told Perez that they were asking for his logs, to
get handwriting samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``He relayed to me that if I do go on vacation, be careful where
I go, watch out what I'm doing, because I'm being followed, and
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he had received similar warnings before, but this
time it would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was arrested a few days later, I was supposed to be
going on vacation. And I guess they wanted to arrest me before I
went on vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   While he believed his days as a cop were numbered, Perez said he
never thought to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where am I gonna go?,'' he told investigators. ``I mean, what,
take my family and just run? That's never ... a lot of other things
have come into my mind. But never run. Be a fugitive?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It's what, you know, what am I gonna do? Hide in a hole
for the rest of my life? It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost three years, Perez said, he and others had
participated in illegal shootings and beatings, falsified evidence
and perjured themselves to send innocent people to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he and other cops learned to rely on sergeants to
smooth out crime scenes where guns or drugs had been planted, or
suspects beaten. Hoopes even rewarded such activity, Perez said,
giving him a plaque with a red heart and two bullets on it after he
and a partner, Nino Durden, handcuffed, shot and framed Javier
Ovando in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give plaques out when you get involved in shootings. If the
guy dies, the card is black number two. If he stays alive, it's a
red number two.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by investigators which color was most prestigious,
Perez responded, ``I mean, you know, the black one signified that a
guy died.''
</P>
<P>
   After the July 1996 fatal shooting of an unarmed Juan Manuel
Saldana, Sgt. Edward Ortiz allegedly called a debriefing ``huddle''
among officers, including those Perez said he saw plant a handgun
next to the dying man.
</P>
<P>
   A record of the shooting, in which Perez testified he saw
Officer Doyle Stepp place a handgun near Saldana, is missing from
the CRASH log book. Stepp could not be reached for comment, but the
City Attorney's Office has denied him legal representation in
connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   None of the officers implicated by Perez could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said Ortiz proved his loyalty to his subordinates after an
officer had ``thumped'' a suspect, and Ortiz asked, ``Does anybody
got anything on him?''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was subsequently booked. ``And that's how we knew,''
Perez said, ``Sgt. Ortiz was in the loop.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Corrupt LAPD cop Rafael Perez was warned
repeatedly by fellow officers and supervisors before his arrest
that he was under investigation by federal and police authorities,
according to transcripts of his testimony in the Rampart Division
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to protect Perez, involving at least three Rampart
sergeants, was overt and continuous, starting shortly after he
stole cocaine on March 2, 1998, until his arrest nearly six months
later, according to transcripts of Perez's interviews with Los
Angeles Police Department and District Attorney's Office
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks before his tumble from an elite CRASH officer
to an unmasked dirty cop who shot and framed suspects, the warnings
intensified and officers in the disgraced division curtailed a
great deal of their illegal tactics and thuggery, Perez testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``After March 2, I never, I never did anything after that,''
Perez told investigators last month. ``In fact, if you look at the
CRASH book and the recaps of everything that was going on,
everything went downhill. There was hardly any arrests being
made.''
</P>
<P>
   According to nearly 2,000 pages of transcripts obtained by the
Daily News, Perez said being tipped off to internal investigations
was standard _ indeed, expected _ behavior in a tight-knit
anti-gang unit in which criminal behavior and cover-ups were a part
of ``being in the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to remember now, we're working Rampart CRASH. And that
may not mean a whole lot to some people. But to us, it meant a
whole lot ... The relationship we had, within CRASH, is a little
bit tighter than just working patrol,'' said Perez, who has been
convicted of stealing cocaine from the department. He agreed to
provide information as part of a plea deal, and will be sentenced
Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   A top source close to the police corruption investigation
confirmed Perez's statements. ``A group of sergeants had an idea,
or should have had an idea, what was going on at Rampart CRASH,''
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman David Kalish said he could not comment on any
specific allegations against the Community Resources Against Street
Hoodlums unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of the investigation that is being conducted, if any
of those allegations are proven true, obviously the department will
take immediate, corrective action,'' Kalish said. ``If they are
true, we will be extremely disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Capt. Richard Meraz became the highest ranking
Rampart officer to go before a LAPD administrative disciplinary
committee on the count of failing ``to take appropriate action
after becoming aware of misconduct,'' in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In detailed testimony to investigators, Perez described how
Rampart sergeants helped concoct bogus stories after bad shootings,
condoned the planting of drugs and guns and looked the other way
when officers brutally beat up, or ``thumped,'' suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a CRASH unit, and you're a supervisor in a CRASH
unit, you have to know things are going on,'' Perez said under oath
during a Sept. 22 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Perez identified nine Rampart sergeants he claims either had
participated in illegal activities or allowed them to be covered
up.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Daily News that Perez failed a polygraph _ a
lie-detector test that's inadmissible in court. Nevertheless, LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks has said dozens of investigators in an
independent probe have corroborated enough of his testimony to urge
District Attorney Gil Garcetti to overturn 57 cases. Two officers
have been fired and 17 relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's attorney, Winston Kevin McKesson, said ``the test was
absolutely invalid.'' He declined to comment on specific statements
made by Perez to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first warnings Perez received came shortly after he
had stolen the cocaine from the LAPD Property Division, when an
officer told Perez that his name came up at the start of an
Internal Affairs investigation into the theft, according to the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation progressed, the warnings slowly intensified
until just before he was detained, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, a friend of his, also an LAPD officer, and
another cop approached him in Las Vegas and told him he was being
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `Hey, be careful.'''
</P>
<P>
   About one month later, a sergeant who supervised Perez notified
him that investigators had confidentially requested copies of his
logs for handwriting comparisons. Sgt. George Hoopes offered
similar warnings, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1998, the tips were coming from many sources,

WAVES SET STAGE FOR SHOWDOWN WITH GONZAGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ On the eve of the big test, Pepperdine settled
in for some last-minute studying Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The concern was that the Waves would have to pull an
all-nighter. Instead, they glanced at the textbook for a few
minutes, then slammed it shut and proclaimed themselves ready.
</P>
<P>
   After rolling over study partner Portland 80-60 before 1,611 at
Firestone Fieldhouse, they just might be.
</P>
<P>
   The final is today, of course. That's when Gonzaga strolls onto
campus for a critical West Coast Conference battle.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Bulldogs have a one-game lead over Pepperdine
(18-6, 8-1) with five games remaining. A win for the Waves would
pull them even and clear a path to a share of the WCC
regular-season crown, perhaps even the outright title.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, a berth in the NCAA Tournament becomes a
distinct possibility provided Pepperdine doesn't collapse at the
WCC Tournament in March.
</P>
<P>
   A loss severely hurts the Waves' title hopes and makes it almost
imperative that they win the WCC Tournament to reach the big dance.
The tournament champion gets an automatic bid, everyone else's fate
is property of the NCAA selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other then that, it's just another game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're ready,'' said Tezale Archie, who had 15 points
to lead the Waves. ``We're coming off a big win; now hopefully
we're ready to go and handle Gonzaga.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Prince and Kelvin Gibbs added 13 points each for the
Waves, who shot 50.9 percent from the floor (28 of 59), forced 21
turnovers and blocked seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Dejworek had 16 points for the Pilots (8-14, 2-7), who
shot just 38.3 from the field but stayed somewhat close by shooting
18 of 19 from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   All the Gonzaga implications were on the Waves' minds Friday,
although they did their best to stay focused on the task at hand.
After all, the Gonzaga game was meaningless without a win over the
Pilots first.
</P>
<P>
   On paper it looked like a walkover. Portland was winless in nine
road games, and only hapless Loyola Marymount and St. Mary's are
worse in the WCC. But recent history suggested otherwise. Last
week, Pepperdine struggled at Portland in a 75-68 win. A year ago
the Pilots beat Pepperdine in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't look past Portland at all,''Archie said ``We knew
they were a tough team and that they played us tough up there. We
just concentrated on them tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take the Waves long to put to rest any thoughts of a
major stumble. They jumped out to a 16-2 lead early in the first
half, holding Portland without a field goal for the first 8:38.
</P>
<P>
   There was one minor scare _ Portland closed to within 36-33 late
in the first _ but it turned out to be nothing. The Waves quickly
restored order in the opening minutes of the second, outscoring the
Pilots 10-2 to stretch the lead to 51-35. It was a peaceful cruise
from that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we closed out the first half with a little momentum
and then we brought our energy in the second half,'' Pepperdine
coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``As I tell our team, when we play
with a high energy level, we're a very good basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The comfortable cushion allowed van Breda Kolff to substitute
freely with about 10 minutes left. With Gonzaga playing Loyola
Marymount on Friday, van Breda Kolff was hoping to conserve some
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the attention shifts back to Gonzaga, which came back from a
15-point second-half deficit last week to beat Pepperdine 62-57 in
Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we have some momentum and we're playing the way
we're capable of playing,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``It's going to
be a game against an excellent basketball team who is going to be
ready for us, and we'll be ready for them. That's where you're at
at this point in the season.''

AMONG HACKERS, THE LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD IS OFTEN BLURRY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer industry has a long, respected tradition of hiring
so-called tiger teams of professional hackers who attack a computer
system to determine how secure it is. The idea is that only by
waging a full-scale siege on a system with an authorized break-in
can its true level of vulnerability be determined.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, that hacker tradition has grown to embrace
unauthorized attacks in which programmers find a way to invade or
cripple a system, then publish the details of the vulnerability _
often accompanied by software that exploits the weaknesses they
discover.
</P>
<P>
   While the wisdom and ethics of these practices have long been
debated, the attacks that blocked access to several prominent Web
sites this week have fueled the controversy because the siege was
accomplished in part using a technique and software published last
year on the Internet by a hacker who calls himself Mixter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Mixter's motive, to law enforcement officials and many
security experts his posting of the attack software was akin to
leaving a loaded gun in the middle of a room full of children.
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail exchange Friday, Mixter, like other
self-appointed monitors of computer security, defended his actions
as a sort of wake-up call for complacent network administrators.
Mixter said he considered himself a responsible hacker, and he
tried to distance himself from this week's ``senseless'' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers themselves are deeply divided over which actions are
responsible and which reckless, but there is general agreement that
the line between good guys and bad guys is somewhat blurry,
shifting and permeable.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the terms ``white hats,'' ``black hats'' and even
``gray hats'' are used to label hackers. Each hews to a unique, if
occasionally inscrutable, set of limits.
</P>
<P>
   But this splitting of ethical hairs is quickly losing its charm
for law enforcement officials and security experts alike, and there
is a growing sentiment that enough is enough. Earlier this week,
following the Web-site attacks, the Justice Department announced
that tougher penalties might be necessary to prevent more serious
attacks in the future. And Friday President Clinton called for a
summit meeting on Internet secu- rity to be held next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a hacker ethos, and even the bad guys have
thought there are some things you can do and some things that are
off limits,'' said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is
now a vice president at Global Integrity, a computer-security
consulting firm in Reston, Va. ``I think we've reached a point
where this kind of activity is almost universally decried as being
off limits.''
</P>
<P>
   White-hat hackers grew out of the concept of tiger teams. Since
the 1970s, a number of government laboratories and even some
corporations have deployed special groups of employees who test
computer security by trying to compromise a system or bring it down
in a sort of digital war game.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Palmer, manager of network security and cryptography at
IBM Research, leads a squad of white hats who are paid by companies
to attack their computer systems to test how well they can stand up
to an assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``A white hat does it when asked, under contract, with a
get-out-of-jail-free card,'' said Palmer. ``We'll do the job,
evaluate it, and tell the customer what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Black-hat hackers, on the other hand, adhere to the basic
philosophy that information should be free _ including information
about security weaknesses. For these people, ``breaking into a
system or exposing a system's weaknesses in literal terms, is a
good thing because truth and knowledge should win out in the long
run,'' said Dan Farmer, a network security specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gray-hat hackers, who straddle both worlds,
sometimes acting like malicious hackers, but in pursuit of some
greater good, whether real or imagined. Such is the case with a
group of hackers in Cambridge, Mass., who call themselves L0pht
(pronounced ``loft''). They recently joined forces with (AT)Stake,
a computer security consulting firm in Cambridge with $10 million
in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   When L0pht detected a vulnerability, the group published an
advisory on its Web site. But the description of the security flaw
was usually detailed enough for other, perhaps more malicious,
hackers to use in carrying out an attack. At the same time, the
group published a solution that told network administrators how to
close the hole.
</P>
<P>
   L0pht members have appeared before the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs and have generally received praise.
</P>
<P>
   Mixter, who identifies himself only as a 20-year-old German from
the Hanover area, says he was a gray-hat hacker who recently turned
white hat. In an e-mail interview Friday, he said the conversion
came when he crossed a few ``legal borders'' in 1998 and 1999 and
ran afoul of German law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Mixter, ``I am a white hat, the definition meaning
that I am trying to contribute to improving security by doing what
I do, and completely acting within the law and hacking ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixter defended what he did, saying that his intention in
posting the attack software, known as Tribal Flood Network, was to
alert security sites to vulnerabilities, not to provide vandals
with cyberweapons.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, was that Tribal Flood Network was
adopted as a weapon by vandals before security experts had
succeeded in creating a reliable defense. Even so, Mixter said,
other, similar tools had been available on the Net longer than his.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Rasch, the former federal prosecutor: ``That's
like saying, `I've come up with a better bomb, but I'm not the one
who came up with the idea of bombing people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, even if Mixter had intended that attackers use
what he posted, ``it's wrong, but probably not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer of IBM agreed: ``If he's doing it to educate, I respect
it. But the fact of the matter is, it can be misused, and if he's
not real careful about how he posts it, it can fall into the hands
of people who want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mixter said he was ``not trying to play down the negative
aspects and dangers of this decision,'' he called this week's
attacks ``an inevitable price to pay to be able to develop
countermeasures and fixes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The security sites are making the tools and the source code
public so that everyone has an equal chance of informing himself
about them and coming up with countermeasures,'' he said of public
postings. ``It would be unfair to provide them to just a small
circle of security experts who would possibly only consult some few
elected companies. The only fair way is getting the information out
to everyone, because generally, everyone on the Net can be affected
by security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral ambiguity is most pronounced when hackers offer
commentary about one another. A member of the hacker group Cult of
the Dead Cow who goes by the handle Death Veggie condemned the
week's attacks as ``not hacking'' but ``digital vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take any skill, and it's purely destructive,''
Death Veggie said. ``Once a hacker starts becoming really
destructive, they stop being a hacker and become a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Cult of the Dead Cow produced and distributes a program
called Back Orifice, which enables a hacker to control another
computer from a remote location.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Palmer consorts with such groups but refuses to recruit
from their ranks, even if they claim to have gone straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hire reformed hackers because let's just say I've
never really found one,'' he said. ``It's like hiring an arsonist
to be your fire marshall. They know all about the stuff and they
know how to be good at it, but can you ever really sleep at
night?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Palmer occasionally attends Defcon, an annual
three-day hacker gathering in Las Vegas. Palmer said he often mixes
with hackers of all stripes at the hotel bar between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said that what he does _ inventing ways to defend against
attacks like this week's _ is both ``harder'' than malicious
hacking and ``a huge high.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasch, who was the lead prosecutor in a high-profile computer
crime case in 1989, said he did not entirely agree with his former
bosses at the Justice Department who are calling for stiffer
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a single case that we can point to and say, `If
only the penalties were greater, the person would not have done
this.''' he said.

Prairie View A&AMP;M track team vows to carry on, honor those who died
<TEXT>
<P>
   By NEAL FARMER
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PRAIRIE VIEW _ In good times and bad, one of the constants of
excellence at Prairie View A&AMP;M University has been the track and
field team.
</P>
<P>
   In this worst of times _ the deaths of four members killed
Thursday night in a northeast Texas van accident that injured five
athletes and coach Hoover Wright _ athletes and students gathered
Friday at the college campus about 40 miles northwest of Houston to
mourn and to consider the twists of fate that kept some of them
from making the fatal trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in total shock and denial, really,'' said Anthony
Coe of Austin, a trainer for the Prairie View baseball team who
formerly worked with the track squad. ``Nobody wants to accept it.
They know it happened, but it is just like no one can believe it.
Everybody is still in shock. From what we understand, the ones in
the hospital are doing well. So hopefully we will have them back
home next week some time.''
</P>
<P>
   When word of the accident first came about 11 p.m. Thursday,
students gathered at the school's fountain to console one another.
A memorial service was held Friday morning, and the student
government provided purple and gold ribbons to be worn by students
or posted around campus.
</P>
<P>
   Team member Jacques Hudson said as many as eight team members
had a chance to accompany their teammates on the long drive to Pine
Bluff, Ark., where they were scheduled to compete at an
invitational meet. Some chose not to make the trip or elected to
compete at another meet set for this weekend at the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me just to stay put,'' Hudson said. ``God must
have sent an angel from heaven, because I could have been on that
van. It just goes to show that God has a purpose for me in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinter Andre Edwards was scheduled to make the trip to
Arkansas as well but didn't get the message from Wright in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came home about 1:30 (p.m.), I had a message on my
answering machine that coach said, `You are going to Arkansas at 1
(p.m.),''' he said. ``And I said, `Oh, well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said team members will compete the rest of the year to
honor the memory of their late classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should (continue to run) because they wouldn't want us to
stop,'' Hudson said. ``They would want us to go on and run for
them. We'll dedicate this season to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added javelin thrower Demarco King: ``I think every time I step
onto the track, I'm going to have them in my heart. I'll have them
looking over me and helping win my event. I'll try to just keep
them in my heart and dedicate my season to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Track team member Lewis Turner, whose brother, Jerome Jackson
was killed in the accident, said Jerome ``would want me to keep
moving on, keep continuing what I am doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he hopes another message emerges from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to start putting on their seat belts,'' he said.
``I think if they had their seat belts on, it wouldn't have been as
bad as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie View was a powerhouse in track and field in the late
1940s and early 1950s, then had a revival of sorts in recent years.
The team won the 1998 Southwestern Athletic Conference indoor title
and in 1999 ended a 29-year drought by winning the outdoor
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Jamie O'Neal, who worked with the track team for three
years, said the team members ``would want us to go on. We won the
SWAC last year, and we were on the verge of winning it again this
year. We still can. We've just got to stay strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the survivors of the accident, returning to competition
might take some time. Tirhas Kedane of Dallas said her boyfriend,
Trent Harris, survived the accident but was shaken by what he saw,
particularly the death of teammate Houston Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent is in the hospital (in Marshall) and said he was doing
OK physically,'' Kedane said. ``He told me it's just the fact that
he saw his teammate (Watson) there lying dead. He was one of his
best friends, and Houston had been driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in another world right now. He won't be back here for a
while. He is from Texarkana, and he is going to stay there until he
gets his thoughts together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people supporting him, but at the same time
there are a lot of rumors about the accident going around. I think
he wants everybody just to back off for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Kedane said she had been concerned about Harris making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had told him not to go because he had a test (on Friday),''
Kedane said. ``And I was against him going to the track meet. But
he wanted to compete and there was really nothing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Johnson, a Smiley High School graduate, didn't know any
of the team members but said everyone on the Prairie View A&AMP;M
campus shares in the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the North Forest area, where everybody knew
everybody else, and I get that same feeling at Prairie View,''
Johnson said. ``Something like this really hurts a small campus,
because this campus is one of the few around that is still small.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know any of the track people who died in this
incident, you knew someone who knew them, or you have seen them
around at some point here. It's such a tragedy.''

   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ The Ladies Professional Golf Association
has the right idea. Make the rookies pay their dues.

its rookies to put in 16 hours during the year doing the work of
tournament volunteers and organizers.
</P>
<P>
   That might mean handing out tickets at the will-call window,
setting up gallery ropes, posting numbers on the scoreboard,
fetching buckets of range balls for veteran players or answering
phones in _ cringe _ the press room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd (callers) say, `How'd did this player do?' '' said
Moira Dunn, recalling her 1995 rookie experience, after shooting a
4- under-par 68 in Friday's first round to join Janice Moodie and
Laura Philo in a second-place tie a stroke behind leader Laura
Davies. ``I'd say, `Didn't you call five minutes ago? They haven't
finished the next hole yet!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The program was begun in 1992. It was prompted by no particular
crisis. LPGA players weren't routinely cursing the volunteers or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just a way, as we (the tour) became bigger and
stronger, to make sure they still understood where we came from,''
said Connie Wilson, the LPGA's public-relations manager. ``To try
to make sure they're well-rounded human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody thinks it contributes to the generally friendly
atmosphere you'll find on the LPGA, where players call out ``Good
shot!'' to each other and seem to treat the little people with
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rookie hours,'' as the players call them, might sound a
little like rookie hazing. And there is an element of the old
rookies-carry-the-veterans'-suitcases going on here.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one-year-old Jane Egan was in the locker room, getting
ready for a long day of setting ropes and working the 18th-hole
leaderboard, when a veteran player said, ``Hey, go get me a Dr.
Pepper,'' Egan obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually fell for that,'' she said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever camaraderie the program engenders _ we're assuming Egan
took that Dr. Pepper thing as a joke _ is a bonus. The idea is
simply to teach the young golfers a little appreciation for the
hundreds of volunteers it takes to put on a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these volunteers take the week off to do this,''
Moodie, a 1998 rookie, said with apparent surprise. ``I don't think
!ital!I'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   One tournament spectator Thursday thought the LPGA program
sounds like a sharp idea: Fred Claire, the former Dodgers general
manager who teaches a USC class neatly titled ``Sports, Business
and Media in Today's Society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports needs mentoring, and golf seems to do that, with
players giving and getting help from each other,'' Claire said.
``It's a lot more important than it's ever been, when you look at
the vast amounts of money that players receive at the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire isn't talking about women golfers when he refers to vast
salaries, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sauntering into the rookie program this season is the
most confident, credentialed class of LPGA freshmen since Nancy
Lopez teed off alone. Among the 28 tour rookies _ 12 of whom are
playing at Wood Ranch _ are players like Grace Park, who won five
of 10 events on the 1999 Futures Tour, Jenny Rosales, the 1998 NCAA
champion from USC, and Jen Hanna, tied for fourth after a
first-round 69.
</P>
<P>
   Park likes the idea. ``I'm a rookie. All I know is between the
ropes,'' she said. ``I want to know more about the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   All I know is it sounds like an idea whose time has come. I
picture Lamar Odom answering phones in the press room.

KINGS SHOOT DOWN STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly five years of frustration was resting on
the stick of Jozef Stumpel as he skated in on Dallas' Eddie Belfour
Friday night at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the first period, only a moment in the 23 games
since the Los Angeles Kings had beaten the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   But when Stumpel scored, it became clear this would be the night
the streak would end.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had the Stanley Cup champion Stars beaten the Kings
four times this year, they had never trailed. When Stumpel scored
the first goal in a 3-2 victory. the sellout crowd of 18,118 sensed
the end of some pretty messy history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Jason Blake was born the last time we beat this
team,'' said a smiling Kings coach Andy Murray, referring to his
25-year-old rookie. ``I've been here only one year, but you could
tell by the fans that this game was something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak that began after a 3-2 Kings victory April 6, 1995
was the longest between the two clubs, one more than Dallas'
ancestors, the Minnesota North Stars, laid on the Kings in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings now have four wins in their last five games,
including victories over the elite of the Western Conference
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, Phoenix and now Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille's 26th goal with one second left in the second
period stood as the game-winner. Garry Galley also had a goal in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But the sequence that changed everything belonged to Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had just killed off a two-minute, 5-on-3 disadvantage
with IanLaperriere and Bryan Smolinski in the penalty box. Their
defense stiffened and goalkeeker Jamie Storr stopped a certain goal
on a shot by Blake Sloan from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so big,'' said Robitaille, who now has 543 career
goals, one short of Maurice (The Rocket) Richard for 18th place all
time. ``When we killed those penalties it was a tremendous lift.
But we have been playing hard and playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who lead the Pacific Division, didn't make it easy,
cutting the lead to one goal early in the third period on a goal by
Richard Matvichuk after a misplay by Storr behind his own net.
</P>
<P>
   It was Matvichuk, who broke the Kings hearts Nov. 24 with an
overtime goal that gave the Stars a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck cameto me and I waived at it,'' Storr said. ``I
thought (teammate) Sean O'Donnell was going to hit me over the head
with his stick after the goal. But that play wasn't going to stop
us tonight. We just played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The same was true the last time the two teams met Jan. 26 when
the Kings outplayed Dallas, but were stopped by Belfour in a 3-1
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was solid as usual, but two things were missing this
time. He was not playing with the lead and didn't have Brett Hull,
who got a broken nose in the Stars last game. In the last meeting
between the teams, Hull scored an empty net goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also played without former captain Derian Hatcher,
last year's playoff MVP Joe Nieuwendyk and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   At the 7:12 mark of the opening period, Ziggy Palffy, who had
10points in his previous four games, spotted Stumpel breaking past
the Dallas defense. Palffy put the puck on Stumpel's stick and he
did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who has missed most of the season with knee and
abdominal injuries, now has goals in each of his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Galley made it 2-0 with less than seven minutes to play in the
first. In the first two meetings between the clubs this year,
Dallas took two-goal leads in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Galley moved into the slot virtually untouched by the Dallas
defense. It was his seventh goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago we went on the road and thought we could have
gotten six points,'' Galley said. ``We got two and were
disappointed. We've been playing hard and now the rewards are
coming. We are beating very good teams.''

RECOGNITION FOR SMOLINSKI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings knew Ziggy Palffy would get
his points. But the addition of Bryan Smolinski in last summer's
trade with the New York Islanders has given the Los Angeles Kings
their two top scorers this season.
</P>
<P>
   With an assist on Jozef Stumpel's first period goal, Palffy now
has a club-leading 54 points in 49 games, including seven in the
last four games. Smolinski is second with 47 points and is the only
King to play all 54 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   His 16 goals also match last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziggy has been great, but Bryan might have been the key to the
deal,'' said Luc Robitaille, who scored the Kings third goal
Friday. ``It was a trade that solidified two lines and it is rare
you can get that much out of one deal. You need two lines if you
are going to win in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor did not want to give up youngsters
Olli Jokinen and Mathieu Biron, his top draft picks the past two
seasons, as part of the trade. Jokinen has struggled offensively
but was the subject of several trade rumors at last weekend's
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Audette remains out: Friday marked one month since
second-line winger Donald Audette was placed on injured reserve for
a severely sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Audette has missed 13 games and has has not practiced with the
club. He is skating on his own but clearly favors the ankle. There
is no timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the ankle is inside the skate there still is a lot
of movement,'' trainer Pete Demers said. ``Try standing on one foot
for a while. Imagine doing that on one skate. You'll feel it pretty
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not be worse for Audette, who is a free agent
at the end of the season. He is earning $2.3 million this year and
would have to receive at least a 10-percent raise if he re-signed
with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Blake, who did not play well on the first line earlier
this year, has responded in Audette's spot the past few weeks. He
speed has quickly has been a nice complement for Smolinski and Glen
Murray on the second line. Blake assisted on Garry Galley's goal in
the first periodthat gave the Kings a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   __ Minor Moves: Craig Johnson, a healthy scratch in Wednesday's
victory in Phoenix, returned Friday and assisted on Stumpel's
first-period goal. Steve McKenna, who returned Wednesday after
being scratched the previous 10 games, played Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The odd man out against the Stars was Marko Tuomainen, the
third-line forward who had a goal Jan. 20 in a 5-2 loss at Dallas.
He hadn'tscored since.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made other moves Friday, lending rookie defenseman
Franticek Kaberle to minor-league Long Beach and sending down
defenseman Jaroslav Modry to the Ice Dogs for conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Kaberle was a regular on the Kings power play during the first
two months but lost playing time after defenseman Jere Karalahti
arrived in December. In 37 games, Kaberle had nine assists. He has
not played since Dec. 30 against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Modry played Friday night for Long Beach but will return to
practice today.

FORMER COP SAYS HE WAS WARNED ABOUT INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 and GREGG GITTRICH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Corrupt LAPD cop Rafael Perez was warned
repeatedly by fellow officers and supervisors before his arrest
that he was under investigation by federal and police authorities,
according to transcripts of his testimony in the Rampart Division
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to protect Perez, involving at least three Rampart
sergeants, was overt and continuous, starting shortly after he
stole cocaine on March 2, 1998, until his arrest nearly six months
later, according to transcripts of Perez's interviews with Los
Angeles Police Department and District Attorney's Office
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks before his tumble from an elite CRASH officer
to an unmasked dirty cop who shot and framed suspects, the warnings
intensified and officers in the disgraced division curtailed a
great deal of their illegal tactics and thuggery, Perez testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``After March 2, I never, I never did anything after that,''
Perez told investigators last month. ``In fact, if you look at the
CRASH book and the recaps of everything that was going on,
everything went downhill. There was hardly any arrests being
made.''
</P>
<P>
   According to nearly 2,000 pages of transcripts obtained by the
Daily News, Perez said being tipped off to internal investigations
was standard _ indeed, expected _ behavior in a tight-knit
anti-gang unit in which criminal behavior and cover-ups were a part
of ``being in the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to remember now, we're working Rampart CRASH. And that
may not mean a whole lot to some people. But to us, it meant a
whole lot ... The relationship we had, within CRASH, is a little
bit tighter than just working patrol,'' said Perez, who has been
convicted of stealing cocaine from the department. He agreed to
provide information as part of a plea deal, and will be sentenced
Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   A top source close to the police corruption investigation
confirmed Perez's statements. ``A group of sergeants had an idea,
or should have had an idea, what was going on at Rampart CRASH,''
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman David Kalish said he could not comment on any
specific allegations against the Community Resources Against Street
Hoodlums unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of the investigation that is being conducted, if any
of those allegations are proven true, obviously the department will
take immediate, corrective action,'' Kalish said. ``If they are
true, we will be extremely disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Capt. Richard Meraz became the highest ranking
Rampart officer to go before a LAPD administrative disciplinary
committee on the count of failing ``to take appropriate action
after becoming aware of misconduct,'' in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In detailed testimony to investigators, Perez described how
Rampart sergeants helped concoct bogus stories after bad shootings,
condoned the planting of drugs and guns and looked the other way
when officers brutally beat up, or ``thumped,'' suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a CRASH unit, and you're a supervisor in a CRASH
unit, you have to know things are going on,'' Perez said under oath
during a Sept. 22 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Perez identified nine Rampart sergeants he claims either had
participated in illegal activities or allowed them to be covered
up.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Daily News that Perez failed a polygraph _ a
lie-detector test that's inadmissible in court. Nevertheless, LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks has said dozens of investigators in an
independent probe have corroborated enough of his testimony to urge
District Attorney Gil Garcetti to overturn 57 cases. Two officers
have been fired and 17 relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's attorney, Winston Kevin McKesson, said ``the test was
absolutely invalid.'' He declined to comment on specific statements
made by Perez to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first warnings Perez received came shortly after he
had stolen the cocaine from the LAPD Property Division, when an
officer told Perez that his name came up at the start of an
Internal Affairs investigation into the theft, according to the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation progressed, the warnings slowly intensified
until just before he was detained, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, a friend of his, also an LAPD officer, and
another cop approached him in Las Vegas and told him he was being
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `Hey, be careful.'''
</P>
<P>
   About one month later, a sergeant who supervised Perez notified
him that investigators had confidentially requested copies of his
logs for handwriting comparisons. Sgt. George Hoopes offered
similar warnings, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1998, the tips were coming from many sources,

KOBE'S STAR IS SHINING BRIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Kobe Bryant has been here before, under the glare of
these lights, surrounded by this mob of media, propped up, promoted
and sold by these NBA marketing mavens.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, a star the moment he entered the league in June
1996, is back in the NBA's ultimate hype vehicle, All-Star weekend.
He's been here before, as a starter in the 1998 All-Star Game in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the same Kobe who at age 19 was forced onto the
national stage and into a prepackaged head-to-head battle with
Michael Jordan. That Kobe, not yet a starter on his own Lakers
team, was an All-Star in popularity but an unpolished phenom in
professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   His charisma and style earned him a free pass, and resentment
over his accelerated ascent. There was the Bryant Backlash, a
feeling he was more hype than substance. There was his second-half
tailspin, when his game took a nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   So here's Bryant again, an All-Star starter once more, and his
game has caught up to his stardom. Substance has grabbed the lead
in the race with Kobe's immense hype.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bryant, now 21, admits, that this All-Star Game carries a
certain legitimacy his first election lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' he said. ``I was proud when I made the All-
Star team my (second) year, but to prove to myself that it wasn't a
fluke, to be able to come back. . . . It was such a huge challenge,
because I missed so many games. I didn't know if I was going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoring fans left little doubt that would happen, even after
Bryant missed the first month of this season with a broken hand. He
has rewarded their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 48 games of the season, Bryant has averaged
22.6 points, 6.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists. He and Shaquille O'Neal
have been the league's most lethal one-two punch, leading the
Lakers to a 37-11 record, second best in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Few doubt anymore that Bryant belongs here. That he belongs with
the group of next-generation superstars _ Kevin Garnett, Allen
Iverson, Tim Duncan, Vince Carter _ poised to take over the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting started,'' Bryant said. ``I haven't
accomplished anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the problem two years ago, when the backlash began.
</P>
<P>
   He's always had the look of a star, from the moment he stepped
onto a stage in the Lower Merion High School gym in Philadelphia
and declared, with sunglasses perched on his forehead, ``I've
decided to take my talents to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the good looks and flashy moves of a young Michael
Jordan, and through no fault of his own, by his sophomore season,
the ``Heir Jordan'' label was affixed. Then came All-Star weekend
'98 _ Bryant vs. Jordan, screamed volumes of NBA print and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the game and Bryant exacerbated matters by waving off
a screen from Utah's Karl Malone so he could go one-on-one with
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the weekend was over, Bryant was worn out. And he
was tarnished, as Malone angrily criticized Bryant's choice of
showmanship over team play. Then Lakers coach Del Harris poured
fuel on the fire, criticizing the league for elevating Bryant too
quickly, before he had done a thing on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Del viewed it that way, which made it even harder,''
Bryant said. ``I think if he just would have viewed it as, this is
the opportunity I had here and it's a good opportunity . . .
instead of viewing it as a negative matter. I think once you view
things negatively, it has an impact on your mind. I think his views
made it even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly weighed on Bryant, who began to wilt under the
scrutiny. After scoring 17.9 points per game before the All-Star
crush, Bryant's average plummeted to 12.7 points in the second half
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league really put a lot of pressure on him to go
out and be such a super duper-star, when you need him to just play
the game. . . . It was just ridiculous for him to go through all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant said other factors were at work then, specifically
his coach and some teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it hard the second half of the season, because
(Harris') perception of me trickled down to my teammates,'' who
also seemed to think Bryant had gotten too big for his own good, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with emotions. Once the emotions kind of
get dented a little bit, it's kind of hard to play,'' Bryant said.
``I mean, I went out and played hard, but it was their perception
of me that affected my game, which made it even harder. I was
frying my brain _ `What the hell is going on?' But as years went
on, a couple years down the road, I was able to kind of look back
and analyze things, break things down.''
</P>
<P>
   The main thing he learned?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just enjoy yourself regardless of what people are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience certainly changed him. Witness his decision
not to compete in the slam-dunk contest or the 2ball competition,
both events the league desperately wanted him in. Instead, he'll
unveil his rap debut _ ``K-O-B-E'' with Tyra Banks _ this morning,
and spend time with a cousin who lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the experience of what I learned about perceptions,''
he said. ``I'm very picky about my time and keeping it to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His growth on the court is even more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, oft-criticized as selfish, leads his team in assists and
came within a rebound of his first career triple-double this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep coming together and talking about it, and I'm
remaining very positive that he's learning game by game and
experience by experience,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``I'm never
displeased with his effort.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson, no stranger to the effects of hype after mentoring
Michael Jordan with the Bulls, said Bryant has ultimately benefited
from his experiences in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aspect of having that happen to him really matured him
quickly in that kind of a setting, and subsequently what happened
after the game,'' he said. ``His play has left him to say, `Well,
I'm not going to go to the dunk contest, the 2ball contest or
whatever else.' And he's just taking the event for himself, and I
think that's important now, that he can narrow his scope a little
bit and say, `I'll stay focused on what I'm doing.' ''

KOBE IN STORE FOR LESSON FROM BEATTY BOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had more on his plate than Gilbert Brown. When
you're a prime cut of NBA beef, there are going to be days like
this when you're drowning in gravy.
</P>
<P>
   A one-on-one session with a reporter preceded a two-hour Lakers
practice that came before a video shoot for a cable-music TV
channel that bled into a photo session for a TV magazine, which
bumped up against a taping across town with a late-night TV
talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way all week for Bryant, who will participate
in his second All-Star game Sunday. Over the past few days, only
computer hackers have been busier than Bryant, 22, who admitted,
``It's been kind of crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He had just swallowed the last bite of a nutritional bar that
passed for lunch and was slipping into his sneakers even as he
started striding toward his next obligation. Unless it's on a cue
card, Bryant probably hasn't read it, but, what the heck. ``Uh,
Kobe,'' you say, quickening your step to keep up with him, ``have
you finished the book, ``The White Boy Shuffle,'' that coach Phil
Jackson gave you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't even cracked it open,'' Bryant said, so crunched for
time he was blowing off personal pronouns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what Jackson knows and what Bryant has yet to learn
is this: Because Bryant doesn't have time to read is exactly why he
needs to sit down and acquaint himself with Gunnar Kaufman and the
other characters in L.A. native Paul Beatty's first novel, which
was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, the story's narrator, is a basketball player, but
that's almost beside the point. He is an African-American kid who
goes from living as a curiosity in Santa Monica _ ``the whitest
Negro in captivity,'' in his words _ to being a cultural misfit
when his mother uproots Kaufman and his sister and moves them to an
impoverished multiracial West L.A. neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world Kaufman might look to outsiders like he fits
right in, but in fact he is himself an outsider. He has to find his
way and earn his station and it doesn't happen overnight. As
Kaufman puts it, ``Dues had to be paid or you wasn't joining the
union.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the neighborhood the locals called
Hillside, but Kaufman could have been speaking of the NBA, where a
crisp crossover dribble, a harefooted first step to the basket or
balletic dunks can buy you fame and a corporate following but not
the love of the guy in the locker stall next to yours.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman talks about all the rules from the old neighborhood no
longer applying. The eye contact he was taught to maintain when
speaking to someone in the name of common courtesy, for example, is
considered an affront that necessitates immediate physical
retaliation on the hardscrabble streets of Hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the hard way that social norms in Santa Monica were
unforgivable breaches of proper Hillside etiquette,'' Kaufman says.
</P>
<P>
   Think the sporting norms at Lower Merion High in Philadelphia,
where Bryant starred before coming to the Lakers aren't egregious
transgressions in the NBA? Think of Karl Malone's reaction to
Bryant waving him off when the Utah star forward endeavored to set
a pick for Bryant at the at the All-Star game in New York two years
ago and think again.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Jackson, when asked what prompted him to pick this
particular book for Bryant, went straight to the theme of having to
adapt to one's environment in order to survive and thrive. ``I like
that,'' Jackson said with a crooked smile, his shrewd eyes
sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same day, Jackson would launch into a discussion of
how Bryant is in some ways behind for having made the leap from
high school to the NBA insofar as college forces even the most
cloistered or coddled teens to ``step out of their environment into
an environment they don't have any control over and . . .
reorganize their lives accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman starts playing basketball and in doing so gains the
acceptance of his peers, though it is as a poet that he ultimately
commands the respect _ indeed, the reverence _ of his community.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, the author whose own life is reflected in Kaufman's
story of race confusion, isolation and self-hatred, was surprised
when he heard his book had been hand-picked for Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his New York City home earlier this week, Beatty
said, ``I have no idea why he would give him my book.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's best guess was that Jackson maybe sees shades of Bryant
in Kaufman's friend, Nicholas Scoby, a basketball phenom who lived
uneasily (until his self-inflicted death) with his reputation for
never missing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching his hands shake,'' Kaufman says of Scoby, ``I
realized that sometimes the worst thing a (black man) can do is
perform well. Because then there's no turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, an accomplished poet who just completed his second
novel, said, ``You see it all the time, how much pressure is put on
young athletes. A lot of people are like [Scoby]. They are
paralyzed by the pressure they feel to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant poured in 18 points and had six rebounds and two steals
in 22 minutes at the 1998 All-Star game and his life hasn't been
quite the same since. We wondered, has he felt at all nonplussed by
all the expectations heaped on him the past two years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' Bryant said. ``After [the 1998 All-Star game], I kind
of had to raise the bar a little bit on my own expectations so I
wouldn't feel the pressure from everybody else. It forced me to
elevate my game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first line of ``The White Boy Shuffle'' reads: ``On one hand
this messiah gig is a (bear).''
</P>
<P>
   Can Bryant relate to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' he said, smiling and shaking his head. ``That's the
first line? Man, I've got to crack this book open.'' &QL;

<P>
   At an awards banquet at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in downtown
Los Angeles, amid applause and shouts, El Camino students jumped
and howled the second it was announced that their team had won the
championship and would advance to the statewide contest.
</P>
<P>
   El Camino beat 58 other teams _ with nine students each _ in the
competition that was held Jan. 29 and Feb. 5. The win marked the
school's seventh city title in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   El Camino will now gear up for the state Academic Decathlon,
which the team has won four times. Local winners will compete March
17-19 at the LAX Marriott Hotel, Westchester High School and Loyola
Marymount University in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the state competition will go to the U.S. Academic
Decathlon April 14-16 in San Antonio, Texas. El Camino has one
trophy from the national event.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's celebration was a time for the winners to rest on
their laurels.
</P>
<P>
   Team members Jennifer Beatty, Shamiq Hussain, Jeana Jorgensen,
Dmitry Miroshnichenko, Burton Newman, Sean Rosami, Ernest Rasyidi,
Kyle Wilding, and Qi ``Janet'' Zhou and coaches Melinda Owen and
Christian Cerone screamed and cheered the moment that their team
was announced the winners.
</P>
<P>
   Competition was tight at this year's event. Many of El Camino's
earlier champs have graduated, leaving it up to freshmen to carry
the torch.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles High School was a close second, while Palisades
Charter High School took third place.
</P>
<P>
   El Camino accumulated 49,097 points in the two-day competition,
capturing first place in the art, math, and speech categories. L.A.
High followed closely, earning 49,020 points, while Palisades
earned 45,090 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Most Improved Team award went to Sherman Oaks Center for
Enriched Studies, which jumped 31 spots from its final position
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on all 10 events, In Yong Song of Palisades scored the
highest individually with 8,931 out of 10,000 points. She led all
Honor Division opponents, followed by El Camino's Rasyidi (8,627)
and L.A.'s Tae Hong (8,547).
</P>
<P>
   Top scorers in the Scholastic Division were L.A.'s Igor
Sapozhnikov (8,706), Roosevelt's Rodrigo Luna (8,025), and L.A.'s
Vladimir Kogan (7,967).
</P>
<P>
   In the Varsity Division, El Camino's Sean Rostami took first
(8,419), followed by teammate Wilding (8,173), and then
Birmingham's Erik Himmel (7,894).
</P>
<P>
   The first-, second- and third-place individual scoring winners
in each division received $1,000, $750, and $500 scholarships,
respectively, donated by the Milken Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The winner was selected based on total points in 10 events,
counting the scores of the top two students from among the three
team members in each grade-point average category
</P>
<P>
   Varsity (2.99 GPA and below), Scholastic (3.0-3.74 GPA), and
Honor (3.75-4.0 GPA).
</P>
<P>
   Individual events included multiple-choice tests in art, math,
music, social science, economics, language and literature. Each
student also gave two speeches, wrote an essay and was interviewed
by a judging panel.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th event _ the Super Quiz _ was the only event scored as a
team event. L.A. High took first in that competition, followed by
El Camino.

DOCUMENTS SHINE NEW LIGHT ON FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS and TED MILLER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As newly discovered documents detailed the scope of
his relationship with Michigan basketball player Jamal Crawford,
Seattle businessman Barry Henthorn on Friday emphatically denied he
had set up a scholarship foundation solely to benefit the former
Rainier Beach High School star.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Henthorn also explained how he met Crawford
and supplied a personal reference in response to the documents
uncovered by the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, obtained by the P-I from attorneys and school
officials, include:
</P>
<P>
   -- A signed agreement in which Henthorn promised to repay
several loans that his former administrative assistant entered into
on behalf of Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   -- Loan agreements with a bank, a jewelry company and a
commercial lending company to purchase items for Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   -- A letter questioning Henthorn's relationship with Crawford
dating to 1998, when Crawford was the Washington state player of
the year at Rainier Beach.
</P>
<P>
   -- An unsigned ``Scholarship Acceptance Agreement'' between
Crawford and Hen-thorn's Academic Assistance Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn, 33, president of Innovative Communications
Technologies, maintained he never intended to eventually profit
from his relationship with Crawford or from the money, cars,
jewelry and living arrangements he provided for the Michigan
freshman. Henthorn also insisted the Academic Assistance Foundation
is only in the planning stages and has yet to offer any benefits to
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal never received anything from the foundation. Anything
given to Jamal was given by me,'' Henthorn said. ``The foundation
exists, but so far we haven't been able to enact it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Friday, Henthorn disclosed that he met
Crawford through a third party, Tim McGee, director of the Joshua
Generation Teen Center in Seattle. McGee brought Crawford and four
or five other young basketball players to Henthorn's former Edmonds
residence, which contained an indoor court.
</P>
<P>
   McGee could not recall the date of the meeting, saying it was up
to three years ago. Also, he said he knew Crawford and Hen-thorn
had spoken previously at a basketball game but had not been
formally introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about this friendship. It is a genuine friendship,''
McGee said. ``There is nothing that Jamal can give Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, documents obtained Friday detail the extent of the
gifts Henthorn provided Crawford over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show Henthorn had his administrative assistant
co-sign on a loan of $3,763 for a 1985 Chevy Blazer and another
personal loan of $4,088, and open an account at Gordon's Jewelers
(current balance $2,813) for jewelry that allegedly went to
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford is listed as co-signer with the administrative
assistant, Darcienne LeRoue, on the Blazer purchased in December
1998 from Bayside Auto Sales with a $2,954 loan from First Security
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also show that Henthorn drafted a scholarship
acceptance agreement with his foundation ``for the purpose of
establishing a relationship where Jamal Crawford may receive
assistance in his pursuit of academic excellence and the
development of his persona.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which does not specify how much assistance
Crawford would receive, states that the foundation would ``from
time to time'' ask Crawford to appear on its behalf to ``promote it
or its contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   It also states that Crawford agrees ``to disclose and consult
with the foundation on any and all business decisions or
opportunities so as to allow for accurate advice.'' The
foundation's main requirement is that Crawford maintain a B average
or better.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, listed under non-profit corporations with the
Secretary of State's Office, has the same phone number as
Henthorn's telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about this scholarship acceptance agreement,
Hen-thorn said: ``I cannot speak to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The document specifically contains several clauses that would
have bound Crawford to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree to allow the foundation or its representatives to
inquire and negotiate any and all other scholarships or assistance
programs that they feel may benefit me,'' it states.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA last week suspended Crawford, Michigan's leading
scorer, for five games on top of the one handed down by the
university for violating a bylaw concerning amateurism. The NCAA
also ordered Crawford to repay $15,000 to Hen-thorn.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn, a 1985 graduate of Issaquah High School who attended
the University of Puget Sound, Seattle University and Bellevue
Community College, has no direct connection to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, meet with Wolverines coach Brian Ellerbe during
the recruitment of Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Since new allegations about Henthorn's financial and personal
relationship with Crawford were published by the P-I this week, the
NCAA and the University of Michigan have sent officials to Seattle
and reopened their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview, Henthorn at first declined to
discuss the specifics of the LeRoue-Crawford loans because they are
now the subject of a lawsuit filed by LeRoue in King County
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   LeRoue, who filed suit against Henthorn and Innovative
Communications on Nov. 10, 1999, seeks repayment of the loans and
damages for loss of wages and benefits, emotional distress and pain
and suffering from having to leave her job last year.
</P>
<P>
   One document, dated July 27, 1999, is a signed agreement between
Henthorn and LeRoue, in which Henthorn agrees to repay the loans.
The agreement notes that Henthorn had made some of the payments on
the jewelry account, but that payments were late and some checks
did not clear.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agreement states Henthorn did pay off the loan on
the Blazer and the personal loan at Norwest Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn said LeRoue refused to settle the suit when he offered
to repay any outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a flat-out extortion attempt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazer was one of three cars Henthorn apparently provided to
Crawford dating back to his days at Rainier Beach and continuing to
the most recent car, a 1988 Mercedes valued at $12,000, that
Crawford recently tried to register on campus at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   When the university learned of the vehicle, it suspended
Crawford for one game and launched its own investigation into the
basketball player's relationship with Henthorn.
</P>
<P>
   Also while in high school, Crawford allegedly was given a 1993
Jeep Grand Cherokee from Henthorn that became a subject of
controversy when Crawford started driving it to Rainier Beach in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 18, 1998, letter from Rainier Beach athletic director
Dan Jurdy to the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association,
Jurdy disclosed that Henthorn and the Academic Assistance
Foundation had reportedly supplied the car to Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry told Jamal that he had been selected as the student the
foundation would help,'' Jurdy said in a letter to the WIAA. ``He
gave Jamal a pamphlet about the program and said that it was a new
program that targets one young person each year, and provides them
with academic and personal assistance. On the pamphlet are the
names of various reputable businesses and individuals which make
the foundation appear very legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurdy's letter states he called Henthorn and ``asked him what he
was doing giving a high school kid a car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I informed him that this was against WIAA rules and that he
was putting Jamal in jeopardy,'' Jurdy said in the letter. ``He
(Henthorn) said that his lawyers had informed him that it was not
against WIAA rules and that I should mind my own business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jurdy then told Crawford that the foundation was ``set up
against the rules of the school and the WIAA,'' according to the
letter to the agency. ``Jamal has assured me that he will have no
further contact with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn on Friday first said he couldn't recall ever speaking
to Jurdy. Then he said that he had requested a meeting with Jurdy
but was denied.
</P>
<P>
   In a story in Thursday's P-I, businesses and individuals listed
on the foundation's brochure _ which Henthorn has since claimed was
merely a ``mock-up'' _ either didn't exist or denied having any
connection to the AAF.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, more questions about the foundation surfaced. An
apparent pay stub from the foundation obtained by the P-I listed
$21,666 in salary payments ($1,666 a week) to Gerald Piper of Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   However, when contacted about his employment with AAF, Piper
said he never worked for AAF or for Henthorn. He said his only
connection to Henthorn was that he bought a house from him in July
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Piper said he was a high school security guard and wanted to
know how he came to be listed on a pay stub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what you are talking about,'' Piper said.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn also said he had no idea what the pay stub was or how
Piper's name and Social Security number surfaced in connection with
the foundation.

ALL-STAR GAME BRINGS SONICS' PAYTON BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It started way back when the Jherri curl was a
cool hairstyle and just about any basketball shoe made of leather
heightened streetball fashion.
</P>
<P>
   On one of those countless occasions when kids frolicked under
eight-foot rims outside Jefferson Elementary School, there was Gary
Payton _ a mischievous third-grader with an athletic gift _
exercising his basketball prowess and a mouth that, even then, ran
with more RPMs than a race car.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, fancy cars, big houses and long money awaited him,
Payton would often say between peewee pickup games in his the East
Oakland neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we would tell him `Yeah, right''' said Milton Jackson,
Payton's best friend of nearly 30 years. ``He was always lying.''
</P>
<P>
   There was something Payton did a lot more of than embellish.
He'd perpetually play basketball _ in the morning, at recess, after
school, until dusk, in the driveway, in the bedroom and definitely
in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In Payton, the playground truthfully had a rising star and one
of its most audacious characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's changed,'' Jackson said, sounding proud. ``He's
still black and loud like he was then.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's still got game.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has since exchanged the dripping curl for a bald 'do. And
those Dr. J. sneakers that made Payton the envy of his peers have
been replaced by a pair of self-named Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the locals _ as well as a national television audience _
will see the same mannerisms Payton first exhibited just 10 miles
from the Arena at Oakland, when the NBA All-Star Game tips off here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark Payton's sixth All-Star appearance, but the first
in his hometown since he entered the NBA nearly 10 years ago. The
Sonics' point guard will be joined by fellow Oaktown native Jason
Kidd (Phoenix) as All-Star hosts.
</P>
<P>
   However, the allure of Payton is as unparalleled now as it was
then.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he won't start for the Western Conference (Kidd and
the Lakers' Kobe Bryant won the fans' balloting), Payton has
developed into one of the top three players in the NBA. Payton also
is recognized as the absolute best player this little melting-pot
community across the bay from San Francisco ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knew Payton as a child says the same thing. His
jumper was crooked and he wasn't extremely quick. But Payton ``was
so much more advanced than anyone else. He'd do whatever it took to
win games,'' longtime friend James Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all he wanted to do,'' Dailey said. ``We'd take a break
every now and then to go swimming or do something else. Gary was
always on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I always knew Gary had more of a future playing
basketball than anyone else around. Not that he was always the
best, but you just had a feeling with his determination, and as
much as he played basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   `PAYTON'S PLACE'
</P>
<P>
   The walk to Jefferson Elementary was short. Just 2{ blocks from
the house on 41st Street where Payton lived. Payton's family lived
in the West Oakland projects when he was born July 23, 1968. He is
the youngest of five children born to his mother, Annie, and
father, Al. The Paytons moved into the same one-story,
three-bedroom home Payton's father still occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, a sign hanging above the porch reads ``Payton's
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   For a good while, Payton excelled in this section of East
Oakland. His father made sure of it, as Payton's first coach and
constant motivator.
</P>
<P>
   Al didn't want his son playing on the low rims. Instead, Payton
made an early impression with kids twice his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to tell me I had to go play with them,'' Payton
said. ``I didn't have a choice. But that's what made me better. The
games were always hard-core.''
</P>
<P>
   And so was the little, trash-talking Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was as tough as they come back then, because he
would talk so much and the things he'd say made people afraid,''
Dailey said. ``I learned his bark was a little bigger than his
bite. But not a lot of people knew that. He wasn't a punk, but he
definitely handles himself by the way he talks.''
</P>
<P>
   A saucy mouthpiece is what was needed in the Flats, a somewhat
precarious part of town. The Hills, where Kidd grew up, was a nicer
area with better schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the broke brothers lived in the Flat lands,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   As legend has it, you had to have attitude to be successful in
the Flats, or at least be able to protect yourself. It was common
for shady characters to try to take over a game, disregarding those
waiting on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It was be rough or be run over. Payton's toughness stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be,'' Payton said. ``I mean, I wasn't as big as some
of those guys. But I had to act like I was. It was just the way it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   SERIOUS GAME
</P>
<P>
   Payton carried that no-fear attitude from the playground to
organized basketball. When Payton finished his seasons at Jefferson
Elementary, he'd immediately start playing for the Jefferson
Cobras, a recreational league team coached by his father, a.k.a.
``Pops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd travel to places like San Francisco and Phoenix,'' said
Dailey, who along with Jackson were Payton's teammates. ```Pops'
always had us in tournaments. And he treated us all like his sons.
Gary got the ball when the game was on the line. But that was OK,
because he was usually our best player.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton called himself the ``Iceman'' because he idolized George
Gervin. ``Iceman'' posters covered nearly every inch of wall space
in his bedroom, and Payton was adamant about the nickname making
the back of his rec-league jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's reputation as a solid player grew across town at
Claremount Junior High later, Skyline High School and eventually
Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Skyline, in the Hills 12 miles from his house, Payton
was a little-known player because he made his name in the Flats.
Playing in the Hills turned out to be a tough adjustment for
Payton. He struggled as a student/athlete his freshman and
sophomore seasons, seeing little playing time as his grades
declined.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Payton was declared ineligible that he got
himself together. A couple of run-ins with his father played a
part, too.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time when Payton was supposed to be washing his
dad's car on the street. When he was done, Payton jumped in the
driver's seat and drove away. That short joy ride ended with Payton
slamming the car in reverse against a curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking the long way to the driveway. And wrecked that
car,'' Jackson said, laughing. ``He knocked the concrete off the
curb, and `Pops' was highly upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Pops, who would lay into Payton, shook up the 15-year-old for
good when he burst into a classroom at Skyline and admonished him
in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back in there crying, in front of all my friends,''
Payton said. ``I straightened up. You know, you don't want him to
come back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton became the most celebrated player to leave Skyline's
dingy, 600-seat gymnasium. He has donated so much to the school,
and is such an example for current players, that the school
district is proposing the gym be renamed after Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what he'd be doing if he wasn't playing
basketball,'' Jackson said. ``Gary always wanted to play. And
`Pops' didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's father, also known as Mr. Mean in the neighborhood, was
always firm. Payton's friends, though, remember the deep affection
`Pops' had for his youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary always had new gym shoes, and he always had money in his
pocket due to his father,'' Dailey said. ``I remember when we'd
hang out after school and go get some Chinese food. It would cost
99 cents, $1.08 with tax. And Gary would have a $20 bill in his
pocket but say, `Give me a dollar so I don't have to break my $20.'
Me and Milton would have a couple of bucks at the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton divided his time at the homes of Dailey and Jackson. As
teenagers, the trio eventually graduated to the Malibu, now a
vacant lot, but once a place to play video games and ride go-karts.
</P>
<P>
   Just one of the many pit stops on Payton's way to becoming a
local legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special guy,'' Jackson said. ``That's all you can say
about him. He's one of a kind.''

COWBOYS EXPECTED TO OBTAIN GALLOWAY DESPITE SNAG

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys appeared to have had a seven-year,
$42 million deal in place, or nearly in place, with Seattle's
unhappy big-play receiver Joey Galloway last night when Galloway
suddenly fired his agents.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last night, the Cowboys were still working on trying
to sign Galloway, who is now represented by Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   A contract is imperative before a trade _ which still appears
imminent _ can be consummated between the Seahawks and Cowboys, who
are willing to give up their first-round draft pick (19th overall)
in the April 15-16 draft and other possible considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, who is one of the NFL's premier big-play men, missed
eight games last season over a bitter contract dispute in which he
turned down a seven-year, $35 million offer from the Seahawks.
Galloway was demanding a $10 million signing bonus on a five-year
deal instead.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Galloway fired his agents, Eric Metz and Ethan Lock
of Phoenix, and hired Steinberg to resume negotiations with the
Cowboys, Steinberg told the Seattle ``Post-Intelligencer''.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, a deal between Steinberg and the Cowboys
is expected to be reached today.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who has had a close working relationship with Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones over the years, represents five Cowboys,
including quarterback Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre twist to this story is that Stephen Jones, Cowboys
vice president/director of player personnel, was negotiating
positively with Metz when suddenly all bets were off, as Galloway
changed agents.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren, Seattle coach and general manager, made it clear
that he was eager to trade Galloway _ and sooner rather than later.
Holmgren received what he considered to be serious inquiries from
six NFL teams, including the Cowboys, over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Seahawks made Galloway their ``exclusive
franchise player,'' which meant they would receive two first-round
picks if he left via unrestricted free agency. This set up the
trade scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The Joey Galloway Sweepstakes took a specific direction toward
Valley Ranch when Holmgren decided late yesterday afternoon that
the Cowboys would receive an exclusive first crack at trying to
sign Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's reasoning was based on the Cowboys having what he
felt was what it would take to meet the needs of both Galloway,
contractually, and the Seahawks in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren explained that he saw the potential for time-wasting
gamesmanship among owners and general managers of these six teams
if given the chance to bid against each other. Dallas, Washington,
Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cleveland are known to be among the six
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on long enough for my tastes,'' said Holmgren,
deciding not to turn show-and-sell into something that could drag
out for weeks, or even months.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Seahawks had gone through a messy three-month
holdout last season with Galloway, who sat out the first eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said the same thing to every \Rinterested\S team: `Talk to
me and tell me what we can do.' I'm not going to go back and forth
between teams,'' said Holmgren. ``To me, \Rthe Cowboys\S present
the best scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   That's now up to Galloway and his new agent, Steinberg, to
determine.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, with three first-round selections (second, 12th
and 24th) reportedly offered the lowest of these picks and wide
receiver Albert Connell to the Seahawks. But Holmgren preferred
19th overall to 24th overall, and therefore gave the Cowboys first
dibs.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, 28, caught 29 of his career 37 touchdown passes over
the 1996, 1997 and 1998 seasons. In his first four years in the
league, he averaged 65 receptions, 1,030 yards and nine touchdowns
before his 22-catch, 335-yard, holdout-marred half-season in 1999.

`TROPHIES' EN HANCE CITY IM AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY RICCARDO A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another week, another award for Phoenix. But how does the trophy
case of No. 1 rankings help the area? Or could it hurt?
</P>
<P>
   In a just over a year, Phoenix has been cited among the top
places, if not the No. 1 spot, to start, expand or move a business
by at least a dozen national publications. Last week, the Phoenix
area
</P>
<P>
   was named the hottest area in the United States for an
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all read those publications as site-selection consultants,
as well as the corporate CEOs we are working with,'' said Peter
O'Neill, senior vice president of Corporate Real Estate Advisors,
based in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Phoenix isn't under consideration, we will go back and give
it another look.''
</P>
<P>
   Area economic-development professionals said the national notice
pushes Phoenix to the top of the list of potential sites for
companies looking at the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition ``is a major plus for Phoenix and because of it we
will probably make the short list,'' said William Stephenson,
certified economic developer for Arizona Public Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can't make the short list if you don't get on the long
list,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Roderique, Scottsdale economic-development director, said
the recognition could go a long way in sinking the business world's
perception that the Phoenix area is only a great place to golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (CEOs) now see the Valley as a serious business center,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area has won several high-profile projects in the
last few months: the USAA operations center; a $2 billion chip
plant that boosts Intel Corp.'s presence in the Phoenix area; and a
new credit-card processing center for retailer Target Corp.
Honeywell International now has headquarters for its $10.5 billion
aerospace business in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area's booming business climate and the resulting
migration of people to the metropolitan area can have a downside. A
disproportionately large number of start-ups in Arizona translates
into a higher number of small-business failures.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Department of Commerce Director Jackie Vieh isn't
concerned with the number of the failures. Unsuccessful businesses,
she said, are a mark of the entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the nature of business in the New Economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All the executives and workers who come because of the Phoenix
area's reputation further strain the area's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Although a December poll showed residents loved Arizona, almost
half said they would leave the area tomorrow if they could. Among
the reasons cited: air pollution, traffic and encroaching
development.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Weddle, president of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council,
said a balance between a high quality of life and a healthy economy
would almost ensure the Phoenix area's future competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Being more selective in the types of businesses GPEC seeks to
lure to the Phoenix area, Weddle says, also will help preserve some
of the quality of life while sustaining a vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   Weddle says his work is not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our image race is not over we have to push it to an even
higher level,'' he said. &QL;

THREE NIGHTS THAT WILL SATISFY SCORSESE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A PERSONAL JOURNEY WITH MARTIN SCORSESE THROUGH AMERICAN MOVIES 
Written and directed by: Martin Scorsese and Michael Henry Wilson. 
Produced by: Florence Dauman and edited by Thelma Schoonmaker.
When: Monday through Wednesday night at 8 p.m. and 12 a.m. 
On: Turner Classic Movies. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a trip through the history of American movies with Martin
Scorsese is a film lover's dream. It would be like a house tour for
architects led by Frank Lloyd Wright or sitting next to Isaac Stern
for a concert series or talking baseball with Ted Williams or the
history of hoops with Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three nights on Turner Classic Movies, Scorsese
weaves his idiosyncratic way through genres, directors, stars,
studios, and writers in ``A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese
through American Movies.'' The documentary airs from 8-9:30 p.m.
and repeats from midnight-1:30 a.m. each night.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Scorsese spoke in a conference call to a handful of
writers throughout the country, explaining his passion for movies
and why this journey is so personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a film critic,'' he says from his office in
Manhattan. ``I love movies too much to be a critic.''
</P>
<P>
   What Scorsese means is that he can isolate a particular sequence
or a specific shot or the artful use of a color and appreciate that
portion of a movie. He can forgive innumerable sins for one
brilliant moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this documentary as not really a history but what
affected me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As an asthmatic child growing up in the Little Italy section of
New York City, he virtually lived at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't play sports,'' he says. ``I spent my time inside
movie theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   That early exposure transformed the youngster into a virtual
encyclopedia of film knowledge. Sometimes, while shooting his own
films, he'll request his office to ship him clips from other movies
that might help him resolve a particular problem.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Scorsese's cinematic journey so memorable is his
intelligence, affection, and humility.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know Scorsese only through his films, the
documentary is an opportunity to be both entertained and educated
through his vast knowledge of other directors' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran the new print of `Rear Window,' '' he says of the
Alfred Hitchcock classic. ``You might as well give up. He's the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese wants the viewer he calls the ``younger film
enthusiast'' to appreciate more obscure directors. Instead of
concentrating on filmmakers whose work is already well-documented
and respected _ such as John Ford and Hitchcock _ Scorsese lauds
more obscure talents such as Andre de Toth and Anthony Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to build up an appreciation for the little
movie,'' he says. ``These films are art. Sometimes good, bad, or
indifferent but they were art. It's like spending time with a piece
of music or a painting that moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese, whose own film resume includes ``Mean Streets,''
``Taxi Driver,'' ``Good Fellas,'' ``Raging Bull,'' and ``Bringing
in the Dead,'' speaks of ``Detour,'' Edgar G. Ulmer's low-budget
1945 film noir with a no-name cast, with the same enthusiasm
usually reserved for Orson Welles's ``Citizen Kane'' (1941). ``Its
crudity made it special,'' he says. ``It created a nightmarish
atmosphere . . . a hyper-reality. He had no time to shoot it . . .
he had to use his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   And imagination is still what fuels Scorsese and, he hopes,
future generations of filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each generation is trying to re-invent what cinema is,'' he
says, in response to a question about the new digital technology.
``But we're all doing the same thing. We're trying to do something
that will emotionally affect people.''

   Slinging Mud Among the Palmettos
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush won in Delaware, but Sen. John McCain got 25
percent of the vote and never even showed up. Meanwhile, the two
are getting down and dirtier as South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary
looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending lavishly on ads that portray him,
wouldn't you know, as a maverick, George's boy and the endorsee of
Dan Quayle. He is now cast as ``a reformer with results.'' Bush has
taken to calling McCain ``the Chairman,'' depicting him as someone
who mouths reform while cozying up to lobbyists with interests
before the commerce panel he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to destroy McCain's image as someone who stands up
to the special interests, someone who possesses strength of
character, a trait not usually associated with inside-the-beltway
types.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the independent voters in New Hampshire saw McCain,
and they turned out in large numbers. They may be a big factor in
the Palmetto State, as well, and Bush must either dampen their
enthusiasm or transfer their starry-eyed loyalty to himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, striking back, is running ads comparing Bush to
President Clinton, and has been accusing the Bush campaign of
so-called push-polling, a practice where voters are called and fed
negative information about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies any involvement and McCain's supporters worry that
all the skirmishing over tactics will depress turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to get worse in the lead up to Tuesday's GOP debate.
Steve Forbes, who dropped out after a poor showing in Delaware,
won't be there to kick or kick around anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, money talks, and won't shut up. Some of Bush's big
backers grumble that the $37 million he's spent so far hasn't
bought much, but they aren't bolting yet. McCain raised more than
$2.2 million on the Internet and starred at a fund-raising event in
Washington studded with lobbyists, some of whom wore ``McCain voted
against my bill'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats don't get to vote in a primary of their own until
March 7. Vice President Al Gore lavished attention on California
and went on Jay Leno, while Bill Bradley plans to run an
endorsement ad from Michael Jordan.

   The Return of Mortadella &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the traditional pork sausage of Bologna,
mortadella, was as illegal in the United States as Cuban cigars
and, accordingly, just as valued by connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella lovers have been known to sneak the delicacy past
U.S. customs inside metal containers to hide the scent from
meat-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   To advance trade negotiations with the increasingly intransigent
European Union, the Agriculture Department lifted its ban, a
long-awaited reversal that was greeted in Italy as a moral
vindication along the lines of the exoneration of Alfred Dreyfus.
Italian pork products were banned in America after an outbreak of
African swine fever in Italy in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella costs more than twice as much in Italy as
American-made bologna, and Italian producers say that most
Americans have no idea what the real thing tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even try it,'' Rino Brini, 80, a co-founder of the
Alcisa pork factory in Bologna, said of American bologna. ``It
looks so sad.''

   A Setback in North Ireland After Delay in Disarmament  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 weeks after it began, the power-sharing government of
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland came to an end,
aborted by the continuing conflict over the issue of paramilitary
weapons. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said
he acted because the Irish Republican Army refused to give any sign
that it was going to dismantle its arsenal. He expected the
government to return ``on an even firmer footing,'' he said, if the
long-running dispute could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, tried to
deflect blame for the action, saying the breakdown increased the
complications surrounding guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   1990s' Productivity Makes It Best Decade Since 1960s
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s economic expansion, now the longest expansion in the
nation's history, draws its staying power from various wells _ the
two most important being the booming stock market and labor's
rising efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market makes people feel wealthy, encouraging them to
spend. To help satisfy this rising demand, America's workers are
managing to produce more goods and services in each hour of work.
Their rising output keeps the economy growing and plays a big role
in extending the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows just why workers have become more productive
in recent years, or for how long they will continue to grow more
efficient, as they did in the last six months of 1999. The Labor
Department announced last week that productivity, or output per
hour, had risen at an annual rate of 5 percent from June through
December, the best performance in seven years. And the expansion
marches on.

   Hijacking Ends
</P>
<P>
   The four-day hijacking of an Afghan airliner at Stansted Airport
outside of London ended peacefully and with no injuries when the
hijackers surrendered unconditionally on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half the people on the plane, Afghans who had been
on a domestic flight from Kabul when the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727
was seized, asked for political asylum. The Home Office pledged to
decide their cases as soon as possible, with a view toward ejecting
the Afghans from Britain. Twenty-two people were arrested and will
be charged under hijacking and terrorism laws.

</P>
<P>
   A brutal police corruption scandal that had largely been
contained to one anti-gang unit is now threatening to engulf the
Los Angeles Police Department, with the district attorney having
declared for the first time that the investigation has broadened to
other police divisions and that the police have been dragging their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 40 tainted cases now overturned, the new
disclosures of abuse have led to demands for an outside
investigation, perhaps by federal prosecutors.

   Gov. George W. Bush won in Delaware, but Sen. John McCain got 25
percent of the vote and never even showed up. Meanwhile, the two
are getting down and dirtier as South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary
looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is spending lavishly on ads that portray him,
wouldn't you know, as a maverick, George's boy and the endorsee of
Dan Quayle. He is now cast as ``a reformer with results.'' Bush has
taken to calling McCain ``the Chairman,'' depicting him as someone
who mouths reform while cozying up to lobbyists with interests
before the commerce panel he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to destroy McCain's image as someone who stands up
to the special interests, someone who possesses strength of
character, a trait not usually associated with inside-the-beltway
types.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the independent voters in New Hampshire saw McCain,
and they turned out in large numbers. They may be a big factor in
the Palmetto State, as well, and Bush must either dampen their
enthusiasm or transfer their starry-eyed loyalty to himself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, striking back, is running ads comparing Bush to
President Clinton, and has been accusing the Bush campaign of
so-called push-polling, a practice where voters are called and fed
negative information about a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies any involvement and McCain's supporters worry that
all the skirmishing over tactics will depress turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's bound to get worse in the lead up to Tuesday's GOP debate.
Steve Forbes, who dropped out after a poor showing in Delaware,
won't be there to kick or kick around anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, money talks, and won't shut up. Some of Bush's big
backers grumble that the $37 million he's spent so far hasn't
bought much, but they aren't bolting yet. McCain raised more than
$2.2 million on the Internet and starred at a fund-raising event in
Washington studded with lobbyists, some of whom wore ``McCain voted
against my bill'' stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats don't get to vote in a primary of their own until
March 7. Vice President Al Gore lavished attention on California
and went on Jay Leno, while Bill Bradley plans to run an
endorsement ad from Michael Jordan.

   The Return of Mortadella &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the traditional pork sausage of Bologna,
mortadella, was as illegal in the United States as Cuban cigars
and, accordingly, just as valued by connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella lovers have been known to sneak the delicacy past
U.S. customs inside metal containers to hide the scent from
meat-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   To advance trade negotiations with the increasingly intransigent
European Union, the Agriculture Department lifted its ban, a
long-awaited reversal that was greeted in Italy as a moral
vindication along the lines of the exoneration of Alfred Dreyfus.
Italian pork products were banned in America after an outbreak of
African swine fever in Italy in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella costs more than twice as much in Italy as
American-made bologna, and Italian producers say that most
Americans have no idea what the real thing tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even try it,'' Rino Brini, 80, a co-founder of the
Alcisa pork factory in Bologna, said of American bologna. ``It
looks so sad.''

   A Setback in North Ireland After Delay in Disarmament  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 weeks after it began, the power-sharing government of
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland came to an end,
aborted by the continuing conflict over the issue of paramilitary
weapons. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said
he acted because the Irish Republican Army refused to give any sign
that it was going to dismantle its arsenal. He expected the
government to return ``on an even firmer footing,'' he said, if the
long-running dispute could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, tried to
deflect blame for the action, saying the breakdown increased the
complications surrounding guerrilla disarmament.

   1990s' Productivity Makes It Best Decade Since 1960s
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s economic expansion, now the longest expansion in the
nation's history, draws its staying power from various wells _ the
two most important being the booming stock market and labor's
rising efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market makes people feel wealthy, encouraging them to
spend. To help satisfy this rising demand, America's workers are
managing to produce more goods and services in each hour of work.
Their rising output keeps the economy growing and plays a big role
in extending the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows just why workers have become more productive
in recent years, or for how long they will continue to grow more
efficient, as they did in the last six months of 1999. The Labor
Department announced last week that productivity, or output per
hour, had risen at an annual rate of 5 percent from June through
December, the best performance in seven years. And the expansion
marches on.

   Hijacking Ends
</P>
<P>
   The four-day hijacking of an Afghan airliner at Stansted Airport
outside of London ended peacefully and with no injuries when the
hijackers surrendered unconditionally on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half the people on the plane, Afghans who had been
on a domestic flight from Kabul when the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727
was seized, asked for political asylum. The Home Office pledged to
decide their cases as soon as possible, with a view toward ejecting
the Afghans from Britain. Twenty-two people were arrested and will
be charged under hijacking and terrorism laws.

   A brutal police corruption scandal that had largely been

other police divisions and that the police have been dragging their

   With more than 40 tainted cases now overturned, the new

   Big Bang Reproduced Small  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the universe is looking less mysterious all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in Geneva announced that they had recreated a bizarre
form of matter that probably filled the entire universe when it was
a mere 10 millionths of a second old and expanding as a fireball.
The scientists, at the CERN particle physics laboratory, succeeded
in getting the reclusive particles called quarks to roam freely for
the first time in an experiment. Quarks are normally locked inside
protons and neutrons and cannot be knocked loose.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement could help scientists understand what ignited
the Big Bang explosion that they believe created the universe in

   Getting a Day in Court
</P>
<P>
   Victims of gay-bashing, wife-beating and other crimes based on
gender or sexual orientation could have an easier time in court if
the Illinois General Assembly approves a bill introduced in the
House of Representatives that would enable them to sue any person,
company or organization responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is modeled on the federal Violence Against Women Act, a
1994 law that enables women to sue their attackers in federal
court. The Illinois law would extend similar protections to crime
victims singled out because of their sexual orientation or gender.
The Supreme Court is now considering a challenge to the federal
law; the main issue is whether jurisdiction for such laws should
lie with the states.

   Adjusted Auction Fees
</P>
<P>
   Faced with class-action lawsuits and a three-year-old antitrust
investigation into possible collusion between Sotheby's and
Christie's, the world's two largest auction houses, Christie's said
it was changing its fees. The English-based house has raised its
buyer's commissions, charging 17.5 percent on the first $80,000 and
10 percent of any amount over that. Since 1993 both Christie's and
its archrival Sotheby's charged buyers 15 percent for the first
$50,000 and 10 percent for everything after that.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may now be pricier to buy at Christie's, the company
is making it cheaper to sell. Previously, sellers paid a fixed
scale ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent. Now it will give
customers who buy a lot of art cheaper rates when they sell.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's is expected follow suit.

   No Untested Pills For Mothers-to-be  &QL;

<P>
   When the Food and Drug Administration recently announced that
dietary supplements could be marketed for morning sickness, experts
in birth defects were outraged. They reminded the agency of how, in
the 1960s, it refused to approve thalidomide, a drug that maimed
thousands of babies whose mothers took it overseas. The arguments
worked; the FDA forbade supplement manufacturers from marketing to
pregnant women until the risks can be studied.

   A high school gay tolerance group in the conservative community
of Orange, Calif., held its first meeting in school Wednesday over
the objections of the school district, which argues that the club
should be banned because its issues of sexuality are inappropriate.
On Thursday, school officials banned noncurricular clubs in
elementary and middle schools.
</P>

   Until the matter is settled in court, a federal court order
enables the students to continue meeting. In the meantime, school
officials are considering new requirements for participation in

   Bah! You have no nerve: you have no brain: you are the

know nothing. God help you, except what you know all wrong:
daylight blinds you: you run after life furtively and run away or
huddle up and scream when it turns and opens its arms to you: you
are a man's disgrace and infatuation, not his crown ``above
rubies'' . . . ((Y))ou are an owl, sickened by two days of my
sunshine: I have treated you far too well. . . . Go then: the
Shavian oxygen burns up your little lungs: seek some stuffiness
that suits you. You will not marry George! At the last moment you
will funk him or be ousted by a bolder soul. You have wounded my
vanity: an inconceivable audacity, an unpardonable crime.

   Farewell, wretch that I loved.

   Oh, my rancor is not yet slaked: I have not said enough vile
things to you. What are you, miserable wretch, that my entrails
should be torn asunder hour after hour? . . . Come round me all the
good friends I have neglected for her. Even her slanderers shall be
welcome: I shall say, ``Spit your venom; heap up your lies; vomit
your malice until the air is poison: you will still fall short of
the truth.'' And to her friends, her dupes, her adorers, I will
say, ``All that you say is true and not half good enough for her;

<P>
   A woman is often a wonderful thing. . . . But in you, as in all

Cleopatra, the tyrannical marble-heartedness of Katherine de
Medici, and the cold glitter of all the passionless despots of
men's warm souls since sex first originated _ since Eve broke the
heart of humanity forever and laughed with sadistic joy at Adam
sweating blood on the rack she made for him. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming the ages of women gone before
you who handed such legacies down, blaming the radiant and
sparkling and fidgety ladies of history who kissed in a moment of
coquetry and saw men die, kings dethroned and nations fight in
blood because of that careless caress. Men are fools, weak,
wine-blooded, deeply-devoted darn fools. What have women done for
them ((that is)) half so intense and potent as what they have done

as Dorothy L. Sayers showed. The mystery novelist as much as called

child with another man: (END ITALICS HERE)

   You can do whatever pleases you, but your letters now sound

when I think I can leave and then cannot leave is thoroughly
inhuman and mechanical. . . . Everything would be all right if you
wrote the right kind of letters. But you write the worst letters,
letters bad enough to estrange anyone. I have never seen more
expressionless, pan-faced letters, in regard to whether I come or

life, and let you alone, etc., rather hurt my feelings. . . . You
are so terrible, so terrifying when you are angry. . . . When you
are like that you freeze something in me.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In his fiction, Ernest Hemingway often
conveyed emotion between the lines. But not in correspondence.
Shortly before marrying Martha Gellhorn, Papa in 1940 drew up a
crow-eating ``contract'' for her to sign, to atone for a recent
separation from him: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I, the undersigned Mrs. Martha, or Mrs. Fathouse Pig . . .
hereby guarantee and promise never to brutalize my present and
future husband in any way whatsoever. . . . I recognize that a very
fine and sensitive writer cannot be left alone 2 months and 16 days
during which time many trying and unlikely things are put upon him
voluntarily and involuntarily, and that I . . . was a great cause
for his uneasiness of mind during this long period of solitude . .
. I am deeply sorry therefore and shall attempt . . . to make up to
him for the wretchedness he has gone through and shall also attempt
to protect him against same wretchedness in the future. This
statement is given of my own free will and in my rightest mind and
with love.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) And the poet Anne Sexton rebuffed the
romantic overtures of Philip Legler by suggesting in 1966 that he
seek professional help: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Phil baby, everyone is wrong here. Your love, your
abundance for me is partly sick. I can tell you this because I am
the healthiest, wisest sickest human you'll meet outside the nut
house (patient or doctor/nurse). The sanest thing in this world is
love. And what is important is honesty. . . . I feel in my heart
that if you concentrate (as you have been doing) on your Anne
Sexton campaign that you'll run off into a tornado. . . . You're
sick. You need help. . . .
</P>
<P>
   First, foremost, Phil, work out your constant need for
affection, closeness with students, or with this poet. . . . Phil,
take the pills and start on the road to growing. . . .

   CAIRO, Egypt _ Perched on the border between Syria and the
Israeli-held Golan Heights is a divided town where relatives take
up a megaphone once a week to shout out news to one another across
the disputed terrain. When the leaders of each country recently
wanted to send a message to one another after the breakdown of
peace talks, they used their own ``shouting valley.'' It is called
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly fighting in Lebanon in the past week _ escalating
from Hezbollah ambushes and rocket attacks to bombs dropped from
Israeli aircraft on electrical generating plants _ is a familiar
manifestation of a peculiarly Middle Eastern form of communication
between governments.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians in Lebanon and northern Israel, of course, pay the
bills, which come in the form of scars from flying glass, ruined
houses, loss of electricity in mid-winter, days and nights spent in
underground shelters, and corpses. They must wonder: wouldn't a
phone call, a poison pen letter or e-mail work as well?
</P>
<P>
   There may be no logical answer to that question. This is the way
Syria and a succession of Israeli prime ministers have messaged
each other for years. Across the battered land of Lebanon they have
set loose their proxies in the militant Hezbollah, a militia whose
supply lines are controlled by Damascus, and in the
Israeli-supported South Lebanon Army, whose mercenaries shield
Israel's northern border. (Responses are not limited to proxies.
That's where Israel's air force comes in.)
</P>
<P>
   But this latest lethal dialogue is not exactly like so many
previous outbreaks of killing in Lebanon. The message from Syria
this time appears aimed directly at the Israeli public and
specifically at those who say they want to hold on to the Golan
Heights even at the cost of a peace treaty. Brutal but clear, it is
a reminder from the Syrian president, Hafez Assad, that Syria
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's bombardment of targets all over Lebanon was equally
clear. It warned Damascus that pushing Israel too far would risk
military humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   It is instructive to examine the sequence of events. In
mid-January, negotiations at Shepherdstown, W.Va., between Syria's
foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, and the Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, ended with no agreement and with sour feelings on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Israelis opposed to a peace treaty that includes
a full return of the Golan Heights to Syria held a mass
demonstration. That protest was broadcast on television sets in
living rooms across Syria and it was presented to Syrians, who are
unfamiliar with the push and pull of interest groups in a
democracy, as a proof that the Israeli government was not really
interested in letting go of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus a few weeks ago, one hard-line government official
expressed this view when he dismissed the notion that Barak may
want to make a deal but can only do so with the support of a
majority of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could also get 100,000 people on the street to protest
against the peace,'' he said, adding with pride that Assad is
confident enough of his position to make peace anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Syrian leadership, there are more sophisticated
people who understand that Barak must take into account Israeli
public opinion. One way to interpret the Hezbollah activity since
the breakdown of Syrian-Israeli peace talks is as a message to
those hesitant Israelis. In essence, it is this: You cannot ignore
Syria if you want security in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's actions have always sent a similar message: Peace is
peace and no peace is no peace. There is no half-way point between
the two that will guarantee a good night's sleep every night to
Israelis living in towns and settlements close to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a given that Israel would respond forcefully to the
Hezbollah attacks that have killed seven of its soldiers over the
last two weeks, as well as the second-in-command of the South
Lebanon Army. Again, that is part of the calculation in this
murderous discourse.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when the tit-for-tat violence reached a certain
intensity, the United States would step in. This served Syrian
officials, who have long preferred to have Washington intimately
involved as a referee and go-between in any dealings with Israel.
The reactions of Syria's government-owned newspapers last week
underlined the point. The solution to the violence in Lebanon, they
maintained, is immediate American intervention.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a roundabout and costly way to get back to
the bargaining table, it is. ``This was an escalation with the
intent to reactivate the peace process,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a
military analyst in Cairo and a former Egyptian diplomat. ``But it
could get out of hand.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ During The Cold War, when Latin American leftists
gravitated toward communism, it was easy for them to identify their
enemies: local military dictators or U.S. corporate imperialists.
They had an economic system to demonize _ capitalism _ and an
alternative _ socialism _ to put in its place. And they had a
playbook, written by Marx and Lenin and Fidel Castro, to guide
their thinking and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But times are different. There still is an activist left in
Latin America, and it still does battle with inequality and poverty
and undemocratic government. But the recent nine-month strike at
Mexico's national university revealed a new kind of leftist
movement, one whose new foe is the global economy. The strike,
which devastated Mexico's most important university and divided its
society, gave a preview of the vexing challenges the new leftists
may pose to the region's young democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The striking students at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico declared that their fundamental purpose was to oppose the
worldwide spread of free trade and the lean government,
pro-business policies that promote it. But the conundrum for their
movement was that the new adversary _ globalism _ was faceless. It
was a product of commerce and technology more than of government or
guns. It was emerging everywhere at once, with no clear alternative
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   If the students were confronting anarchic change, they met it
with an anarchic movement. The strike steering committee took over
the campus, using barbed wire to keep other students out. They
elected no outstanding leaders and took their decisions in chaotic
all-night assemblies. Over the months the university conceded
demand after demand, but the strikers only upped the ante.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers confounded everyone who dealt with them, from
conciliatory university administrators to conservative
intellectuals to lifelong leftists. In the end, after the federal
police marched in on Feb. 6 and hauled the remaining strikers away
to jail, it seemed that the strike had been an end in itself, a
form of complete resistance against social and economic changes
they could never hope to control.
</P>
<P>
   The new leftism probably emerged in Mexico because this country
has led the charge in Latin America into the globalized age. Since
signing on to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico
has seen its international trade explode, its business middle class
rise like a phoenix and the country's northern half become an
industrial export powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the student strikers were also a product of globalization _
of two decades of policies that laid the foundations for Mexico's
recent leap into the global economy. The government has stimulated
growth by restraining inflation, mainly by depressing workers'
wages. Official figures show that the minimum wage today buys 48
percent of what it did in 1982. So, while export enclaves have
thrived, workers elsewhere have been drawn into a spiral of
downward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The national university, with 275,000 students, was once
Mexico's main avenue of social ascent. Today many students graduate
wondering if they will be able to earn a living. Alfonso Zarate, a
political analyst, said the strike revealed how much Mexico has
become ``a nation of winners and losers.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike was not radical at the start. It began last April, as
a protest against a plan to charge tuition _ about $150 a year _
for the first time in decades. The university president, Francisco
Barnes de Castro, cast the plan as an effort to get resources for a
critically underfunded institution. But in today's increasingly
impoverished urban working class, even small tuition costs can
break a family's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The new left gave the students a rationale for rejecting the
plan. It was a vast plot by the business-friendly government to
impose private sector logic on a public university, and deny
working class youth the education they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, a faction of strikers, dubbed ``ultras'' by their
companions because of their intolerance for dissent, gained the
upper hand through nasty purges. A central demand was for
face-to-face negotiations with the university president. But the
movement, once it was in the hands of the ultras, did not really
negotiate. The strikers never moved an inch from their original
demands. Administrators dropped the tuition plan, agreed to direct
talks, agreed even to hold a congress to reform how the whole
university was organized.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikers, true to their anarchist core and lacking
vision of an alternative, continued to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebellion is our only leader, our one true cause and the
reason for everything we do,'' read one banner.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Alvarez, an economics professor, at first supported
the strike but fell out with the ultras. ``They made distrust into
a form of politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the strike divided Mexico, which is in the midst of
a delicate move from authoritarianism to democracy. While the
general public applauded the police action to end the strike, many
intellectuals, journalists and democratic leaders saw it as an
extension of the bloody repression with which the student movement
of 1968 was broken. The result was some of the most vigorous street
protests Mexico has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to education and the division among Mexicans could
serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who thinks the changes that
globalization brings will only reinforce democratic institutions.

   ``A card and some flowers? That's so 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DeBeers magazine advertisement
</P>
<P>
   Feeling extra guilt-tripped this Valentine's Day, big spender?
It's not your imagination. Alan Greenspan may have inflation under
control, but it doesn't look that way in the diamond business _ and
certainly not in those rarefied realms where size of heart is
conspicuously if not touchingly linked to size of wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Poor men with bucks. They don't stand a chance, not with the
world's largest producer of diamonds, DeBeers, spending $60 million
this year just to advertise its rocks, often with ego-taunting
slogans like, ``Give her something that won't wilt in a week.'' Now
that's cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Love has always had its mercenary aspects, but in this booming
economy they have been starkly magnified. On Tuesday, for example,
Fox is airing ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' in which
50 female contestants will be whittled down, beauty pageant style,
to five finalists, all in wedding gowns, one of whom will be
proposed to and married on the air, live, by a willing millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing refracts the current climate like the diamond. Last
week the diamond retailer Mondera kicked off its Web site,
Mondera.com, with a bash at the Havana Club at Top of the Sixes in
New York. There diamond-draped models mingled with Wall Street
brokers, Upper East Side bachelors and James Gandolfini _ TV's Tony
Soprano _ as the guys partook of single-malt scotches, cigars,
straight-razor shaves and shoeshines.
</P>
<P>
   All the pampering and advertising seem to be paying off. ``The
diamond market is up 12 percent,'' said Joan Parker, the director
of the diamond information center at J. Walter Thompson, DeBeers'
advertising agency. Another key indicator _ DeBeers sales of rough
diamonds _ surged 57 percent last year to a record $5.24 billion,
up from $3.35 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The upward trend is not lost on women in certain circles. Take
Anna Rothschild, a 31-year-old Manhattanite just getting divorced
from her second husband. Her first, a stockbroker, gave her a
five-carat, round diamond set in platinum from Harry Winston. Her
second husband gave her a six-carat, emerald-cut diamond with
trilliums on the side. She designed it with him at a private
jeweler (cost: about $75,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' Rothschild said, ``I would have preferred 10
carats.'' But husband No. 2, an English businessman, ``thought that
was vulgar and inappropriate. He wanted a more understated type of
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, Rothschild said, ``I would like at least an
8-carat canary diamond. They are much more rare than just a regular
diamond, and I've tried on my friends' rings and I know it looks
good on my finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See, if you're medium-boned, even four carats can look small
on your body,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, engagement rings of four carats or more are not
uncommon in Upper East Side social circles, and many women echo
Rothschild's view that a smaller diamond might get lost visually on
a woman of any heft. At Tiffany, for example, insiders were
horrified that Jerry Seinfeld only bought a two-carat ring for his
new bride, Jessica Sklar. ``Couldn't he afford more? Really,'' said
one employee, who didn't want to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just about size. It's about cut too. Both the
emerald cut (rectangular) and the once-rare asscher cut are popular
now. The asscher cut yields a very deep stone and is considered
more understated _ as if to say, ``I have more substance than
flash.''.
</P>
<P>
   Muffie Potter-Aston, an executive vice president of Van Cleef &AMP;
Arpels, has an asscher-cut diamond of over 15 carats. She says her
husband, a plastic surgeon, Sherrell Aston, ``loves me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Men are clearly feeling the pressure. Mark Simone, a Manhattan
bachelor and cable television host, said, ``I see guys buy
zillion-dollar rings because it's a big blinking neon sign that
says, `I got a lot of money.''' Most women he knows want rings ``as
big as an ashtray,'' he said. And men deliver. ``The women spend 20
minutes talking about the ring and three minutes talking about how
they met the guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're a poor sap who can only afford, say, a carat?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, I don't meet anyone like that,'' said Rothschild,
who nevertheless feels she must refrain from diamond-wearing for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want men to think I'm married,'' she said. ``How will
I meet my third husband?''

THE DEATH PENALTY: WHEN THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR

<P>
   When Gov. George Ryan of Illinois called last month for a
moratorium on executions in his state, he focused on the fact that
12 men on death row had recently been proven innocent. Sentencing
an innocent person to death was, the governor said, ``shameful,''
but he said little about how the legal representation these inmates
had received at trial may have contributed to justice gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune found, however, that 33 people who were
sentenced to die in Illinois had lawyers who were later disbarred
or suspended, and many more had lawyers with no experience in
capital cases. Death penalty experts say the situation is almost
certainly worse _ though not as well documented - in states where
capital punishment is more routine.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that in many capital cases the means to mount a
good defense, which often costs $250,000 or more, are lacking.
Elisabeth Semel, who runs an American Bar Association project
examining this question, describes the disparity in resources
available to the prosecution and the defense this way: ``It's like
a match between Mike Tyson and Martin Short, and the referee _ the
judge _ is on Tyson's payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, Connecticut and New York have attempted to address
these problems by creating a state funded central office of defense
lawyers who specialize in capital cases. David D. Wymore, chief
deputy public defender in Colorado, said: ``We found years ago that
we had to cultivate this expertise because capital law is very
complex and has all these traps. If you're inexperienced, you'll do
a poor job at trial and you'll fail to preserve your rights on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is a Western state where the death penalty is popular,
yet prosecutors there seek the death penalty infrequently _ about
three times a year, on average _ in part, experts say, because they
believe that the Colorado Office of the Public Defender will defeat
all but the strongest cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colorado office does an excellent job, and that greatly
reduces the chance of miscarriages of justice,'' said Stephen B.
Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta
and a professor at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous system for representing capital defendants not only
means fewer wrong verdicts, it also means fewer death sentences.
Experienced death penalty lawyers are adept at dissuading
prosecutors from seeking capital punishment, and juries from
applying it. In 52 capital trials in Colorado since 1975, five
people have been sentenced to death, and only one has been
executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason alone, few states will adopt this kind of
system,'' said Franklin E. Zimring, law professor and director of
the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``There is a great desire to have assembly-line
executions.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, like Colorado, has a capital defense team within
its public defender office, which is under contract to the state to
provide legal counsel to indigent defendants. As in most
Northeastern states, prosecutors seek the death penalty only
rarely. Still, in the 27 years since Connecticut reinstated capital
punishment, no one has been executed.
</P>
<P>
   New York's death penalty law, enacted in 1995, also created the
Capital Defender Office, rated by experts as the gold standard of
its kind. The office has a $15 million budget, provided by the
state. Its 21 trial lawyers and 17 investigators all receive
intensive training, and many have worked on capital cases in other
states. The Capital Defender Office joins a case as soon as a
defendant is charged with first-degree murder. Since 1995, there
have been 524 cases in which prosecutors either charged first
degree murder or went to court leaving open the possibility of that
charge. The Capital Defenders Office participated in the defense in
these cases as long as there was a possibility of a sentence of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, prosecutors have sought the death penalty in 39
cases, winning it five times. The first execution is years away, as
all the cases are under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doyle, New York's Capital Defender, says his office has
``a cultural advantage,'' in that New Yorkers are not as
enthusiastic about the death penalty as people in the South and
West. ``There's a moral ecology that says we're not just going to
pay lip service to constitutional rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are states like Texas, Alabama and Georgia, where the
death penalty is frequently imposed, and there is no public
defender system at all. Instead, judges appoint lawyers for poor
defendants and set their compensation, often at low rates. Even
states like Illinois appoint lawyers this way when the caseload is
too large for the public defender offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a culture of habitually appointing courthouse
hangers-on,'' said David I. Bruck, a defense lawyer in South
Carolina who helps train lawyers in handling death penalty cases.
``They don't know capital law, they're cozy with the judges and
they're underpaid. It's not a good situation.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a photograph washed in sepia tones that lend
its scene _ the 1930 lynching of Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith and an
approving white mob _ an otherworldliness. Perhaps it was my father
who first showed it to me. Yet, growing up black in Kentucky, with
its not-so-distant past of lynching and other violent expressions
of racism, I knew that this picture depicted a hatred that was
embedded in my country. This lynching occurred in Marion, Ind., 24
years before I was born, but that gave me little comfort as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   I recently visited the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York City to
gaze again at that photograph, and 59 other images of lethal
brutality meted out to blacks by the vigilante's noose. For weeks,
thousands of visitors have crowded in for a glimpse of a dimly lit
chapter of American history.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, titled ``Witness,'' documents lynchings from
1883 through 1960 mostly with picture postcards from the collection
of James E. Allen and John Littlefield. Originally scheduled to
close Feb. 12, the show will move to larger quarters at the
New-York Historical Society in March.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Witness'' has dramatically renewed awareness of a
rite almost exclusively reserved for blacks, it only hints at why
lynching still haunts America's collective psyche. Although the
physical act has all but disappeared in this country, lynching
continues to be used as a stinging metaphor for profound injustice.
It represents, as Harlem-based author Albert Murray calls it,
``American terrorism'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At his troubled confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court,
Clarence Thomas effectively silenced his critics in the Senate,
accusing them of leading a ``high-tech lynching'' to derail his
nomination. The Ramsey family, white and wealthy, invoked the
L-word last fall to describe, perhaps too glibly, the unwanted
media attention since the unsolved murder of JonBenet Ramsey as a
``public lynching.'' Last December, when the New York City Board of
Education voted against extending Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's
contract, he stayed home because ``he prefers to be lynched in
absentia,'' his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lynch law, which owes its name to Charles Lynch, a Virginia
farmer who administered a rough justice to outlaws and Tories
during the Revolution, is a contradiction in a country grounded in
laws and rights. Unlike other outward spasms of racial, ethnic or
religious violence, the lynching of black people was not an
isolated incident to be blamed on an individual or a political
group. It was part of a culture in which those who upheld the law
looked the other way or, in many instances, participated.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of lynching brings Americans face to face with ``our
problematic history with due process and the rule of law,'' said
William Kornblum, sociologist at the City University of New York's
graduate school, ``Even today we can't face part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The faces of white men, women and children gathered at these
scenes express a certain satisfaction. What is more chilling is the
unmistakable air of celebration, evil posed as righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   And the white mobs did not stop at merely murdering their
victims. They often tortured and mutilated them, occasionally
burning them (``this is the barbecue we had last night,'' one
witness wrote). The victims, carrion left hanging from trees as a
warning, some castrated, were officially less than human. On the
other hand, the frontier hangings of white victims rarely included
castration or mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is one of atrocity,'' said Murray, who was born
near Mobile, Ala., in 1916. He cautioned blacks to be careful not
to get entangled in the act's accompanying messages of
powerlessness and victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up terrified of lynching,'' he said. ``I have no
scars from it that I know about. While I was growing up, I was
thinking about how to conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Cameron, an 85-year-old writer and retired building
engineer in Milwaukee, Wis., disagrees. ``It is a part of history
that should be told,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was almost part of the Horowitz exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   He, Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith, the two young men in that
photograph from my youth, were arrested for the robbery and murder
of a white man and the rape of a white woman in Marion. Whites
stormed the jail to lynch them. Cameron was beaten but released
when someone in the crowd vouched for his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that such a thing could happen,'' Cameron said.
``I was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1882 to 1968, the Census Bureau counted the lynchings of
4,742 blacks. Historical references often include the victims'
alleged crimes, from rape to murder. But records also show blacks
hanged for little more than suspicion. In the act of lynching,
white women won respect, black men were emasculated and white men
made themselves omnipotent.
</P>
<P>
   The institution of lynching influenced men as dissimilar as
W.E.B. Du Bois, one of America's foremost equal rights activists,
and Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Sam Hose, a black farmer, killed a white man in an
argument over a debt. He was summarily hanged and then burned. Du
Bois, teaching at Atlanta University, was taking a letter of
protest to The Atlanta Constitution when he passed a downtown shop
window. In it was a trophy: the charred knuckles of Sam Hose. Du
Bois later helped found the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking with
the strategy of accommodation and demanding immediate rights for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in 1903, Elijah Muhammad was traumatized when a neatly
dressed white man approached him on the street, opened his palm and
showed him the ear of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   I knew these stories as a child. My father insisted that I
understand that such cruelties formed part of African-American
history. They were cautionary tales all too true, he would say.
</P>
<P>
   As I eagerly started out for my first newspaper job more than 20
years ago, I drove to a quiet and friendly town in northern
Indiana. Once settled in my apartment, I called a cousin who was
finishing college at an Indiana university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you tell me?'' I asked him about my new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said after a long pause, ``Marion is one of the
last places there was a public lynching of black folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a sudden confluence of memory and image. I drove to
the courthouse to remember how and where white justice was meted
out to two young black men and I wept. Most whites prefer to forget
lynching, seeing it as peculiar to another place and time. But most
blacks will continue to remember this ritual, in reality and
metaphor, until their own collective sense of vulnerability fades.

lynching still haunts America's collective psyche. Although the
physical act has all but disappeared in this country, lynching
continues to be used as a stinging metaphor for profound injustice.
It represents, as Harlem-based author Albert Murray calls it,
``American terrorism'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At his troubled confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court,
Clarence Thomas effectively silenced his critics in the Senate,
accusing them of leading a ``high-tech lynching'' to derail his
nomination. The Ramsey family, white and wealthy, invoked the
L-word last fall to describe, perhaps too glibly, the unwanted
media attention since the unsolved murder of JonBenet Ramsey as a
``public lynching.'' Last December, when the New York City Board of
Education voted against extending Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's
contract, he stayed home because ``he prefers to be lynched in
absentia,'' his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lynch law, which owes its name to Charles Lynch, a Virginia
farmer who administered a rough justice to outlaws and Tories
during the Revolution, is a contradiction in a country grounded in
laws and rights. Unlike other outward spasms of racial, ethnic or
religious violence, the lynching of black people was not an
isolated incident to be blamed on an individual or a political
group. It was part of a culture in which those who upheld the law
looked the other way or, in many instances, participated.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of lynching brings Americans face to face with ``our
problematic history with due process and the rule of law,'' said
William Kornblum, sociologist at the City University of New York's
graduate school, ``Even today we can't face part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The faces of white men, women and children gathered at these
scenes express a certain satisfaction. What is more chilling is the
unmistakable air of celebration, evil posed as righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   And the white mobs did not stop at merely murdering their
victims. They often tortured and mutilated them, occasionally
burning them (``this is the barbecue we had last night,'' one
witness wrote). The victims, carrion left hanging from trees as a
warning, some castrated, were officially less than human. On the
other hand, the frontier hangings of white victims rarely included
castration or mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is one of atrocity,'' said Murray, who was born
near Mobile, Ala., in 1916. He cautioned blacks to be careful not
to get entangled in the act's accompanying messages of
powerlessness and victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up terrified of lynching,'' he said. ``I have no
scars from it that I know about. While I was growing up, I was
thinking about how to conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Cameron, an 85-year-old writer and retired building
engineer in Milwaukee, Wis., disagrees. ``It is a part of history
that should be told,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was almost part of the Horowitz exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   He, Tommy Shipp and Abe Smith, the two young men in that
photograph from my youth, were arrested for the robbery and murder
of a white man and the rape of a white woman in Marion. Whites
stormed the jail to lynch them. Cameron was beaten but released
when someone in the crowd vouched for his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that such a thing could happen,'' Cameron said.
``I was ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1882 to 1968, the Census Bureau counted the lynchings of
4,742 blacks. Historical references often include the victims'
alleged crimes, from rape to murder. But records also show blacks
hanged for little more than suspicion. In the act of lynching,
white women won respect, black men were emasculated and white men
made themselves omnipotent.
</P>
<P>
   The institution of lynching influenced men as dissimilar as
W.E.B. Du Bois, one of America's foremost equal rights activists,
and Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Sam Hose, a black farmer, killed a white man in an
argument over a debt. He was summarily hanged and then burned. Du
Bois, teaching at Atlanta University, was taking a letter of
protest to The Atlanta Constitution when he passed a downtown shop
window. In it was a trophy: the charred knuckles of Sam Hose. Du
Bois later helped found the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking with
the strategy of accommodation and demanding immediate rights for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in 1903, Elijah Muhammad was traumatized when a neatly
dressed white man approached him on the street, opened his palm and
showed him the ear of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   I knew these stories as a child. My father insisted that I
understand that such cruelties formed part of African-American
history. They were cautionary tales all too true, he would say.
</P>
<P>
   As I eagerly started out for my first newspaper job more than 20
years ago, I drove to a quiet and friendly town in northern
Indiana. Once settled in my apartment, I called a cousin who was
finishing college at an Indiana university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you tell me?'' I asked him about my new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said after a long pause, ``Marion is one of the
last places there was a public lynching of black folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a sudden confluence of memory and image. I drove to
the courthouse to remember how and where white justice was meted
out to two young black men and I wept. Most whites prefer to forget
lynching, seeing it as peculiar to another place and time. But most
blacks will continue to remember this ritual, in reality and
metaphor, until their own collective sense of vulnerability fades.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Feb. 13:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-GOVTS-LOBBY (Washington) _ Some countries, such as
Israel, Greece and Taiwan, have always had a strong presence in the
parlors of policy-making in the capital. But the depth and breadth
of lobbying by individual countries has grown in recent years, and
foreign governments are now paying out tens of thousands of dollars
a month. By Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-MILITARY (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Perhaps the most
telling insult to Indonesia's armed forces, people here say, is
that mothers no longer encourage their daughters to marry a
military man. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-SHIELD-ANXIETY (Washington) _ European allies have
expressed increasing concerns about the Clinton administration's
plans to negotiate with Russia to allow deployment of a missile
shield, and about how much the Europeans are being consulted in the
matter. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-U.N. (United Nations) _ African governments, unable to
bring about a cease-fire in the widening war in eastern Congo, want
the United Nations to take on the job of disarming combatants,
diplomats from the region say. They also want a peacekeeping force
much larger than the 5,537-member mission now being proposed in an
American-sponsored Security Council resolution. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-ETHNIC-WAR (Bunia, Congo) _ Another ethnic war is erupting
in central Africa, this time a tribal conflict in Congo fought
mostly with machetes and barbed arrows that nurses in a hospital
near here collect in a little white box. Some of the barbs are
still covered with blood and flesh. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-KAMEI (Tokyo) _ By midday, the visitors were spilling out
of the waiting room and into the corridor outside the office of
Shizuka Kamei, the longtime machine politician who has suddenly
become one of this country's most powerful and solicited figures.
By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ A frantic week of talks
and ultimatums and deadlines that fed the grim conviction that
Northern Ireland was discarding a promising chance to escape its
rancorous past ended Saturday on a surprisingly benign and
forward-looking note. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SPRAWL (Santa Clarita, Calif.) _ This is the future home
of Newhall Ranch, the largest housing development ever approved by
Los Angeles County, with 21,600 units for 70,000 people to be built
over the next 20 years. To its critics, Newhall Ranch is a symbol
of all that is wrong with California's decades of
catch-as-catch-can development. But big as it may be, Newhall Ranch
is nothing compared with the projected need for new housing in Los
Angeles County: about 25,000 units a year, according to the
Southern California Association of Governments. By 2025, the
state's population of 34 million is projected to grow by 18 million
more (a whole New York state) and that of the Los Angeles region by
6 million (or two Chicagos). By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-IRS (Undated) _ Warning that continuing cuts at the
Internal Revenue Service threaten the nation's tax system, the
Clinton administration is proposing more money to find cheaters and
make them pay up. And the agency's top official has begun
emphasizing that getting tough with cheaters is as important as
helping honest taxpayers. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   WEB-SECURITY (Undated) _ The consternation over the assaults
that hobbled popular Web sites underscored how heavily both
businesses and consumers had come to rely on the Internet for
everything from paying bills to planning vacations. But as Internet
executives beef up security and public attention turns to the FBI
pursuit of the culprits, some network experts _ and at least a few
lay Internet users _ contend that last week's electronic attacks
should sound an alarm. As Internet entrepreneurs and investors
entice people to put more of their personal, political, financial
and even medical lives online, those who counsel caution see need
for a more gradual pace. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ALASKA-AIRLINES-REPAIRS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Whatever brought
down Alaska Airlines Flight 261 is only half of the airline's
problem. The other half is in the files of the airline's
maintenance hangar here, where workers and supervisors sign their
initials to thousands of work orders. In at least a few cases,
according to the Federal Aviation Administration, they may have
signed papers approving work that was not completed. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-DEBATE (Jacksonville, Fla.) _ The Clinton
administration and corporate America have a great deal riding on
whether Congress decides to give up its annual review of China's
trading rights. In a landmark agreement last year paving the way
for China to join the World Trade Organization, the Clinton
administration promised that China would be guaranteed the same
low-tariff access to the U.S. market that most countries have. But
Congress has the final say. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SEA-TURTLES (South Padre Island, Texas) _ Despite
stepped-up efforts to protect them, sea turtles keep washing up on
Texas beaches, and environmentalists are calling for new limits on
the state's $600 million-a-year shrimping industry that they
believe will solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   WEST-POLITICS (Denver) _ Huge regional issues in what is loosely
defined as the Interior West _ eight states that account for nearly
a quarter of the country's land mass but only 40 of its 538
electoral votes _ have been all but ignored this year because of
the marginal role these states play in the nomination process.
Virtually nothing is heard from the stump about land management,
water rights, nuclear waste cleanup or endangered species. By
Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-FCC (Washington) _ Buried in the two-foot stack of more
than 500 letters from Sen. John McCain to federal agencies released
by his office several weeks ago is a strongly worded appeal to the
Federal Communications Commission written in McCain's very first
week as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The letter,
dated Jan. 9, 1997, all but demanded that the commission take no
action on 200 contested radio licenses pending before the panel. By
John M. Broder and Don Van Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Keyes hangs on; Brouhaha over Bush
visit; In-fighting in GOP. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-GUIDELINES (Washington) _ A special House panel,
unusually united across party lines, criticized the Energy
Department on Friday, saying it did not follow congressional
guidance in creating an agency to oversee nuclear weapons programs.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the nearly two years since Indonesia's
strongman, Suharto, stepped down in May 1998, it is the press that
has been the most free, and the most tumultuous, of Indonesia's
institutions. It has been the fundamental underpinning for the
continuing move toward a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways today it is also a victim, not just a
protagonist, in the liberation _ and disorder _ it has helped
unleash.
</P>
<P>
   Its condition reveals a lot about the chaotic freedoms of the
new Indonesia, where the harsh hand of the dictator has often given
way to the unpredictable passions of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   In many arenas the rules that governed, and often stifled, the
nation have been eased or removed or simply ignored. As a result _
as in many newly liberated nations _ Indonesia's road from
repression to democracy is wild and uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the focus of change is on the military, with
President Abdurrahman Wahid returning Sunday from a foreign trip to
confront his most prominent general, Wiranto, who has so far
refused the president's demand to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The general, accused of human rights abuses, represents the old
guard that, under Suharto, saw itself as standard bearer and
enforcer of a top-down regime known for corruption, repression, and
the silencing of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto's fall, the military has been retreating under the
pressure of a popular demand for civilian rule. But its new
weakness in the eyes of society comes with a social cost: It has
contributed to the uncertainties and instabilities the nation
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the present moment,'' said Susanto Pudjosumatono, chief
editor of the daily Jakarta Post, ``who cares about the law? Street
justice is the order of the day. Mobs deal with thieves and
burglars. Police are caught red-handed as burglars. Villagers loot
estates. Communal conflicts are flaring. People resort to violence
to settle disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the arena in which the press now operates.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of the fear of arrest or the closure of their newspapers,
editors no longer censor themselves to please authorities. But
self-censorship is alive among editors of newspapers both big and
small. It is the mob they fear.
</P>
<P>
   When Christian churches were burned on the island of Lombok
recently, one newspaper, sidestepping the religious conflict,
declined to identify them, calling them blandly ``houses of
worship.''
</P>
<P>
   When mobs demonstrated in the eastern Indonesian city of
Ujungpandang late last year, local editors said they refrained from
revealing the instigators for fear that the mobs would turn on them
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Javanese city of Solo, the most devastated city
in the huge riots of early 1998, armed thugs have threatened
reporters in their newsroom. Even in the capital, Jakarta, not long
ago, a mob protested outside the offices of Tempo, the nation's
leading magazine, vandalizing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Clear and professional reporting can be the most difficult in
the places where it is most needed, places like Ambon and Aceh
where separatist or communal conflicts threaten to touch off a
nationwide backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Bambang Harimukti, the editor of Tempo, said that to assure that
his reports are complete and unbiased he must consider sending in
non-local staff members who leave the area as soon as their
reporting is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the authorities wielding their power who are the
biggest threat anymore,'' Susanto said. ``Now the clear and present
danger comes from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In this unstable arena, the press has played a crucial role in
keeping the country's political and social evolution more or less
on course. As an independent institution, its reforms came quickly,
leading the way into a new atmosphere of openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the changes we've seen, the press is perhaps
Indonesia's most transformed institution,'' said Warief Djajanto,
an executive at the Indonesian news agency, Antara.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 18 months after Suharto stepped down, 1,500 press
licenses were issued by the liberal-minded new minister of
information, Yunus Yosfiah.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under a new press law passed last fall, the requirement
for licenses was abolished. Nobody knows now how many newspapers
and radio stations have joined the babble around the nation, but
they have contributed to a brand new sense that anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the newspapers offer serious political reporting and
analysis, investigations of corruption and military abuses,
high-stakes policy debates and fundamental explorations of new
directions for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many new outlets, the country suffers from a
crippling shortage of trained journalists and much of what is
printed and aired lacks fundamental elements of accuracy and
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   With so few resources, some small newspapers do not even pay
their reporters. They simply issue them press cards and leave them
to seek whatever fees and payoffs they can earn from their sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we organize training for young reporters, many lack
professionalism both in journalistic competence and in ethical
competence,'' Susanto said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono, in a recent interview,
complained of widespread tabloid journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a vigorous press but it is often a vigorous and
irresponsible press,'' he said. ``A lot of hopes have been placed
in the press but I don't think these hopes have been fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those hopes were too high at this early stage. Without
the free press, flawed as it is, Indonesia might have made far less
progress than it has.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto was president, just about every institution in
Indonesia had one thing in common: from the courts to the
bureaucracy to the military to the press, they were tailored to
serve his interests.
</P>
<P>
   When he departed, he left intact a venal and self-serving
legislature, a power-hungry military and a thoroughgoing culture of
corruption that, without the pressure of an overwhelming popular
will, might well have reverted to their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   They never had a chance. Suddenly, political talk shows filled
the airwaves, an unfiltered puree of wisdom and nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But at their heart was a powerful momentum for change.

   Bambang Harimukti, the editor of Tempo, said that to assure that
his reports are complete and unbiased he must consider sending in
non-local staff members who leave the area as soon as their
reporting is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the authorities wielding their power who are the
biggest threat anymore,'' Susanto said. ``Now the clear and present
danger comes from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In this unstable arena, the press has played a crucial role in
keeping the country's political and social evolution more or less
on course. As an independent institution, its reforms came quickly,
leading the way into a new atmosphere of openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the changes we've seen, the press is perhaps
Indonesia's most transformed institution,'' said Warief Djajanto,
an executive at the Indonesian news agency, Antara.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 18 months after Suharto stepped down, 1,500 press
licenses were issued by the liberal-minded new minister of
information, Yunus Yosfiah.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under a new press law passed last fall, the requirement
for licenses was abolished. Nobody knows now how many newspapers
and radio stations have joined the babble around the nation, but
they have contributed to a brand new sense that anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the newspapers offer serious political reporting and
analysis, investigations of corruption and military abuses,
high-stakes policy debates and fundamental explorations of new
directions for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many new outlets, the country suffers from a
crippling shortage of trained journalists and much of what is
printed and aired lacks fundamental elements of accuracy and
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   With so few resources, some small newspapers do not even pay
their reporters. They simply issue them press cards and leave them
to seek whatever fees and payoffs they can earn from their sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we organize training for young reporters, many lack
professionalism both in journalistic competence and in ethical
competence,'' Susanto said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono, in a recent interview,
complained of widespread tabloid journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a vigorous press but it is often a vigorous and
irresponsible press,'' he said. ``A lot of hopes have been placed
in the press but I don't think these hopes have been fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those hopes were too high at this early stage. Without
the free press, flawed as it is, Indonesia might have made far less
progress than it has.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto was president, just about every institution in
Indonesia had one thing in common: from the courts to the
bureaucracy to the military to the press, they were tailored to
serve his interests.
</P>
<P>
   When he departed, he left intact a venal and self-serving
legislature, a power-hungry military and a thoroughgoing culture of
corruption that, without the pressure of an overwhelming popular
will, might well have reverted to their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   They never had a chance. Suddenly, political talk shows filled
the airwaves, an unfiltered puree of wisdom and nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But at their heart was a powerful momentum for change.

   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain hosted a landmark fund-raising
event the other night. There were no buffet tables or stump
speeches or grip-and-grin photographs. Instead, McCain held a
question-and-answer session beamed live over the World Wide Web. It
was believed to be the first ``cyber-fund-raiser'' in American
political history.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sat in a makeshift television studio on a college campus
in Charleston, S.C., while his moving image was transmitted by
satellite to a computer server in Seattle. From there, the
60-minute web-cast appeared on the computer screens of 500
``chat-room'' guests, each of whom paid $100 for the privilege of
zapping e-mail questions back to the candidate. The event added
$50,000 to the $2.7 million that McCain's campaign has raised on
the Internet since his resounding 19-point victory in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it has revolutionized many aspects of contemporary life,
the Internet has now demonstrated that it may be poised to rewrite
the battle-tested rules of modern presidential politics. Political
analysts and strategists have long argued that the enormous
advantages enjoyed by big-money establishment candidates could be
counteracted if an insurgent candidate harnessed the Internet's
power to communicate interactively with voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may prove them right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain ends up winning, it won't be because of the
Internet,'' said Trevor Potter, the general counsel of the McCain
campaign and a former member of the Federal Election Commission.
``But you will be able to say that it might not have happened
without the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, candidates struggled to translate the seismic
upheaval of an upset primary victory into an avalanche of money. In
the past, surprise New Hampshire winners _ Pat Buchanan in 1996 and
Gary Hart in 1984 _ failed to do this, but their victories predated
the e-commerce revolution. Back then, it took weeks for a campaign
to solicit checks, deposit them and wait for them to clear. Now, a
Web site does that at lightning speed and at almost no cost.
Similarly, campaign organizations no longer have to canvass
door-to-door to find supporters. Now, supporters can find the
campaigns themselves, with a few mouse clicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five years ago, people excited about a resurgent
candidate would have written letters,'' said David Rohde, a
professor of political science at Michigan State University. ``Ten
years ago, they would have called on the telephone in search of a
campaign headquarters. Now they can go on the Net and find a Web
site and in a few moments make a contribution or volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 people have volunteered to help McCain's campaign
through his Web site, 37,000 of them since the first primary.
``What's really interesting about this is an enormous amount of
activity is simultaneously being initiated by thousands of people
around the country,'' Rohde said. ``The people are initiating the
contact. Usually, it is the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   This success is due largely to McCain himself. Aides say he
recognized the Internet's potential in 1998 and, early on, he hired
some twenty-something Webmasters to design a ``user-friendly'' Web
site geared primarily toward attracting money and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which McCain has raised his money is not lost on
Republican fund-raisers.One of them, Ted Welch, said somewhat
wistfully last week: ``It's an amazing thing. You don't have to go
get the money. The money comes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas enlisted 200
``Pioneers'' to each raise $100,000, and they did it the
old-fashioned way: calling friends, writing letters and gathering
checks with a lot of zeroes. It still works, of course; Bush has
raised a record-shattering $70 million thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people began flocking to McCain's Web site
(www.mccain2000.com) at 7 p.m. on Feb. 1, the night of the New
Hampshire primary, just after the networks announced his crushing
victory over Governor Bush. The cash, given by credit card,
cascaded in at a rate of $20,000-an-hour..
</P>
<P>
   ``We always looked at this as a David and Goliath thing,'' said
Max Fose, the Internet manager for the McCain campaign. ``John
McCain is David, the Internet is our sling shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey who
built the foundation for McCain's success. In March 1998, Bradley's
campaign asked the Federal Election Commission for permission to
count credit card contributions to the campaign's Web site toward
presidential matching funds. ``At a time of concern over citizen
disengagement from the political process, the commission has the
opportunity to encourage citizen participation, reduce the
influence of large contributions and restore confidence in
democracy,'' Bradley's lawyers wrote the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission allowed credit card contributions to be matched
by the federal government, which means that McCain's $2.7 million
will earn him an additional $1.4 million. Bradley's argument
appears to be correct. Thirty-nine percent of those who have
contributed to McCain over the Internet had never given to a
candidate before, and 70 percent had only contributed once. Nearly
half of his e-supporters are under 40.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts warn that candidates attempting to copy
McCain's success will have to do more than build a snazzy Web site
or host chat sessions. After all, McCain is perceived by many of
his supporters as an honest maverick, which nicely matches the way
many Web users regard themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much we can generalize about Internet fund
raising in the future from this single experience,'' Rohde said.
``I think the Internet phenomenon is mixed up with the McCain
phenomenon.''

   The Internet got some really bad news last week, so naturally it
was really good news too. Sure, cyber-hackers paralyzed a number of
powerhouse Web sites, including Amazon.com, Yahoo and eBay. But now
Internet security consultants find themselves doing a land-office
business.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with the new economy. Of the thousands of dot-com
companies now in existence, the number to have actually turned a
profit can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Yet there's
plenty of money being made by everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Like in TV: Internet companies accounted for nearly half the
advertisers on this year's Super Bowl broadcast, which commanded a
record $2.2 million on average for each 30-second spot. Before that
the Y2K troubleshooting industry cleaned up. And of course,
inflated stock prices have created billions in new private assets,
which in turn have emptied luxury-car showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow the industry say the paradox of capital flowing
every which way but into the black for the dot-coms isn't all that
surprising. After all, money has to go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reminded of a famous passage from John Maynard Keynes'
`General Theory,''' said James Fallows, a columnist for the
Industry Standard, a weekly Internet-business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where he talks about how paying people to dig holes in
the ground, and fill them up, could actually make sense, because of
the virtue of getting all that money into circulation,'' he said
via e-mail. ``In a sense, this is a newly elegant flip on
Keynesianism: Pay people to start companies that never make money,
but that spreads a lot of money around to others in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't necessarily a permanent state of affairs, say
others. ``It's temporary,'' said Professor Donna L. Hoffman, the
co-director of the Electronic Commerce Research Laboratory at
Vanderbilt University. She noted that for now, much of the money is
going into infrastructure, including the development of Web sites;
it's going to businesses serving other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where people are making the money,'' she said. ``The
Internet is indeed profitable, but it's starting in the center and
moving outward.'' Eventually profits will be made in
business-to-consumer transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the present state of the new economy is
illustrated by the boom in security consulting sparked by last
week's cyber-sabotage. ``The first thing I thought when I heard the
news was, `I have to buy stock in security companies.''' Hoffman
said. ``The only question was, which one?''

   WASHINGTON _ Pity the poor presidential campaign strategists.
With make-or-break primaries fast approaching, they're frantically
trying to cobble together winning strategies to appeal to an
electorate so diverse, cacophonous and in flux as to make the folks
trying to build the Tower of Babel sound like a harmonious glee
club. With no big issue like war, recession or incumbency to give
the 2000 race some shape, America looks more than ever like an
indistinct montage of contending groups _ some new, some old
standbys.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there are hero-admiring dads to take into
consideration along with angry white males, single moms along with
soccer moms. There are seniors whose politics are shifting ever
rightward and _ perhaps most important _ a growing number of
independents who, as their name suggests, are hardly a monolith.
Cutting across everything is a schizophrenic view of President
Clinton, who is both loved and loathed at the same time _ sometimes
by the same people.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche marketer's dream, and a pundit's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on out there,'' said David Axelrod, a
Democratic political consultant in Chicago. ``There is no one thing
that was driving everything as there was in '92 or '80 or '84.
There are times when single issues overwhelm everything else. This
isn't one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the key electoral demographics is a tricky
business, but here goes anyway:
</P>
<P>
   THE GUY'S GUY. In some ways, the last few years have been tough
for white guys. Sure, they're making money, either through overtime
at the auto plant or overdrive in the stock market. They've got
SUVs and IPOs. But in the political arena, they've had nobody to
look up to. Four years ago, the thought of a Colin Powell candidacy
made many weak in the knees. But he took a hike on them. Now
they've suddenly got two straight-talking heroes _ John McCain and
Bill Bradley _ from the realms of war and sport.

<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the Los Angeles Times during the New
Hampshire primary illustrate what could be the makings of a gender
gap involving both McCain and Bradley. According to the polls, 50
percent of men voting in the Republican primary backed McCain while
only 29 percent went for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among men
voting Democratic, Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore among men by
about four points (while he trailed Gore by five points among
women).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all those guilty male boomers who didn't go to Nam,'' Lou
DiNatali, a senior fellow with the John W. McCormack Institute, a
Boston-based research organization, said of McCain's appeal to men.
``First, they went with Clinton, the anti-war guy. Now they go for
the POW.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gender gap has helped McCain more than Bradley.
That's because so many more men vote in Republican primaries than
in Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain win the Republican nomination, his male-based
appeal will probably widen the already cavernous gender gap between
the Republicans and Democrats, since Gore draws much of his
strength from women. That situation might favor the Democrat, since
there were 7 million more eligible female voters than eligible male
voters in 1998. And women tend to register and vote in higher
proportions than men.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENTS' DAY. In the New Hampshire primary, unaffiliated
voters helped power McCain to a 19-point victory over Bush, and
kept Bradley close enough to Gore to remain in the race. The
independents' role there has stirred interest in how much of a
force they will be in other primaries and the general election.
After all, they make up about 13 percent of the electorate
nationally, 25 percent in the Rocky Mountain states and 34 percent
of registered voters in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But the independents are hardly a bloc. There are so-called
``prosperity independents,'' affluent, generally white,
college-educated, Internet-savvy, stock-buying voters who tend to
be pro-environment and socially liberal yet fiscally conservative.
They were a hefty slice of McCain's support in New Hampshire, but
in national polls they also tend to like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also roped in his share of independents in New Hampshire
as well. But his independents, while also well educated, tended to
be less affluent, earning less than $50,000 annually, according to
polls conducted by RKM Researchers Inc. of Portsmouth, N.H. These
voters tend to be more liberal when it comes to government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third large group of independents: people who aren't
particularly interested in politics. More than 7.1 million people
were added to the voter rolls in 1997 and 1998, as a result of the
so-called ``motor voter'' law, which made it possible to register
to vote when renewing a driver's license, applying for welfare and
conducting business with other government agencies. Many of these
new voters have registered as independents. Who these disaffected
voters will vote for _ if they vote at all _ is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   BIFURCATED BLACKS. The black vote, as always, will be critical
for Democrats. But while 55 percent of blacks live in the South,
they tend to turn out in lower proportions than Northern blacks,
who tend to be more affluent and better educated and are less
likely to live in hard-to-organize rural areas. Indeed, except for
1992, Northern blacks have voted in higher proportions than
Southern blacks in every presidential election since the Voting
Rights Act was passed in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Some political strategists say that unless this changes, the
black vote may be more of a factor in closely fought states in the
industrial Midwest like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio than in Deep
South states like Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, where
Republicans have had a lock.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIANT SLEEPS TONIGHT. For years, Hispanics have been
described as the sleeping giant of U.S. politics, and George W.
Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet
when it comes to presidential races, there are no signs this giant
is stirring or that Hispanics will have much of an impact on the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population.
But half of that group is concentrated in two states _ California
and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic
vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that
vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly
different result this year.

   WASHINGTON _ Pity the poor presidential campaign strategists.
With make-or-break primaries fast approaching, they're frantically
trying to cobble together winning strategies to appeal to an
electorate so diverse, cacophonous and in flux as to make the folks
trying to build the Tower of Babel sound like a harmonious glee
club. With no big issue like war, recession or incumbency to give
the 2000 race some shape, America looks more than ever like an
indistinct montage of contending groups _ some new, some old
standbys.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there are hero-admiring dads to take into
consideration along with angry white males, single moms along with
soccer moms. There are seniors whose politics are shifting ever
rightward and _ perhaps most important _ a growing number of
independents who, as their name suggests, are hardly a monolith.
Cutting across everything is a schizophrenic view of President
Clinton, who is both loved and loathed at the same time _ sometimes
by the same people.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche marketer's dream, and a pundit's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on out there,'' said David Axelrod, a
Democratic political consultant in Chicago. ``There is no one thing
that was driving everything as there was in '92 or '80 or '84.
There are times when single issues overwhelm everything else. This
isn't one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the key electoral demographics is a tricky
business, but here goes anyway:
</P>
<P>
   THE GUY'S GUY. In some ways, the last few years have been tough
for white guys. Sure, they're making money, either through overtime
at the auto plant or overdrive in the stock market. They've got
SUVs and IPOs. But in the political arena, they've had nobody to
look up to. Four years ago, the thought of a Colin Powell candidacy
made many weak in the knees. But he took a hike on them. Now
they've suddenly got two straight-talking heroes _ John McCain and
Bill Bradley _ from the realms of war and sport.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the Los Angeles Times during the New
Hampshire primary illustrate what could be the makings of a gender
gap involving both McCain and Bradley. According to the polls, 50
percent of men voting in the Republican primary backed McCain while
only 29 percent went for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among men
voting Democratic, Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore among men by
about four points (while he trailed Gore by five points among
women).

   ``It's all those guilty male boomers who didn't go to Nam,'' Lou
DiNatali, a senior fellow with the John W. McCormack Institute, a

``First, they went with Clinton, the anti-war guy. Now they go for
the POW.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gender gap has helped McCain more than Bradley.
That's because so many more men vote in Republican primaries than
in Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain win the Republican nomination, his male-based
appeal will probably widen the already cavernous gender gap between
the Republicans and Democrats, since Gore draws much of his
strength from women. That situation might favor the Democrat, since
there were 7 million more eligible female voters than eligible male

they tend to turn out in lower proportions than Northern blacks,
who tend to be more affluent and better educated and are less

   Some political strategists say that unless this changes, the
black vote may be more of a factor in closely fought states in the
industrial Midwest like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio than in Deep
South states like Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, where
Republicans have had a lock.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIANT SLEEPS TONIGHT. For years, Hispanics have been
described as the sleeping giant of U.S. politics, and George W.
Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet
when it comes to presidential races, there are no signs this giant
is stirring or that Hispanics will have much of an impact on the
race.
</P>

   Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population.
But half of that group is concentrated in two states _ California
and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic
vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that
vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly
different result this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 40 percent of Hispanics of voting age are not
U.S. citizens, and only 26 percent of those eligible to vote did so
in 1996 _ far fewer than non-Hispanic whites and blacks _ despite a
major effort by the Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders to get
out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The one state where Hispanics may be crucial is Florida. Four
years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, won only
46 percent of the Hispanics who voted there, mainly conservative
Cuban-Americans. That was the lowest draw of any Republican
candidate in recent memory. Vowing not to let that happen again,
the Republicans _ particularly Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is the
governor _ are vigorously courting Cuban-American voters. But
Democrats, noting that the Cuban-American community is younger and
less vehemently anti-Castro, sense an opening.
</P>
<P>
   OLD STORY. It used to be that the band would strike up the
Roosevelt-era anthem ``Happy Days Are Here Again'' and elderly
voters would feel all nostalgic and troop off to vote Democratic.
No more. Quite simply, many of those seniors who remember the New
Deal have passed away, and many more of the voters now over 65 are
people who were swept up in the Reagan Revolution and have remained
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior vote today is a different group of people than it
was four years ago and eight years ago,'' said John Rother,
director of legislation and public policy for the American
Association of Retired Persons, who is not publicly supporting any
candidate. ``They didn't go through a life experience like the
Depression that brought everybody together and they don't have the
same view of government.''
</P>
<P>
   THE YOUNG AND THE LISTLESS. Despite efforts like MTV's ``Rock
the Vote,'' young people continue to be among the most politically
apathetic groups in the country. In 1996, only 32.4 percent of
people 18 to 24 years old cast a ballot _ the lowest level since
1972, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
</P>
<P>
   A close race and a maverick candidate like Bradley or McCain
might bring out more young voters. But it's unclear if anything can
break through this group's lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   STILL ANGRY AFTER ALL. The angry white males are still around.
They tend to be college grads, relatively affluent and over 50
years old. They are more likely married, living in the South and
are often ex-Democrats turned Republican. They hate Clinton with a
passion. According to Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center for
People and the Press, they make up about 10 percent of the
population and 12 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   They had a moment in the sun in 1994, when they helped power the
Republicans to control of Congress. But even as their economic
status has improved and their influence has waned, their anger has
not diminished. ``Many still feel that the cultural winds are
blowing against them,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in
Atlanta. ``That creates the sense that the forces of political
correctness are working against them and what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   I DO, I DO. The gender gap has been a hardy perennial in
analyses of the electorate. But perhaps as important in determining
who is wed to which party is a voter's marital status. Exit polls
indicate that married men supported the Republican over the
Democrat in every presidential race since 1984, and that except for
1996, when they backed Clinton over Bob Dole, married women did the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried men have a more checkered recent history, backing
Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George Bush in 1988, and flocking to
Clinton in 1992 and 1996. On the other hand, Democrats since 1984
have set single women's hearts aflutter. And in Kohut's survey,
60.7 percent of unmarried women with children _ so-called waitress
moms _ said they supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about soccer moms, but, really, for Clinton and
Gore, it's single moms,'' Kohut said.

   CALIF-SPRAWL (Santa Clarita, Calif.) _ This is the future home
of Newhall Ranch, the largest housing development ever approved by
Los Angeles County, with 21,600 units for 70,000 people to be built
over the next 20 years. To its critics, Newhall Ranch is a symbol
of all that is wrong with California's decades of
catch-as-catch-can development. But big as it may be, Newhall Ranch
is nothing compared with the projected need for new housing in Los
Angeles County: about 25,000 units a year, according to the
Southern California Association of Governments. By 2025, the
state's population of 34 million is projected to grow by 18 million
more (a whole New York state) and that of the Los Angeles region by
6 million (or two Chicagos). By Todd S. Purdum.

pursuit of the culprits, some network experts _ and at least a few

of Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew the Socialist government of
Salvador Allende, two American supporters of President Allende were
killed in Chile under circumstances that stirred suspicions of CIA
involvement. U.S. officials categorically denied any role in the
young men's deaths, which were dramatized in the 1982 movie
``Missing.'' Now, spurred by the arrest of Pinochet in 1998,
President Clinton has ordered the declassification of ``all
documents that shed light on human rights abuses, terrorism and
other acts of political violence during and prior to the Pinochet
era in Chile,'' and there are answers to many longstanding
questions. By Diana Jean Schemo.

go to a shelf and pull down a blank _ an 18-inch brook trout, say,

<P>
   Mission statements _ those distilled essences of corporate goals
_ will never be confused with works of Donne or Shakespeare. Yet
they have caught on like Britney Spears' latest hit, becoming
poetry to executives' ears, sonnets to shareholder value, so much
so that 86 percent of U.S. corporations have their own carefully
worded, neatly printed, widely disseminated statements.
</P>
<P>
   While this mass embrace of codified corporate goals seems part
hula hoop fad, part keeping up with the Joneses, many business
executives say they serve as a vital compass. Also called credos or

<P>
   Mission statements _ those distilled essences of corporate goals
_ will never be confused with works of Donne or Shakespeare. Yet
they have caught on like Britney Spears' latest hit, becoming
poetry to executives' ears, sonnets to shareholder value, so much
so that 86 percent of U.S. corporations have their own carefully
worded, neatly printed, widely disseminated statements.
</P>
<P>
   While this mass embrace of codified corporate goals seems part
hula hoop fad, part keeping up with the Joneses, many business
executives say they serve as a vital compass. Also called credos or
vision statements, they range from florid language to business
school argot, from snappy staccato to
I-need-No-Doz-to-finish-reading-this-thing.
</P>
<P>

   ``We always thought our new competition was going to be
`Microsoft University,''' the president of an elite Eastern
university ruefully remarked to a visitor over dinner recently.
``We were wrong. Our competition is our own faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the ivory tower in the dot.com age, where commerce
and competition have set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, educators and entrepreneurs began to see that
millions of students and potential students might be reached, and
tens of millions of dollars earned, using the Internet to provide a
higher education. More than one-third of all colleges and
universities in the United States already offer distance learning,
as it is called; by 2002, four of every five are expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, now recognizes that the 14 million or so
students engaged in some form of higher education make up only a
small part of a much larger market.
</P>
<P>
   What if part-time students working toward a degree after work,
Chinese executives interested in Western management techniques,
European farmers studying advanced agronomy and American retirees
with the time to retake a favorite but forgotten Shakespeare course
_ paying customers all _ were just a modem away from class?
</P>
<P>
   It was and is an alluring prospect, but one thing the
universities didn't envision was how their professors would react
to it. Distance learning sells the knowledge inside a professor's
head directly to a global online audience. That means that, just by
doing what he does every day, a teacher potentially could grow rich
instructing a class consisting of a million students signed up by
the Internet-based educational firm that marketed the course and
handles the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faculty are dreaming of returns that are probably multiples of
their lifetime net worth,'' said Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard
Business School. ``They are doing things like saying, `This
technology allows someone who is used to teaching 100 students to
teach a million students.' And they are running numbers and
imagining, `Gee, what if everyone paid $10 to listen to my
lecture?'''
</P>
<P>
   Academics and their academies are already squaring off over who
owns the electronic rights to a professor's lectures and research.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable collision so far, as chronicled in The Wall
Street Journal in November, involved Arthur Miller, a celebrated
Harvard Law School professor and a pioneer legal analyst on
television. Miller says Harvard never objected to his work on
``Good Morning America'' or elsewhere, but he was rebuked by his
deans for videotaping a 10-hour lecture series last summer for
Concord, an online law school founded by Kaplan, the well-known
student preparatory company. Why the sudden change of heart? ``I
don't think it's undue cynicism to recognize that many of the
old-format educational productions _ books, monographs, articles _
produce no or very little revenue,'' Miller said in an interview.
``They were of no concern to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Today they are of great concern, and Harvard is rewriting its
policies on how professors may use course materials. So are a great
many other schools, large and small. But in doing so they are
exploring relatively uncharted legal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the general rule was that a professor was free to
write textbooks, even if based on his course work, and to keep all
royalties. Patented research conducted on campus was a different
matter, subject to various restrictions to which professors
typically had to agree as a condition of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The old contract no longer applies partly because of the number
of new outlets for academic expertise created by the Internet _
which can distribute material as text, sound, moving image or a
combination of the three. But powering the commercial growth of
this new technology are the huge sums of money the Internet has
attracted to distance education.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rosenfield, for example, is the chief executive of
Unext.com, a startup that plans to offer a full range of college
courses over the Internet. Rosenfield estimates his company will
spend nearly $100 million developing courses before it receives $1
of tuition. Unext is backed by Michael Milken, the former junk-bond
king, who was convicted of securities law violations in 1990. The
company has signed deals with Columbia, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon
University, and the University of Chicago, promising them revenue
from the course materials they develop, and granting them Unext
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Unext envisions a world where anyone can begin a course in, say,
basic finance, at any time of the year, from any location. Indeed,
to make a profit, the company will need to have thousands of people
engaged in a particular course at a time, Rosenfield said. But he
believes that the opportunity to take courses designed by elite
schools will attract such numbers. Company projections suggest
that, if he is correct, the University of Chicago could earn $20
million in royalties alone from the venture over the next five
years. (Payment to participating professors has not yet been set.)
No wonder, then, that Chicago's scholars must now seek the
university's permission before they engage in similar efforts on
their own.

   Williams College, the prestigious liberal arts college in
western Massachusetts, is reviewing another corporate offer. Global
Education Network, a company founded partly by Herb Allen, the
president of the venture-capital firm Allen &AMP; Co., has approached
Williams and Brown University, among others, with an invitation to
contribute course material to a proposed for-profit Web site
providing on line liberal arts education for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Williams have said that the venture could earn the
institution upwards of $250,000 per year, per course, for up to 10
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General, which owns Harcourt Brace, a major textbook
publishing company, is yet another firm entering the field.
Harcourt announced last summer that it would create an independent,
full-range, distance learning ``university,'' offering college
degrees in a variety of disciplines. And this spring, Kaplan will
introduce KaplanCollege.com, which will offer degree and
certificate programs in a number of fields including education,
real estate, financial services, paralegal studies and nursing, in
addition to law.
</P>
<P>
   Obscured by all this entrepreneurial activity lies a still more
fundamental issue: As distance learning enterprises start competing
with colleges and universities for students, tuition and faculty,
will they not also progressively marginalize ``brick and mortar''
institutions, perhaps even rendering them obsolete?
</P>
<P>
   Elite institutions like Williams are the ones least likely to be
displaced by technological innovation. But there are some 3,500
colleges and universities in the United States alone, and distance
education will certainly make a portion of them redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that really are going to get hurt by distance
learning are the smaller, independent institutions located in rural
areas,'' said James V. Koch, president of Old Dominion University,
in Virginia. Those schools generally charge high tuition, and
students will find it cheaper to take distance learning courses for
at least part of their degree program.
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning will also provide a simple credentialing
function _ certifying that someone has acquired a certain skill,
say, in computer programming or accounting, entirely bypassing
traditional institutions of higher learning and trade schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are going to be loads and loads of students who
want the traditional experience _ the football team and the junior
year abroad,'' Koch said. But will that traditional experience be
recognizable if colleges and universities begin behaving like
corporate profit centers?
</P>
<P>
   The advent of distance learning has turned everyone, from
trumpet teachers to professors of Japanese and statistics, into
potential entrepreneurs. And like relatives sharing a winning
lottery ticket, professors and their schools are elbowing each
other in pursuit of the same pot of gold. ``This set of
technologies, and the opportunities it presents, create potential
conflicts of commitment _ of the faculty's commitment to the
university, and of the university's commitment to the faculty and
to its core mission,'' said Clark of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the institutions and the faculty don't reaffirm those
commitments,'' he added, ``the forces will actually tear places
apart.''

 UNDATED: their own.

<P>
   Williams College, the prestigious liberal arts college in
western Massachusetts, is reviewing another corporate offer. Global
Education Network, a company founded partly by Herb Allen, the
president of the venture-capital firm Allen &AMP; Co., has approached
Williams and Brown University, among others, with an invitation to
contribute course material to a proposed for-profit Web site
providing on line liberal arts education for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Williams have said that the venture could earn the
institution upwards of $250,000 per year, per course, for up to 10
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt General, which owns Harcourt Brace, a major textbook
publishing company, is yet another firm entering the field.
Harcourt announced last summer that it would create an independent,
full-range, distance learning ``university,'' offering college
degrees in a variety of disciplines. And this spring, Kaplan will
introduce KaplanCollege.com, which will offer degree and
certificate programs in a number of fields including education,
real estate, financial services, paralegal studies and nursing, in
addition to law.
</P>
<P>
   Obscured by all this entrepreneurial activity lies a still more
fundamental issue: As distance learning enterprises start competing
with colleges and universities for students, tuition and faculty,
will they not also progressively marginalize ``brick and mortar''
institutions, perhaps even rendering them obsolete?
</P>
<P>
   Elite institutions like Williams are the ones least likely to be
displaced by technological innovation. But there are some 3,500
colleges and universities in the United States alone, and distance
education will certainly make a portion of them redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that really are going to get hurt by distance
learning are the smaller, independent institutions located in rural
areas,'' said James V. Koch, president of Old Dominion University,
in Virginia. Those schools generally charge high tuition, and
students will find it cheaper to take distance learning courses for
at least part of their degree program.
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning will also provide a simple credentialing
function _ certifying that someone has acquired a certain skill,
say, in computer programming or accounting, entirely bypassing
traditional institutions of higher learning and trade schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still are going to be loads and loads of students who
want the traditional experience _ the football team and the junior
year abroad,'' Koch said. But will that traditional experience be
recognizable if colleges and universities begin behaving like
corporate profit centers?
</P>
<P>
   The advent of distance learning has turned everyone, from
trumpet teachers to professors of Japanese and statistics, into
potential entrepreneurs. And like relatives sharing a winning
lottery ticket, professors and their schools are elbowing each
other in pursuit of the same pot of gold. ``This set of
technologies, and the opportunities it presents, create potential
conflicts of commitment _ of the faculty's commitment to the
university, and of the university's commitment to the faculty and
to its core mission,'' said Clark of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the institutions and the faculty don't reaffirm those
commitments,'' he added, ``the forces will actually tear places
apart.''

COMMENTARY: KING OF THE HOODS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everyone knew that South Carolina would jump ugly.
And it did.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Bushes start flailing, I mull whether it would be
different if Lee Atwater were still around.
</P>
<P>
   I used to wonder if the cocky strategist, the Ricky Martin of
dirty campaigning, could have pulled President Bush through in '92,
as he did in '88, when he zestfully turned Willie Horton into the
bogyman. Now I'm wondering how Atwater would be smashing up John
McCain's giddy insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and ``Junior,'' as he called W., were close. It was Lee who
invited Junior to come to Washington and work on the '88 campaign.
And in '92, after Lee had died of a brain tumor, it was Junior who
most clearly saw that the campaign was being mismanaged by Baker
and Teeter and Malek, missing its wily hit man. But with Lee gone,
there was no one to listen to Junior.
</P>
<P>
   The amoral king of the hoods was spawned amid the pig-snout
dinners in the swamps of South Carolina, learning conservative
politics from Strom Thurmond and Carroll Campbell, the senator and
former governor now trying to save W. with the same firewall
Atwater once promised would save Bush senior if he had lost New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Profiling Atwater for Esquire in '86, David Remnick recalled the
1980 congressional race in South Carolina's 2nd District ``between
Atwater's man, Republican Floyd Spence, and a Faulknerian figure
named Tom Turnipseed. ... At one press briefing, Atwater planted a
reporter who rose and said `We understand Turnipseed has had
psychiatric treatment.' Atwater played it cool and refused to
comment, but later told the reporters off the record, `In college I
understand he got hooked up to jumper cables.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Phil Gailey wrote in The New York Times about a
controversy that erupted when Campbell was running for governor.
His critics charged that in his 1978 campaign for Congress,
Campbell had tried to make an issue of the Jewish faith of his
Democratic opponent, Max Heller.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey wrote that Alan Baron, a Washington-based Democratic
analyst, had revealed in a 1983 newsletter that Campbell's
pollster, Arthur Finkelstein of New York, told him he did a survey
to ``determine the impact on voters of information that Heller was
(1) a Jew; (2) a foreign-born Jew; and (3) a foreign-born Jew who
did not believe in Jesus Christ as the Savior.'' They learned (3)
would hurt Heller.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater allegedly told another consultant that it would be great
if a third candidate could bring (3) up. Sure enough, an
independent candidate did assert, after his aides met with the
Campbell camp, that Heller should not be elected because he was not
a Christian and did not ``believe Jesus Christ has come yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell hotly denied charges of collusion and exploitation but
conceded religion was raised in the '78 poll and released the
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   One question asked voters to choose from six characteristics
that best described Campbell and Heller: ``(a) Honest, (b) A
Christian man, (c) Concern for people, (d) A hard worker, (e)
Experienced in government, (f) Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question asked which ``personal qualities'' would make
voters more or less likely to vote for the two candidates. Among
the 15 qualities listed were ``a Jewish immigrant'' and ``a native
South Carolinian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, now editor of the editorial page at The St. Petersburg
Times, does not believe the state has grown sweeter. ``There is
nothing like politics South Carolina-style,'' he says. ``I don't
know of another Southern state in the year 2000 that still plays as
rough as the Republicans play in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no moral compass whatsoever,'' agreed Sam Tenenbaum,
a Democratic activist in Columbia who so loved McCain's upbraiding
of Pat Buchanan over Hitler that he is now wooing Jewish Democrats
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain accused Bush of push-polling in South Carolina _ calling
voters on the pretense of gathering information when you're really
spewing dirt. Bush has denied it. McCain said things had gotten so
ugly, he would no longer air ads criticizing Bush. Bush aides
seethed as McCain once more pushed ahead in the virtue sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father before him, W. is morphing from moderate to
conservative, from easy-going to do-what-it-takes, to win an
election.
</P>
<P>
   He should take care. Atwaterworld is a dangerous place _
especially without Atwater.

COMMENTARY: LOST IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Last week's attacks on the Internet are an
exciting subject, about which I have nothing to say. But they did
make me think about a less exciting but still important subject: a
tax on the Internet. (Apologies to Groucho Marx.) You see, Internet
taxation is one of John McCain's signature issues, second only to
campaign finance reform. And it so happens that his position is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if you buy a book at your local bookstore, you
probably pay sales tax. If you order it from Amazon.com, you don't.
This unequal treatment is largely due to administrative issues:
state and local governments haven't yet figured out how to collect
taxes on catalog shopping, let alone e-commerce. But there is also
a legal impediment: the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998, of which
John McCain was a chief sponsor, imposed a three-year moratorium on
Internet taxes. And McCain is the only presidential contender
promising to make that moratorium permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this a bad idea? A basic principle of taxation is that
different ways of doing the same thing should face more or less the
same tax rates. Suppose that there are two bridges connecting the
suburban community of Sprawlville to Anytown U.S.A. And suppose
that the bridge authority needs to levy tolls to pay for
maintenance, interest on its bonds, etc. Should it collect tolls on
only one bridge? No. Not only is this unfair to those who have to
use that bridge, but it leads to wasted time and money, because
some people will take a longer route to work in order to use the
toll-free bridge. If revenue must be raised, charging the same toll
on both bridges minimizes the associated distortion of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle applies to any tax. If I really prefer
roaming the aisles of a physical bookstore to browsing the Web, but
I nonetheless decide to order from Amazon to avoid paying sales
tax, my decision has been distorted. So why exempt the Internet
from the taxes imposed on the material world?
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes to talk about consumer savings, exulting in the
taxes cybershoppers saved this past Christmas. But those savings
(which, like tolls saved by drivers who go out of their way to
avoid them, are partly offset by hidden costs) are also lost
revenue. The only way to regard them as a net benefit is to suppose
both that the loss in revenue will force governments to spend less
rather than tax other things more and that the spending forgone is
of no value. It is, in short, the
slash-taxes-to-starve-the-bureaucrats theory _ which is precisely
the theory McCain rightly derides in his critique of George W.
Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also argues that the Internet deserves special treatment
because it is nifty _ it's an ``engine of growth,'' cyberspace is
the new frontier (``President Jefferson did not send a revenue
agent to ride herd on Lewis and Clark'') and all that. And of
course e-business does claim to be special _ but that's what they
all say. When I buy from Amazon instead of my local bookstore,
should I feel proud because I am helping settle the electronic
frontier or guilty because I am undermining an institution that I
will miss when it is gone? Anyway, conservatives are supposed to be
against the idea of ``picking winners,'' a.k.a. industrial policy _
that is, having the government second-guess the market, according
some sectors special treatment because it thinks that they are more
equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not alone in his position. Right-wing think tanks like
the Heritage Foundation have blithely brushed aside the normal
principles of taxation and their usual opposition to industrial
policy _ not to mention their usual solicitude for states' rights!
_ when it comes to the Internet. I have always assumed, however,
that this is basically a fund-raising ploy. Opposing Internet taxes
panders both to crude anti-tax conservatives _ who don't really
want to live without a government but can't bring themselves to
admit that any tax is necessary _ and to the new money of the
cyberelite, which like any elite thinks that it deserves special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to think that McCain isn't engaged in that kind of
pandering. So let's hope he's just confused.

NUCLEAR RIVALS MARSHAL ARMIES OF LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pakistan and India, the world's newest nuclear
rivals, have brought their battles to Washington, where each
country has assembled a bevy of highly paid lobbyists already
tested in one fight _ Pakistan won _ and now engaged in another:
whether President Clinton should visit Pakistan as well as India
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's foreign policy team will give him persuasive pros and
cons. But in the end, the decision may hinge on the power of the
Washington lobbyists who are being increasingly sought out by
foreign countries that believe that they need professional help in
getting a piece of the foreign policy pie or polishing their image
here.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, such as Israel, Greece and Taiwan, have always
had a strong presence in the parlors of policy making in the
capital, and some issues _ the Vietnam War in the 1960s;
intervention in Central America in the early 1980s _ have generated
vocal constituencies. But the depth and breadth of lobbying by
individual countries has grown in recent years, and foreign
governments are now paying out tens of thousands of dollars a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a cost of doing business with the U.S.
government for foreign countries to be represented in Washington by
lobbying firms,'' said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L.
Stimson center, a research organization. ``It makes foreign policy
making more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of India and Pakistan and Clinton's travels, each
side has already begun to lobby the White House, the State
Department and Congress, and neither lobby squad is beneath some
nasty comments when talking about the other's client.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, India shunned lobbyists, relying on its
distinguished foreign service to make the nation's case in State
Department meetings with Indian diplomats. These days, India is
paying $50,000 a month for the lobbying services of Verner,
Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand, where the heavy hitters
include two former Senate majority leaders, Democrat George
Mitchell and Republican Bob Dole, and a former governor of Texas,
Ann Richards. (Verner, Liipfert also lobbies for Ethiopia, the
Marshall Islands, Slovenia, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay.)
</P>
<P>
   Adding to some grumbling at home about the use of lobbyists, the
Indian government is paying an additional $25,000 a month for the
clout of former Democratic congressman Stephen J. Solarz, a New
Yorker who was viewed as a friendly voice for India when he was a
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pakistan is shelling out $30,000 a month for the
services of Charlie Wilson, a former Democratic congressman from
Texas who was a staunch ally of the country when he served in the
House. Even though Wilson cautioned the Pakistani government last
year about hiring another lobbyist _ given that ``Pakistan's
resources are limited,'' he wrote in a memorandum _ just this
month, Pakistan signed a contract with the politically connected
law firm of Patton, Boggs &AMP; Blow for $22,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The person handling the account is a former Clinton special
counsel, Lanny J. Davis, who helped the White House navigate
through the 1996 Democratic fund-raising imbroglio and then, after
leaving the White House, made frequent television appearances to
defend President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he has talked to the White House and the State
Department, although he will not reveal which officials he has
approached, about adding a stop in Pakistan to Clinton's itinerary
when he visits the Indian subcontinent next month. To spurn a
visit, Davis says, ``would be conveying a message of hostility, and
pushing Pakistan in a dangerous direction away from the West and
toward the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries that are paying Patton, Boggs for help include
Benin, Croatia, Oman, Paraguay and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep thinking it's just a matter of hiring the right
lobbyist, that the right lobbyist will be their salvation,'' Robert
Oakley, a retired U.S. diplomat, said about Pakistan, where he
served as ambassador from 1988-1991.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes the right lobbyist may indeed make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the battle last fall over legislation that would allow
for the resumption of U.S. military aid to Pakistan. Since 1990,
military assistance had been suspended because of Pakistan's
nuclear program. On top of that, economic sanctions were imposed on
Pakistan after it tested nuclear bombs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Senate's defense appropriations bill had a
provision that would allow the president to waive the sanctions
against Pakistan; the House bill did not have a similar provision.
When the bill went to conference committee, Wilson went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked day and night,'' Wilson said. ``I moved to the
Hill,'' he added, passing time on a park bench, waiting to catch
members.
</P>
<P>
   The odds were against him. To begin with, the Indian-American
population is politically active, and growing, seeking to build a
lobby on the model of the American lobby for Israel, lawmakers and
diplomats say. In Congress, as a reflection of that activism and of
generous campaign contributions, there is an India caucus, with
more than 100 members, which makes it the largest ethnic
congressional caucus. Given its size, it is listened to at the
State Department, diplomats there say.
</P>
<P>
   The co-chairman of the India Caucus, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.,
who has received substantial campaign contributions from
Indian-Americans outside his district, has publicly urged Clinton
not to go to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Pakistani caucus, which never had more than a
handful of members, is largely dormant now.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson was up against a few negatives on the Pakistan side
of the ledger: Pakistan recently tested its nuclear weapons;
Pakistani-backed guerrillas crossed into the Kargil region of the
disputed territory of Kashmir last year, bringing international
condemnation and the threat of outright war with India; then, last
fall, came the military coup _ or ``political sea change,'' as
Wilson carefully depicts it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In arguing his client's cause during the congressional fight,
Wilson hurled some tough charges. India had been ``virtually a
Soviet satellite'' during the Cold War, Wilson said he told
representatives, a depiction he repeated with emphasis for use in
the current row. Another aspersion was that ``Indians hate
Americans,'' he said, a charge most Indians would probably dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson had something else going for him. While a member of
Congress, he had served for 20 years on the defense subcommittee of
the House appropriations committee. The members of this
subcommittee were on the conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely lucky,'' Wilson said. ``They were all
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, and his client, won that day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the challenge for Wilson is to keep Pakistan off the State
Department's list of terrorist nations, and to convince Clinton
that he must stop in Pakistan, however briefly, during the India
trip. Once again, his colleague for 20 years in the House, Solarz,
is on the other side, as is Verner, Liipfert.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Solarz both granted lengthy interviews, as did Davis.
Brenda Meister, who handles the India account at Verner, Liipfert,
declined to be interviewed, saying that it was the firm's policy to
maintain a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, Wilson and Solarz agree: Clinton would like to
make the stop.
</P>
<P>
   That would be ``inappropriate and counterproductive,'' Solarz
said. He minces no words. Pakistan is a ``terrorist state,'' and
now it has a military government. Solarz has already made these
views known to the White House and the State Department, as well as
to his former colleagues in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is equally busy, trying to generate a letter from enough
members of Congress urging the president to make the stop, which he
feels would give the president political protection.
</P>
<P>
   Is he also talking to State Department officials? ``Not more
than four or five times a day,'' he answers. A bit of lobbyist's
hyperbole, perhaps. But a senior State Department official
acknowledged that he hears from Wilson frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating to watch,'' said a State Department official
about the dueling lobbyists. He cheerfully declined to say which
side was winning, or to handicap the race.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ethanol plays so large a role in the agricultural
economy of Iowa that candidates campaigning before the January
caucuses there, the first test of presidential aspirations, ignored
the issue at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   Yet huge regional issues here in what is loosely defined as the
Interior West _ eight states that account for nearly a quarter of
the country's land mass but only 40 of its 538 electoral votes _
have been all but ignored this year because of the marginal role
these states play in the nomination process. Virtually nothing is
heard from the stump about land management, water rights, nuclear
waste cleanup or endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the polls close on Super Tuesday, March 7, more than
two dozen states and U.S. territories will have held primaries or
caucuses that could well determine the major parties' presidential
nominations. But among the Interior eight _ Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming _ Arizona
alone will have voted by then (in a primary for Republicans only).
</P>
<P>
   In a further reflection of the region's scant influence, for the
fifth straight election cycle not one of the presidential or vice
presidential debates is to be held in any of the eight states.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rarity of such debates anywhere in the West
prompted the Western Governors' Association to ask the Commission
on Presidential Debates last week to add a fourth presidential
debate or a second vice presidential debate, to be held in a
Western state. In a letter to the commission, the governors
expressed concern that it ``has again overlooked the
fastest-growing region in the country,'' with issues different from
those in states to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just insane,'' Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, R-Utah, said of
what many here regard as the Interior West's status as an
afterthought, a result in part of the tendency of big states like
California and New York to gain greater influence in the nomination
process by moving up the dates of their primaries. ``Everybody
races to the front, and the more it's front-loaded, lots of areas
in the United States get completely left out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   No region so vast has been more frequently overlooked than the
Interior West, whose eight states rank from forth to 12th in land
mass but from 24th to 50th in population. And as if the low
population alone was not enough to make them hardly worth fighting
over, most of the eight are so heavily Republican that the party's
nominee can virtually take them for granted. Only in Colorado and
Nevada have Democrats achieved nearly equal strength.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of attention has been especially noted by environmental
organizations that focus much of their efforts on the West and rely
on public awareness to get their issues before Congress and the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays in the military _ that is an important issue, but it
affects a very small portion of the populace,'' said Kieran
Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity
in Tucson, Ariz. ``Clean air and clean water affect every single
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Marshall, coordinator of the disarmament program for the
Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center in Boulder, Colo., said the
cleanup of nuclear waste from Cold War weapons programs, an
enormous problem in the West, ``is an issue that rarely shows up,
if at all, in presidential campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for many other Western issues. ``Any kind
of public debate would focus on policies of the West,'' said Gov.
Jim Geringer, R-Wyo. ``Like protection of national forest lands.
Who wouldn't be for that? But if you don't talk about areas for
grazing and areas for logging, then you've not taken everybody into
consideration. And without debates, that part of it gets lost.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase the influence of the Interior West and shine a
spotlight on Western issues, Leavitt led an effort two years ago to
create a Western presidential primary in early March that would
have enabled voters in all eight states to cast votes on the same
day. But the effort failed for a variety of reasons, and a chance
for the region to broaden its influence was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the West as a whole had much success attracting
presidential debates. In recent years, only Los Angeles, in 1988,
and San Diego, in 1996, have been host to any held in the region.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Souby, executive director of the Western Governors'
Association, said many universities, civic groups and other likely
hosts of a presidential debate ``are not aware of the process'' of
applying. But the debate commission's executive director, Janet
Brown, said that was not necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Brown said, the commission received dozens of
inquiries but, finally, just 12 formal bids, only three from
prospective hosts in the West: the University of California at Los
Angeles, the University of Southern California and the University
of Portland. No bid, she said, came from the Interior West, and the
Pacific Coast bids were eliminated when the commission selected St.
Louis, Boston and Winston-Salem, N.C., for the presidential debates
and Danville, Ky., for the vice presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the Western governors to ask for the additional
debate and for a response from the commission by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   A commission co-chairman, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a Nevadan who
is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said
that he sympathized with the Western states but that at this late
date in the presidential election season, he could not hold out
much hope for the request.

   MILLSTONE, N.J. _ Mark Hayward has caught dozens of smallmouth
bass in the Delaware River over the years, so it is not surprising
that he decided one day to have a taxidermist put one on a plaque.
What is remarkable is how the taxidermist, Robert Kennedy, did it.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who recently completed the order in his basement
workshop in this central New Jersey town, never handled one of
Hayward's fish. He never even saw one. Nor was he given a photo of
a fish, or its measurements.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Hayward has released almost every bass he has
ever hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have a particular one in mind,'' Hayward said.
``So I ordered one about in the middle of the range he offers, not
overly large. The middle of the range seemed like the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the state of taxidermy in this increasingly virtual
world: trophy fish can now be ordered like a pair of L.L. Bean
boots. The centuries-old art of skinning, stuffing and varnishing a
fish so it can be stuck on the wall and bragged about is still
alive and well. But taxidermists now make trophies out of resin and
plastic, too. They can simply go to a shelf and pull down a blank _
an 18-inch brook trout, say, or a 21-inch largemouth bass _ paint
it, stick on synthetic fins, and voila.
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward fake-fish trophies, which has accelerated over
the last few years, has to do with their durability, as well as
with a new environmental sensitivity that enables anglers to claim,
the way movie credits sometimes do, that no animals were harmed in
the making of this trophy.
</P>
<P>
   A few saltwater species, like sailfish, have long been
reproduced synthetically because their oily skin deteriorates
quickly. But taxidermists now make replicas of everything from
arctic char to piranha to spoonbill catfish.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward found what he wanted on the Internet. His order was for
one ``SMB 16.5 RT'' (smallmouth bass, 16.5 inches, with a
right-hand turn to the body). The price was $180, about what a
traditional mount costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many anglers recoil at mock trophies, Kennedy and other
taxidermists acknowledge. But many others embrace the
nonbiodegradable souvenirs. Conservation groups, naturally, are
delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the satisfaction of having that replica there to
remind you of your great experience,'' said Kathy Buchner, a member
of Trout Unlimited in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and the owner of a
replica Snake River cutthroat trout, ``but you have the
satisfaction of knowing you could catch that same fish again.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual ``wall hangers'' have also been a boon to restaurants
and bars. In Stuart, Fla., Mike Kirkhart, whose specialty is
replicating giant ocean fish, recently made a 5-foot head of a
black marlin for a restaurant in Cape Hatteras, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has also helped anglers carry on a tradition usually
reserved for barroom or dockside conversations _ embellishing the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people come in to do a 30-inch fish,'' Kirkhart said,
``and end up leaving with a 40- or 50-inch fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Some taxidermists, including Kennedy, make synthetic trophies
not only for individual customers, but also for fellow
taxidermists. He uses rubber molds of prize specimens to turn out
white blanks that he sells wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 39, also molds just the heads of fish _ oily species
like Atlantic salmon, which tend to rot if mounted in the old way.
He sells these to other taxidermists, who meld the heads with foam
bodies on which real fish skin is glued.
</P>
<P>
   His business, Great American FishHead Co., has grown so much
that he employs four high school students to help him make 100
heads a week, which he ships across North America and as far afield
as New Zealand. It has taken over his basement, where dozens of
full-body fish replicas hang from the ceiling, and freshly molded
heads jut from wall hooks. Shelves hold amber molds made using
prime specimens brought in for traditional mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish are like people,'' Kennedy said. ``Some are better
looking than others. Some have better lines.''
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of his workshop recently, he poured white resin into
a mold, set a timer for 13 minutes and started up a big blue
machine that slowly spun the mold to spread the liquid as it
hardened.
</P>
<P>
   He then returned to another project, a smallmouth bass. With
scissors, he cut out fins from a sheet of plastic and stuck them
into slots on a white body. Then he sat at a bench and _ with a
rhythmic hiss, hiss, hiss _ airbrushed the bass' stripes.
</P>
<P>
   As he painted, he acknowledged the oddness of his craft. ``A
beautiful fish swimming in a stream ends up with a product
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the timer chimed, he walked back to the blue machine,
peeled open the mold and pulled out a 23-inch rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' he said.

QUESTIONS DOG BUSH ON WILLINGNESS TO ENDURE GRUELING RIGORS OF
CAMPAIGNING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer was
waiting to be the first speaker at a Lincoln Day Dinner in New
Hampshire, an aide to George W. Bush approached him and said: ``Can
Governor Bush speak first? He's tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer refused to yield. ``I'm tired, too,'' he recalled saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 53, sets aside two hours a day to exercise. But in the
wake of his upset loss to John McCain in New Hampshire there is a
nagging question about whether Bush has the necessary fire in the
belly to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the fire-in-the-belly question involves his desire to
run, his willingness to endure the grueling rigors of campaigning _
including ceaseless attention from the global press corps _ and
whether he has the personal fortitude to turn things around in the
face of his first political trouble in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before his New Hampshire loss, Bush repeatedly
complained about being tired and homesick. He admitted he even
carried his pillow from home to guarantee a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend after New Hampshire, Bush went home to rest in
Austin, Texas, rather than attend the California Republican
convention _ where McCain gave a well-received luncheon speech _
leaving many there believing that Bush took the state for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the next primary, in Delaware on Tuesday, but McCain
got a quarter of the vote without campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush attributed McCain's New Hampshire win in part to the number
of days he spent campaigning there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with South Carolina's primary approaching Saturday, Bush is
resting Sunday, Feb. 13, in Austin. McCain, who is 10 years Bush's
senior, is holding a Seneca, S.C., picnic before traveling to
Atlanta to promote his war-hero autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of South Carolina will understand that someone
wants to go home to go to their own church and to be with their
teen-age daughters for one day, on Sunday,'' said Bush spokeswoman
Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a completely full schedule,'' Hughes said. ``We're
doing as much as possible to interact with individual voters, to
talk with them one on one, answer their questions, talk about the
issues, to do all kinds of South Carolina media, to continue to be
as accessible to the national media as we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said anyone who believes Bush is taking the race for
granted has ``underestimated his desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has found himself reassuring supporters about these
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to a meeting this morning, I walk in and could look in
their eyes and they were wondering if the man has it,'' Bush told a
Grand Rapids, Mich., Republican gathering. ``I looked right back at
them in a private meeting and said, `Don't worry about me. I've
dusted the snow off of my suit. I'm ready to fight.'''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, ``I miss my family, miss our girls, miss
the cats _ they don't miss me,'' a homesick Bush lamented to an
Iowa State University audience last month. ``I miss the dog. She
does miss me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of verbal misspeaks, Bush said it was fine for
the media to poke fun at his verbal gaffes _ ``just put in there
he's real tired.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said
Bush's fatigue and apparent lack of enthusiasm has not sunk in with
the general voting population. But Sabato said Bush is sending a
bad signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's homesick, maybe he shouldn't be president,'' Sabato
said. ``Presidents are gone almost every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said there is little doubt that Bush could perform as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it does create the question of whether there is fire in
the belly,'' Sabato said. ``Between Bush and McCain, McCain's fire
is hot enough to melt steel. I'm not sure Bush's is hot enough to
melt butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the candidate's struggle with fatigue, Bush's campaign
has tried to portray him as a man of vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers often have been allowed shots of him in his daily
workout or run. In New Hampshire, he held photo opportunities while
snowmobiling or sledding. Last year, his doctor released a physical
report that said Bush's fitness was in the top 1 percent of his age
group.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's New Hampshire chairman, Sen. Judd Gregg, was featured in
a television commercial telling voters that Bush ``reflects
Reagan's optimism and Teddy Roosevelt's energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt _ declaring that anyone who is ``sober, washed and
free of bodily advertising'' should get to shake the president's
hand _ on New Year's Day 1907 pressed 8,150 palms at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The handshake has been an integral part of Bush's campaign for
president. Bush remains after almost every speaking event to shake
hands with voters, sometimes for almost two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, it takes a lot of effort to shake every hand. I'm
tired,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever good may have come from Bush's hand-shaking, it was
McCain's open, ask-any-question town hall meetings that captured
voters' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign at first said that voters asked the governor
questions while he shook their hands. But in the wake of New
Hampshire, Bush's staff started a daily count of how many people
mentioned issues to Bush while shaking his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly dropped that, and on returning to South Carolina
last week Bush had adopted the McCain-style town hall meeting
format, called ``One on One with Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain still maintained a more vigorous public schedule than
Bush. On Saturday, McCain had scheduled door-to-door campaigning
and three town hall meetings. Bust had set two morning town hall
meetings before flying to Austin in the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bush's challenge is to overcome the image that his
campaign created when they positioned him as the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a groundswell of support from the GOP establishment
nationwide and raised a record amount of money, $68 million. He had
an aura of invincibility, an aura that vanished with McCain's upset
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Bill Bennett made an
inescapable comparison between Bush and the late-blooming prince of
Shakespeare's Henry IV, who gave up a life of good times to assume
his father's throne and ``pay the debt I never promised.'' The
prince ultimately has to fight for the throne, fending off a
challenge from a lord, who like McCain, had been a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   After New Hampshire, Bennett said that Bush, like Shakespeare's
prince, now needs to prove he is willing to fight and not take his
nomination for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of support for him, but now the question
is asked and the issue now is can he rise to the challenge,'' said
Bennett, who has campaigned with McCain. ``Now, we will see what is
in him, what is truly in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Revealing ``what is truly in him'' is not only Bush's job, but
the self-assigned role of the national and international media, who
have trailed Bush endlessly since he began officially campaigning
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems weary of the media attention as well.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has a ``media availability'' every day, his access to
the press is tightly controlled. By contrast, McCain will speak to
reporters at length every day, answering whatever questions are
pitched to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attitude toward the media was captured last year when a
C-Span reporter asked him if he was treated unkindly by the Texas
news media. ``I'm treated with respect,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But recently when Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts asked Bush the
same question three times during an interview, Bush grew visibly
angry and his spokesman later said that the journalists had been
``disrespectful'' in their efforts to pin down the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his father's presidential campaigns, Bush and his
aides were wary of the national news media. Shortly after the
former president left office, he declared that he didn't miss
Washington or politics: ``I damn sure don't miss the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Bush friend and adviser Clay Johnson said he asked the
governor last June how the Texas press corps differed from the
national press corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `There's no humor,''' in the national press corps,
Johnson said. They were ``real serious, real grim. Their jaws were
tight. It's not very friendly, very adversarial.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bush's different approach to the media has been the his
campaign's effort to keep the front-runner on message, mistake
free. As the underdog, McCain was at liberty to swing away with
little to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run against George Bush, he is going to have one
message,'' former Gov. Ann Richards said last year. ``He is going
to say that message until the world gags and everybody else is
going to be able to say it back.''
</P>
<P>
   A rare crack in the Bush campaign's facade occurred last month
as reporters badgered press aide Mindy Tucker about when would they
get their next news availability with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have one big, fat news conference on our
schedule where everyone can come and ask about what you think the
news is. It's not in our best interest. We have a message of the
day, and we want to stick with it,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush now, the question is does the man have what it takes to
keep going at this pace through the mid-summer conventions on into
November?
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be just adrenaline 'cause you can't keep adrenaline
going,'' said McCain, still perky as he headed into his 12th hour
of campaigning aboard the ``Straight Talk'' express last week in
South Carolina. ``It's a sense of excitement. It's a sense that
you're in something miraculous.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Perhaps the most telling insult to
Indonesia's armed forces, people here say, is that mothers no
longer encourage their daughters to marry a military man.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to tell us: `Marry a soldier. You'll have money and
prestige,''' said a young woman who recently graduated from
college. ``Now not so much. We are all hearing too many bad things
about the military.''
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest years of the nation, half a century ago, there
was no prouder profession in Indonesia than to be a member of the
military, a ``son of the revolution'' and ``guardian of the
nation.'' Manipulated by former President Suharto into a mainstay
of his 32 years of rule, the armed forces became Indonesia's most
powerful and privileged institution, effectively running the
country, from small villages to major government ministries.
</P>
<P>
   And in the service of the president, as well as their own
personal and economic interests, they employed the force of arms
with impunity. As the joke had it, if someone steps on your toe in
the bus, you say to him: ``Are you a member of the military? If
not, please get off my toe.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in popular perception has been swift.
</P>
<P>
   With the forced resignation of Suharto nearly two years ago and
the powerful momentum of a nationwide reform movement, the military
is retreating in disarray from its commanding position in society.
And like any cornered fighter, some officers are snarling in
dangerous defiance.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, President Abdurrahman Wahid is to return from a
two-week foreign trip during which the country's most prominent
general, Wiranto, refused his demand to resign as coordinating
minister for security affairs. The general's defiance touched off
rumors of a coup. And while that now seems unlikely _ with the
general and the president expected to talk out the situation
face-to-face _ the resistance of parts of the military to civilian
command is now an open issue.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliation of a once-proud _ once-arrogant _ institution
poses serious risks for Indonesia. A scattered and fractious
archipelago of 210 million people, it has relied on its armed force
of 350,000, rather than on democratic processes, to maintain
national unity.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever today, many political analysts agree, there is a
need for security forces to calm the explosions of religious and
ethnic conflict that have spread in this time of national
transition and weak central government. While the current military
may not be able to play that role, it also cannot be recreated or
pushed out of public life overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous to ask the military to completely withdraw from
the political arena,'' said Amien Rais, the speaker of Parliament,
who has been an advocate of military reform. ``We must give it
time.''
</P>
<P>
   With its top generals branded war criminals abroad and facing
human rights investigations at home, with the president taunting
restive officers as ``cowards,'' and with the history of their
abuses literally being exhumed from mass graves, Indonesia's
military is at its lowest point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the country's contemporary history the military has never
been so humiliated and disrespected by civilians,'' said Hermawan
Sulistyo, a political commentator.
</P>
<P>
   While some officers remain defiant, some are offering elaborate
statements of contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to apologize for past military violence and I
call on the people to stop condemning the military,'' Maj. Gen.
Agus Wirahadikusumah, a regional commander, said recently. ``Give
us a chance to restore our image and if necessary troops who are
used to the practices of the past regime will have to be
brainwashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gap between generals like this and the poorly
trained, poorly paid soldiers they command is a deep one, said Dewi
Fortuna Anwar, a political analyst who was a top aide to former
President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people on the ground have a very narrow
interpretation of nationalism,'' she said. ``For a lot of them,
nationalism means going around with a red-and-white band around
their head and doing horrible things to people.'' Red and white are
the colors of the Indonesian flag.
</P>
<P>
   Many other officers express bewilderment, said Salim Said, a
prominent expert on military affairs. Criticized from all sides for
doing what they believed to be their job, pressed to withdraw from
politics without a thank you, they now are uncertain of their
mission. Oddly, he said, little has been done legislatively to
redefine the proper role of the military; the institution has been
expected to create its own reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dinner with a general last night,'' Salim said, ``and he
told me: `What is important for us is the confidence to do our job.
We need to know what is allowed and what is not allowed today.
Because we do not want to end up like our superiors who were doing
their jobs in East Timor and then were accused of human rights
violations.'''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of military abuses in East Timor are at the heart of
the military's problems today, although they are not the first or
the only arena in which the military faces criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, separate investigations by an Indonesian government
panel and by the United Nations found five top generals _ including
Wiranto _ at fault for the violence and destruction that followed
East Timor's vote for independence from Indonesia last August.
Wahid immediately called on Wiranto to resign. The general says he
wants to make his case directly to the president before deciding
what to do, and the president has begun to talk vaguely about
promising him an eventual pardon if he is tried and convicted of
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But looking around them as they face this challenge from a newly
confident civilian government, military officers have found few
expressions of public support.
</P>
<P>
   What is most dangerous, say some local analysts, is the
possibility of a backlash by at least some elements of the military
as they realize how isolated they have become and see their
economic power and social privileges threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many analysts believe that disaffected officers may be
instigating much of the current unrest in an attempt to preserve
their local power or destabilize the central government.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, unpopular as it may have become, the military remains
an essential fixture in Indonesian society. Juwono Sudarsono, a
major symbol of reform as the country's first civilian defense
minister in 40 years, noted recently that the civilian government
was still not ready to take over the broad political and
administrative functions the military has performed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he called the armed forces ``the most
organized, or at least the least disorganized, of all the
disorganized elements in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he warned publicly: ``If civilian leaders are not able
to develop a healthy and independent political life, then we will
sooner or later return to a military-dominated role just like in
Pakistan and some African states.
</P>
<P>
   ``So objectively, as an observer and not as a minister, I have
to say that at least for the next 10 years turmoil is still
unavoidable here, although it would not be as frequent and severe
as we expected.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Even with the constitutional and legal status of the military
still unchanged and its powerful regional commands still exercising
local control, its influence has been steadily whittled away over
the last year or more. Its parliamentary voting bloc has been cut
in half, to 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Its abuses in the provinces of Aceh, Irian Jaya and elsewhere
have come under investigation, along with its role in political
killings and kidnappings here in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   And Wahid has acted to undercut to power of the most politically
aggressive service, the army, by appointing naval and air force
officers to a number of key posts, including the armed forces chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In a move three weeks ago that crystallized the shifting balance
of power, Wahid fired the military's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Sudrajat,
who had frequently been critical of his policies. In one of his
last, injudicious statements, the general had posed what seemed to
be a direct challenge to civilian authority, asserting that the
president ``does not have the right to interfere in the affairs of
the military.''

CONGO'S WAR OVERSHADOWS TRIBAL FIGHT

<P>
   BUNIA, Congo _ Another ethnic war is erupting in central Africa,
this time a tribal conflict in Congo fought mostly with machetes
and barbed arrows that nurses in a hospital near here collect in a
little white box. Some of the barbs are still covered with blood
and flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Like ethnic conflicts around the globe, this is fundamentally a
fight between brothers: the two tribes _ the Hema and the Lendu _
speak the same language, marry each other and compete for the same
remote and thickly populated land in northeastern Congo, on the
western bank of Lake Albert.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last seven months, at least 2,000 people have been
killed, possibly as many as 7,000. In one massacre last month _
recorded in a horrifying video _ a reported 416 Hema were
slaughtered. The fighting has pushed at least 150,000 people from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war within a war, a conflict that has spun out of
control because of the much larger fighting inside Congo. The
Congolese state has degraded so much that no authority is strong
enough to step in. This territory is controlled by one of three
rebel groups _ arguably the weakest _ fighting to oust Congo's
president, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no government,'' said the Rev. Desire Ngodjolo, a
41-year-old Roman Catholic priest outside the town of Drodro, whose
parish grounds have become the home for 4,000 Hema refugees.
``There is just a rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, there are allegations that rogue soldiers from
neighboring Uganda _ the real power in this region and one of five
outside nations with troops inside Congo _ have not only sided with
the Hema in this conflict but have killed Lendu for hire. If true,
it would represent yet another way that Ugandan soldiers have
profited from the war in Congo, which began in August 1998. So far,
they have been accused of smuggling out diamonds, gold, coffee and
ivory.
</P>
<P>
   John Nagenda, an aide to the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni,
called the allegation ``absolute rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree 100 percent with the Lusaka peace accord and
therefore have no interest in pouring flames on an already hot
situation,'' he said, referring to the peace document signed in the
capital of Zambia last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, local authorities here say that one Ugandan commander,
along with Congolese soldiers, had been hired by Hema to harass and
kill Lendu. Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity group,
noted in a recent report that most gunshot wounds they treated were
suffered by Lendu _ suggesting superior firepower on the Hema side.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Depelchin, a leader of the rebel group the Congolese
Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement, said that battalion was
replaced in November. Since then, he said, there have been far
fewer reports of Ugandan soldiers helping Hema.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does happen occasionally, but it is against policy,'' he
said. ``And when it does happen, these people are removed and
punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduard Dz'ba Ngorima, a Lendu chief in the village of Saliboko,
north of Bunia, said much the same thing: Attacks on Lendu had
included Ugandan and Congolese soldiers, though less commonly now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know why they gave a measure of support to the
Hema,'' he said, standing a few hundred yards from mounds of fresh
graves and Lendu huts burned to bits of charred rubble from a Hema
attack in January. But, he said, since the new soldiers arrived,
``the situation is becoming a little more normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Hema have received help from Ugandans, the Lendu do
not appear to be helpless victims: Lendu warriors have carried out
large massacres, banding together in well-organized groups wearing
sneakers and soccer uniforms, killing women and children, and
mutilating corpses. Even though the conflict has been simmering
since May, it was brought to the vivid attention of the outside
world last month because of two videos of Hema victims of Lendu
massacres. The videos were shot by a worker for a local aid group,
the Evangelical Medical Center, and were sent to journalists and
aid groups by another aid group, Christian Blind Mission.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the two videos documents a massacre in Blukwa,
about 40 miles north of Bunia, on Jan. 9. In all, 416 Hema were
reportedly killed, and the video shows the remains of about 35 of
them lying in straw mats in a church. A child is disemboweled;
women's throats are cut; several victims appear to be missing
brains.
</P>
<P>
   One boy who survived is Singo Losukpa, 8, a Hema who sat in a
hospital bed in Drodro with bandages on his head and arm covering
hacks from a machete. His mother, Mandesi Bussi, 32, said she ran
from the village when the Lendu attacked. Three of her five
children were killed. She thought Singo was too, but she found him
among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running with my bags,'' he said. ``When I got to the
road I was surprised by three Lendu people.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been periodic outbreaks of violence between the Hema
and the Lendu at least since 1910, and in its broadest outlines,
the tension resembles that between the Tutsi and Hutu in nearby
Rwanda and Burundi. That tension led to the killing of at least
500,000 Tutsi in 1994 in Rwanda. An estimated 200,000 people have
died in the civil war in Burundi since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Lendu, like the Hutu, are Bantu farmers who have lived in
the region for many centuries. The Hema, like the Tutsi, apparently
migrated from areas around the Nile more recently, though still
hundreds of years ago. Like the Tutsi, the Hema tend to be richer,
in this case farming plantations of cattle and coffee once owned by
Belgian colonialists. The Lendu outnumber the Hema, though it is
unclear by how much. Some estimates say there are 400,000 Lendu and
350,000 Hema. Others estimates are that there are several times as
many Lendu as Hema.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities and aid groups say the recent violence began
when a few rich Hema sought to extend the reach of their
plantations onto land occupied by Lendu.
</P>
<P>
   Depelchin, from the rebel group, said that tensions were made
worse by the governor of Ituri province, a woman named Adele Mugisa
Lotsove, a Hema who he said was working to expand her ethnic
group's power in the region. She has since been replaced by a man
who is neither Hema nor Lendu.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Lendu or Hema have killed more people.
Depelchin said he believes the numbers of dead are roughly equal _
though declining, he said, because of mediation efforts by the
rebels and peacekeeping missions by Ugandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but steadily, we are moving toward peace,'' he said.
But there is much anger, mistrust and a thirst for revenge
</P>
<P>
   Villagers near Saliboko said 41 Lendu were killed by Hema,
including soldiers, on Jan. 10, a day after the massacre of Hema in
Blukwa. A Lendu named Batse Chulo, 25, stood in front of the
destroyed mud hut that belonged to his father. He said his
grandfather died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not think the fighting was over yet. He said,
``Some Hema just came by in a car and said, `When the soldiers
leave, the war will start again.'''

AFRICANS WANT U.N. TO PLAY MORE FORCEFUL ROLE IN CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGO-ETHNIC-WARS)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ African governments, unable to bring about a
cease-fire in the widening war in eastern Congo, want the United
Nations to take on the job of disarming combatants, diplomats from
the region say. They also want a peacekeeping force much larger
than the 5,537-member mission now being proposed in an
American-sponsored Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in danger of losing everything if there is no
provision to have these armed groups disarmed,'' said Dumisani
Kumalo, South Africa's representative to the United Nations.
``Without the threat of being disarmed by force, they'll never lay
down arms. This whole thing can unravel, and the United Nations
will get blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is likely to ask the South Africans, who
consider themselves neutral in a war that has involved at least
half a dozen nations, to provide half the planned armed force _ two
of four battalions of 250 soldiers each. That is a total of 1,000
armed troops to protect 500 military observers and a support staff
of about 4,000 medical, administrative and service personnel
scattered around a country one-third the size of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   African diplomats say the size of the force should be
reconsidered, but have made no specific proposals for increasing
the number of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative, who has to persuade Congress to pay the U.S. share
of the mission, demanded an exact number of people to be deployed,
which accounts for the unusually precise figure of 5,537. The
proposed mission carries a start-up cost of $41 million, with no
estimates of the amount it would eventually cost. The United States
is billed 31 percent of any peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   The armed battalions would not be authorized to disarm fighters
or otherwise involve themselves in the war, which pits rebels
allied with Rwanda and Uganda against forces fielded or backed by
Congo's president, Laurent Kabila. U.N. officials and U.S.
diplomats agree that combatants should be disarmed only after
fighting has stopped and peacekeepers can begin to separate the
forces. By then, U.N. officials and Security Council members say,
they hope that political talks between Kabila and his enemies will
have begun.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting shows no sign of receding, however, despite a peace
agreement signed last July in Lusaka, Zambia, by nations whose
troops are involved in the fighting _ though not by most of the
unofficial armies on both sides. Friday, in Geneva, a spokesman for
the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said that more people fled
Congo for Tanzania last week. The refugees say they are being
dislodged from looted homes as rebels fighting ethnic groups loyal
to Kabila have disrupted life in Sud-Kivu province.
</P>
<P>
   Africans may agree on the need for disarmament, but they do not
agree on which forces must be dealt with first, and where they
should be moved once disarmed. One factor complicating
deliberations here is the fact that sub-Saharan Africa's lone voice
on the Security Council this year belongs to Namibia, which has
sent troops to back Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members say that as daily negotiations proceed
on sending peacekeepers to Congo, the Rwandan and Ugandan
governments are asking that the United Nations make a priority of
disarming the Hutu Interahamwe militias and soldiers from the
former Hutu-led army of Rwanda still in Congo, where they were
driven after a Tutsi-led army seized power in Rwanda in 1994. The
Hutu militias in particular include many fighters thought to be
involved in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi and
their moderate Hutu defenders in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that we don't repeat the mistakes of
Rwanda over and over again,'' said Kumalo of South Africa, arguing
for comprehensive disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Some African diplomats say that Kabila is recruiting the
Interahamwe and former army troops, who are then trained by
Zimbabwean officers fighting for the Congo president. This raises
fears in the region that the Hutu forces might become too powerful
in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Hutu gain the upper hand in Congo, said Joseph W.
Mutaboba, Rwanda's representative, it would be ``the worst
nightmare'' for the Rwandans. Rwanda wants the armed Hutu exiles
rounded up and returned or moved somewhere well away from Rwanda's
borders and Kabila's recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   On his side, Kabila is demanding that the United Nations disarm
rebel groups backed by Rwanda and Uganda. He describes the fighting
as not a civil war but an attempt to repel an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating diplomatic and peacekeeping efforts are Kabila's
objections to the presence of South Africans in Congo. He accuses
them of siding with Rwanda, which the South Africans deny. South
Africa faces the delicate task of dealing with Rwanda while trying
not to increase tensions with its neighbors, Zimbabwe and Namibia,
which back Kabila.

 &HT;    Filmmaker's creative license revoked
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ These days, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee has more to worry about than plane hijackings, arch-foe
Pakistan and nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his government announced a much-awaited visit to India
by President Clinton to discuss security issues _ the first visit
by a U.S. president since Jimmy Carter _ Vajpayee was busy
reviewing, well, a script for a film.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta's latest project, ``Water,'' has
turned into a deluge of controversy in the country of her birth.
The film, the last of a trilogy, depicts an outcast Hindu widow's
attempt to rejoin conservative society in 1930s India. But even
before a single scene was shot, Mehta and her film were in hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu radicals claim Mehta is grossly distorting traditions, and
after weeks of protests, angry mobs ransacked the sets the day
shooting was to begin. Mehta was even called a prostitute and
burned in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing. Very absurd,'' said director Gautam
Ghose, who faced similar opposition when he made ``Antarjali
Jatra,'' a film that explored the practice of sati, in which widows
burn themselves to death in their husband's funeral pyre. ``As a
filmmaker, you have to be tactful. There are plenty of sensitive
issues here _ it's a very complex country.''
</P>
<P>
   But tact has not gotten Mehta very far.
</P>
<P>
   Following the attack on the sets of ``Water,'' the government of
Uttar Pradesh state, ruled by Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, withdrew permission to make the film in
Varanasi. The city along the banks of the Ganges, about 400 miles
southeast of New Delhi, is one of India's oldest and holiest. In
the period in which ``Water'' is set, many Hindu widows sought
refuge in ashrams or homes in Varanasi after being turned out by
their families because of superstition that staying with widows
brings bad luck. Widows were often made to shave their heads, wear
only white, eat one meal a day and be confined to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   With production stopped at a loss of $50,000 a day, a desperate
Mehta flew to New Delhi to make a personal appeal to the prime
minister to save her project. That's when Vajpayee stepped in,
giving his approval after Mehta agreed to an altered script. Five
``offensive'' lines were removed from the script including one that
read: ``There is no difference between widows and prostitutes. Both
are soiled goods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this puts an end to the controversy,'' said Mehta, who
was finally able to start filming last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It did not.
</P>
<P>
   Production halted again the next day when a Hindu radical
belonging to the Shiv Sena nationalist organization weighted
himself down with rocks and plunged into the Ganges in an attempted
suicide to protest the film. On Monday, a group of Shiv Sainiks
threatened self-immolation if Mehta's crew did not leave Varanasi
immediately. The district magistrate then ordered a 15-day
postponement of production and asked the film crew to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   We can't shoot anymore. We have to pack up and go. This is very
disappointing,'' said Mehta, who accused the Hindu radical of being
a professional in attempted suicides. She said the man had tried to
kill himself three times before in the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Several fundamentalist groups such as the Shiv Sena and Vishwa
Hindu Parishad have publicly vowed to put an end to Mehta's film.
They say a few altered lines are not good enough: The very theme of
the film tarnishes the image of Indian women.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy is new neither to Indian cinema nor to Deepa Mehta.
Her film, ``Fire,'' enraged Indian audiences for showing a lesbian
relationship that develops between two women bound by tradition and
trapped in bad marriages. But if Mehta thought she could put out
``Fire'' with ``Water,'' she was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And now a disconcerted artists' community in India a serious
threat to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is plain hooliganism and illiteracy in the garb of Hindu
militancy,'' said Indranil Chakravarti, Indian coordinator for the
European Union-India Media Meeting Point, a EU-financed forum for
cross-cultural film and television production. ``It seems like we
are moving towards an official declaration of India as a Hindu
state just as Pakistan is Islamic. That is what I find offensive.
The brouhaha is a total negation of the idea of India.''
</P>
<P>
   Though India is the world's largest democracy, the federal
government maintains tight control over the film industry, which
churns out more films each year than Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign filmmakers are required to obtain clearance from the
Information and Broadcast Ministry before beginning production.
Steven Spielberg, for example, was denied permission to shoot
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' here because the script
was considered to show India in a poor light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to check the script to see if there is anything
detrimental to India,'' a ministry official told The Statesman, an
English-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a film is given initial clearance _ as was ``Water'' _
it could still run into trouble later. Director Louis Malle was
allowed to shoot ``Phantom India'' here, but the film has yet to be
screened in the country. And ``City Of Joy'' encountered all sorts
of production problems after the state government decided the
cinematic version of Dominique Lapierre's story was not a
flattering portrayal of Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   ```City of Joy' was not my cup of tea. But it doesn't matter.
The film should be allowed to be made,'' said Calcutta filmmaker
Mrinal Sen. ``If the film is bad, the heavens are not going to fall
on the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Moni Basu, an assistant international editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, is currently on assignment in Calcutta, her
hometown.

 &HT;    Murder suspect in Atlanta slayings talked of rich pals
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ At the Garfield's Phase II Beauty Salon, Reginald
``A.J.'' Oakley was known to brag about the celebrities he knew.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was buddies with Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, movie
star Denzel Washington and members of the R&AMP;B group Dru Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The barbers who worked for Oakley figured it was all talk. They
used to tease him by asking why he didn't bring any of his
superstar buddies to the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the neighborhood was too bad to bring celebrities
to,'' said Kevin Parker, 32, a barber who used to work for Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Oakley, whom Atlanta police described as ``armed
and dangerous,'' has been charged along with Lewis with murder,
Parker said he guesses Oakley must have been telling a little truth
about knowing Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Just how he knew the football star is a mystery in the Pimlico
neighborhood of northwest Baltimore where Oakley operated a
barbershop for more than three years. Police say the neighborhood
is known for street drug sales.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, a boy who looked to be 13 offered ``weed'' to
people walking the streets. Restaurants barricade their workers
behind thick plexiglass and pass customers' food to them through a
drawer similar to what all-night gas stations use.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's barbershop is padlocked. He stopped paying rent in
August. Even when the business was open, Oakley wasn't too good
about paying his rent on time, said Taylor Lee, owner of the
building where Oakley rented his shop for $425 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while a check would bounce. I'd have to come and
collect cash,'' Lee said Friday. ``He'd say he had a problem with
his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wife? He didn't have a wife,'' Parker chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Parker worked for Oakley for two years. It was a tough two
years, Parker said. Most of the other barbers quit rather than work
for Oakley, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was he like? He was a low-down, dirty shame,'' Parker
said. ``He would even get into brawls with people over their
business. He could never keep barbers in there, never.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Parker's customers, Tony Downs, said Oakley once gave him
trouble because he stopped by to say hello to Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exchanged words. We almost got into a fight,'' Downs said.
``But I left. I didn't want to go to jail for hurting that boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Oakley would talk about having spent time in prison
for a drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Department of Corrections records show Oakley _
who was born in Granville County, N.C., and once lived in Charlotte
_ has been in prison. In 1991, he was convicted of assaulting a
police officer, resisting arrest and speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said that for a time Oakley drove a Toyota Celica, but
talked about becoming a big-time record and movie producer. Then he
started driving a new BMW.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got money,'' Parker said. ``He can get out of town and
hide out with someone for a while, easy.''

<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ This is the last frontier, the place
where the suburban sprawl of Los Angeles meets a peaceful patch of
live oaks, rolling hills and quiet back roads along the Santa Clara
River, one of a tiny handful of wild waterways left in Southern
California. It is also a battle zone, the future home of Newhall
Ranch, the largest housing development ever approved by Los Angeles
County, with 21,600 units for 70,000 people to be built over the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To its critics, including neighboring Ventura County, which has
filed a lawsuit seeking to block it, Newhall Ranch is a symbol of
all that is wrong with California's decades of catch-as-catch-can
development, in which suburbs sprang up in ever-widening,
ill-considered rings.
</P>
<P>
   To its backers, Newhall Ranch is a sensitively planned
community, the vision of a responsible developer with a long track
record of building affordable slices of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   But as big and controversial as it may be, Newhall Ranch is
nothing compared with the projected need for new housing in Los
Angeles County: about 25,000 units a year, according to the
Southern California Association of Governments.
</P>
<P>
   By 2025, the state's population of 34 million is projected to
grow by 18 million more (a whole New York state), and that of the
Los Angeles region by 6 million (or two Chicagos).
</P>
<P>
   That pace would exceed the boom years of the 1950s, '60s and
'70s combined in absolute numbers, though not in percentage. New
Californians are being born or moving into the state at the rate of
1,700 a day, or roughly one every 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A.'s so big that you can take the biggest project anybody's
ever conceived of, and it is, in regional terms, only a drop in the
bucket,'' said William Fulton, an urban planner, ``which shows you
how hard it is to meet the need with traditional suburban
development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?'' asked Fulton, the author of ``The
Reluctant Metropolis: The Politics of Urban Growth in Los
Angeles.'' ``Build 200 Newhall Ranches? The truth is, with 6
million people, growth has got to be both up and out.''
</P>
<P>
   That is easier said than done in a place where even residents of
modest means have long viewed a patch of yard and sky, a lemon tree
and maybe even a swimming pool as all but a birthright, and the
fight over Newhall Ranch is proof positive of how hard it will be
to change the paradigm. Planners and politicians may talk of
``urban infill'' and ``downtown redevelopment,'' but Los Angeles
has been steadily sprawling for more than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least the mid-'70s, residents of established
neighborhoods have consistently opposed construction of
higher-density apartment complexes, leaving developers little
choice but to build in fringe areas like those near Santa Clarita,
a collection of old farming towns northwest of Los Angeles that
have been consolidated into the fourth-largest city in the county,
with nearly 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Los Angeles, it's part of our culture to aspire to live in
open spaces in single-family homes,'' said Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky of Los Angeles County. Yaroslavsky, a Democrat,
acknowledged that it pained him to vote for a project as big as
Newhall last year but felt he had little choice, given his own
constituents' opposition to living any closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to live in skyscrapers like New York,'' he
said. ``People fled New York to come here, and once you've lived in
a single-family house with your own back yard, you're basically not
interested in moving back to what amounts to a Holiday Inn-like
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The population of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, which
make up the ``Inland Empire'' east of Los Angeles, has roughly
doubled since 1980, making the area the fastest-growing part of the
region, and the population there is expect to double again in the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such explosive growth has ignited widespread anxiety, and a
recent statewide survey by the Public Policy Institute of
California found that four in 10 residents said they believed the
state would be a worse place to live in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Newhall Ranch, to be built in an unincorporated
area of Los Angeles County, has put the debate over urban sprawl
into particularly sharp relief because the project abuts the border
of Ventura County, an agricultural enclave that is Southern
California's least populated. For years, Ventura has looked askance
at growth and recently adopted some of the most stringent
anti-growth measures in the nation, which generally require voter
approval to rezone farmland or open space for development, or to
expand cities beyond their existing boundaries. Fulton, the
planner, calls this conflict the region's Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land &AMP; Farming Co., the 117-year-old real estate and
ranching concern that is developing the project, says it is merely
keeping pace with realities and demand by building Newhall Ranch,
which is to be divided roughly between single-family houses with
prices up to $1 million and town houses and rental apartments.
Newhall began developing some of the 36,000 acres it owns in the
area more than 30 years ago after county tax assessors, watching
the northward growth from the San Fernando Valley, raised
assessments on what had long been agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The result was the planned town of Valencia, a still-growing
leafy haven that boasts two office parks, two industrial parks and
a pedestrian-friendly Town Center mall that is the shopping and
entertainment hub for the Santa Clarita Valley.
</P>
<P>
   This suburb, first settled by workers in the aerospace industry
who were attracted by the short commute to places like the Lockheed
plant in Burbank, is now home to many support workers and
technicians in the entertainment industry, and to high-tech types
who work in the office parks of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita
Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all that you would hear, and the outcries about
development,'' a house ``is still the American dream,'' said Thomas
L. Lee, chairman and chief executive of Newhall, which expects that
about half the buyers for Newhall Ranch houses will come from the
Santa Clarita Valley itself. ``We're providing homes to people who
just want a piece of the American dream like everybody else. The
large majority of people want to live that way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lee added: ``The people are going to be here, whether the
housing is here or not. They already have a serious problem in Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of Newhall's plans point out that much of the demand
for housing in the region is among the growing Hispanic and
immigrant populations of urban Los Angeles, where families are
doubled up in apartments and cannot yet afford suburban houses.
(Hispanic residents were the only group in the recent Public Policy
Institute survey that said the state would be a better place to
live in 20 years). At the same time, Newhall's opponents note that
some 40,000 additional housing units have already been approved but
not built in Santa Clarita, and they would like to see these
developed before builders encroach on pristine land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just vaporizing your open space and watershed and
indiscriminately paving it over for something that I can't see as a
genuine need,'' said Lynne Plambeck, first vice president of the
Santa Clarita Organization for Planning and Environment. The
organization is part of a coalition of several environmental
groups, Ventura County and the state attorney general's office that
challenged Newhall's environmental review as inadequate, especially
in its analysis of water supplies for the new development. A trial
in the case is set for next month in a state court.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of opposition, Newhall scaled back the project from
the originally planned 25,000 units, and it has set aside about 10
percent of the units as lower-income housing and promised to
preserve about nine square miles of the 19-square-mile project as
open space.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics have dismissed the concessions and contend that
Newhall Ranch would damage the delicate ecosystem of the Santa
Clara River and threaten birds and other wildlife, as well as the
flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel like sometimes it's a situation where if you
don't build it, they won't come,'' Plambeck said, reversing the
``Field of Dreams'' formulation.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is not quite so simple, and the growing population's
demands on state roads, schools, bridges and public transportation
are already a concern. Newhall itself expects to pay tens of
millions of dollars in the coming years for highway improvements.
But statewide investment in public facilities has lagged since the
tax revolt of the late '70s, which was itself fostered in part by
local opposition to apartment construction. That caused housing
shortages that led real estate prices _ and, eventually, property
tax assessments _ to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build fences around communities in areas that are
adjacent to the high job-growth areas of the state, you're not
going to meet your housing needs, period,'' said Tim Coyle, the
California Building Industry Association's chief lobbyist. ``The
politics of antigrowth initiatives not only limit housing, but
ultimately they're hostile to the economic and social interests of
the citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians, like Philip Angelides, the state treasurer,
have proposed investments aimed at rebuilding neighborhoods. As a
member of state public employee pension boards, for example,
Angelides has voted to invest $1 billion in pension funds in urban
real estate development, and he has restructured tax credits to
make $450 million a year available for construction and
rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take the view that even the most robust of public
policies is really powerful enough to shape growth patterns,''
Angelides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But clearly, their absence will result in a situation in which
we're the victims of unplanned growth. As long as we remain
productive and attractive, we will have that growth demographic.
Our challenge is how do we maintain the livability and quality of
life that brought residents and economic vitality in the first
place.''

Clinton administration has told states to evaluate hundreds of
thousands of people in nursing homes, mental hospitals and state
institutions to see whether they could be receiving care in their
own homes or elsewhere in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy statement with far-reaching implications, the
administration has informed states that to comply with the court
ruling they will almost certainly have to provide more medical and
social services and shift more people out of institutions and into
small group homes or apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``No person should have to live in a nursing home or other
institution if he or she can live in his or her community,'' Donna
Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said in a
letter sent last month to all governors. Moreover, she said,
``unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities
is discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act.''
</P>
<P>
   People with disabilities welcomed the administration's action,
saying it would help them enforce their rights. But state officials
said the federal policy went beyond the court ruling and could
impose substantial new costs on states.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials said that compliance would cost tens of
millions of dollars in individual states and could cost over $2
billion a year nationwide. Federal officials said they had no
immediate estimate of how much it would cost states to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has some power to force states to comply
with its new instructions, both because the states are required to
meet federal standards as a condition of receiving Medicaid money
and because the federal government enforces the Americans With
Disabilities Act. But officials said they would prefer that the
states cooperate in developing acceptable practices.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave institutions to live in the community often
need housing assistance, job training, medical care and personal
attendants to help them with everyday activities. Many people spend
years in institutions because these kinds of services are not
available in less restrictive settings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they wanted to know about any disabled
person being unnecessarily confined to an institution, and they
promised to investigate every complaint. They said they had
received 43 complaints from people in 20 states. But the number of
people eventually affected by the policy would be vastly greater.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court case, Olmstead vs. L.C., involved two Georgia
women, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, who had been confined to a
state institution for years, even though doctors had said they
could receive appropriate care for their conditions _ mental
retardation and mental illnesses _ in their community.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 decision last June, the court said, ``States are
required to provide community-based treatment for persons with
mental disabilities when the state's treatment professionals
determine that such placement is appropriate,'' considering a
state's resources and the needs of other people with mental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials contend that the ruling applies to people of
all ages with all types of disabilities in all institutions and all
state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Auberger, a co-founder of Adapt, an advocacy group
for disabled people, said state officials ``see the Olmstead
decision as potentially busting the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   William Waldman, who represents state officials as executive
director of the American Public Human Services Association, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling has deep and profound implications for all
states,'' Waldman said. ``It affects not only people in state
psychiatric hospitals and centers for the mentally retarded, but
also people in nursing homes and children in institutions who want
to live somewhere else. States can redirect spending from
institutions to community services. But very likely there will also
be new expenses for states.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration policy, combined with the Supreme
Court decision, is likely to lead to tangible changes in the lives
of people with disabilities. Even before the court decision, state
officials had been moving fitfully to increase community-based
care, but the wait for such services exceeds eight years in some
states.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal policy ``will force states to step up the
pace,'' said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy
at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   In its letters to state officials, the Clinton administration
made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Supreme Court ruling applies not just to people with
mental impairments but also to those with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ruling applies not just to people in state institutions
but also to Medicaid recipients in private nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ruling applies not only to people in institutions but also
to people who are living at home and might have to enter an
institution if they do not receive proper services.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration told states it expected them to
evaluate ``all individuals with disabilities in institutional
settings (such as state institutions, intermediate care facilities
for the mentally retarded, nursing facilities, psychiatric
hospitals and residential service facilities for children)'' to see
if their needs could be met in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Roger M. Auerbach, a senior official at the Oregon Department of
Human Services, said he was ``surprised at the broad interpretation
that the federal government has given to the Olmstead decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, a lawyer who is vice chairman of the National
Association of State Medicaid Directors, said, ``In a huge majority
of cases, serving people in the community is much less expensive
than serving the same people in an institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Clinton administration's reading of the law
could increase costs overall because it could require states to
serve a larger population, including disabled people in their
communities who have not received services they need.
</P>
<P>
   Ira A. Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental
Health Law, an advocacy group, said states should not be allowed to
``claim poverty'' as an excuse for not providing community care,
but should try to get more money from Medicaid, state legislatures
and other sources.

</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision has prompted advocates for the
disabled to file other suits, helped them win lower-court judgments
and put new pressure on states to settle pending cases. Recently,
advocates for the disabled have won court victories in Hawaii,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, Judge Robert C. Chambers of U.S. District
Court ordered the state to eliminate long delays in providing
community services to people who were mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the New York State Health Department said they were
still reviewing the Clinton administration's letters and had not
decided how to respond. Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the
department, said the number of people in state institutions had
declined sharply in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah J. Gilmour, a disability rights lawyer in Rochester,
N.Y., said: ``Thousands of people now in institutions in New York
should be receiving home health care or personal care in their own
homes. So far the state has done nothing to respond to the Olmstead
decision.'' Disability rights advocates will soon file complaints
about the state's inaction with the civil rights office of the
federal Department of Health and Human Services, Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many states have tried to increase community
care, but advocates for the disabled say that spending still favors
institutions. Nationwide, Medicaid spending on long-term care
totaled $59 billion in 1998. Seventy-five percent of that sum was
for institutional care, while 25 percent was for community care.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not known as a leader in health and human services, but
is ahead of many other states in responding to the Supreme Court
decision. It has developed a plan to identify people in
institutions who could be served in their communities, and it is
setting a timetable for action.
</P>
<P>
   Experts suggest several reasons for the state's progress. Texas
has a strong coalition of disability rights groups. Gov. George W.
Bush is running for president. And his father signed the law that
the Clinton administration is now enforcing.

 &HT;    Bush in critical phase of campaign
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, his big-budget and
big-buddies presidential campaign hanging in the balance, is
entering nine days that could go a long way toward determining
whether he will become a president or a poster boy for political
underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the most important stretch of his political
career, Bush is battling toward crucial showdowns with Sen. John
McCain in South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona, his foe's home
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will tell us whether the race will be over quickly or
whether this is going to be a divisive battle with both candidates
winning some states all the way through,'' University of Virginia
political scientist Larry Sabato said of the coming contests.
</P>
<P>
   At a South Carolina campaign stop Friday, Bush worded it a
little differently:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, during times of adversity, you get to find out who
your real friends are,'' he said, confident that things are going
his way because ``the crowds are big and enthusiastic. ... I'm less
windy on the speeches, more windy on the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, a prohibitive front-runner for the nomination until
people started voting, the goal is simple: Prevent the ``bump in
the road'' caused by McCain's big win in New Hampshire from turning
into a full-blown detour to two more years in the Governor's
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Republicans _ and independents and Democrats, who
are not barred from participating in the GOP primary _ go to the
primary polls Saturday. The outcome there could have major impact
in Michigan and Arizona, where voting is set for Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Steve Forbes' exit from the race, the upcoming
contests are largely one-on-one battles, though Alan Keyes is still
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Though each state primary is a separate contest, all evidence
indicates that a win in one state can spark momentum in the next.
McCain trailed Bush by about 20 points in most South Carolina polls
until he whipped Bush in New Hampshire. Now the polls show a tight
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's suppose that McCain wins South Carolina,'' said Sabato,
``he would then almost certainly win Michigan and Arizona. Virginia
then becomes Bush's next big chance to stop McCain and I don't know
whether he can or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Republicans vote Feb. 29, the last major test before
the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' contests in 12 states, including
California and New York, and the March 14 contests in Texas,
Florida and four other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins most everything, obviously it's over for Bush
and I assume he would withdraw shortly after March 14,'' Sabato
said. ``If on the other hand McCain is turned back, he would run
out of money and he would have to withdraw by the 14th.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, three losses in the next nine days might start a
domino tumble that would be hard to halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, although it's not quite panic time, it is time
to fish or cut bait before you lose another primary and get a real
black eye,'' University of Texas government Professor Bruce
Buchanan said of Bush, the man with the money and endorsements.
``It would certainly not be a flattering story told of him if he
managed to blow this lead with these advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, pre-New Hampshire, when Bush victories in
South Carolina and Michigan, combined with a tight race in Arizona,
might have been enough to knock McCain out and effectively hand the
nomination to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, buoyed by the New Hampshire win, McCain seems
poised to ride it out unless Bush wins big in the upcoming
contests, something no polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain are sparing no energy or expense in South
Carolina. Both plan to be there all week, highlighted by a Tuesday
night debate that has the potential for full-contact politics from
two men who spent much of the previous debates telling people how
much they like and respect each other.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina battle has the Bush campaign in a
hunkered-down mode that differs from the less-intense attitude that
prevailed in New Hampshire. Bush, adopting a tone he declined to
use against former Gov. Ann Richards in his 1994 race and didn't
need in his 1998 re-election contest against Garry Mauro, is
attacking McCain personally, as an underachieving senator guilty of
some of the campaign finance abuses he curses.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming battles also will test the prognostication
abilities of Bush political strategist Karl Rove, who said last
month there was no way McCain could win the nomination. Rove's
confidence was based on the campaign ``firewall'' theory that said
any of several states _ including South Carolina and Michigan _
were solidly for Bush and would stem any McCain wildfire ignited
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The race also will hit another major milestone sometime in
coming weeks. For now, it's a battle for momentum. The goal is to
drive foes out of the race by piling up victories.
</P>
<P>
   But if no pattern develops and each candidate picks up some
wins, it becomes a numbers game as the contenders work toward
piling up the 1,034 delegates it takes to win the nomination at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, only 307 delegates will have been
awarded. But by March 14, 1,301 will have been doled out.
</P>
<P>
   If, somehow, McCain and Bush both keep piling up delegates, the
GOP faces the unpleasant prospect (''nightmarte scenario,'' says
Sabato) of a national convention at which the nomination might
still be in doubt.

 &HT;    NAACP urges Texas officials to remove Confederate flag from
buildings, plaque
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ John Evans Jr. isn't about to get sucked into
the controversy over the Confederate battle flag. For the
67-year-old Austinite, it is a symbol without any power in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an old man born in 1932 who went through all that Jim
Crow stuff, the flag's not important,'' said Evans, who is
African-American. ``I know the controversy. People are bitter, but
what's happened has d. People need to get their minds and
hearts together.''
</P>
<P>
   But 135 years after the Civil War ended, the Confederate battle
flag still resonates deeply with many people, either as a symbol of
heritage and those who fought for the Confederacy or as a reminder
of slavery and a symbol of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence on a plaque in the Texas Supreme Court building and
its use as a mascot at several high schools have brought the flag
under attack in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which has urged Americans to boycott South Carolina for flying the
Confederate battle flag over its Capitol, wants Texas leaders to
remove the plaque at the Supreme Court building, which was built in
the 1950s with money from the Confederate Pension Fund. The group
also wants the flag banned from schools and other public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The battle flag) symbolizes slavery, racism, and division,
and also disloyalty,'' said Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP's
Texas chapter.
</P>
<P>
   For 24-year-old University of Texas student Sabrina Everett, who
also African-American, the flag represents ``all the oppression
that the white South still wants us to be under.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of view saddens Ralph Green, the former commander in
chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an international group
dedicated to confederate heritage whose members have family ties to
confederate veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the flag symbolizes heritage, but has been misused by
hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, it's simply a symbol of my heritage, my history,''
said Green, who lives in Fairview, north of Dallas. ``It's not a
white flag, it's not a black flag, it's the flag of a nation, and I
hate to see it used to divide people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the national Confederate flag, a red, white, and blue
flag with three stripes and seven stars in a circle, is featured
across the state in displays of the six flags that have flown over
Texas, Bledsoe said the NAACP is focusing on the battle flag. With
its distinctive ``southern cross,'' Bledsoe said the flag ``has
been utilized by hate groups that preach that (minorities) should
be eliminated from the face of America for no other reason than for
being what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he isn't planning to file a lawsuit, ``but I hope
people will do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state leaders who have responded to the NAACP's
request don't seem convinced a flag ban is the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush has faced numerous questions about his stand
on Confederate symbols during his presidential campaign. Bush has
said South Carolina's citizens should decide whether to continue
flying the Confederate battle flag in their state.
</P>
<P>
   When the NAACP asked for his support in removing the Supreme
Court building plaque, Clay Johnson, Bush's executive assistant,
sent the group a letter saying the governor supports posting an
explanation for why the plaque, and a second plaque bearing the
seal of the Confederacy, are displayed. Johnson wrote that the
reason for the plaques should be better explained.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP has not targeted the second plaque.
</P>
<P>
   The state General Services Commission is working on the
explanatory plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said last month he won't enter the divisive
debate, adding, ``like it or not, the Confederacy is part of our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said the Texas Education Agency and state board of
education have an obligation to make sure the Confederate battle
flag isn't displayed at public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Education Agency does not have the power to order
schools to stop using the battle flag, said TEA spokesman Debbie
Ratcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the education agency ordered Robert E. Lee High
School in Tyler to stop using the Confederate battle flag, but the
agency lost its power to control school mascots when the
Legislature re-wrote the public education laws in 1995, Ratcliffe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice of school mascots and symbols are completely local
decisions,'' she said. ``If people want a mascot ... changed, the
school board is really where they need to start. Short of
legislation, I don't think there's a blanket way to effect this
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Statues, monuments, and other tributes to the Confederacy are
everywhere in Texas. A monument on the Capitol grounds stands as a
memorial to the Confederate dead. At the University of Texas,
statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and rebel
commander Robert E. Lee have been the target of protests in years
past.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said the NAACP isn't targeting statues or other
monuments.

   WASHINGTON _ Pity the poor presidential campaign strategists.
With make-or-break primaries fast approaching, they're frantically
trying to cobble together winning strategies to appeal to an
electorate so diverse, cacophonous and in flux as to make the folks
trying to build the Tower of Babel sound like a harmonious glee
club. With no big issue like war, recession or incumbency to give
the 2000 race some shape, America looks more than ever like an
indistinct montage of contending groups _ some new, some old
standbys.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there are hero-admiring dads to take into
consideration along with angry white males, single moms along with
soccer moms. There are seniors whose politics are shifting ever
rightward and _ perhaps most important _ a growing number of
independents who, as their name suggests, are hardly a monolith.
Cutting across everything is a schizophrenic view of President
Clinton, who is both loved and loathed at the same time _ sometimes
by the same people.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche marketer's dream, and a pundit's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on out there,'' said David Axelrod, a
Democratic political consultant in Chicago. ``There is no one thing
that was driving everything as there was in '92 or '80 or '84.
There are times when single issues overwhelm everything else. This
isn't one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the key electoral demographics is a tricky
business, but here goes anyway:
</P>
<P>
   THE GUY'S GUY. In some ways, the last few years have been tough
for white guys. Sure, they're making money, either through overtime
at the auto plant or overdrive in the stock market. They've got
SUVs and IPOs. But in the political arena, they've had nobody to
look up to. Four years ago, the thought of a Colin Powell candidacy
made many weak in the knees. But he took a hike on them. Now
they've suddenly got two straight-talking heroes _ John McCain and
Bill Bradley _ from the realms of war and sport.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the Los Angeles Times during the New
Hampshire primary illustrate what could be the makings of a gender
gap involving both McCain and Bradley. According to the polls, 50
percent of men voting in the Republican primary backed McCain while
only 29 percent went for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among men
voting Democratic, Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore among men by
about four points (while he trailed Gore by five points among
women).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all those guilty male boomers who didn't go to Nam,'' Lou
DiNatali, a senior fellow with the John W. McCormack Institute, a
Boston-based research organization, said of McCain's appeal to men.
``First, they went with Clinton, the anti-war guy. Now they go for
the POW.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gender gap has helped McCain more than Bradley.
That's because so many more men vote in Republican primaries than
in Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Should McCain win the Republican nomination, his male-based
appeal will probably widen the already cavernous gender gap between
the Republicans and Democrats, since Gore draws much of his
strength from women. That situation might favor the Democrat, since
there were 7 million more eligible female voters than eligible male
voters in 1998. And women tend to register and vote in higher
proportions than men.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENTS' DAY. In the New Hampshire primary, unaffiliated
voters helped power McCain to a 19-point victory over Bush, and
kept Bradley close enough to Gore to remain in the race. The
independents' role there has stirred interest in how much of a
force they will be in other primaries and the general election.
After all, they make up about 13 percent of the electorate
nationally, 25 percent in the Rocky Mountain states and 34 percent
of registered voters in New England.
</P>
<P>
   But the independents are hardly a bloc. There are so-called
``prosperity independents,'' affluent, generally white,
college-educated, Internet-savvy, stock-buying voters who tend to
be pro-environment and socially liberal yet fiscally conservative.
They were a hefty slice of McCain's support in New Hampshire, but
in national polls they also tend to like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also roped in his share of independents in New Hampshire
as well. But his independents, while also well educated, tended to
be less affluent, earning less than $50,000 annually, according to
polls conducted by RKM Researchers Inc. of Portsmouth, N.H. These
voters tend to be more liberal when it comes to government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third large group of independents: people who aren't
particularly interested in politics. More than 7.1 million people
were added to the voter rolls in 1997 and 1998, as a result of the
so-called ``motor voter'' law, which made it possible to register
to vote when renewing a driver's license, applying for welfare and
conducting business with other government agencies. Many of these
new voters have registered as independents. Who these disaffected
voters will vote for _ if they vote at all _ is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   BIFURCATED BLACKS. The black vote, as always, will be critical
for Democrats. But while 55 percent of blacks live in the South,
they tend to turn out in lower proportions than Northern blacks,
who tend to be more affluent and better educated and are less
likely to live in hard-to-organize rural areas. Indeed, except for
1992, Northern blacks have voted in higher proportions than
Southern blacks in every presidential election since the Voting
Rights Act was passed in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Some political strategists say that unless this changes, the
black vote may be more of a factor in closely fought states in the
industrial Midwest like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio than in Deep
South states like Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, where
Republicans have had a lock.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIANT SLEEPS TONIGHT. For years, Hispanics have been
described as the sleeping giant of U.S. politics, and George W.
Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet
when it comes to presidential races, there are no signs this giant
is stirring or that Hispanics will have much of an impact on the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population.
But half of that group is concentrated in two states _ California
and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic
vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that
vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly
different result this year.

Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet

race.

   Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population.
But half of that group is concentrated in two states _ California
and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic
vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that
vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly
different result this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 40 percent of Hispanics of voting age are not
U.S. citizens, and only 26 percent of those eligible to vote did so
in 1996 _ far fewer than non-Hispanic whites and blacks _ despite a
major effort by the Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders to get
out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The one state where Hispanics may be crucial is Florida. Four
years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, won only
46 percent of the Hispanics who voted there, mainly conservative
Cuban-Americans. That was the lowest draw of any Republican
candidate in recent memory. Vowing not to let that happen again,
the Republicans _ particularly Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is the
governor _ are vigorously courting Cuban-American voters. But
Democrats, noting that the Cuban-American community is younger and
less vehemently anti-Castro, sense an opening.
</P>
<P>
   OLD STORY. It used to be that the band would strike up the
Roosevelt-era anthem ``Happy Days Are Here Again'' and elderly
voters would feel all nostalgic and troop off to vote Democratic.
No more. Quite simply, many of those seniors who remember the New
Deal have passed away, and many more of the voters now over 65 are
people who were swept up in the Reagan Revolution and have remained
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior vote today is a different group of people than it
was four years ago and eight years ago,'' said John Rother,
director of legislation and public policy for the American
Association of Retired Persons, who is not publicly supporting any
candidate. ``They didn't go through a life experience like the
Depression that brought everybody together and they don't have the
same view of government.''
</P>
<P>
   THE YOUNG AND THE LISTLESS. Despite efforts like MTV's ``Rock
the Vote,'' young people continue to be among the most politically
apathetic groups in the country. In 1996, only 32.4 percent of
people 18 to 24 years old cast a ballot _ the lowest level since
1972, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
</P>
<P>
   A close race and a maverick candidate like Bradley or McCain
might bring out more young voters. But it's unclear if anything can
break through this group's lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   STILL ANGRY AFTER ALL. The angry white males are still around.
They tend to be college grads, relatively affluent and over 50
years old. They are more likely married, living in the South and
are often ex-Democrats turned Republican. They hate Clinton with a
passion. According to Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center for
People and the Press, they make up about 10 percent of the
population and 12 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   They had a moment in the sun in 1994, when they helped power the
Republicans to control of Congress. But even as their economic
status has improved and their influence has waned, their anger has
not diminished. ``Many still feel that the cultural winds are
blowing against them,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in
Atlanta. ``That creates the sense that the forces of political
correctness are working against them and what they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   I DO, I DO. The gender gap has been a hardy perennial in
analyses of the electorate. But perhaps as important in determining
who is wed to which party is a voter's marital status. Exit polls
indicate that married men supported the Republican over the
Democrat in every presidential race since 1984, and that except for
1996, when they backed Clinton over Bob Dole, married women did the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried men have a more checkered recent history, backing
Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George Bush in 1988, and flocking to
Clinton in 1992 and 1996. On the other hand, Democrats since 1984
have set single women's hearts aflutter. And in Kohut's survey,
60.7 percent of unmarried women with children _ so-called waitress
moms _ said they supported Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about soccer moms, but, really, for Clinton and
Gore, it's single moms,'' Kohut said.

SECURE OR NOT, THE INTERNET HAS BECOME A PART OF LIFE'S ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Colo., R.I., Wash.)  (nk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jon Tara first heard that unknown vandals with unclear
motives had managed to sabotage several of the Internet's most
prominent businesses last week, the San Diego software engineer
posted a probing message to an online investing forum that he
frequents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the end of Internet innocence? Is the house of cards
about to crumble?'' Tara, 45, wondered. ``Can we move to an
Internet-based economy while the potential exists for a group of
hackers to bring it to its knees at any time?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by Friday, Tara had settled back into his normal Internet
routine, which includes trading stocks, exchanging e-mail with
clients all day, and checking traffic conditions before he drives
home from work. ``I could see discontinuing trading online if the
instances of this were accelerated, but it would be a very
difficult decision.'' Tara said. ``We're going to be dependent on
the Internet, and I don't think you can stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the assaults hobbled popular Web sites like Yahoo, Amazon
and eBay for only a few hours, the ensuing consternation
underscored how heavily both businesses and consumers have come to
rely on the Internet for everything from paying bills to planning
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   But as Internet executives beef up security and public attention
turns to the FBI pursuit of the culprits, some network experts _
and at least a few lay Internet users _ contend that last week's
electronic attacks should sound an alarm. As people are enticed to
put their personal, political, financial and even medical lives
online, those who counsel caution see a need for a more gradual
pace.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the kind of mischief that today might merely cause
delays and frustrations could eventually have more serious and
far-reaching consequences. Being blocked from an eBay auction for
four hours may be only a nuisance. But being shut out from ETrade,
the online brokerage firm that was also hit last week, had a more
direct financial impact on those affected. And what would happen
if, as many planners hope, all of a person's medical history was
someday stored on a Web site? A Netscape error message may provide
little solace to the next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should give us pause,'' said Lauren Weinstein, co-founder
of a group called People for Internet Responsibility. ``With all
the dot-com hype that's been going on, not enough attention has
been given to the fact that the Internet is not like the older
technologies on which we have built our commerce over the last
century. It has vulnerabilities that need to be factored into
decisions about all these important applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Yu Sun, a computer science student in Seattle, had another
suggestion for the Internet industry. ``Maybe they should stop
wasting huge amounts of money on Super Bowl advertising and spend
more on improving their security,'' said Sun, who was unable to
compare homework with a fellow student by e-mail last week while
Yahoo, their e-mail provider, was recovering from the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Spoilsport views are, of course, not popular among e-commerce
executives, who have sought to cast the vandalism as an unfortunate
cost of doing business online. Nor are many frequent Internet users
or technology investors receptive to the notion of downsizing
digitization.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic at the compromised sites returned to normal almost
immediately after the attacks. Online Valentine's Day shoppers also
seemed unfazed, with reports showing traffic spikes at sites like
1800Flowers.com and VictoriasSecret.com last week.
</P>
<P>
   As for investor confidence, while the share price of some of the
affected companies dipped this week, all of them had recovered by
the close of trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be problems with the Internet here and
there,'' said Donna Pelletier, 45, of Harrisville, R.I., echoing
the sentiments of many others on the eBay Cafe discussion group.
``This only lasted for a couple of hours, so I don't think it's
that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, or at least not now. Only a tiny fraction of
consumer sales _ 1.2 percent _ currently take place over the
Internet, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   But several million military personnel will cast their
presidential ballots via Internet this year. Online banks and bank
services are proliferating. And online transactions, while still
small, more than doubled last year.
</P>
<P>
   The security of such transactions has already proved shaky. Last
month, for instance, an extortionist disclosed some of the 300,000
customer credit cards he said he had stolen from CD Universe, an
online music retailer. Days later, a new online bank, X.com, a
division of the La Jara, Colo., community bank First Western
National Bank, discovered that for almost a month, its customers
had been able to transfer funds from any other account in the
nation's banking system to accounts at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as businesses transfer more of their internal
operations online, the potential toll rises. ``The biggest risk is
not what we've seen so far, it's if hackers start to attack
business-to-business sites,'' said David Pecaut, head of Boston
Consulting's e-commerce practice.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly why consultants urge their Internet clients to go
the ``clicks and mortar'' route, operating through multiple
channels. Charles Schwab, the brokerage firm, which has call
centers and physical branches as well as a Web service, is often
held up as a model.
</P>
<P>
   Whether confidence in the Internet as an economic engine
declines at all after last week's brazen attacks may depend on
whether law enforcement authorities are able to apprehend whoever
orchestrated the electronic incursions. Yet even if the rule of law
prevails in this instance, Internet executives acknowledge that
there is little they can do to prevent similar assaults in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way today to stop the attack from occurring if it
gets launched,'' said Greg Hawkins, chief executive of Buy.com, one
of the sites disabled by a deluge of data on Tuesday, the day it
went public. ``All we believe we can really do is to ensure that we
can deal with it as rapidly and efficiently as possible.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The form of assault on the sites last week, known as denial of
service, is particularly difficult to defend against. Essentially,
intruders use third-party machines to overwhelm the victim's
servers, preventing customers from gaining access to the site.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, lax security on any of the millions of computers
connected to the Internet leaves every other one exposed.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives prefer to compare their security risks to
those of real-world retailers. On the Internet, they note, stores
are open all day, they do not worry about shoplifting, and they can
operate much more efficiently. Occasional interruptions of service
are unfortunate, but hardly cataclysmic.
</P>
<P>
   But Web retailers offer vandals a single target to attack
instead of a series of separate stores. Critics argue that such
attacks are likely to increase both because of the network's
inherent security flaws and because vandals will discover they are
able to achieve a dramatic effect with comparatively little effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French farmers blockading the McDonald's were not that
effective,'' said Tom Eisenmann, who teaches e-commerce at the
Harvard Business School. `What's different here is the scale.`
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's scale _ and its sheer ubiquity _ are why even
disgruntled Internet users are hanging tough. After being shut out
of Yahoo last week, Sun and his friend briefly contemplated faxing
their homework. But instead, they signed up for free e-mail
accounts at another Web site. ``E-mail,'' Sun said, ``is so much
easier.''

AT LAST MINUTE, A STEP FORWARD IN BELFAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ A frantic week of talks, ultimatums
and deadlines that fed the grim conviction that Northern Ireland
was discarding a promising chance to escape its rancorous past
ended Saturday on a surprisingly benign and forward-looking note.
</P>
<P>
   The province still faced an uncertain future, with its new
government of Catholics and Protestants shut down and no clear
procedures in place to restore it.
</P>
<P>
   But David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, emerged from
an afternoon meeting of his ruling party council to say that his
support and his party's determination to pursue power-sharing
government were greater than ever. He reported jauntily that
post-dated letters of resignation that fell due Saturday were now
``invaluable historical documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble had faced being ousted by his party over the failure of
the Irish Republican Army to begin disarming, but was saved by
Britain's suspension on Friday of the 10-week-old Ulster government
and reimposition of direct rule from London.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists entered government in November only on the
assurance that there would be some weapons turnovers by now, and
Trimble's pledge to step down was the insuring collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson
suspended the Belfast government, the IRA surprisingly declared it
was prepared to make long-awaited moves on weapons. The word
emerged in a rushed report from Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada,
head of an international disarmament panel.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he believed that the new report on the IRA's more
cooperative stance would not have been sufficient to save Trimble
from having to resign, and thus he had no second thoughts about
putting the Belfast administration on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Britain believes Trimble to be key to keeping the Ulster
Unionists committed to the peace arrangements, and fears that any
successor to him might scuttle them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the IRA assurances failed to forestall suspension of
local government, they appeared to be the basis for negotiations
next week. Trimble said Saturday that he would meet with Gerry
Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, next
week to seek ``clarification'' of the IRA proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In its main passage, the general's report said, ``We find
particularly significant, and view as valuable progress, the
assertion made to us by the IRA representative that the IRA will
consider how to put arms and explosives beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting arms beyond use could be a method of destroying arms or
sealing off arms caches that would allow the IRA to disarm in a way
that did not constitute surrender in its eyes. A subsequent
reference in the report to ``the removal of the causes of
conflict'' might mean the actual departure of the British from
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said: ``The significance of the latest report is that
the IRA's position has shifted. Now there are certain aspects which
are unclear about the IRA's position, and further clarification is
needed about what it amounts to.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the IRA had still not answered the critical questions of
whether it intended to disarm and how and when it proposed to do
so. But he said the new report contained the ``potential'' to
restore home rule to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The two sponsors of the peace agreement, London and Dublin, and
its most vigorous international booster, Washington, issued
statements calling the new IRA stance constructive.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of optimism Saturday was fueled by the realization
that the peace settlement had been extricated from its most serious
threat, that Trimble was still in place and that Sinn Fein was
still on board. There also was no hint that the paramilitary
cease-fires, now in their third year, might end.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, mostly Protestants, want to see the province remain
part of Britain, while Republicans, who tend to be Catholics, want
better ties with Dublin and eventual union with Ireland.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the small increments by which advances are measured in
Northern Ireland, it appears significant that Trimble and Adams go
into this stage with a personal association and in direct
communication, which they lacked the last time progress stalled
last summer. This relationship between two men who had never spoken
civilly to one another before was one of the gains of the review
conducted in the fall by former Sen. George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Although the home rule government lasted only 10 weeks, it
altered the profile of Sinn Fein leaders in the public mind. Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, once an IRA fighter,
was pictured in papers every day in a business suit behind his
minister's desk at the education department, or chatting up
schoolchildren like any other parochial politician.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Brian Mawhinney, the Belfast-born spokesman for the former
Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major, told the
House of Commons in London last week of his changing view of Adams:
``I surprise myself slightly by saying I am willing to give him the
benefit of the doubt. I believe that he does want change in a
peaceful, democratic direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Major himself talked of new signs that people in Sinn Fein and
the IRA wanted a political solution, not a violent one.
</P>
<P>
   The changing attitudes have fed a consensus that Sinn Fein's
failure to get the IRA to disarm was a miscalculation rather than
deception. The mystery over the exact relationship between the IRA
and Sinn Fein, its political ally, continues, but it seems clear
that Adams cannot get just anything he wants from the paramilitary
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talk sponsors and participants have for years
repeatedly wrapped the vexing issue of weapons turnovers in
ambiguous language or parked it on the sidelines with independent
international commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the word used for disarmament _ decommissioning _ sounds
more like the shuffling of papers than the surrender of guns, but
that did not take the sting out of the issue.

 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, as the forces of Gen. Augusto Pinochet
overthrew the Socialist government of Salvador Allende, two
American supporters of President Allende were killed in Chile under
circumstances that stirred suspicions of CIA involvement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials categorically denied any role in the young men's
deaths, which were dramatized in the 1982 movie ``Missing.''
Compelled by the Freedom of Information Act, the government in 1980
released the results of classified internal investigations, heavily
censored in black ink, that appeared to clear the American and
Chilean governments of any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But now, those thick black lines have been stripped away.
Spurred by the arrest of Pinochet in 1998, President Clinton has
ordered the declassification of ``all documents that shed light on
human rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of political violence
during and prior to the Pinochet era in Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those documents make clear for the first time that the
State Department concluded from almost the beginning that the
Pinochet government had killed the men, Charles Horman, 31, and
Frank Teruggi, 24. The investigators speculated, moreover, that the
Chileans would not have done so without a green light from U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in
Horman's death,'' said one newly declassified memo. ``At best, it
was limited to providing or confirming information that helped
motivate his murder by the government of Chile. At worst, U.S.
intelligence was aware the government of Chile saw Horman in a
rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing to discourage
the logical outcome of government of Chile paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   With their chunks of black ink now removed, the documents
declassified by the State Department illustrate how exemptions in
the Freedom of Information Act _ a law meant to reduce secrecy _
can be misused.
</P>
<P>
   Two principal exceptions the department used allow the
government to withhold information on the grounds of national
security and executive privilege. ``They're not protecting national
security information at all,'' said Peter Kornbluh of the nonprofit
National Security Archives, which promotes the declassification of
government documents. ``Preventing embarrassment is not an
exemption clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after extensive Senate intelligence committee hearings in
the 1970s, the U.S. role in the overthrow of Allende remains a
matter of dispute and conjecture. Kornbluh said that other
government agencies responsible for carrying out U.S. policy in
Chile, including the CIA and the Pentagon, have so far failed to
release key records on the era.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Horman's death, Mark Mansfield, a spokesman for the
CIA, recently released a 22-year-old letter denying any role by the
agency and said the agency would show the public files on the case
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department refused to address questions about the two
deaths, saying few of the people involved in the case still work
for the government. The former officials, most of them retired and
scattered around the country, largely disavow any responsibility
for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Horman's widow, Joyce, is hoping that enough has changed to
finally learn what really happened to her husband. She is asking
for Washington's help in her quest for an honest explanation of his
murder from the new Socialist government in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know who gave the order,'' said Horman, who has
never remarried. ``Nobody's held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and Teruggi were friends who belonged to a group of
young left-of-center Americans attracted by Allende's socialist
experiment in the early 1970s. In Santiago, they worked for a
newsletter that reprinted articles and clippings from American
newspapers critical of U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   When Pinochet seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, Horman was at Vina
del Mar, a coastal resort, with Terry Simon, a family friend from
New York who was vacationing in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said she and Horman saw U.S. warships offshore and spoke
to U.S. naval officers stationed in nearby Valparaiso, who appeared
elated at the coup's success. The two interpreted what they saw as
proof of U.S. connivance in the military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to return to Santiago, they rode back with Capt. Ray E.
Davis, chief of the U.S. Military Group at the U.S. Embassy, who
had been making his weekly visit to the naval station.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, as Pinochet's forces moved to arrest thousands
of people around the country, men in military uniforms abducted
Horman, ransacking his apartment. His wife, Joyce, was out at the
time. She never saw him again. Simon searched with Joyce for Horman
and eventually flew home to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, security forces arrested Teruggi and his
roommate, David Hathaway, at their apartment. They were held at the
national stadium with thousands of other political prisoners.
Teruggi never returned from his second interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway was released alone and later flew home to the United
States. A friend identified Teruggi's body in the government
morgue. His throat had been slashed, and he had been shot twice in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Horman was more tortuous. His father, Edmund,
flew in from New York to help. He and Horman's wife followed
whatever leads they could, keeping in close touch with the embassy,
which supplied escorts and pressed Mrs. Horman for a list of her
husband's friends. Doubting the diplomats' motives, she says, she
never supplied it.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, now 74 and retired, said in a recent interview that he
had nothing to do with the deaths and appeared offended by the
resurgence of questions about the killings.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of his close ties to the Chilean military during his
time there and said he had welcomed Pinochet at his home, but was
in no position to demand that Chilean army commanders answer for
the killings, and had not been ordered to do so. ``We weren't down
there to cause trouble,'' he said. ``We sold them weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Teruggi and Horman ``part of the problem'' in Chile.
``They were down there handing out pamphlets against the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, actually, had been supporting the Allende
government, not the one Davis hoped to see in power. He corrected
himself: ``against the people who were trying to do something about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hormans have long contended that despite the embassy's
avowal that it was doing all it could to find Charles, its
officials would merely confirm information the family had obtained
for itself. Taken together, the newly released documents support
their suspicions.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wintry precipitation will fall from the north central
Mississippi Valley across the lower Great Lakes to the interior
Northeast. A large, developing storm in Missouri will draw very
mild, moist air northward from the Gulf of Mexico. As the humid air
rises over a dome of very chilly air covering the northern states,
a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain will form. A swath of
moderate snow will coat the region from eastern Wisconsin across
central Michigan and southwest Ontario. Lighter snow will commence
in upstate New York and advance into western New England.
</P>
<P>
   Sleet and freezing rain will glaze surfaces from northern
Pennsylvania to southern Michigan. A cold drizzle will envelope the
northern Middle Atlantic region as ocean air glides over a wedge of
chilly air. An ice storm is possible tonight from the Mohawk Valley
of New York to central Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive showers, with embedded thunderstorms, will drench a
section of the Ohio and lower Mississippi Valleys. More than 2
inches of rain may fall over the same area that was soaked on
Friday night. This will lead to a rapid rise in creeks and streams,
perhaps above flood stage in parts of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Cold, moist air will circulate into the western high Plains and
along the east slopes of the northern Rockies. Rain and snow
showers will diminish along the west slopes of the central and
southern Rockies. Clouds should break in parts of the interior
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A large disturbance off the Pacific Coast will send a front of
warmer, moist air inland. Rain will return to California and snow
levels will rise in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Thunder and Sleet
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, thunder and lightning was noted in the lower
Ohio Valley. Weather stations in this region also reported sleet. A
thunderstorm is the only production mechanism for hail, the balls
of ice that form in the rapid, turbulent motions in a cumulonimbus
cloud. Sleet occurs when a cold rain falls through a layer of
sub-freezing air near the ground and freezes into tiny pellets of
ice. Sleet forms in winter storms when cold air is trapped below an
advancing, rising warm air mass. Sometimes, this warmer air can be
buoyant enough to form thunderclouds above the wintry air below.

MCCAIN'S ROLE IN RADIO LICENSING DISPUTE DISCLOSES BREAK WITH
PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.C., La., Pa.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buried in the 2-foot stack of more than 500 letters
from Sen. John McCain to federal agencies released by his office
several weeks ago is a strongly worded appeal to the Federal
Communications Commission written in McCain's very first week as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, dated Jan. 9, 1997, all but demanded that the
commission take no action on 200 contested radio licenses pending
before the panel. McCain told the agency that he planned to
introduce legislation to resolve the backlog and to rewrite the
60-year-old law under which radio licenses were then granted.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the potent lobbying firm of Patton Boggs was
quietly working toward the same end on behalf of a half-dozen
clients whose applications for broadcast licenses were among the
200 that had been frozen for four years. Handling the matter for
Patton Boggs was the son-in-law of McCain's Republican colleague
from Arizona, Sen. Jon Kyl.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting McCain legislation _ added as a rider to the
comprehensive Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and virtually unnoticed
at the time _ appeared to have the effect of wrenching broadcast
licenses from a number of owners of small-town radio stations and
benefiting a handful of rich clients of Patton Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's behavior as Commerce Committee chairman has been under
scrutiny because of his intervention, which came to light last
month, on behalf of a political donor, Lowell Paxson. The senator
wrote the communications commission last year, urging action on
Paxson's application for a television license in Pittsburgh.
Although McCain did not suggest how the commissioners should vote,
Paxson's application was approved.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the radio license issue looks like an example of
hypocrisy, which McCain's critics, especially supporters of George
W. Bush, say he exhibits when it comes to moneyed special
interests: He rails against them, but does favors for them, as
chairman of the commerce panel.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership
at New York University, says the case casts McCain's maverick
reputation into doubt. ``This case demonstrates that his sympathies
do seem to be squarely on the side of large corporations,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story of the disputed radio licenses is more
complex, far from a simple tale of a Senate chairman catering to
big business interests or connected Washington lobbyists. It also
provides a revealing glimpse of how McCain operates as Commerce
Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a federal court invalidated the lottery system method
the communications commission had used since 1934 to grant radio
licenses. It ordered the commission to come up with a new system;
about 200 pending license applications were frozen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new commission chairman, Reed Hundt, a
Democrat from North Carolina and a close political ally of Vice
President Al Gore, was undertaking an effort to replace the lottery
system with public auctions of a variety of radio, television,
telephone and satellite airwaves. Auctions were a fairer system,
Hundt argued, and one that could bring big money to the government.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was one of only a handful of Republicans who supported
Hundt's push for auctioning radio licenses. The auction system was
vehemently opposed by the National Association of Broadcasters,
representing the owners of hundreds of television and radio
stations, who preferred the old system of free, eight-year licenses
awarded by lottery. It was the old system, in fact, that favored
those who already had licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain said no more lotteries,'' said Blair Levin, Hundt's
former chief of staff. ``He was philosophically very consistent on
that.'' He earned the enmity of the broadcasters, perhaps the
biggest lobbying force with interests before his panel.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen applicants hired Patton Boggs' well-connected
armada of telecommunications lobbyists to push for a legislative
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants for licenses also contacted their home-state senators
and representatives to push for a solution. Among the most vocal
was the Lee family of Asheville, N.C. The family, which had
operated a small-wattage AM station in Asheville since 1938, wanted
to expand to FM.
</P>
<P>
   The radio license brouhaha was one of the first issues to
confront McCain when he assumed the chairmanship of the Commerce
Committee in January 1997. His staff urged him to propose
legislation to unclog the licensing pipeline, and he vowed to do
so. He told the FCC in a letter that he would soon introduce a bill
to authorize the commission to auction the disputed licenses.
</P>
<P>
   And while McCain never introduced a separate bill on the issue,
he did secure passage of an amendment to the 1997 budget bill that
gave the commission the authority to auction licenses. The
amendment was attached at a closed meeting of a Senate and House
conference committee on the budget bill and was never debated
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the FCC to auction radio licenses was a potential
disaster for the Lee family, which feared (correctly as it turned
out) that its opponents could easily outbid it for the Asheville FM
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lee, son of the AM station's founder, Zebulon Lee, and now
the 6,000-watt FM station's general manager, saw a conspiracy at
work. He believed McCain's proposal was covertly supported by big
radio groups and their Washington lobbyists, and he now says he
partly blames McCain for allowing big radio conglomerates to
flourish by outbidding locally owned radio stations for licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hypocrite,'' Lee said. ``The hypocrisy is he talked
about how awful the Telecom Act was, but he has basically created
the means to allow all the corporate giants to get their hands on
all the new stations. How does it influence the public's best
interest when the group with the most money wins?''
</P>
<P>
   Such a belief was fed by Patton Boggs, which boasted on its Web
site that it had ``successfully lobbied Congress'' to resolve the
radio matter to the benefit of its clients.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Patton Boggs' claim turned out to be exaggerated. Its expert on
the issue was Stephen Gavin, Kyl's son-in-law. His contribution to
the process was a narrow proposal, ultimately included in McCain's
amendment, to allow a 180-day window during which the competitors
for the disputed frequencies could reach private settlements.

   McCain aides insist that Gavin and others from Patton Boggs had
nothing to do with the drafting of the larger legislation. Patton
Boggs officials back them up, confining their contribution to the
relatively minor settlement provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one from Patton Boggs ever met with Senator McCain on this,
nor did anyone from Patton Boggs meet with me,'' said Mark Buse,
chief of staff of the Commerce Committee. ``It was I who brought
this issue to the senator's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Many station owners avoided auctions and legal delays by
settling with their license competitors, sometimes for millions of
dollars. But the Lee family spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on legal challenges and, after the sale of the AM station, gained
possession of the FM license, though it is still in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's brother, Brian, a disc jockey and program manager at the
FM station, traveled to Washington to meet with McCain's senior
aides in September 1997. But Lee failed to change McCain's mind,
even with the backing of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Buse stressed that the Lees should not be surprised that McCain
stuck to his position on the license issue. Neither the Lees nor
Patton Boggs affected his views, Buse said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., agrees. He opposed McCain on the
auction provision and is supporting Bush's candidacy. But he does
not question McCain's actions or his motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain had taken this position early on,'' Tauzin said. ``I
don't think it was designed specifically to help someone or hurt
someone. Every time you change policy you make some people happy,
some unhappy.''

POLITICIAN SEES FUTURE OF JAPAN IN ITS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ By midday the visitors were spilling out of the waiting
room and into the corridor outside the office of Shizuka Kamei, the
longtime machine politician who has suddenly become one of this
country's most powerful and solicited figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very critical moment in Japan's history, that will
decide whether we have a good 21st century or not,'' said Kamei,
who is the policy chief in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   What many of Kamei's critics question, though _ and they abound
not only in the opposition and in business circles but also in his
own party _ is whether this staunchly conservative former policeman
is in fact trying to steer Japan into the present century or back
into the last.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Kamei's scornful views on efficiency and
competition. ``The competitive market principle, which made the
United States affluent and made its people happy, cannot
necessarily be applied to Japan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kamei is an old-time politician, and he is trying very
hard to keep old-time Japan going, its industries, its society,''
said Taro Kono, a 37-year-old member of parliament from the Liberal
Democratic Party frustrated by Kamei's powerful influence. ``We lag
behind the U.S. because too many people like him are trying to keep
Japan the way it is, rather than adapt to our new circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with each tentative step that Japan takes toward
economic recovery, after a decade of slow growth, Kamei has emerged
increasingly resolute _ and usually successful _ in his opposition
to the liberalizing reforms that many say are badly needed to
ensure future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   His influence was most recently on display over the New Year
holidays, when, in the midst of the traditional news lull, he
prevailed upon the government to scuttle quietly an important
component of its longstanding plans to reform the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ decried by Japan's leading business association, the
Keidanren, editorial writers and many economists _ was seen as a
costly sop to the country's thrift institutions and other small
banks, many of which would fail without protection.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of a loose band of Liberal Democratic Party
figures and parliament members who unabashedly call themselves the
``anti-deregulation committee,'' Kamei is the unapologetic champion
of troubled businesses, and of a Japan whose past glories are now
fast fading.
</P>
<P>
   His is the land of high trade barriers protecting deeply
inefficient businesses, from steel and textile manufacturers to the
small retail sector, while relentlessly promoting Japan's sleeker
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the government of Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister
who appointed him, often preaches the gospel of competitiveness,
the importance of the Internet and internationalization, for Kamei
globalization stands out as a real menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has a long history, just like America,'' Kamei said in
his large office, which is filled with expensive orchids and every
manner of the animal that is his namesake, the turtle. ``Our
society is based on villages and towns which have been in existence
for hundreds of years. During that time, a certain lifestyle has
formed, and we should attach some importance to these traditional
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, see Kamei's championing of the little man and of
depressed industries as driven not so much by principle as by
political and financial calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan for all
but two years since the end of World War II, is above all a
vote-getting machine whose wheels are greased through patronage and
endless fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Kamei has excelled in this world, and charges of numerous
financial irregularities have dogged him throughout his political
life, including involvement with the Japanese mobs that operate the
country's ubiquitous pachinko game parlors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kaoru Ogawa, a well-known corporate gadfly, who has himself
often been accused of associating with gangsters, recently called
Kamei the ``dirtiest in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamei gave an impassioned but nuanced defense of his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a former police officer and have never touched dirty
money,'' he said. ``My fund raising comes from small and
medium-size businesses, and I have done nothing which could be
reproached me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a politician, however,'' he added. ``And I am sometimes
asked to take care of certain people. Some of them have sometimes
been convicted of crimes, but I have nothing to be ashamed of.''

divorce from his wife of 18 years, the Friends of Newt Gingrich PAC
has brought in a quarter as much, about $288,000. Gingrich's folks
say they have purposely slowed their fund-raising as they looked to
close down the FONG PAC. Last month, Gingrich started a new kind of
fund-raising machine, one from which he won't be required to file

January. Buying or coercing votes by using public social programs
for the poor as bait is considered one of the biggest obstacles to
holding truly clean elections in Mexico. Despite claims they've
changed their ways, the country's ruling Revolutionary
Institutional Party, the PRI, takes ``the grand prize'' when it

the government's inclusion of the Freedom Party, which is described
as somewhere between neo-Nazi and American Republican. So far, the
greatest affect of the domestic and international indignation is to
greatly enhance Joerg Haider's popularity in Austria and perhaps to
encourage other right wing parties seeking power across Europe.

EXECUTIVES MAKE TRADE WITH CHINA A MORAL ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also being filed in `i' category.) 
(nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When a group of Florida businessmen paid a
visit one recent afternoon to Corrine Brown, their congresswoman,
they put her on notice that they consider trading with China a
moral crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we're going to undermine that regime is to
infiltrate it,'' Frank Pearce, a business consultant and local
Chamber of Commerce leader, told Brown in a meeting. ``You can't
moralize across the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Nash, who runs his own import-export company, said
missionaries and businessmen will work together to change China,
unless Congress interferes. ``The missionaries are over there doing
the dangerous stuff,'' he told Brown, ``but trade is what opens the
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and corporate America have a great
deal riding on whether such pitches persuade Brown, a four-term
Democrat who considers herself a leader in human rights causes, to
vote in favor of extending new, permanent trading rights to China.
She is among 70-odd wavering members of Congress whom both sides
see as crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must decide, as early as spring, whether to give up its
annual review of China's trading rights. In a landmark agreement
last year paving the way for China to join the World Trade
Organization, the Clinton administration promised that China would
be guaranteed the same low-tariff access to the U.S. market that
most countries have. But Congress has the final say.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton argues that the choice is clear. The often
tense relationship with China and America's global leadership in
trade would get a significant boost with a yes vote. Rejecting the
agreement would deal a serious blow on both fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the decision is being hotly contested, and the outcome is
uncertain. Trade, in the final year of the Clinton presidency, has
become a tough sell. The failure of global trade talks in Seattle
late last year emboldened a coalition of labor, environmental and
consumer groups that now want to derail or at least delay trade
liberalization with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on
Capitol Hill,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta told a
friendly group of farm lobbyists this week. ``There are people who
have strong views who don't agree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders say they will not schedule a vote until
Europe closes its own deal with China, and the timing of that
remains uncertain. Yet nearly everyone agrees that the vote must
take place by June, before the election year pressures become any
more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has not rallied to the cause. Republican leaders back
China trade. But, facing some ideological opposition in their
party, they say that they will not push the measure through unless
they get support from 90 or so Democrats, roughly half that party's
number in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 53 members of the Democrats' left-leaning Congressional
Progressive Caucus have announced that they will vote no. Pro-trade
Democrats worry that the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters, two
unions determined to defeat the China accord, could make this an
excruciating choice for liberals facing re-election.
</P>
<P>
   To turn the tide, the administration and big business, which
strongly supports a China trade deal, have launched what they are
billing as the largest lobbying effort on a foreign-policy vote
since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   America Online leads a coalition of computer and Internet
companies trying to give the China vote a high-tech spin, arguing
that free trade opens China's promising telecommunications and
Internet industries. Michael Eisner of Walt Disney Co., Sumner
Redstone of Viacom and Rupert Murdoch of News Corp. are pushing the
accord because it would increase the number of films they can
market in China.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest business lobbying groups, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the Business Roundtable, have vowed to try to whip up
support for the China trade agreement in several dozen swing
congressional districts with a $12 million campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, the northern Florida port city, is viewed as a
test of whether business can stoke pro-trade enthusiasm at the
local level. Spurred by the national Chamber of Commerce, local
business leaders hold regular meetings with Jacksonville's port
authorities and the city's economic development board to plot ways
of persuading the city's representatives in the House, Brown and
Tillie K. Fowler, a Republican, to vote for China trade. Both have
opposed extending normal trade privileges to China in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-trade forces are emphasizing the city's vested interest
in expanding economic ties. Its port employs 35,000. With sparkling
Toyotas and Hyundais parked bumper to bumper on acres of asphalt,
the port is also thriving on Asian cargo. It recently struck an
alliance with Hong Kong-based Hutchinson-Whampoa, a cargo handler
that specializes in China trade, to serve as a way station for
goods that pass through Hutchinson's new deep-water container port
in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the downtown were just a bit farther upriver so people
could see all the traffic going through here,'' said Kenneth R.
Krauter, president of the port, which is about 15 miles from the
city center.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she was ready to listen. She joined 800 local
executives for a Chamber of Commerce lunch late last month. After
the Pledge of Allegiance, a video tribute to Jacksonville's NFL
Jaguars and a pro-trade speech by a prominent local leader,
businessmen tried to pin Brown down on her views on China.
</P>
<P>
   They mixed testimonials about how important trade had been to
their own businesses with appeals to her human rights concerns.
They spoke of their passion for spreading democracy and
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you change a totalitarian system?'' Pearce asked her,
stressing each syllable in a slow Southern rhythm. He answered his
own question. ``You get it exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave them scant comfort. ``China has always been a
struggle for me,'' she said, describing how she had changed her
mind about whether expanding trade with China was a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to have discussions with those people for seven
or eight years,'' she said. ``What have they tangibly done in terms
of human rights?''
</P>
<P>
   Some local business executives said they thought they had more
success converting Fowler. Over lunch, six executives of
Jacksonville companies described how their own business depended on
imports and exports. Hy W. Kliman, president of Global Sourcing &AMP;
Trading, described how he had built a thriving multinational
business on the strength of a single bowling shoe contract he
reached with a Chinese company in 1973, five years before the two
countries had formal diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the business executives said that Fowler called the
session an ``education'' and told them after the lunch that she
would support the China accord. But her chief of staff said Fowler
had yet to decide how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Schweitzer, an official of the national Chamber of
Commerce who led the Jacksonville organization drive, said there is
clearly a deep reservoir of pro-trade sentiment to be tapped. But
she acknowledged that the process demands patience.

<P>
   ``This has to be sustained long-term every place we try it to be
effective,'' Schweitzer said. ``The problem is that the most
important policy issue we face _ China _ is here right now.''

EXECUTIVES MAKE TRADE WITH CHINA A MORAL ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also being filed in `a' category.) 
(nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When a group of Florida businessmen paid a
visit one recent afternoon to Corrine Brown, their congresswoman,
they put her on notice that they consider trading with China a
moral crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we're going to undermine that regime is to
infiltrate it,'' Frank Pearce, a business consultant and local
Chamber of Commerce leader, told Brown in a meeting. ``You can't
moralize across the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Nash, who runs his own import-export company, said
missionaries and businessmen will work together to change China,
unless Congress interferes. ``The missionaries are over there doing
the dangerous stuff,'' he told Brown, ``but trade is what opens the
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and corporate America have a great
deal riding on whether such pitches persuade Brown, a four-term
Democrat who considers herself a leader in human rights causes, to
vote in favor of extending new, permanent trading rights to China.
She is among 70-odd wavering members of Congress whom both sides
see as crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must decide, as early as spring, whether to give up its
annual review of China's trading rights. In a landmark agreement
last year paving the way for China to join the World Trade
Organization, the Clinton administration promised that China would
be guaranteed the same low-tariff access to the U.S. market that
most countries have. But Congress has the final say.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton argues that the choice is clear. The often
tense relationship with China and America's global leadership in
trade would get a significant boost with a yes vote. Rejecting the
agreement would deal a serious blow on both fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the decision is being hotly contested, and the outcome is
uncertain. Trade, in the final year of the Clinton presidency, has
become a tough sell. The failure of global trade talks in Seattle
late last year emboldened a coalition of labor, environmental and
consumer groups that now want to derail or at least delay trade
liberalization with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on
Capitol Hill,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta told a
friendly group of farm lobbyists this week. ``There are people who
have strong views who don't agree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders say they will not schedule a vote until
Europe closes its own deal with China, and the timing of that
remains uncertain. Yet nearly everyone agrees that the vote must
take place by June, before the election year pressures become any
more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has not rallied to the cause. Republican leaders back
China trade. But, facing some ideological opposition in their
party, they say that they will not push the measure through unless
they get support from 90 or so Democrats, roughly half that party's
number in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 53 members of the Democrats' left-leaning Congressional
Progressive Caucus have announced that they will vote no. Pro-trade
Democrats worry that the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters, two
unions determined to defeat the China accord, could make this an
excruciating choice for liberals facing re-election.
</P>
<P>
   To turn the tide, the administration and big business, which
strongly supports a China trade deal, have launched what they are
billing as the largest lobbying effort on a foreign-policy vote
since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   America Online leads a coalition of computer and Internet
companies trying to give the China vote a high-tech spin, arguing
that free trade opens China's promising telecommunications and
Internet industries. Michael Eisner of Walt Disney Co., Sumner
Redstone of Viacom and Rupert Murdoch of News Corp. are pushing the
accord because it would increase the number of films they can
market in China.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest business lobbying groups, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the Business Roundtable, have vowed to try to whip up
support for the China trade agreement in several dozen swing
congressional districts with a $12 million campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, the northern Florida port city, is viewed as a
test of whether business can stoke pro-trade enthusiasm at the
local level. Spurred by the national Chamber of Commerce, local
business leaders hold regular meetings with Jacksonville's port
authorities and the city's economic development board to plot ways
of persuading the city's representatives in the House, Brown and
Tillie K. Fowler, a Republican, to vote for China trade. Both have
opposed extending normal trade privileges to China in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-trade forces are emphasizing the city's vested interest
in expanding economic ties. Its port employs 35,000. With sparkling
Toyotas and Hyundais parked bumper to bumper on acres of asphalt,
the port is also thriving on Asian cargo. It recently struck an
alliance with Hong Kong-based Hutchinson-Whampoa, a cargo handler
that specializes in China trade, to serve as a way station for
goods that pass through Hutchinson's new deep-water container port
in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the downtown were just a bit farther upriver so people
could see all the traffic going through here,'' said Kenneth R.
Krauter, president of the port, which is about 15 miles from the
city center.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she was ready to listen. She joined 800 local
executives for a Chamber of Commerce lunch late last month. After
the Pledge of Allegiance, a video tribute to Jacksonville's NFL
Jaguars and a pro-trade speech by a prominent local leader,
businessmen tried to pin Brown down on her views on China.
</P>
<P>
   They mixed testimonials about how important trade had been to
their own businesses with appeals to her human rights concerns.
They spoke of their passion for spreading democracy and
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you change a totalitarian system?'' Pearce asked her,
stressing each syllable in a slow Southern rhythm. He answered his
own question. ``You get it exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave them scant comfort. ``China has always been a
struggle for me,'' she said, describing how she had changed her
mind about whether expanding trade with China was a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to have discussions with those people for seven
or eight years,'' she said. ``What have they tangibly done in terms
of human rights?''
</P>
<P>
   Some local business executives said they thought they had more
success converting Fowler. Over lunch, six executives of
Jacksonville companies described how their own business depended on
imports and exports. Hy W. Kliman, president of Global Sourcing &AMP;
Trading, described how he had built a thriving multinational
business on the strength of a single bowling shoe contract he
reached with a Chinese company in 1973, five years before the two
countries had formal diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the business executives said that Fowler called the
session an ``education'' and told them after the lunch that she
would support the China accord. But her chief of staff said Fowler
had yet to decide how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Schweitzer, an official of the national Chamber of
Commerce who led the Jacksonville organization drive, said there is
clearly a deep reservoir of pro-trade sentiment to be tapped. But
she acknowledged that the process demands patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be sustained long-term every place we try it to be
effective,'' Schweitzer said. ``The problem is that the most
important policy issue we face _ China _ is here right now.''

PANEL FAULTS ENERGY UNIT ON PLAN FOR NUCLEAR AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., S.C., Nev., Kan., Va.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A special House panel, unusually united across
party lines, criticized the Energy Department on Friday, saying it
did not follow congressional guidance in creating an agency to
oversee nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has long opposed creation of
the agency within the Energy Department, saying it would undercut
his authority. Congress mandated a revamping of the department last
year in response to accusations that China stole some of the United
States' most sensitive nuclear secrets because of lax security at
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Richardson dropped his public opposition to the
overhaul in the face of veto-proof majorities in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But critics in Congress suggested on Friday that Richardson was
continuing his fight behind the scenes, drafting a plan to restrict
the semiautonomy that lawmakers had carved out for the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the House Armed Services Committee that is charged
with monitoring the Clinton administration's compliance with the
law said Richardson's draft plan assigned department officials to
similar jobs inside and outside the new agency, the National
Nuclear Security Administration. This overlap would undermine the
agency's autonomy, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The department still retains too much control over the new
agency's budgeting and management, and overemphasizes its authority
over the agency, the lawmakers said. The panel also chastised the
department for failing to consult with department experts and
outside contractors before preparing its plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel remains very concerned that senior DOE leadership
remains opposed to the provisions of Title 32, and lacks a strong
commitment to full compliance with the law,'' the lawmakers said in
a report, referring to a section of a larger Pentagon budget bill
that deals with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, who heads the panel of five
Republicans and three Democrats, said in an interview that the
lawmakers ``wanted to avoid bashing the administration and instead
guide them down the path'' before the agency formally begins
operations on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California,
said in an interview that she recognized the difficulties of
revamping a federal bureaucracy late in an administration's tenure.
But she added that the department so far had ``failed to provide a
detailed road map'' for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the panel's eight members endorsed its findings. The
only dissenter, Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said that the
administration's plan fell short of the law's requirements but that
Congress needed to review flaws in the statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that we should criticize the department and
what it has done without also making a critical review of what
Congress has enacted,'' Spratt said in a written dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials defended their plan, noting, as did
the House panel, that a search committee had identified several
promising candidates to be the agency's administrator. Officials
hope to submit a nominee to the White House early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reject the criticism of our implementation plan,''
Richardson said in a statement. ``We are trying to make sense of
poorly drafted legislation.'' He added that he expected the agency
to be ``up and running on March 1, as required by law.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the agency's administrator, an undersecretary of
energy, would have broad authority over policy, budgeting and
counterintelligence for nuclear programs. The administrator would
report directly to the secretary of energy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency's creation marked the most far-reaching legislative
response to two scathing studies last year _ one by a House panel
and another by a presidential review board _ that looked into the
allegations of China espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the new agency to improve the security of defense
information also begins to reverse a trend at the Energy Department
since the end of the Cold War to emphasize nonproliferation
programs over defense programs and nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   The other panel members are Duncan Hunter of California, Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina, Jim Gibbons of Nevada and Jim Ryun of
Kansas, all Republicans; and Norman Sisisky, D-Va.

U.S. INVESTIGATORS EXAMINE MAINTENANCE AT ALASKA AIR
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Whatever brought down Alaska Airlines Flight
261 is only half of the airline's problem. The other half is in its
maintenance hangar here, where workers and supervisors sign their
initials to thousands of work orders as they complete them.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few cases, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration, they may have signed papers approving work that
they did not do.
</P>
<P>
   When the agency finds violations, it levies civil penalties. But
in this case, in an unusually harsh follow-up, federal prosecutors
convened a grand jury. Even before the airline got a formal notice
of the modest $44,000 fine the agency was proposing, the hangar
here got a visit from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in with guns drawn, flak jackets and everything
else,'' John R. Fowler, Alaska Airlines' executive vice president
for technical operations, said in a voice of dismay.
</P>
<P>
   In the kind of enforcement action that is almost unheard of in
aviation, federal agents seized the records of several of Alaska
Airlines' MD-80s. The first raid was in 1998, and covered three
planes; the investigation has continued, and last November the
records of eight more planes were seized. Prosecutors have brought
at least 10 of the airline's mechanics before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   At the hangar here, where Alaska Airlines maintains its 34
MD-80s, the investigation comes at a time when the company is in
shock over the crash of one of its planes off the Los Angeles
coast, which killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of that crash is not known, but it appears to involve
the mechanical failure of a part of the tail, the horizontal
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, pilots have been dispatchedin small teams to
give pep talks to mechanics. ``They didn't feel uncomfortable
flying our airplane,'' said John Kelly, a mechanic, shortly after
one such visit. ``They're worried about us. They want to let us
know they appreciate us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another company mechanic, John Liotine, who sparked the
investigation 15 months ago with a complaint to the FAA. He had
been hired in 1989, when the hangar here was bought by the airline,
and worked as a lead mechanic, supervising a handful of others. He
complained about work on three planes being done out of sequence,
or not done at all, in a rush to return them to service.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of his assertions are known in detail, the company
professes not to know exactly what the government is investigating
as the inquiry drags on and expands. Asked what the planes have in
common or what the mechanics are being asked, Karen A. Gruen, a
company lawyer, simply turned her palms up. (The plane that crashed
was not one of those covered by the investigators' subpoenas.)
</P>
<P>
   Gruen and other executives said that after the crash they wanted
to dispel the idea that there was any connection between the
charges and the crash of Flight 261. There is no obvious
connection, but it is hard to know for sure because the cause of
the crash is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are not talking about the scope of their
criminal investigation of the airline. Todd Zinser, the
Transportation Department's assistant inspector general for
investigations, would not comment on the specifics of the case.
Neither would spokesmen for the FAA or the U.S. Attorney's office
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Zinser said that to justify criminal prosecution, violations
must be knowing and willful, and that prosecutors generally take
into account the rank within the company of the people accused of
violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Alaska inquiry has not produced any indictments, the
only indication of what is happening comes from a sketchy notice of
violation from the FAA and documents from the agency's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   They include statements by Liotine, the mechanic who first
reported the violations to the FAA. He told the agency that other
mechanics had signed their names to work cards indicating they had
done work on three planes although they had not actually done the
work.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, for example, as mechanics rushed to finish work on
an MD-80, he observed that managers and mechanics were filling out
a so-called Post-maintenance final run checklist before all the
checks had actually been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   He removed the card, he said, and asked that the mechanics start
over. A new card was produced and filled out, he said, but by a
mechanic not qualified to taxi the plane or check the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said that some of the accusations involved
misunderstandings of the paperwork system at the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   On another airplane, Liotine complained, the throttle knobs for
the two engines were out of alignment, and he filled out a form
that should have led to them being fixed. Instead, a supervisor
``cleared'' the entry from the aircraft log by noting that previous
tests had found the throttles acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA inspector, alerted by Liotine, wrote in a report that the
supervisor ``proceeded to `sign off' the throttle split discrepancy
just written in the aircraft maintenance log, without actually
performing any maintenance to correct the discrepancy!''
</P>
<P>
   But airline executives now say that while this was not the
proper procedure, it was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on the shop floor said they were not sympathetic to
Liotine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual was a fanatic; he wanted it perfect,'' said
John Kelly, Liotine's fellow mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, which traces its roots to the 1930s, flies an
extensive system on the western edge of the continent, from
northern Alaska to Mexico. The company is well regarded in the
industry for having developed new satellite-based navigation
techniques for landing in treacherous Alaskan mountains, among
other innovations.
</P>
<P>
   It has also had some prior run-ins with the FAA. For example,
when one of its MD-80s developed a fuel leak, the airline drained
and sealed the tank and assigned the plane to shorter routes. The
agency said the modification was improper and proposed a $250,000
fine, later settling for $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in a statement that it plans to release on Monday,
asserts that Liotine was trying to slow maintenance down as a
pressure tactic during contract negotiations, and was bitter about
having been passed over for promotion. Liotine, who has declined to
talk to reporters, has denied in statements to the FAA that any of
his charges was a negotiating tactic. He was president of the
mechanics union at the time he made the charges, but the union
later removed him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.

TURTLE'S FRIENDS SPLIT OVER SHRIMPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas _ Despite stepped-up efforts to
protect them, sea turtles keep washing up on Texas beaches, and
environmentalists are calling for new limits on the state's $600
million-a-year shrimping industry that they believe will solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 450 dead and injured turtles washed up on the Texas
coast, a 14 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is the Kemp's ridley turtle, a
wide-ranging turtle that nests mainly in one place in the world: a
90-mile stretch of beach in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Texas biologists have taken elaborate steps to
develop a second nesting area along the South Texas coast. Their
efforts have included transplanting eggs from Mexico and raising
silver-dollar-size hatchlings in laboratory buckets for about a
year. And their work seems to be paying off. In 1999 they found 16
nests in South Texas, up from six in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemp's ridley turtle is endangered. Scientists believe that
many are killed or injured when they are inadvertently caught in
shrimp nets, even though federal law requires shrimpers to use
devices that let turtles escape from the nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as shrimp season opens, the turtles start washing up
dead,'' said Teri Shore, a spokeswoman for the Sea Turtle
Restoration Project, an advocacy group for the turtles. ``This we
know, year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, state officials began boarding shrimp boats to make
sure they were complying with laws protecting the turtles.
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates for the turtles say it is time the turtle's
second home became an outright sanctuary: a marine reserve closed
year-round to shrimpers.
</P>
<P>
   In early February a coalition of advocacy groups donned turtle
costumes and took the issue to the doorstep of Gov. George W. Bush.
They said state enforcement had failed, and they demanded that
shrimping be banned off the beaches favored by the Kemp's ridley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical nesting area and a critical migrating area,
both for turtles that nest in Texas and those that nest in
Mexico,'' Shore said.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of a marine reserve divides even friends of the
Kemp's ridley.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the fishing and seafood industry, which does
not support a Texas marine reserve, has invested in protecting the
Kemp's ridley's primary nesting place at Rancho Nuevo, in the
Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Last year the industry bought land and
materials for an additional turtle camp there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. supervisor of the binational effort at Rancho Nuevo,
Patrick Burchfield, said the industry's support was an important
factor in the 12 percent to 14 percent annual increase in turtle
nests there.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the 924 nests and 48,000 hatchlings counted in
1978, the project's first year, biologists protected 3,648 nests
and returned 228,000 hatchlings to the Gulf of Mexico in 1999.
Burchfield said he did not want to risk the delicate coalition and
alienate shrimpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could very quickly get back to where we were five years
ago: people in opposing camps and spending all their money in court
instead of trying to preserve the turtle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Les Hodgson, past president of the National Fisheries Institute,
a seafood industry group, said that additional restrictions on
shrimping were ``not out of the question,'' but that the focus
should be on proven efforts at Rancho Nuevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a way to solve the turtle problem that
doesn't put a lot of people out of business and shut down an
industry,'' said Hodgson, who has been honored by the Commerce
Department for his turtle conservation work at Rancho Nuevo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scientists disagree on the underlying reasons for high turtle
mortality in Texas. With nests multiplying in Mexico, some suggest
it is inevitable that more turtles will be harmed as they migrate
through Texas waters.
</P>
<P>
   But Donna Shaver, a federal government biologist at Padre Island
National Seashore in Texas, said Mexico's turtle sanctuary had many
more nests and far fewer deaths than Texas. It is also closed to
shrimping in the nesting season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials say they will probably propose new shrimping
restrictions in the spring.

SPORTS COLUMN: PAYTON RETURNS HOME WITH ALL-STAR STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Jason Kidd and Gary Payton sat across the room
from each other Friday afternoon as the news media swarmed into a
huge ballroom for the ritual of All-Star media day. Kidd and Payton
were separated by only a few feet, though the journey they have
traveled, from childhood to adulthood, from Oakland to the NBA to
this lofty All-Star perch has been a phenomenal mixture of
coincidence and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought two decades ago that two kids, one living
high, one living low, would wind up in the same place, the same
prestigious league, back home and on top of their profession?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be selected as an All-Star is a big honor,'' Kidd said
``But to have it happening back home is even a bigger honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Payton, who at 31 is five years older than
Kidd, echoed the sentiment. ``This is All-Star Weekend,'' he said.
``For me to be here in my hometown and play in front of my home
folks, it's going to be great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game is the latest step of their parallel evolution.
For much of their lives, the gregarious, tough-as-nails Payton was
the teacher. The milder, younger Kidd was the student, watching in
awe as Payton went from high school to Oregon State to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Payton remembers Kidd as a 12-year-old coming around to play
pickup games. When Payton was an NBA rookie with Seattle and Kidd
was a hot-shot high school senior, Payton sent him down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let me take the ball out first,'' Kidd recalled, ``and
really tried to show me that my offense skills weren't up to par.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd tried a patented crossover move and Payton stole the ball.
Kidd drove; Payton suffocated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something that really blew me away,'' Kidd said,
``because I thought I could get a shot off against anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was a good defensive player, and I thought he would,
you know, let up at some point. But he didn't. For me it was an ego
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the student has surpassed the teacher. At least in the view
of fans. Kidd received 1,061,031 votes, the most among guards in
the West. Payton was selected as a reserve by coaches after
receiving the third-most votes. Payton, who started the last two
All-Star Games, will come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when someone asked Kidd who was the best, he
demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``At talking? Definitely Gary,'' Kidd said. At the game? ``I'd
have to go with Gary. You never disrespect your elders. I think
he's having an MVP season.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Kidd, Payton said, ``Jason's been destined for the NBA since
he could walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd and Payton underline distinctions within similarities. They
are Californians, born in Oakland. But their lives began on
separate planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is from the Flatlands,'' Kidd said Friday. ``A little bit
rougher than where I'm from. I'm more in the Hills, a little bit
more laid back. But when it came to basketball, it didn't matter
where we played, it was always going to be a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For Payton, the road began in the rough-and-tumble life on 41st
Street in the West Oakland projects on July 23, 1968, the youngest
of five children. From there, his family moved into a one-story,
three-bedroom home in East Oakland that his father still occupies.
Payton attended Jefferson Elementary, played for the Jefferson
Cobras, a team in a recreational league coached by his father. Then
Claremont Junior High.
</P>
<P>
   Payton finally climbed to Kidd's Hills when he attended Skyline
High School there, 12 miles from his house. He struggled
academically and was forced off the team.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a nose-to-nose confrontation with his father and
a commitment to buckle down, Payton achieved a balance between
academics and athletics. He went on to Oregon State and an
All-American career.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd was a phenom as a sophomore at St. Joseph's High School in
Alameda. There was an All-American career at California-Berkeley.
He was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks in 1994, then traded to the
Phoenix Suns in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges for Kidd would come later in life. Learning to
work hard, get tougher, achieve a level of responsibility
commensurate with his talent. As a pro, there was a late-night car
accident from which he fled, then a paternity suit and another
lawsuit charging that Kidd hit a woman at his 21st birthday party.
He settled both cases. As a pro basketball player, Kidd was on
cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in my career, practice was something where I just went
through the motions,'' he said. ``I thought I was saving myself for
the game. As I found out later, if you practice just as hard as you
play, the game will be a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Kidd's father, Steve, died of a sudden heart
attack. His father's death was a jolt and a wake-up call and a
message. The message will resonate when Kidd takes the floor
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts that my dad won't be there to see me in person,''
Kidd said, ``but he'll be there in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   This All-Star Game illustrates mentorship at its best. Kidd is
no longer coasting. Payton never did.

REPUBLICANS TO TEST THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT'S STRENGTH IN SOUTH
CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ There are not many states where a presidential
candidate is asked _ by a teen-ager, no less _ whether God had
called him to lead the country. But South Carolina is not the kind
of place where religious issues hover silently beneath the surface,
and the fervent campaign for the religious right is as likely to
veer into predestination as it is into tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was a bit startled last week when
asked about God's choice for president at a rally in Greenville. He
quickly made it clear he was not attaching a divine imprimatur to
his candidacy, but the tone of his reply also made it clear he knew
the importance of a demonstrable religious faith to a large part of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all holy sinners,'' he said. ``That's what redemption is
all about, it seems like to me. And I'm doing the best I can do,
but I don't know whether it's God's will or not. The truth of the
matter is that the people of South Carolina are going to be voting
on Feb. 19, and I hope you get to vote. But I do believe in prayer,
and I do believe in a personal walk, and that's exactly what I'm
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's personal appeal to conservative Christian voters who make
up the core of the state's Republican Party has, if anything, grown
in intensity in the last 10 days. For months, he had positioned
himself to take the majority of such voters, who usually make up 30
percent to 40 percent of the Republican electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But with tens of thousands of independent and Democratic voters
now likely to vote in the primary for Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
the usual conservative vote may well be seriously diluted or even
swamped.
</P>
<P>
   Most leaders of conservative groups are supporting Bush,
including all but one of the 46 former county coordinators for
Steve Forbes, who were hastily brought into the fold after Forbes
withdrew last week. But the support is by no means unanimous, and
several prominent anti-abortion leaders and others in the movement
have broken from the majority to endorse McCain. Bush officials
have worked the phones all week, urging pastors and activists to
step up their organizing and arouse a large turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the primary were among Republicans and conservatives only,
this race would be very difficult for John McCain to win,'' said
Ralph Reed, a strategist for Bush who is employing his contacts as
former executive director of the Christian Coalition to shore up
the campaign's support. ``But it's not, so that makes winning the
grass-roots conservatives that much more important. If Governor
Bush wins that group heavily, it's arithmetically very difficult
for him to lose the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearances and advertisements, Bush has stepped up his
attack on McCain in precisely the areas most likely to stimulate a
high turnout among the religious right. He has said McCain's tax
plan would make it harder to deduct charitable contributions, and
his advertisements say McCain is not compassionate toward churches.
He speaks often of his support for abstinence programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials say that this week they will begin
criticizing McCain for voting against a bill that provided extra
money for a government crackdown on sexual predators who use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And most prominently, there is the central issue of abortion,
over which both candidates have been waging a bitter ground war for
weeks, splitting a once-solid ideological front. Bush has
widespread institutional support, winning the endorsements of the
National Right to Life Committee and South Carolina Citizens for
Life, which have teamed up to run ads accusing McCain of wavering
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to expose his flip-flops,'' said Holly Gatling,
executive director of the South Carolina group. ``When he's on the
West Coast, he says he opposes reversing Roe vs. Wade. When he's
here, he says he's pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Leonard, state chairwoman of the Republican National
Coalition for Life, a group founded by Phyllis Schlafly, said she
believed McCain actually has a better record of supporting
anti-abortion measures than does Bush. The larger groups are
opposing McCain because they believe his campaign finance plan will
hurt their influence in Washington, said Leonard, who lives in
Florence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign may have the organizations, but they don't
have the people,'' she said. ``Voters aren't led by groups anymore.
They're looking for a candidate who can attract the Reagan
Democrats again, all the American patriots. People tell me they
think McCain is the one to clean up the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some disagreement in the state about the political
strength of the religious right, which can occasionally be
energized to fight such matters as video poker, but which fractured
in the last gubernatorial election, allowing a Democrat, Jim
Hodges, to be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayers, an Atlanta pollster who has worked on many
Republican campaigns in the state, says there is a reliable group
of 25 percent to 35 percent of the Republican electorate that
identifies with the religious right, and an even larger group of
voters who he says are ``very concerned about the moral decay of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed says the group may be even larger. In the presidential
election of 1996, he said, 42 percent of voters identified
themselves in exit polls as conservative Christians, or as
born-again evangelicals who go to church at least four times a
month. Their numbers are particularly large in the northern part of
the state, around Greenville and Spartanburg, and in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But David Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson
University, says the right is overrated in this election, coming
together on what are considered moral issues, like opposition to
video poker, but not necessarily for a single candidate when the
differences between the leading contenders are essentially
marginal.
</P>
<P>
   The race in South Carolina is now so close that each side is
scrambling for the smallest possible advantage, as shown by the
Bush campaign's instant and successful effort to round up most of
the prominent supporters of Forbes and Gary L. Bauer. It hardly
mattered that neither Forbes nor Bauer ever broke out of single
digits in most statewide polls, and had barely bothered to campaign
here. Each had some voters, and some activists, and the Bush and
McCain campaigns want them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it did not matter how much criticism Bush endured from
Democrats for speaking at Bob Jones University, a conservative
bastion that bans interracial dating. When Bob Taylor, a university
dean, decided to switch from Bauer to Bush, his newfound political
home immediately put out a glowing press release.

CLINTON PROPOSES INCREASING IRS BUDGET TO FIND CHEATERS

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning that continuing cuts at the Internal Revenue Service
threaten the nation's tax system, the Clinton administration is
proposing more money to find cheaters and make them pay up. And the
agency's top official has begun emphasizing that catching cheaters
is as important as helping honest taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is seeking a 9 percent increase in the
agency's budget, the largest increase, adjusted for inflation, in
13 years. That would allow the IRS, whose auditing staff is down
one-fourth since 1995, to raise the number of auditors for the
first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress who have criticized the IRS said they
were open to the idea that more money might be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the request for an increased budget is taken up by
Congress, IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti is moving to ensure
that the agency does a better job of collecting taxes owed by
companies and individuals, he said in an interview last week. For
example, he has summoned all 665 managers in the collections
department to a three-day meeting in Chicago next month to insist
that they act when taxpayers do not pay.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such meeting of collection managers in the
agency's history, said Jody Patterson, an IRS spokeswoman. At the
meeting, Rossotti will drive home the message that collection
managers cannot allow delinquent taxpayers, especially those who
flout the law, to get away without paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stanch the decline in collection activity,''
Rossotti said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's budget request is approved, part of it would pay
for 633 more auditors, a 5 percent increase. They would hunt for
cheating by people with incomes over $100,000, especially business
owners, professionals and investors in partnerships. In the last
three years, audit rates among such taxpayers have fallen by
two-thirds, to about one in 131 returns.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said it would also focus on illegitimate business tax
shelters that make profits invisible to the IRS. These shelters are
growing so fast, IRS officials say, that despite soaring profits
the taxes paid by large companies have actually begun to decline.
These officials say that less than 70 cents of each dollar of
profit reported to shareholders in 1998 was reported by companies
as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also wants to hire more people to answer
telephone calls to the agency, allowing about 300 auditors detailed
to this kind of customer service work to resume examining
questionable returns.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that ``we need to begin
increasing capacity'' to enforce the tax laws ``to maintain
people's confidence that this is a tax system that works.''
</P>
<P>
   He said enforcement must go hand in hand with improving service
to cooperative taxpayers. ``Better customer service and greater
collection volumes go together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the president have kept such a tight rein on
spending that the IRS has hired only 20 new auditors even as more
than 2,000 have quit or retired since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that this year fewer than one in 300 personal
returns is expected to be audited, down from one in 63 two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in enforcement has become so significant that
Rossotti now warns that it threatens to ``undermine our entire
system of voluntary tax compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti and others worry that understaffing and a growing
timidity by front-line auditors and tax collectors have allowed
more Americans and businesses to get away with not paying what they
owe.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also has fallen down at the job of collecting from those
who fail to turn over taxes due, mostly small businesses and the
self-employed. Since hitting a record $38 billion in 1996, taxes
collected through enforcement actions like audits and levies on
bank accounts have fallen by 13 percent, or $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS came under fire in Congress two years ago, in hearings
at which taxpayers said they had been bullied and harassed.
Congress answered with, and Clinton signed, legislation intended to
give taxpayers more protection against overzealous tax agents.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was passed, Rossotti, a wealthy businessman
brought in to fix the agency, made improving service to customers _
as he calls taxpayers _ his theme.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the mission statement _ ``to collect the proper
amount of tax due'' _ was replaced by ``provide America's taxpayers
top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and
fairness for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But recently Rossotti has begun to emphasize the catching of
cheaters as much as helping taxpayers. Earlier this month, for
example, he told the Senate Finance Committee, ``Customer
satisfaction is not achieved by failing to collect taxes that are
properly due.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has spoken out about the agency's weaknesses in enforcing
the law.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about shrinking resources, for one thing. This year,
full-time IRS payroll has fallen nearly 16,000, to 81,834
employees, a 16 percent decline since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the last five years the number of income tax returns has
grown 11 percent and the number of complex returns filed by people
making $1 million or more is doubling every three years. About
250,000 households will report an income of $1 million or more for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And this at a time when the agency has had to comply with more
than 1,200 changes imposed by Congress that essentially make its
job more demanding. Some of those changes make it easier for
taxpayers to get answers from the IRS, such as having people
available around the clock to answer telephone inquiries. Others
require the agency to take many more steps in the audit and
collection process to make sure that taxpayers are not abused.
</P>
<P>
   The equivalent of 3,000 more workers have been assigned to
comply with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-CLINTON-IRS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
WASHINGTON: the changes. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the shrinking size of the work force has been its
attitude toward pursuing tax cheats. Many IRS employees are now
operating extremely cautiously for fear that under the new rules
they can be fired for the way they once did their jobs. In
interviews with The New York Times in the last year, collection
officers across the country, all of whom insisted on anonymity,
said that even in cases where they had followed the rules
faithfully their managers were unwilling to approve seizures and
levies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem,'' Rossotti said, ``is that there is a lot of
confusion, and sometimes managers are backing off to the point
where they are not managing.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, tax revenues have been soaring in recent years as the
economy has boomed and profits have jumped. But IRS officials say
many forms of cheating have proliferated and tax revenues should be
even higher. Their concern is that if people think they can cheat
without being caught, many more people will do it and honest
taxpayers will sour on the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our entire tax system depends on the vast majority of
taxpayers who attempt to pay their taxes that are due having
confidence that they are being treated fairly and that their
competitors and neighbors are also paying what is due,'' Rossotti
told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month. ``If the
public concludes over a period of time that the IRS cannot meet
these basic expectations, the risk to the tax system will become
very high and the effects very difficult and extraordinarily
expensive to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his new budget proposal earlier this month, has
asked for $8.84 billion for the IRS in 2001, up 9 percent from the
$8.11 billion Congress approved for this year. The $729 million
increase includes $174 million this year and next to hire 1,633
more people, including 633 more auditors and 33 more tax
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money would allow the IRS to replace about one-sixth
of the auditors, collectors and related personnel it has lost since
Clinton took office. It would also allow the hiring of more people
to answer telephone inquiries from taxpayers, a job that diverted 3
percent of auditors and collectors from their primary work last
year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Republicans who control the House
Appropriations Committee said that adding a total of 2,800
full-time employees, as proposed in the budget, is a rather large
request, one that will be discussed in hearings next month.
Republicans have long held a suspicious view of the IRS and have
criticized the agency for what they call its plodding pace and its
emphasis on catching tax cheats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to look very closely at this request,''
said Elizabeth Mora, the spokeswoman, adding that Congress has had
a different set of priorities for the IRS in the past. ``We have
been concerned and remain concerned about modernization. We are
also very concerned about a balance between law enforcement and
customer service. We need to make sure there is a correct balance
between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Two architects of the recent laws overhauling the IRS said they
were open to the idea that more money may be needed for
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House Ways and Means
Committee, said he ``will do what's necessary so the IRS can serve
the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who chairs the Senate Finance
Committee, said, ``It's important that the IRS have sufficient
funding to ensure successful execution of the current
reorganization plan in order to make tax collection more efficient,
and provide better service to taxpayers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IRS has also backed away from an interpretation of the new
tax act that required collectors to demand full payment of taxes
past due _ or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under that new approach, tax delinquents who did not pay in full
were having their cases put aside. Tax experts said that many
people who owed money would bet that the statute of limitations
would expire before the IRS pursued them, and that therefore people
who could have paid something would no longer do so.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy directs agents to collect as much as possible
from such taxpayers, just as was done previously.

</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-GOVTS-LOBBY (Washington) _ Some countries, such as
Israel, Greece and Taiwan, have always had a strong presence in the
parlors of policy-making in the capital. But the depth and breadth
of lobbying by individual countries has grown in recent years, and
foreign governments are now paying out tens of thousands of dollars
a month. By Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-MILITARY (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Perhaps the most
telling insult to Indonesia's armed forces, people here say, is
that mothers no longer encourage their daughters to marry a
military man. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-SHIELD-ANXIETY (Washington) _ European allies have
expressed increasing concerns about the Clinton administration's
plans to negotiate with Russia to allow deployment of a missile
shield, and about how much the Europeans are being consulted in the
matter. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-U.N. (United Nations) _ African governments, unable to
bring about a cease-fire in the widening war in eastern Congo, want
the United Nations to take on the job of disarming combatants,
diplomats from the region say. They also want a peacekeeping force
much larger than the 5,537-member mission now being proposed in an
American-sponsored Security Council resolution. By Barbara
Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-ETHNIC-WAR (Bunia, Congo) _ Another ethnic war is erupting
in central Africa, this time a tribal conflict in Congo fought
mostly with machetes and barbed arrows that nurses in a hospital
near here collect in a little white box. Some of the barbs are
still covered with blood and flesh. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-KAMEI (Tokyo) _ By midday, the visitors were spilling out
of the waiting room and into the corridor outside the office of
Shizuka Kamei, the longtime machine politician who has suddenly
become one of this country's most powerful and solicited figures.
By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ A frantic week of talks
and ultimatums and deadlines that fed the grim conviction that
Northern Ireland was discarding a promising chance to escape its
rancorous past ended Saturday on a surprisingly benign and
forward-looking note. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SPRAWL (Santa Clarita, Calif.) _ This is the future home
of Newhall Ranch, the largest housing development ever approved by
Los Angeles County, with 21,600 units for 70,000 people to be built
over the next 20 years. To its critics, Newhall Ranch is a symbol
of all that is wrong with California's decades of
catch-as-catch-can development. But big as it may be, Newhall Ranch
is nothing compared with the projected need for new housing in Los
Angeles County: about 25,000 units a year, according to the
Southern California Association of Governments. By 2025, the
state's population of 34 million is projected to grow by 18 million
more (a whole New York state) and that of the Los Angeles region by
6 million (or two Chicagos). By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-IRS (Undated) _ Warning that continuing cuts at the
Internal Revenue Service threaten the nation's tax system, the
Clinton administration is proposing more money to find cheaters and
make them pay up. And the agency's top official has begun
emphasizing that getting tough with cheaters is as important as
helping honest taxpayers. By David Cay Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   WEB-SECURITY (Undated) _ The consternation over the assaults
that hobbled popular Web sites underscored how heavily both
businesses and consumers had come to rely on the Internet for
everything from paying bills to planning vacations. But as Internet
executives beef up security and public attention turns to the FBI
pursuit of the culprits, some network experts _ and at least a few
lay Internet users _ contend that last week's electronic attacks
should sound an alarm. As Internet entrepreneurs and investors
entice people to put more of their personal, political, financial
and even medical lives online, those who counsel caution see need
for a more gradual pace. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ALASKA-AIRLINES-REPAIRS (Oakland, Calif.) _ Whatever brought

<P>
   ``If they think I'm bad,'' Jack Scott liked to say, ``they ought
to see what's going to come after me. The next reformers may be
anarchists and much more vicious than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The next reformers were much more vicious than Scott, but they
were capitalists. While Scott, who loved games and the people who
played them, gave voice to the overcontrolled athlete, it was the
lawyers, agents and shoe sellers who adjusted the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   They advanced Scott's athletic revolution by making the
performer who can deliver the audience more important than any
designated moral authority. They replaced the temple with the
marketplace, which was not exactly what Scott had in mind. But it
was progress. In Scott's time, an Olympic champion could be thrown
off the team for quietly raising his fist during the medal
ceremony. In this time, a basketball player who choked his coach
eventually got a better job.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw Scott, he was standing at the front of a
University of California classroom wearing red running shoes, a
baseball cap and gym shorts, which, in 1970, even in Berkeley, was
not considered appropriate academic garb. He brought several
hundred undergraduates to startled order by blowing a whistle. He
did that, he later explained, because ``300 yards from here, men
who are also supposed to be teachers act and dress like this all
the time, curse their students and impose arbitrary rules about
hair, clothes, social life, and no one thinks twice about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking, of course, about coaches, a subject in his
course, ``Intercollegiate Sports and Education: A
Socio-Psychological Evaluation,'' because he wanted ``people to
think twice, then do something to make the university approach to
athletics more holistic instead of a fetish for performance
statistics, and stop those coaches who are distorting one of the
most creative and exciting activities of college life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott was dubbed ``the guru of jock liberation,'' scornfully, by
the likes of the later disgraced vice president, Spiro Agnew, but
it was an accurate moniker. Scott wanted to teach athletes to take
control of their bodies and their games. He believed in discipline,
hard work, fair play, civil rights, equal athletic opportunities
for women. While he could despise the racism and hypocrisy of an
Avery Brundage, he could admire the idealism of the Olympic
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was no ivory-tower theoretician. He had been a
hard-hitting high school football player and a college track
athlete. Although his avowed goal was to do well by doing good, he
was a jock, he wanted to win, to be celebrated, to kiss the cup.
This may have undone him; it certainly led him into the Patty
Hearst caper. He had only about five years as besieged and beloved
guru.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the seminal ``Athletics for Athletes'' and ``The
Athletic Revolution.'' In two years at Oberlin, before he was
bounced with the progressive president who had hired him, he
created a prototypical Title IX program and hired Tommie Smith as
track coach. He worked with Bill Walton during the center's early
years with the Portland Trail Blazers, and he helped linebacker
Dave Meggysey with his excellent ``Out of Their League.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott was no shadow figure. He reveled in attention and
publicity. He loved being included on rosters of social activists.
In a bit of all-star name-dropping, he once told me he had been
turned on to margaritas by Fidel Castro. The chance to become
famous as the savior of Patty Hearst, to walk her back up from
underground, to sink the basket at the buzzer, must have been
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 57, died last Sunday in Eugene, Ore., at the home of
Micki McGee, his early partner in the athletic revolution and
mother of his three children. They had reunited in his decline and
married, for the first time, on Jan. 21. He had fought his throat
cancer in that focused way that jocks drive to the goal. In recent
years, Jack, a physiotherapist who had helped many world-class
athletes and had served as Olympic team physician for third world
countries, searched for treatments outside the mainstream. But the
opponent was too strong.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's life and legacy are important and valuable. He certainly
informed my thinking. But he also left me with a question and a
tantalizing doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last October with the FBI, Scott claimed that
while he was helping Hearst elude the police in 1974, she told him
that she had arranged her own kidnapping. She wanted to break off
her engagement with Steven Weed, with whom she was living in
Berkeley, but she didn't want to give her parents the satisfaction
of having been right about Mr. Wrong. So she asked her local dope
dealer to make a connection with the radical Symbionese Liberation
Army, who could snatch her and make Weed look unworthy in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott's story, as told to FBI agents and described
on their interview form, Patty fell in love with an SLA member,
Willie Wolfe, and became Tania the terrorist princess. After Wolfe
and other SLA members died in a confrontation with the police in
Los Angeles, Scott, with hero-hood and a book contract in mind,
went off to save the survivors. Eventually, with his parents, Scott
drove Hearst cross-country and hid her in New York and
Pennsylvania. Two of his close friends, the Olympian Phil Shinnick
and the writer Jay Weiner, also guided fugitive SLA members. But
Shinnick and Weiner eventually went to jail and Scott, the guru,
did not. I have always wondered what kind of deal Scott might have
cut for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he has left us the answer. In those days, he often told
me how close he was to the Hearst family. Could he have been close
enough to that powerful media barony to have it put a lid on his
own prosecution in return for not revealing that Patty had lied
about her abduction? The prison time she served for her adventures
was nothing like the time she would have served had the judge and
jury believed she was not the victim of the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The approaching trial in Los Angeles of Sara Jane Olson, a St.
Paul housewife who was a fugitive until arrested last June as
Kathleen Ann Soliah, once an SLA member, may bring some answers.
Olson is charged with conspiring to murder by planting pipe bombs
under two police cars, which never exploded, in 1975. Her defense
lawyer had petitioned the court to videotape Scott's testimony
about Hearst before he died, but the petition was denied. Hearst is
thought to be an important, if reluctant, prosecution witness.
Scott's revisionism could blow up the Olson trial as a wasteful
circus.
</P>
<P>
   The guru of jock liberation was always at his best pricking the
establishment.

 &HT;    Jordan on Woods
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Tiger Woods won his sixth consecutive tournament
last weekend, rallying from seven down with seven holes to play, no
one was more excited than Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got goose bumps,'' Jordan said. ``Can you believe that? I'll
tell you what else _ I'm ticked off that I missed it. I'm ticked
off because I was supposed to be there, front and center, watching
it firsthand, right there by his side when he was doing it. But I
knew if I was there (as Woods' amateur partner), you guys would
have killed me in the paper for not being on my new job.''
</P>
<P>
   On their relationship: ``He calls me once or twice every 10
days, and we have great conversations,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   NOT-SO-MELLOW RILEY
</P>
<P>
   Miami's practice of 6 hours, 40 minutes on Tuesday was Pat
Riley's revenge for a Sunday loss to the Knicks. Three hours of
film, the rest on the court and only two days after Riley portrayed
himself as a more gentle man who did not like the angry guy he had
become recently.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mr. Nice Guy went over the New York game play by play on
video and ridiculed his players for their mistakes. At one point,
forward Mark Strickland allegedly was reduced to tears.
</P>
<P>
   FORTSON NO LONGER IN GREEN
</P>
<P>
   After raving about forward Danny Fortson, Rick Pitino gave up on
him after 23 games, for Toronto guard Alvin Williams. Fortson is
making $1.68 million this season and will be a free agent this
summer. The Celtics thought they couldn't afford to re-sign him.
Williams is getting $1.925 million this season and is slated to
make $2.1 million next season _ the last of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's throw the money issue out, which is there,'' the coach
said. ``We could not please him with playing time.
</P>
<P>
   VAN GUNDY, EWING DIFFER
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy admits that he and Patrick Ewing
disagree on playing time. Asked if Ewing realizes that he has lost
much of his effectiveness on a consistent basis, Van Gundy said,
``No, I don't think any player with pride can allow himself to say,
`I didn't have it tonight,' or `I should only play 15 minutes.'
Once you give in to that notion, you're on your way down. (Hakeem)
Olajuwon is coming off the bench in Houston, and he likes it.
(Utah's John) Stockton has no problem playing 28 minutes. But I
don't think Patrick can allow himself to think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   AMAECHI WHO?
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's John Amaechi had 25 points with seven rebounds Monday
after scoring 19 against Indiana on Saturday night, while Michael
Doleac, his partner in the pivot, scored 23 on Monday. ``We're
different kind of players,'' Amaechi said. ``And people don't know
who I am. They just think, `Oh, it's Amaechi. We've never heard of
him. He (stinks).'''
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN STILL A WIZARD
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards hope the Pistons agree to do a deal for Ike Austin,
but they are skeptical. As the trade deadline nears, it is becoming
apparent that teams don't want Austin because he has an option on
his three-year, $15 million deal that will pay him close to $6
million for a fourth year.

 &HT;    As the Worm turns
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dennis Rodman barricaded himself in a side room for
nearly one hour Wednesday night after his first game with Dallas
and lifted weights.
</P>
<P>
   After ending an 11-month layoff, Rodman even broached the idea
that if it works out, he would like to return to Dallas next season
for one, final run. Of course, this magical, mystery Worm Tour
began with a 117-106 loss to Seattle at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it like this,'' Rodman said, who excited the
sellout crowd with 13 rebounds in 32 minutes. ``Tonight is a
perfect illustration so people know I can still play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go out and get 13 to 14 rebounds any night I take the
court. Tonight, I would have gotten at least 16 or 17 if I had not
been in foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, by the way, is wearing No. 70 because the NBA denied his
requests for 69 and 007.
</P>
<P>
   JAVIE IN RARE FORM
</P>
<P>
   In Denver's bitter home loss to Minnesota last Saturday, referee
Steve Javie cursed Nick Van Exel, who did not play in the game.
Partner Tommy Nunez tried to call a technical on Van Exel with
eight seconds left in overtime because he believed the player said
something, and mild-mannered assistant coach Louie Dampier went
after Nunez in the corridor. Javie also challenged coach Dan Issel
to a physical confrontation. Issel was restrained by a team
executive, Dennis McGowan. Van Exel and Issel were fined $7,500
each.
</P>
<P>
   SHAQ ON A ROLL
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 37, grabbed 16 rebounds and made 15 of
20 free throws against Minnesota in a 114-81 rout. He scored 18
consecutive Laker points in the second quarter. ``Once Shaq starts
getting 40, 50, you're going to start comparing him to the greats
like Wilt (Chamberlain) and Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar),'' Wolves forward
Kevin Garnett said. ``When he starts making his free throws, it's
going to be hands down who's the best player in the league, if it's
not already.''... More give-and-take between Lakers coach Phil
Jackson and shooting guard Kobe Bryant: In a three-game span,
Bryant's assist totals were 8-9-11, a total of 28, against eight
turnovers.... Being Bryant, impetuosness dies hard. He hit three
consecutive 3-pointers in a comeback against Denver, then put up a
fourth from about 30 feet. Jackson had a sub at the scorer's bench
before it clattered off. ``You know, I vacillate between wanting to
spank him and wanting to pat him on the back,'' Jackson said. ``And
sometimes it ends up about the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   KLEINE: GOOD REASON TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kleine on why he's traveling the country with Portland
instead of enjoying retirement:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple. I was sitting at home at the end of
August, and somebody called me up and said, `Who wants to be a
millionaire?' I said, `I do,' and they said, `Is that your final
answer?' I said, `Let me call my lifeline.' So I called (wife)
Dana, and she said, `If you don't take it, I'll kill you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really going to retire, but Mr. Visa and Mr. American
Express told me I better stick around another year.
</P>
<P>
   LONG DISCOURAGED
</P>
<P>
   Grant Long on life in Vancouver: ``I knew things would be bad
before they got good. But did I expect what's happening now? No, I
didn't. I thought we'd be better at this point of the season. I
wish I could put my finger on it. I just thought at this juncture
of the season we would be better. I thought we would be playing
with the cohesiveness you need to play with, and we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWKINS RIPS CLIPPERS
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Hersey Hawkins ripped the Clippers after the Bulls
came from 16 down to beat them. ``They are extremely talented but
it just seemed to me that they aren't playing as hard as they
could. One of the things I sensed when I got into the game in the
second quarter was that they were playing but they were not playing
to win. I told our guys to pick up the intensity and I think they
will sort of buckle.''
</P>
<P>
   ELLIOTT OUT AS BROADCASTER
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott is finished as a broadcaster because Spurs coach
Gregg Popovich told him he needed to spend more time around the
team. ``You can quickly become an outsider when you're not in the
locker room,'' Elliott said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Piazza's last hit of 1999 was a two-run seventh-inning
homer in Atlanta that tied the score in the final game of the
National League Championship Series. It was heroic, an indication
to the New York Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine, that his tattered
catcher belonged to that elite company of athletes who can overcome
pain when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was able to reach down and get what it took,'' Valentine
said. ``All the really good ones do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 11th inning, it was Todd Pratt _ not Piazza _ who
caught Kenny Rogers' fourth ball to Andruw Jones, a pitch that
forced in the winning run and ended the Mets' season. Piazza had
been removed from the game with shoulder pain. It was the 145th
game he had caught since opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just hit the gas,'' Piazza said, recalling the feeling,
``and you've got nothing in the gas tank.''
</P>
<P>
   He has spent the winter refueling, taking the first two or three
weeks off and then working out every day, as always. The pads go on
again Wednesday, when Mets pitchers and catchers begin working out
in Port St. Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   There are six springs left on Piazza's Mets contract, six more
years to produce as expected for a player with a seven-year, $91
million contract. This is the season in which Piazza turns 32, an
age that represented the last big offensive season for several of
baseball's greatest catchers. Gary Carter batted .255 with 24
homers and 105 runs batted in the year he turned 32, and he never
reached those levels again. Johnny Bench caught a full season at
age 32, then played just 13 games at catcher the rest of his
career. Yogi Berra caught at least 100 games for nine straight
seasons through the season he turned 32, but caught 100 games only
once thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those things are inevitable,'' said the former Braves
catcher Bruce Benedict, who was the Mets' bench coach and catching
instructor last year, and is now the club's advance scout. ``The
wear and tear of that position eventually leads you to some sort of
decision-making process where you look at other areas of the game
to get your at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the natural progression. Either you take more time
off or learn another position, or you DH, if you're in that league.
But no way can you slow down baseball's aging process. Because
Mike's done all he can do. He probably does as well as anybody I've
ever seen at that position at keeping himself ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   If any catcher is bionic, it may be Piazza. He is in superior
shape, careful with his diet _ ``Watch him after a game: it's
bananas and strength bars,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said _
and he has been on the disabled list only twice in his seven
seasons. Only Ivan Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers, who is three
years younger than Piazza, has caught more games since 1995. All
the while, Piazza has remained an offensive force.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips sees no reason for that to change. ``None of those
other catchers are Mike Piazza,'' Phillips said. ``They just
aren't. None of the other guys are anywhere close to that level, to
be able to play that many games and be so consistent with their
offensive production. He is a unique individual, and I don't
foresee his numbers dropping off.''
</P>
<P>
   Through seven full seasons, Piazza has 1,200 hits, a .328
average, 240 homers and 768 runs batted in. In all four categories,
he ranks above the Hall of Famers Bench, Berra, Roy Campanella,
Mickey Cochrane, Bill Dickey and Gabby Hartnett. As long as he
remains a catcher, Piazza could own nearly every batting record for
his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the numbers Mike has put up and the possibility of
thinking of him as a future Hall of Famer, it would be easy to
understand if he wanted to stay a catcher,'' Carter said. ``He has
a lot of pride in himself, and that's what he's going to be
recognized for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bench, who has become a confidant of Piazza's over the years,
said: ``He loves catching; he really loves it. He loves to be in
the middle of the action, and it's what drives him and gives him
that extra incentive to work hard. He's improving all the time.
Obviously, at first base, people say he could prolong his career,
but he's worked hard and he wants to be better every day he goes
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bench knows the demands of the position. He remembers being
the last player off the team's airplane, and compared himself then
to ``an 85-year-old man trying to stand up out of your chair
waiting for your legs to catch up with you.'' In his last year as a
catcher, 1980, Bench threw out three runners in one inning and
returned to the dugout in tears. The ulnar nerve in his elbow was
severely damaged, and to continue catching would require surgery
that would cause him to miss the next season. With his back also
ailing but his bat still productive, Bench became a first baseman.
Now 53, he is still bothered by arthritic fingers, ankles and
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said he will not persist with catching just because
records are in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sort of goal like that,'' he said. ``I've
always wanted, just from an integrity standpoint, to go out for the
next six years that I'm in New York _ or however long I'm in New
York _ and do the best I can, keep myself in the best shape I can
and be productive. If I break records, great. If not, that's
another story. But I don't go into it thinking I've got to be like
Johnny Bench or Carlton Fisk or Bob Boone.''
</P>
<P>
   When Phillips signed Piazza to the seven-year deal in October
1998, he expected Piazza to catch for more than half the contract.
Phillips said Piazza might need to make a transition in the last
year or two of the deal, and Piazza believes he could learn first
base if he had to. But, Piazza said of Phillips, ``We have an
understanding that if it does come down to that, he would give me
ample time to think about it and discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   When first baseman John Olerud left the Mets as a free agent,
Phillips never considered shifting Piazza. If Piazza had become the
first baseman, Phillips explained, the Mets would have had to find
a catcher whose offensive numbers compared to Olerud's. Instead,
the Mets signed Todd Zeile to play first, and Piazza stayed at a
position for which his offense is an enormous asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to get that kind of production from the catching
position separates you from every other team in the game, other
than probably Texas,'' Phillips said. ``It allows you at other
positions to possibly be even with another team or even be slightly
less offensive at a position, because you're making up for it so
significantly with your catcher.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Piazza will probably catch regularly at least through 2002, when
Zeile's contract expires. Piazza will turn 34 that year, but he may
still be young enough to hold up as a hitter. The former catcher
John Stearns, who switched positions with Benedict and will coach
the Mets' catchers this year, said he did not lift weights when he
played and paid for it in August and September. The bat felt
heavier, and his numbers tailed off. But Piazza is a career .323
hitter in those months.
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue Piazza experienced at the end of last season _
compounded by a thumb injury in the division series _ was more an
aberration than a warning sign, Piazza said. With the Mets in such
a tight pennant race and Piazza so essential to the lineup, he
started 30 of the season's final 32 games. Despite a stint on the
disabled list in April with a sprained knee ligament, Piazza caught
137 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said he might have benefited from more days off, but
acknowledged that he will not ask out if he is swinging
particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the magic number?'' Piazza said. ``Is it 125? 130? 120
and you DH in the interleague games? It's kind of funny; I was
laughing about it the other day. If we're going so well as a
ballclub that we've gotten into the playoffs with two weeks left in
the season, then those last two weeks you'd catch five innings and
leave. Ideally, that'd be great, and you'd be 100 percent going
into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, who caught more than 120 games once in his 12-year
playing career, used to think the appropriate range for Piazza was
between 130 and 135 games. After his two years coaching Piazza, he
thinks a better range is between 120 and 125. But it is a difficult
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay a lot of money to Mike to put people in the seats and
have him bat fourth every day,'' Benedict said. ``It's a delicate
process to get the right amount of rest and still do the things
he's capable of doing. It's something you have to stay in touch
with every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has no specific number in mind. Each game takes a
different amount of energy, he said, and the attention Benedict
mentioned is critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more to it than just the number of games,''
Valentine said. ``Sometimes a few innings are all a guy needs to
keep from getting underwater; sometimes it's a couple of days. His
play, as everyone's, we try to monitor as much as we possibly can.
But it's a marathon. This is what we play.''
</P>
<P>
   It starts this week, and Piazza plans to be there at the finish
line.

POPE WEIGHS CHOICE OF SUCCESSOR TO CARDINAL O'CONNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Pope John Paul II surveys the Vatican's secret
list of candidates to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor as archbishop
of New York, he may wish that the walls of a little-known gallery
at St. Joseph's Seminary could talk.
</P>
<P>
   There hang the portraits of men other popes have chosen to lead
the Roman Catholic Church in New York, from Richard Luke Concanen,
so reluctant to take on the job that he died in the two years he
waited to come here, to John Dubois, the only non-Irish bishop to
lead the church of New York, shunned despite adopting a shamrock
for his coat of arms, to John Hughes, a scrappy leader who
subjugated a defiant laity and laid the cornerstones for St.
Patrick's Cathedral, Fordham University and St. Joseph's Seminary
in Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the challenges that these leaders tackled, and through
the city's historic rise as a cultural and financial metropolis,
the Archdiocese of New York has come to overshadow older
archdioceses, like Baltimore, and larger ones, like Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to New York bishops, O'Connor said he
expected his successor to be named by March. The cardinal just
returned from a farewell visit in Rome with Pope John Paul II, who
is weighing candidates for a post he once described as ``archbishop
of the most powerful country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversies debated to this day, like public financing of
parochial schools and reconciling Catholic and American values,
bubbled first in New York, and organizations like Catholic
Charities originated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't become archbishop of New York because you're
important,'' said Monsignor Florence D. Cohalan, 91, author of ``A
Popular History of the Archdiocese of New York'' (United States
Catholic Historical Society, 1983), in an interview. ``You become
important because you're archbishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions arising now, given the changing demographics
of the archdiocese, is whether New York Catholics will see their
first archbishop with no claim to Irish ancestry. Dubois, of
France, came so long ago that New York was not even an archdiocese
then.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, chosen by the pope to lead the archdiocese in 1984, is
frequently described as the Vatican's spokesman to the United
States. He has strenuously advocated church teachings in an era
when many American Catholics do not agree with the church's
positions on abortion, divorce or women in the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Cohalan ventured that O'Connor, who is expected to retire soon,
will be remembered as a ``very good caretaker.'' Asked whether he
meant of souls or of the church itself, Cohalan said the two went
together. ``An archbishop who does his duty frequently has to speak
up on issues that irritate people, like divorce, abortion,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, a few minutes after much of America watched
her try to win $250,000 by identifying a pseudonym used by
disgruntled movie directors (Alan Smithee, which she didn't guess),
Judy Tigay addressed a more interesting question: Why do so few
women play ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''?
</P>
<P>
   The program's selection process, administered by a computer and
open to anyone, has provided students of gender differences with a
rigorously blind experiment involving millions of people. (On a
typical evening a quarter-million people phone to take the first
qualifying quiz.) So far 103 men have reached the hot seat facing
Regis Philbin. Tigay is only the 12th woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are just as smart, but men are more tenacious,'' said
Tigay, who was back home in West Bloomfield, Mich., when the taped
program was broadcast. ``The men competing with me in New York said
they'd called night after night trying to get on _ nine times a
night if the line was busy. If I hadn't been lucky enough to make
it on the first phone call, I might not have kept trying.''
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals at the ABC studio on West 67th Street, Tigay
noticed that the men remembered all the questions they'd had on
their qualifying tests. She and another woman contestant did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is important to the men, especially young men,''
said Tigay, who at 54 is one of the oldest players. ``It's the cave
man mentality _ they have to go out and conuer the world, and the
young single guys have free time to concentrate on it. Women have
other things to worry about, like taking care of their homes and
families.''
</P>
<P>
   That theory jibed with my own experience as a game show
contestant. I was single, 24 and happy to spend dozens of evenings
training for ``The $20,000 Pyramid'' under the tutelage of another
young single guy, who had triumphed on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Using a stopwatch, he conducted drills in speed-talking and
trained the class to memorize clues to any word that would come up.
Over and over, we practiced blurting out a primary clue
(``Old-fashioned ladies' underwear'') followed immediately by a
secondary clue (``Blank Junction'').
</P>
<P>
   My skill got me on the show, through the first game, but not
quite to the top of the pyramid in the bonus round. Then I lost the
second game when my celebrity partner, Michael McKean, a wonderful
actor tragically unfamiliar with ``Petticoat Junction,'' replied to
my memorized clues by saying ``Tuxedo.'' I went home with a rug
shampooer and a case of Rice-A-Roni.
</P>
<P>
   It was not unlike the obsessive, testosterone-poisoned behavior
observed in an experiment with chicken. Researchers sprinkled two
colors of grain, red and yellow, and noticed that the
high-testosterone chickens single-mindedly went after a single
color.
</P>
<P>
   Once a high-testosterone male settled on red, he would ignore a
convenient yellow grain nearby and go off hunting for a distant
red. Meanwhile, the yellow grains were probably gobbled up by more
sensible females who gazed at the males in the way that my
girlfriend regarded me and my Rice-A-Roni.
</P>
<P>
   Men are presumed to be doing most of the pecking at telephones
to reach the ``Millionaire'' computer, and it's been theorized that
their experience with videogames makes them faster at punching the
right answers. But the speed record during the ``fast-finger''
round of the game was set by a woman _ four answers in 0.87 seconds
_ so that theory seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that men tend to have an edge on quick trivia
questions. They grow up trying to one-up each other with baseball
statistics, and as adults they're more likely than women to
converse about topics in the news _ anything to avoid messy
emotional topics that might actually be personally important.
</P>
<P>
   To redress the balance, Regis Philbin issued a plea on the show
last week for women to pick up the phone and try out. But Tigay
wonders how many women will respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very competitive, but I'm an exception,'' she said.
``Women are geared to be nurturing and that doesn't suit the style
of this game. It's very difficult to be competitive when you feel
that you must make everyone happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what's needed is a game attuned to women's subtle
talents at forging coalitions, one that rewards sophisticated
networkers instead of brutes trying to beat everyone at a simple
task. Suggestions are welcome here (jtier(AT)nytimes.com) for an
improved ``Millionaire,'' or for a whole new kind of game show.
Regis might like to hear them, too.

BEHIND A MURDER SUSPECT'S COOL FACADE, EMOTIONAL TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All week long, a small, close-knit group of students at Columbia
University has puzzled over the paradox of Thomas G. Nelford Jr.
What inner torment could have possessed a bright young man they
knew as a pacifist, artist and all-around mellow California dude to
suddenly slash the throat of a woman he had just taken home for
Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   If Nelford had not subsequently threw himself in front of a
subway train, dying instantly, his friends said, they would have
found it impossible to even imagine that he had killed Kathleen A.
Roskot, a 19-year-old sophomore and star lacrosse player at
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to understand, but we don't,'' the Rev. George
Sullivan told nearly 800 friends and relatives Friday at Nelford's
funeral Mass in Oxnard, Calif. ``Our souls cry out: Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Deepening the mystery is the fact that the day before their
deaths last weekend, there were no outward signs of strain between
the two, some friends said. They shared sandwiches Friday
afternoon, did stomach crunches together and discussed going to see
the movie ``Angela's Ashes.'' Upon returning to her dormitory after
midnight, Roskot mentioned to friends that the couple planned to
stay in for the rest of the night. They were holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   After she failed to show up for lacrosse practice last Saturday,
her room was checked and her nude body was discovered. Nelford, 23,
killed himself soon after.
</P>
<P>
   While the police continue to investigate, some of Roskot's
friends have suggested that she was trying to end the relationship.
Such a rejection would have been devastating, Nelford's father, a
lawyer, said in a series of emotional interviews this week from
Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Thom Nelford said his son's seemingly unflappable cool hid an
emotional fragility, the result of endless discord between his
parents that, the father said, made his son unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced in 1985, the Nelfords have grown so estranged that when
Carolyn Nelford, Tom Jr.'s mother, called last week to let her
ex-husband know about their son's death, he hung up on her before
she could tell him the news, he acknowledged. She called back and
left word of their son's death with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Nelford, a paralegal in Oxnard, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Tom Nelford had managed to overcome his
parents' messy divorce. He thrived in school, becoming one of the
best high school wrestlers in Southern California. At Rio Mesa High
School in Ventura County, he had a 3.5 grade point average, his own
rock band and plenty of friends.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Columbia in 1995. His major was visual arts, and his
freshman year seemed to go well enough. The Columbia sports media
guide called him ``one of the top'' freshmen wrestlers in the Ivy
League, and he finished the season with a respectable 17 wins and
13 losses. He earned the nickname Rugged Tom. With little money for
winter clothes, he could be seen trudging through snow in sandals,
jeans and a T-shirt as if he were strolling through warm California
beach sand.
</P>
<P>
   Nelford's sophomore wrestling season was up and down, and he did
not wrestle during his junior year, but he did find modest success
in art and music. He formed a band called Couchcase and recorded a
few songs featuring his frenetic guitar playing and scruffy voice.
He also had several cartoons published in the student newspaper,
The Columbia Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Nelford spent more and more time on his art at the expense of
academics. He dropped out of college in the spring of 1998 and
returned to California.
</P>
<P>
   His mother sent him to counseling, but he expressed ambivalence
about re-enrolling at Columbia. He told friends that he wanted to
wander the country like Jack Kerouac, one of his literary heroes.
</P>
<P>
   He turned up one day at his father's door in Reno, their first
meeting in years. Nelford described his son at that time as
``emotionally crippled'' yet yearning for a connection. They talked
and cried together at a coffee shop. ``The father-son relationship
was so destroyed,'' Nelford said. ``We wanted to get it back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, Tom Nelford, then 22, returned to New York City
with no specific plan. Back in California, his mother was worried
sick. She would go weeks without hearing from him. ``She prayed for
that child every minute of every hour of every day,'' said her
friend Nancy Reddish of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the fringes of Columbia, Nelford floated along. He fell
in with a small group of students, and spent his summer days
in-line skating, writing songs, smoking marijuana and playing his
guitar on the roof of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house, where he
often slept in an oversized storage closet.
</P>
<P>
   He wore his hair long and scraggly, and gave little thought to
his ratty clothes. ``He was one of those guys it was hard not to
want to take care of,'' said Elizabeth Buckey, 21, another friend.
``He was so down on his luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nelford affected an outward calm. His primary response to
everyday setbacks was a beatific ``Dude, it's cool.'' His outlook
seemed neatly summarized in one of his songs: ``Things could be
better, but I feel content. Because what I'm after, I represent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Nelford underwent an abrupt transformation as he
began to date Kathleen Roskot, the first serious girlfriend his
Columbia friends had ever seen him with. He cleaned himself up, got
a crew cut and took a job selling jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Roskot was full of drive and discipline, the two-time captain of
her high school lacrosse team on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Nelford's more bohemian friends did not understand the
attraction. She seemed preppy, standoffish. Once, when Nelford
introduced her to a friend whose bedroom walls were plastered with
photographs of marijuana buds, it was clear that she wanted to get
out of the room fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was, `Go school, go life, go career,''' Buckey said. ``She
would want to be changing him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two had things in common _ athletics, contemplative
natures and a passion for the music and literature of the 1960s.
Roskot decorated her room with posters of Jimi Hendrix and Janis
Joplin and stuck up favorite Kerouac quotes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Romeo Petretich, who was dating one of Roskot's
suite mates, Roskot took Nelford to her home on Long Island for
Thanksgiving. During the Christmas break, the two drove out West to
visit his parents. His mother was thrilled. ``My prayers have been
answered,'' she told Reddish.
</P>
<P>
   The two then traveled to Reno to spend New Year's Eve with
Nelford's father. Thom Nelford said his son seemed happy, in love,
at peace. Weeks later, he received notes of thanks from both of
them.

TOP REGULATOR TELLS INVESTORS IT'S TIME TO BE MORE PRUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's top securities regulator warned Saturday that some
of the most popular stock market strategies, including buying
stocks with borrowed money and rushing into hot new issues, may be
hazardous to investors.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time that Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, had advised investors to
manage their holdings with caution and prudence. But his tone was
somewhat sharper Saturday and appeared to be an attempt to shake
investors out of a reverie created by many years of abnormally high
stock market returns.
</P>
<P>
   In prepared remarks to be delivered at an investment conference
in Los Angeles sponsored by The Los Angeles Times and attended by
individual investors, Levitt said: ``Successful investors, through
good times and bad, focus a vigilant eye on managing risk. Periods
of promise and prosperity are not an excuse to let your guard down.
In fact, it's times like these when you need to raise it even
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview two days before the speech, Levitt said: ``My
sense is that many investors have become more emotional than
intellectual about their investment decisions, and this is the time
to point out to them the importance of analyzing carefully rather
than impulsively.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Levitt's chief concerns is that investors are borrowing
too heavily from their brokerage firms to buy stocks, a technique
known as buying on margin, without understanding the risk. While
borrowing to buy stocks can increase profits when stocks are
rising, when shares fall, indebted investors can have steep losses,
Levitt pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, asked the SEC to investigate a troubling rise in the amount
of debt incurred by investors in recent months. Levitt is
highlighting the risks of buying stocks with borrowed money as a
result of the Fed chairman's request.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy to own shares in hot initial public offerings is
another area of concern. ``With billions of dollars pouring into
fledgling start-ups with no discernible track record, naturally
investors are looking for big returns,'' Levitt said. ``But
sometimes this race to an IPO comes at the expense of laying the
foundation for a viable, long-term company.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt warned his audience about the hazards of relying on
Internet chat rooms for investment information. ``The Internet,
with its low cost, relative anonymity and unprecedented number of
innocent investors, makes it ripe for out-and-out fraud,'' he said.
Fraudulent messages posted on investor Web sites have been the
subject of SEC enforcement cases in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC chairman also advised investors to focus on a company's
fundamentals rather than simply its future potential. Today,
figuring out what a company is worth may be the hardest analysis of
all, he said. ``But any way you look at it, many of today's
valuations seem to defy traditional explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying that the sky is falling down,'' Levitt said in
the interview. ``But it is fair to say that the biggest threat to
future prosperity is when people lose perspective.''

   The sun was out, the fans were loud and Joe Torre stood at the
microphone at the end of the New York Yankees' victory parade last
October, praising his team for its third championship in four
years. Torre turned and beckoned one player to his side to
illustrate a point: Jorge Posada. ``Tell them what we say at the
end of our meetings, Jorge,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grind it out!'' Posada barked into the microphone, turning a
fist, his grin as wide as City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Torre, others in the organization thought. He summoned
Posada to the front of the stage to make him feel good, to
underscore the point that he would be the full-time catcher next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his first managerial move of the 2000 season,'' said
Mark Newman, the Yankees' president for baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees open spring training on Friday in Tampa, Fla., with
a wealth of contingency plans in place. If a starting pitcher is
hurt, they could turn to Ramiro Mendoza. They have five experienced
outfielders, two veteran designated hitters, both left- and
right-handed. Last year, they were among the few teams who could
afford to carry two front-line catchers, Posada and Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Now Girardi is gone, having signed with the Chicago Cubs. There
is only Posada, coming off a year in which he batted .245 and
accumulated more passed balls (17) than that of 26 teams. There is
only Posada, 28, a talented and hard-working switch-hitter with
power, a catcher who must forge a better working relationship with
the majority of the Yankees' pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have two primary candidates to serve as the backup,
37-year-old Tom Pagnozzi, who is coming back from shoulder surgery
and did not play in the majors last year, and Tom Wilson, who has
never played in the majors. There is no viable fallback in place,
no contingency plan if Posada struggles. This is his job. This is
his chance.
</P>
<P>
   Posada has never caught more than 109 games in a major league
season, but he may catch 140 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your tongue will be hanging out, because it's your job now,''
Torre told Posada when he called him last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking forward to this,'' Posada said in a
telephone interview last week. ``I've got my chance, and I'm
prepared, and I'm very, very positive about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada has been the primary catcher the last two years, but
Torre and the coaching staff relied heavily on Girardi, for his
experience and his empathetic relationship with pitchers. Although
the earned run averages accumulated by the pitchers when working
with Posada and Girardi were generally identical, the coaching
staff would often use Girardi to work on a particular problem with
a particular pitcher. When Orlando Hernandez was not throwing
inside as much as the Yankees' coaching staff wanted in 1998,
Girardi stepped in for a game to nudge El Duque. When Roger Clemens
was struggling into August last season, Girardi was assigned to
work with him.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsibilities belong to Posada now, nine years after he
was converted from infielder to catcher, after years of training as
the Yankees' heir apparent at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a talented guy,'' Newman said. ``He should be one of the
best catchers in the game the next few years. He's more than
capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Each pitcher has different requirements for his catcher. David
Cone is, in a sense, a tyrant on the mound, wanting to control the
games he pitches. The catcher is doing a good job if his presence
does not become a distraction to Cone, who mostly determines his
own pitch selection. When Girardi caught, he usually anticipated
what Cone wanted to throw, tried not to disrupt Cone's rhythm, and
Cone and he developed a strong bond.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast, the relationship between Andy Pettitte and
his catcher is similar to that between a private and a drill
sergeant. Pettitte is better when the pitching is uncomplicated. He
wants to lower the bill of his cap and focus on nothing but the
catcher and nod in robotic fashion to agree with whatever sign the
catcher issues. Jim Leyritz was the catcher for Pettitte in 1996,
and the pitcher liked to throw only to Leyritz. After Leyritz left
the Yankees, Girardi became Pettitte's catcher. There were games
when Pettitte never shook off a sign from Girardi. But before that
can happen, Pettitte must trust his catcher, and in the few games
they have had together, he has not had faith in Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Posada has teamed successfully with Hernandez, and
interestingly, their personalities are similar, both determined and
stubborn. Their disagreements lead to angry clashes that seem to
spur great things from Hernandez. Posada, in fact, begins baiting
Hernandez before each game, knowing how El Duque will respond.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Girardi was with the Yankees, club officials
determined, those pitchers who preferred him would never develop a
relationship with Posada. Now those alliances must be sealed; there
is no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers understand this is our catcher and this is what
we're going to do,'' Torre said. ``It's going to be learning the
pitchers as you go. It's not going to be a situation where every
single finger you put down, the pitcher is going to say yes. It's
going to be trial and error.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to take a lot of work, Pettitte said last month. ``He
has to get comfortable with us, and we've got to get comfortable
with him. It might be a little awkward at first, but that's usually
something that once he gets back there, you can have it right by
the time the regular season comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada played poorly most of last season. When Posada and the
Yankees could not agree on the catcher's salary in spring training,
the team unilaterally renewed his contract, as it can do under
terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Having seen other
players chafe emotionally under similar circumstances, Torre thinks
this may have affected Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``Jorge tried to put on a brave front for me every
time I talked to him. You know, `I'm OK, everything's fine.' I knew
better.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .268 with 17 home runs in 1998, he started
dreadfully in '99, including a .146 batting average in April and 15
strikeouts in 46 at-bats, As his average decreased, he put more
pressure on himself. A longtime scout who saw him often last season
said that Posada never looked comfortable, offensively or
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he didn't have a plan when he went to the
plate,'' the scout said. ``I can't tell you how many times I saw
him swing at a first-pitch breaking ball out of the strike zone and
ground out to second base. His balance was off when he made his
throws to second base, and they were never on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tools, absolutely. He should be a good player. He
just needs consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Posada batted .210 at the All-Star Game break, returned to
Puerto Rico for a few days to work with his father on his hitting,
and figured there was no point in worrying about his average
anymore. He just wanted to play well each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more relaxed, I think,'' he said, and the numbers
reflect this _ he hit .285 in the second half of the season, and
his catching improved.
</P>
<P>
   But Girardi caught Clemens the final weeks of the season, as
well as Pettitte, and in the playoffs, Cone teamed with Girardi, as
well. Posada started only three of the first 11 games of the
postseason, after playing about two-thirds of the games in the
regular season. After Hernandez won the first game of the World
Series, Posada realized that there was a chance he might not catch
again, because Cone, Pettitte and Clemens were scheduled to pitch
the next three games.
</P>
<P>
   Posada decided to lobby for a Game 4, with Clemens. ``I wanted
to catch that game,'' he said. ``I was selfish. I wanted to be the
guy behind the plate. I wanted to catch him, a guy who's going to
the Hall of Fame, in that game.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Clemens this and it apparently appealed to the veteran
pitcher, who treats his catchers the way tennis partners might
treat each other in doubles, pumping fists and feeding off emotion.
``Roger liked what I said,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   What Posada did not know was that Torre was already thinking
about starting him in Game 4. Girardi had been the catcher when the
Yankees wrapped up the World Series in 1996, running to the mound
to embrace John Wetteland, and he had rushed to the mound to hug
Mariano Rivera after the last out of the 1998 World Series. Torre
wanted Posada to have that experience.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched a terrific game before leaving in the eighth
inning, after acknowledging Posada at the mound. The next inning,
Atlanta's Keith Lockhart lifted a fly ball to left field, the last
out. Posada raced to the mound and hoisted Rivera into the air
before the rest of the team piled on.
</P>
<P>
   All of that weight, that responsibility, is on Posada's
shoulders now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves the chance,'' Girardi said. ``He's as ready as
he's ever going to be.''

GOP LEADERS WANT MAYOR'S ATTENTION UPSTATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alarmed that Hillary Rodham Clinton may be making inroads among
voters in upstate New York, Republican Party leaders have begun
expressing frustration and anger that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
spent so little time campaigning in a region that is essential to
winning the race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to light a fire under his backside,'' said one
Republican county chairman, who like others interviewed asked for
anonymity because they did not want to be identified as criticizing
Giuliani. ``You can't take upstate for granted, and we're getting a
little concerned about it. If he doesn't pay attention up here,
people aren't going to vote for a New York City mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Republican county leaders made similar remarks in
interviews on Friday. All three are crucial to building campaign
organizations in upstate areas where Giuliani is not as well known
as in New York City, and all three said that their motive was to
try to goad Giuliani into action. They also said that they still
considered him their best chance to defeat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel as if the upstate campaign has been
nonexistent,'' one of the leaders said. ``He was around quite a bit
in the early fall, and we haven't heard from him since. I have
called a couple of times because we were interested in doing a
fund-raiser, and I never get a call back.''
</P>
<P>
   Another said that Clinton's splashy announcement last Sunday in
Westchester County and her media-saturated road trip across upstate
New York had made Republicans nervous. ``The anxiety's there,
because Hillary's off and running,'' the county leader said. ``So
it's, `Come on, mayor, let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Giuliani has remained insistent that the best way for
him to campaign for Senate is to be a good mayor. ``People
understand that I have a full-time job,'' he said at a news
conference during a 14-hour trip to Buffalo last week, one of the
handful of times that he has been upstate in the last two months.
``And that the full-time job that I have is a very responsible one
and is one that has to be my primary concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a distinction with Clinton, who has never held elective
office, Giuliani added that people ``can look at my record as mayor
of New York City, and what they can say is that I would do the same
thing as senator as I did as mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Giuliani said on a television news program that he
had not wanted the race for the November election to begin this
early. In part because it has _ with daily dueling news conferences
and charges and countercharges between the two candidates that make
it seem like it is October, not February _ Giuliani has run a
series of expensive campaign commercials upstate, where opinion
polls show that he is still ahead of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, those polls also show that Giuliani does not have
the breadth of support upstate that Republicans traditionally do,
in part because many voters there inherently distrust mayors of New
York City. Pollsters also say that Giuliani's advertising campaign,
which began in October, has produced no evidence of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to run 30-second campaign ads,'' said one of
the county leaders. Another said that while the commercials were
very good because they highlighted Giuliani's record in New York
City, ``you're not going to put together the campaign strictly
through broadcast media.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jack Kemp, the former Republican congressman from Buffalo,
said Giuliani needed to venture outside New York City. ``It would
help if he were on the ground in upstate more,'' he said last week.
``I guess he hasn't started his campaign yet.'' Two weeks ago on
the Fox News Channel, Kemp said, ``I think Giuliani has got to get
cracking, particularly in upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani dismissed Kemp's remarks when he was asked about them
on Friday after a speech at the Westchester County Republican
headquarters in White Plains. ``Oh, come on, that's just the latest
silliness of the day,'' he said. ``Next question. We're running,
we're running very effectively, we're doing much better than
anybody thought, and the newspapers need something negative to
write for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did take numerous trips upstate during the fall for
fund-raisers, speeches and endorsements of Republicans in local
races. ``He's right on it,'' William D. Powers, the chairman of the
state Republican Party, said approvingly in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two months, Giuliani has been distracted by the
daily obligations and crises common to the mayor of the largest
city in the country. In December, he faced down a strike threat by
transit workers, engineered the ouster of his second schools
chancellor and played host, to glowing reviews and extensive
television coverage, of the city's New Year's Eve celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In January he delivered his State of the City speech and
released his 2001 budget _ both events so full of the good news of
financial surpluses and lowered crime rates that even Democrats
begrudgingly said they made for good campaign material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani's campaign advisers have long been frustrated by
his dislike of traveling outside the city. He is reluctant to
leave, in large part because he loves being mayor and can never
predict what disaster might occur in his absence. Last week was a
case in point. Giuliani was in Buffalo when a bomb exploded at 4:41
a.m. Friday on Wall Street, but he could not return to the city
until later in the morning because of fog. He was finally able to
get down to Wall Street for a noon news conference, but then had to
leave immediately for an afternoon speech in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's advisers say that he would prefer to be mayor for
life, were it not for term limits. In his State of the City speech,
Giuliani concluded wistfully by saying: ``I'm never going to have a
better job. I've loved it tremendously.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Philip Buch, actor, clutched his script and did the
spiel one more time. ``So, Super-Ninja Action Man senses the evil
of Dr. X,'' he enthused, ``and is now ready to turn Dr. X into
sushi!''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then turned to the director. ``Should I be touching
Dr. X here?'' he asked with concern. ``Should I pick Dr. X up and
start talking about his claw?'' He poked Dr. X.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's great,'' said Susan Wall, calmly. ``Try to be a
little loose with it. Try it without your script, whenever you're
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was the art of theater celebrated last week as hundreds of
frenzied actors and actresses rehearsed for the opening of New
York's biggest non-Broadway show. Ready or not, the curtain goes up
Sunday on the American International Toy Fair, the toy industry's
most prestigious annual trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 New York actors and actresses have been hired as toy
presenters during the weeklong extravaganza, which is by far their
greatest seasonal employment opportunity outside the city's
theater, film and television industries. The 30-year-old Buch
considered himself ``quite fortunate'' to have landed the role of
toy demonstrator for Action Man, a new line of 12-inch toys from
Hasbro Inc., the world's second-largest toymaker.
</P>
<P>
   Such performers personify the hot new offerings of the $23.5
billion toy industry during its annual stage production in
Manhattan, where nearly 2,000 toy companies from 26 countries place
multimillion-dollar bets to catch the eye of 40,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, buyers, securities analysts and a squall of print
journalists and video crews will deluge the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center and the dozens of showrooms in Manhattan's
six-block toy district.
</P>
<P>
   Although Toy Fair (nobody says ``the'') is not open to the
public, it enriches the public coffers by $180 million, according
to the city's convention and visitors' center.
</P>
<P>
   The largest toymakers don't reveal their Toy Fair expenditures,
but this year all the companies are spending more than $30 million
on their elaborate productions, according to David A. Miller,
president of the Toy Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade
group and sponsor of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors estimate that Hasbro and its archrival Mattel, the
world's largest toymaker, have each spent $10 million on their
presentations and showrooms this year.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-fair visit to Hasbro revealed room after room full of
actresses and actors talking to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not from a mental ward, we're just rehearsing our
lines,'' said Christopher Wilkes, the demonstrator for the toys
inspired by ``Titan A.E.,'' a Fox children's movie scheduled for
release June 16.
</P>
<P>
   This year Hasbro _ the maker of Pokemon and Furby toys and
Parker Brothers games _ has, along with its subsidiary Tiger
Electronics, hired 90 demonstrators. Their presentations are ``very
similar to a real play, with a set, costumes and a director,'' said
Wilkes, who is making his fourth Toy Fair appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In the Toy District as in the Theater District, performers must
survive the traditional casting rituals, then endure run-throughs,
technical rehearsals, dress rehearsals and costume-fitting
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Revisions cease only when the curtain goes up. ``We cut and
change the script till the last minute,'' said Jennifer Donahoe,
Wilkes' director, who is an associate marketing manager for toys
for boys.
</P>
<P>
   The performers even suffer from stage fright, facing judges even
harsher than New York reviewers. ``The industry is the ultimate
critic here,'' Buch said, ``and it all comes down to whether
customers buy the toys.''
</P>
<P>
   And more is at stake than on the Great White Way. If actors and
actresses can affect the destiny of a $10 million Broadway musical,
the performers at Toy Fair can help determine the fate of product
lines worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the room with Action Man, Buch said he was ``having
trouble with the introduction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think it's fine to add your personality here,'' said
Wall, Buch's director, who has the offstage title of marketing
manager for Action Man and Pokemon. She turned to an interviewer:
``We want Philip to personify Action Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he ever: With his chisel-jawed good looks and 6-foot-4
frame, Buch was a ringer for the full-sized Action Man mannequin in
the exhibit. But Buch isn't just another pretty face. He has taken
roles on ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' and in the
forthcoming Ben Affleck film ``Boiler Room.''
</P>
<P>
   So why do they do Toy Fair? ``Give me any opportunity to get
paid for playing with toys all day, and I'm there,'' Buch said.
</P>
<P>
   No but, seriously, why? ``I'm so vain, it's scary,'' he said,
laughing. ``I want people to see ME all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel Turner, a demonstrator in the Pokemon suite, said that
``every actor in New York City wants to do this job,'' adding:
``It's great _ 14 days of work on a job that hones your talent. And
for a lot of actors, it means they won't be waiting tables for two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro works with a half-dozen casting agents. In January, 100
performers auditioned. About 75 were called back and 50 were hired.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky winners, who generally make $200 to $400 a day,
depending on their Toy Fair experience and the toymakers' largesse,
perform from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m for 14 straight days, including
rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is grueling, and the audience tough. The toy buyers at
the show _ jet-lagged, partied-out, poker-faced _ do not always
happily follow Hasbro's arrows to toyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that the buyer just came in from the airport, and it's
raining out, and his feet are wet and he's hating life,'' said
Michael Schaefer, 40, a performer of Hasbro Game Theater. ``But you
try to find a way to bring this buyer into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it can take a year to manufacture fully tested production
versions of new toys, most floor samples are hand-built prototypes
_ some costing $10,000. Prototype tragedies are not unheard of.
Terri Hidenfelter, a senior manager at Hasbro, said that last year,
in one National Football League toy line, ``Wayne Chrebet's head
kept falling off.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 97-year-old Toy Fair kicks off with that
another-opening-another-toy spirit, the curtain must fall. This is
not necessarily a time for tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last afternoon, I'm going to gather everyone in the
cafeteria,'' Hidenfelter said, ``and say, thank you.'' She added:
``I'll tell them not to forget me when they become rich and famous.
I knew them when.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the actors have their grandest finale. ``That,'' she
said, ``is when I pass out the paychecks.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Along the Henry Hudson Parkway in Riverdale is an
elegant new 15-story building with a marble-tiled entrance, a fancy
private dining room that can be reserved for entertaining, a
24-hour snack bar and a staff pianist who performs popular
standards. Operated by Atria, a company in Louisville, Ky., the
building is intended for well-off elderly residents who have no
medical need for a nursing home but may require some help taking
care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Highly popular in suburbs all across the country, homes like
these were rare in New York City until two years ago, when
developers began trumpeting the city as an ideal new market.
</P>
<P>
   But in the five months since the home, Atria Retirement and
Assisted Living, opened in the northwest Bronx, only about 27 of
its 238 apartments have been rented. Elsewhere in the city, homes
with similar amenities are half full.
</P>
<P>
   And now many people are having second thoughts about the market
for such assisted-living buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing occupancy rates are raising questions about
whether developers overestimated the market for such costly living
arrangements, where monthly fees start at $3,000 for a small studio
apartment and climb steeply from there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people who provide services to the elderly say there is a
strong demand in the city for assisted living, if it can be offered
at lower rates. ``The desire for assisted living is just
enormous,'' said Jean Murphy, the executive director of Friends and
Relatives of the Institutionalized Aged, a New York consumer
advocacy organization. ``The problem is the prices are very high.''
(The fees usually cover an apartment with a kitchen, two or three
meals a day, linen services, housecleaning and social activities.
Personal and medical care are extra.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Assisted living holds considerable appeal for people like
Margaret Lloyd, 83, who lives alone on the Upper East Side and,
like many elderly New Yorkers, has a rich cultural life. But she is
concerned about the day when it may not be so easy to get around.
``If I stay in my apartment, which is very tempting, and I get
incapacitated, it will be like being entombed,'' she said. ``If I
need care, I'm not going to get it, and I won't have a community of
people to talk with or see.''
</P>
<P>
   As they expanded rapidly on Long Island and in New Jersey, the
publicly traded assisted living companies bypassed the city itself
as an undesirable location because of high real estate costs,
complex licensing regulations and difficult zoning restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But about three years ago, the companies began scrambling to
build homes. About a dozen had either opened or were being planned,
and well-known operators like Marriott were scouring the city for
more locations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Developers said they were drawn to the city because of its
relatively large population of affluent older people and its heavy
concentration of the principal marketing target for assisted
living: middle-aged professionals seeking comfortable and
convenient surroundings for their frail parents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, several companies have pulled back
from the New York market. Marriott, which had hoped to operate
homes on Staten Island and in Manhattan, says it has curtailed the
pace of new development and is no longer looking for sites in New
York. CareMatrix, a company in Needham, Mass., says problems
finding financing affected its decision to scrap plans to build two
homes in Manhattan and two in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   After trying for several years to convert the vacant Towers
Nursing Home, on Central Park West at 106th Street, into an
assisted-living home, the developers, Savanna Partners, have put
the building up for sale. At two other homes that Atria operates,
on 86th Street near Riverside Drive in Manhattan and in Kew
Gardens, Queens, only half the apartments are occupied.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, what is happening in New York reflects a
national trend. The assisted-living industry has grown rapidly in
recent years, accounting for three-quarters of new housing for the
elderly in 1998. As the market nationwide began to appear
oversaturated, the earnings of some companies declined. Wall
Street's enthusiasm dampened, and capital for new construction
dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Susan B. Brecht, a Philadelphia consultant to the housing
industry that serves older residents, said that many operators had
been forced to scale back their expectations in many parts of the
country. ``They projected `fill' rates that were overly
ambitious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's problems seem to be compounded in New York, where
elderly people can be an especially tough sell. Even those who can
afford to move often prefer to remain in their apartments _
especially if they benefit from rent stabilization laws _ and hire
people to help them cope, according to many experts in services for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   While they may admire the concept of assisted living, many older
people shudder at the fees that for-profit companies are seeking.
``My parents were raised in the Depression,'' said Dorothy E.
Siegel, an education researcher at New York University who is
trying to bring her octogenarian parents up from Florida. ``They
have always had a very penurious attitude.''

</P>
<P>
   Older New Yorkers are often skeptical consumers. The assisted
living industry has a good reputation, but most of the new homes
are unlicensed, a status that is permitted under New York state law
as long as health care is arranged through licensed agencies. With
vivid memories of the nursing home scandals of the 1970s, many
people are wary of what Katherine Bachenheimer, an 89-year-old
Manhattan resident, describes as ``real estate ventures with
expensive rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, many potential customers are terrified of being
transferred to a nursing home _ which would be covered by Medicaid
_ if they could no longer afford the high fees. After a close
friend who is 74 became partly disabled, Jane Greengold Stevens
tried to move her into Prospect Park Residence, which is not far
from her own home in Brooklyn. ``We looked at Prospect Park, which
seemed perfect,'' Stevens said, ``except for the fatal flaw that
they wouldn't take Medicaid when the money ran out.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some people said they would prefer a nonprofit
environment like the one proposed for a site on 95th Street and
Second Avenue by an organization called Health Advocates for Older
People. The fees would exceed $3,000 a month, but Friedhilde
Milburn, the president of the organization, said she had created a
special fund through private donations that could be used to
prevent anyone from being evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns, for-profit operators say they expect to
do well in New York over time. ``It takes a year to get a
reputation built in the community,'' said Pat Mulloy, the president
of Atria, which is offering incentives to prospective residents,
like a $1,000 decorating stipend. (The Atria home is facing
competition from a 17-story home, the Classic Residence by Hyatt,
that is going up just across the city line in Yonkers. The
apartments earmarked for assisted living or people with Alzheimer's
_ 111 of the 310 in the building _ will be licensed by the state.)
</P>
<P>
   In Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, nearly a third of the apartments
are already rented in a 102-unit home that Sunrise Assisted Living,
of Fairfax, Va., is opening, said Kevin Hunter, vice president for
operations in the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   Brookdale Living Communities, of Chicago, says it has accepted
41 deposits for a 218-unit retirement home under construction in
Battery Park City, Manhattan, where monthly fees range from $3,400
for a studio to $8,500 for a two-bedroom penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey and Jay Calhoun of Portland, Ore., who are in their 70s,
recently put down a refundable deposit for a two-bedroom apartment
at Brookdale so they could be near their son and his family, who
live near Washington Square. ``There are a lot of advantages to
being near family when something comes up,'' said Mrs. Calhoun, a
retired college counselor. ``The costs are more than we encounter
in Oregon, but comparing what an apartment costs in New York, I
don't think it's out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Among local developers, Forest City Ratner, a partner in the
Hyatt project in Yonkers, is planning to build a licensed
assisted-living home in Forest Hills, Queens. Castle Senior Living
of Teaneck, N.J., is about to open a 93-unit home in Manhattan
mainly for people with Alzheimer's. Stanley Diamond, the chairman
of Castle, said his Prospect Park Residence in Brooklyn was 90
percent full.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that his apartments are beyond the reach of most New
York residents, Diamond recently teamed with the Metropolitan
Council on Jewish Poverty to seek ways to build more affordable
housing. The state has a small Medicaid-financed assisted-living
program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-income nonprofit assisted living is indeed coming to New
York, but only in a trickle. This spring, the Hebrew Home for the
Aged will open a home with 60 apartments about three miles from its
nursing home in Riverdale. Village Care, a Manhattan organization
that runs a nursing home and other services for the elderly, is
building 84 units at 46th Street and 10th Avenue. Residents will be
chosen by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   To many people, this pace seems agonizingly slow. Helen Acker,
81, of Manhattan, perceived the need for assisted living when she
was saddled with the responsibility of caring for her own mother,
who lived to be 96. ``Our government agencies are behind the times
in not realizing the need for this kind of thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But government's ability to bring about more assisted living is
very limited, said Herbert W. Stupp, New York City's commissioner
for the aging. ``It's very expensive,'' he said. ``To come in with
affordable rents requires huge subsidies. I'm not sure how much
government can do.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toronto's acquisition of Darcy Tucker from Tampa Bay
fills the Maple Leafs' need for, well, a pest.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker has been one of the league's great antagonizers,
something the Leafs have needed desperately to go with all of that
skill. Toronto attempted to land Tucker before the trading deadline
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who relishes his reputation, says he got his toughness
from his mother, Florence. When Tucker was 12, he was flattened by
his mother in the family's backyard rink in Alberta. ``It was the
defining moment of my career,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, Dwight, who is four years younger than me, was out
there with me. I was putting the puck through his legs and
laughing.'' Florence then asked Darcy to try the same move against
her. ``When I went to put it through her legs, she gave me a
forearm shiver,'' Tucker said. ``She dropped me on my butt. Then
she told me, `Sometimes you have to pick your spots when to keep
your mouth shut.'''
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING HASEK
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier initially denied that he
held trade talks with Los Angeles involving goalie Dominik Hasek.
Regier recanted his denial after Kings GM Dave Taylor confirmed the
talks. But Regier said he did not initiate them and reiterated that
the goalie, in effect, is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the Kings we're not entertaining offers for Hasek,''
Regier said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Buffalo News, Hasek has a no-trade clause that
mandates the following: 1) the Sabres purchase his $189,000 home in
Amherst, N.Y.; 2) the team pay him a relocation fee of $500,000; 3)
the Sabres also pay the Buffalo Variety Club, a charitable
organization, $25,000 for a series of reachable statistical
plateaus.
</P>
<P>
   'BIG THINGS' BREWING
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Carolina is that center Rod Brind'Amour won 57
percent of his faceoffs in his first seven games with the
Hurricanes after being acquired from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that he had no goals and two assists, despite
playing with Sami Kapanen and Andrei Kovalenko. ``I'm doing enough
of the little things,'' Brind'Amour said. ``Now I need to start
doing the big things.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Carolina coach Paul Maurice on the push by some for four-on-four
hockey: ``That would be a crime. If the league thinks it needs
four-on-four skating to attract new fans, then we're marketing our
product improperly.'' Historians, take note: Hockey used a
six-on-six format until doing away with the ``rover'' position in
1911.
</P>
<P>
   DEVILS FEEL TRADE HEAT
</P>
<P>
   An Anaheim scout and the agent for New Jersey's Brendan
Morrison, who has been requesting a trade, were seen at a recent
Devils game. Naturally, everybody is making assumptions _ such as,
Morrison will be packaged with other players and sent to the Ducks
for Teemu Selanne. Devils players think that GM Lou Lamoriello is
getting ready to swing a major trade.

 &HT;    NHL head blamed for failing clubs
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In addition to his blur of accomplishments on the ice,
Wayne Gretzky's greatest off-ice attribute might be his Bruce
Springsteen-like flair for identifying with the common man.
</P>
<P>
   The trait was evident at the All-Star Game in Toronto last week.
Gretkzy was asked if he is surprised that the Canadian government,
under pressure from angry citizens, rejected financial aid to its
ailing NHL franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple,'' Gretzky said. ``I mean, the whole
country is based on hard-working, 9-to-5 parents who do the best
they can to provide their families. A small percentage of the
country is people who are making over a million dollars a year. The
average person can't understand why people who are making $5- and
$6 million a year need tax benefits. So, it's pretty simple why
they rallied against it, and how can you blame them? It's too hard
for people to comprehend. If you are making $30,000 or $35,000 a
year and working your rear end off, the last thing that I would
vote for is giving a guy making $5 million tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it usually goes that way in professional sports.
Owners say they can't compete on the field of play without new
arenas and revenue streams, hold up local governments for tax
breaks and contributions and, failing that, move the team to a
market willing to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Canada figures to lose three or four of its
franchises to U.S. markets; Original Six members Toronto and
Montreal are the likely exceptions. What doesn't make sense is that
commissioner Gary Bettman is taking the heat for it.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Bettman was skewered by the sometimes
emotionally warped Canadian media in Toronto, where the All-Star
Game and affiliated events were held last weekend. Newspaper
columnists blame Bettman for not doing more for financially wrecked
franchises in Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. He also was
criticized when he announced that the NHL's Canadian Assistance
Plan, which provides aid based on need, was being extended only on
a year-by-year basis _ as opposed to a five-year extension, as some
originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   While Bettman would prefer not to lose any of the Canadian
franchises, it's not the responsibility of any sports league to
keep individual businesses afloat.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Bettman's fault the Canadian dollar has been devalued.
It's not his fault that the United States has more viable markets
than the northern provinces. It's not his fault somebody in Denver
will pay higher taxes than somebody in Quebec. That the NHL is
offering any assistance is probably more than the league should do.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of any sports league is its ownership and its
markets. But if the NHL were to flow millions of dollars into every
failing franchise, the league would suffer in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority, as a league, remains maintaining our Canadian
presence with six teams _ six competitive, viable successful
teams,'' Bettman said last week.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the NHL's responsibility to keep the Flames in Atlanta
or the Seals in Oakland or the Scouts in Kansas City. Nobody in
those U.S. towns said it was the commissioner's fault when they
bolted.

 &HT;    Faceoff with Wayne Gretzky
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   _ Player: Wayne Gretzky
</P>
<P>
   _ Position: Retired legend.
</P>
<P>
   _ On today's young players: ``We seemed to have lost the
creativity, the imagination. That creativity basically came from
the fact kids would go to the ponds and skate for six, seven, eight
hours a day, choose up sides, have two nets and no goalies and away
you go. If you take 10 kids now and rent the ice and say, `We're
going to play a scrimmage,' the first thing every kid would say is,
`What position do you want me to play?' We need to get back to just
the basics of having fun. I think that would go a long way to
getting the imagination back into our game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On whether he has been offered a general manager's job and/or
ownership stake by any franchise: ``I've talked to a few teams. We
never got to the point where it was serious because at this point
in time it's not the right thing for me to do. I need to take a
step back from the game and get away from it for a while, and ... I
don't have the time to do it right now. It's a full-time
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On Jaromir Jagr's backing of four-on-four hockey: ``Obviously,
it's more exciting. But one of the great things about our game is
the tradition. Five-on-five hockey, to me, is the way it should be
played. Obviously, we go in cycles. A few years from now, the
people will be saying, `We're scoring too many goals. We need to
clamp down a little bit.' So it's an evolution. I hope we don't go
to four-on-four.... Maybe we should go to four-on-four with kids,
in certain leagues and certain ages. It would be a way to get back
to some creativity with some kids who are 9, 10 and 11. There's too
much trapping instituted in Pee Wee and Bantam hockey.''

 &HT;    Latest Mess(ier) involves possible trade
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Messier caused a stir in Canada during the
All-Star break when he acknowledged the possibility of being
trading by Vancouver. Such a move would require his approval. But
Messier implied that he would not get in the way of a trade. ``I
just don't want this to turn into a sideshow,'' he said. ``This is
not about me or all my years in hockey. This is about doing the
right thing for the future of this franchise.'' At least four teams
are interested in Messier: Dallas, Toronto, St. Louis and New
Jersey. The Stars' interest is curious. They seemingly have little
in the way of prospects to give Vancouver in return, and they might
balk at the $3 million to $6 million it would take to keep around a
39-year-old whose offense is limited. Messier probably would be
playing as a third-line center, behind Mike Modano and Joe
Nieuwendyk. Then again, GM Bob Gainey and coach Ken Hitchcock have
an affinity for old guys.
</P>
<P>
   THE KIDD TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Florida goalie Trevor Kidd hopes to make his comeback from a
shoulder separation on Saturday against Pittsburgh. But Kidd
probably will be sent to the minors for conditioning for at least
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the position we're in, where points are very
important, I don't want Kidd to come in and play cold,'' coach
Terry Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Kidd proves to be ready, the Panthers probably
will send Mikhail Shtalenkov to the minors rather than trade him,
to give the team a veteran goalie to expose in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   DEAN ON THE MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dean proved in Atlanta that he could not be one of a
team's first four defensemen. In Dallas, he wasn't solid enough
even in a lesser role, which prompted the Stars to move him as part
of a package for Sylvain Cote and Dave Manson. Cote gives the Stars
another solid puck-moving defensemen who can play the power play,
which should take some pressure off Sergei Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   NOT AN ALL-STAR EFFORT
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's best plus-minus player, Detroit defenseman Chris
Chelios, was an atypical minus-five in North America's 9-4 loss to
the World in last week's All-Star Game. His postgame reaction:
``Yeah, I'm tired. I'm tired of fishing the puck out of my own
net.'' ... St. Louis goalie Roman Turek said he doesn't think that
league officials have cracked down on goaltender interference, as
promised, not after Detroit's Pat Verbeek crashed the crease the
other night. ``Goalie interference? I don't know what that means,''
Turek said. ``The NHL made some new rules, and every referee calls
a different thing.'' ... St. Louis' Tyson Nash, mocking a punch
thrown at him by Detroit's Steve Yzerman: ``I thought he threw a
pillow at me. I wasn't sure what he threw at me. He must have hit
me with a soft glove. Was it a bare hand? The ref must have had his
arm.'' ... In Los Angeles' past three wins, the forward line of
Ziggy Palffy, Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel accounted for 14 of
the teams' 16 goals.

SITTING BEHIND BARS: THE ALL-STAR WHO NEVER WAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hook was the greatest playground player ever from Oakland. He
could jump over cars and dunk. He was better than all of us. He
could have been one of the best players in the NBA. It was just one
of them things. He took one route and we took another route.'' _
Gary Payton, All-Star guard
</P>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Calif. _ Demetrius ``Hook'' Mitchell picks up the
telephone on the other side of the thick glass separating inmates
from visitors at Santa Rita Jail. He wonders why a stranger has
come to speak with him during visiting hours on a Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He slowly wipes his eyes and manages a half-smile, revealing the
absence of a few of his bottom front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this going to be about?''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is 31 years old with a stout frame, a beard and
braids in his hair, has two requests: to print his Muslim name,
Waliyy Abdur-Rahim, and to pass along word to his surrogate
grandmother, Shirley Jones, in nearby Richmond: ``Tell her I'm
going to write soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Across San Francisco Bay, Gary Payton and Jason Kidd were
getting ready to receive the keys to the city the next morning.
Kidd was planning a party for family and friends at a posh hotel.
They are fabulously wealthy, the two most accomplished point guards
in the game, living in a surreal world they barely envisioned as
Bay Area youngsters, yo-yoing down the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Both agree the best player they ever saw is sitting in a cell
here, an hour's drive east from the Arena in Oakland, site of the
49th N BA All-Star game on Sunday. Mitchell is awaiting a
preliminary hearing this week on charges of robbery, burglary and
possession of a handgun. He may be sentenced to state prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be at the game if I wasn't in here,'' he said. ``You
know it. I can still play with those guys. They know it too.''
</P>
<P>
   They call him Hook, the All-Star who never was. He comes
straight from Oakland hoop lore, a 5-foot-10-inch guard able to
dunk over a Volkswagen Jetta. Or 7-foot-6-inch Manute Bol in a
pickup game at Cal. He hurdled seven trash cans once, pirouetting
360 degrees before throwing it down. ``He jumped over me once, and
that was my last time volunteering,'' Kidd said. ``You actually
could see the bottom of his sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy, Demetrius, was so talented. He was physically built
like a tank. He could play the game. In my era, yes, he was the
best. You could ask around the town, and if there was a dunk
contest and you heard the likes of Demetrius Hook Mitchell, he
would draw a crowd. He was a magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Pico Wilburn, an Oakland recreation director, calls Mitchell
``our Earl Manigault,'' referring to the New York playground legend
who once plucked quarters from the top of a backboard. ``No, Hook
might have been better than the Goat,'' Wilburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill Russell and Paul Silas decades before, Mitchell
starred at McClymonds High School. His Oakland peer group not only
included Kidd and Payton, but the current NBA players Greg Foster,
Isaiah Rider, Brian Shaw and Antonio Davis, his gangly teammate.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Hook began modestly, with a stumpy 10th- grader
who could barely cradle the ball as he jumped toward the rim. But
it grew exponentially over the years with summer 3-on-3 tournaments
and locally sponsored dunk contests. In the mid-1980s and early
1990s, Mitchell enraptured the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looked around and would ask: `Where's Hook? Where's
Hook?''' said Harold Logwood, executive director of the Oakland
Minority Business Opportunity Committee and Mitchell's surrogate
uncle. ``He'd see me and wink at me, `Watch this one,
around-the-world dunk.' Six kids lined up in chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   For a dilapidated community trying to stave off the
crack-cocaine dealers from taking over the neighborhood, Mitchell
was the elixir.
</P>
<P>
   But Hook could not help himself. He was always drifting back to
the same West Oakland housing project. Abandoned as an infant, he
said his father ``started hustling in the late 1960s, and that was
it.'' He lived with his maternal grandmother, Johnnie Mae Mitchell,
but became attached to Jones through her grandson, Larry Parker.
Parker was shot and killed in 1986 after a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In his next game for Contra Costa College, a junior college for
which he played two seasons, Mitchell dedicated his 45-point night
to his surrogate brother. West Oakland grew more dangerous, and
many of Mitchell's supporters encouraged him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wolfcale, a writer for The West County Times who covered
Mitchell in college, became so fond of Mitchell he tried to land
him on the ``stupid human tricks'' portion of the David Letterman
show by sending in videotapes. ``Everybody that was around Hook
wanted him to succeed and do something for him,'' Wolfcale said.
``You only wished he did more to help himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Logwood even got him a scholarship at South Carolina State in
1991 based on a tape of Mitchell hurdling the car and dunking.
</P>
<P>
   But he never made it. That summer, Mitchell and several friends
were involved in a car accident in which one friend was killed.
Marijuana was found in the vehicle. His probation forbade him to
leave the state, and he ended up returning home. He made up six
credits to transfer to nearby Cal State Hayward, a major
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   His followers made the trek down Interstate 880 from Oakland to
Hayward, sometimes accounting for nearly half the fans in the
arena. They would sit under the basket and wait for that special
moment when he would steal the ball and streak toward the goal.
During a charged game against San Francisco State, Mitchell got
into an altercation with another player; his Oakland following
leaped from the stands and charged the floor. He was suspended for
two games and his college career would soon end.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported that Mitchell left the school after one season
because of financial difficulties. That was merely half the
problem. ``I was never enrolled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Jones described it, Mitchell started hanging out with the
``wrong people'' in Oakland. ``Everybody was running with Hook,''
Jones said. ``He couldn't do wrong. They kind of spoiled him and
never let him grow up. That's what happens to a lot of these kids.
Such a waste. Hook was so damn good. Jason and Gary don't got
nothing on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1993, a 65-year-old man was killed in West Oakland.
Mitchell was arrested and charged with murder and robbery. Those
charges were dismissed in October 1994 after questions arose about
the truthfulness of some witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has served time for gun possession and selling
narcotics to an undercover officer. More recently, he began to
embrace Islam and coached a group of second-graders in West
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to have his life in order, but that changed on Dec.
27 with his arrest. According to the police, a gunman entered an
Oakland Blockbuster Video store at 9:15 a.m. and ordered the
employees to the floor. One employee had dialed 911 and left the
phone off the hook. Hearing the robbery transpire, a dispatcher
sent officers to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was arrested within a few blocks of the store. No gun
was found, but he was carrying $4,500: the amount stolen from the
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a purification period for me,'' he said into the phone
at the jail. ``I was doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing.
I didn't think before I acted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones remembers the instincts that served Mitchell so well on
the court. Jones walks back into the den of her modest,
single-story home in Richmond. Poring through the scrapbooks of
yellowed clippings, you learn his vertical leap was once measured
between 46 and 50 inches. David Thompson, one of the great
skywalking players in NBA history, was said to have had a 46-inch
vertical leap. During 21 games of Contra Costa's 1988 and 1989
seasons, Mitchell had 60 slam dunks _ including six in one game.
</P>
<P>
   A local street hustler had begun giving Mitchell $100 for every
dunk in high school. ``I cleared $300 to $400 every night,'' he
said. ``Gary would come pick me up. One night he saw me getting my
money and he said: `Hey, wait, I had a dunk tonight. Can I get
$100?'''
</P>
<P>
   Payton confirmed that story. ``I remember one time when he spent
the night over my house,'' Payton added. ``He would go in the
corner and get on his tippy toes and stand there for 30 minutes, to
get his calves strong. He would be shaking over there, until his
calves grew bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell still engenders strong passions from his friend. ``Tell
him I still love him to death,'' Payton said. ``I can't be mad at
none of my friends. He just took the wrong route.''

   NEW YORK _ On her first campaign swing through New York City
since becoming an official candidate for the U.S. Senate, Hillary
Rodham Clinton spent a full day rallying the Democratic faithful on
Saturday, speaking of her interest in issues related to children
and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day that was to take her to four of the city's five
boroughs. And Clinton repeated many of the themes from her official
announcement on Feb. 6. But at every turn, the gatherings of
Democratic officials and foot soldiers responded as though they
were hearing her remarks for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   At a senior citizens center in the Flushing section of Queens,
Clinton discussed an initiative to help families pay for long-term
care for ill or disabled relatives, proposing a $3,000 tax credit.
Clinton said her proposal would provide financial support to 2
million people, about 1.2 million of them elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This long-term tax credit would be used to help thousands and
thousands of families,'' Clinton said. ``It will also support the
diverse needs that people have in long-term care. This tax credit
could cover up to 60 percent of the costs that families now bear.
Many of you know how exhausting it can be to care for a loved one
who has difficulties. I promise you that I will work my heart out
to support our seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   As she did in her announcement speech, Clinton told a group of
elderly listeners of her interest in extending Medicare coverage to
include prescription drugs. ``There are too many seniors who cannot
afford the drugs that are being prescribed,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady began her day basking in wild applause and chants
from about 200 elected officials and Democratic Party campaign
workers at a rally at York College, in the Jamaica section of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sounded the themes that she would repeat through the
day: the need to improve the quality of the state's public schools,
the need for legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs
and the need to bolster youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, Clinton came to the headquarters of the Democratic
Party organizations, where more than 300 people waited in two rooms
to hear her. She was met by nearly every Democratic official in the
borough, as she was in Queens. Afterward, she was to meet with
other party officials and campaign workers in the Washington
Heights section of Manhattan.

BUSH TREATING SOUTH CAROLINA AS A MUST WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Mich.)   (EDS: This story is an added starter for page 1.)  
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush's campaign has scrapped
trips to California and Arizona, bought the leftover advertising
time once held by Steve Forbes and started contacting 135,000
independents and Democrats in an all-out bid to stop Sen. John
McCain from winning the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To Bush and his aides, the stakes are enormous. With McCain
riding a wave of national attention after his stunning 19-point
victory in New Hampshire, the Bush camp feels that a loss here for
Bush would put his prospects for winning the Republican
presidential nomination in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign seems to be leaving little to chance. When Forbes
dropped out of the race on Wednesday, Bush aides grabbed the
remaining $45,000 worth of air time, expanding Bush's television
and radio expenses here to $3 million, nearly $500,000 more than
McCain's. In all, the Bush campaign will have pumped as much
advertising money into South Carolina as it did in New Hampshire
over a longer stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also decided to devote virtually his entire schedule to
South Carolina. Considering that Arizona and Michigan hold
primaries only three days after South Carolina's, some Bush
supporters in those states warned that it was risky to bypass them.
But Bush's advisers concluded that the best way to assure success
in other states was to emerge triumphant here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd have won New Hampshire,'' said Warren Tompkins, Bush's
chief strategist in this state, ``McCain would have been gone, so
there wouldn't have been a heck of a lot going on down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual new move is a telephone and mail appeal to
independents and Democrats, which Bush aides said had not been
planned until McCain jolted their campaign in New Hampshire on Feb.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said that their biggest fear, and the biggest
unknown, is that those voters _ who in this state can cross party
lines and participate in the Republican primary _ will flock to
McCain. The objective of the program, which comes on top of an
outreach to the homes of 300,000 reliable Republican voters, is to
persuade the independents and Democrats to back Bush or, at the
very least, discourage them from turning out for McCain. The total
outreach, to about 400,000 homes, is massive; in the Republican
primary in this state in 1996, the turnout was about 275,000.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush adviser said the campaign would be happy to pick off 30
percent of independents and Democrats who vote in the primary; in
New Hampshire, Bush drew only 19 percent of those voters, and
McCain won three times as many.
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone calls, Bush workers urge prospective voters to
back Bush, and raise questions about McCain. On Friday, expected
voters were reminded of Bush's ``strong victory'' in Delaware and
told, ``Don't be misled by McCain's negative campaign tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   While such calls are often effective, the efforts to criticize
an opponent can also backfire. One respondent chastised a Bush
caller, telling her: ``I saw an ad yesterday that Bush had on. I
didn't like him saying something back about McCain. To do one
negative against another. To me they both look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another respondent told a Bush caller, ``I like Bush, but I
don't like running people down like that.'' In recent days the
McCain campaign has accused Bush and his aides of spreading
negative information about McCain through calls intended to
resemble public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But a call may have had the desired effect on another
respondent, who said: ``I was for McCain wholeheartedly at first.
Now I'm on the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   In another move intended to win over more moderates, the Bush
campaign this weekend sent a letter from Elizabeth Dole to tens of
thousands of women in the state, concerning education and taxes on
charities. And earlier this week, the campaign sent a letter to
100,000 elderly voters intended to rebut claims by McCain that
Bush's proposals would threaten Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge mathematical puzzle,'' Karl Rove, Bush's chief
strategist, said in an interview Saturday. ``Our objective is to
maximize our vote among independents in South Carolina. We're going
out of our way with phone calls and postcards to invite these
people to our events.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its overtures to moderates, the Bush campaign is pressing
its cause with conservatives. Beginning on Monday, a recorded
message from Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee and a revered figure among anti-abortion
groups, will be telephoned to the homes of 100,000 conservative
voters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush advisers said they were uneasy about their
prospects, yet buoyed by surveys late last week suggesting that
McCain's momentum was waning.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign, of course, is also pumping its more limited
resources into this state; McCain's aides said they were spending
close to $2.5 million on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the overt changes, like Bush's new emphasis on
depicting himself as the genuine reformer, and his more energetic
style on the stump, McCain's emergence as a threat has forced the
Bush operation to tear up its earlier, behind-the-scenes game plans
for winning the nomination. In the same way that former Sen. Bob
Dole mistakenly focused on the challenge from Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, four years ago, Bush advisers were preoccupied for more
than a year with Forbes and his hefty war chest, and never seemed
worried about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Bush official said the campaign may have been slow to
react to McCain because ``when the budgeting was done, the doomsday
scenario was Steve Forbes unleashing a huge negative attack that we
had to respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush advisers said they were intent on running a tighter
campaign here than in New Hampshire. They said it was a mistake for
Bush to have appeared here with former Vice President Dan Quayle
after that defeat because it undermined the governor's message that
he, not McCain, was the anti-Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake or not, Bush is increasingly campaigning with public
figures from South Carolina. And his aides have spurned requests
from several of Bush's supporters in Congress to campaign in this
state. ``There's some trepidation about bringing in too many people
from the outside,'' Tompkins said. ``We're trying to use as many
home-grown surrogates as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush's most prominent supporters here, like Tompkins
and former Govs. Carroll Campbell and David Beasley, are keeping
some distance at public events.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to stop McCain and help Bush is not limited to South
Carolina. Late this week, Joe Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager,
held a conference call with many Bush backers in Washington _
including people close to former President Bush _ to explain how
the governor would win South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush lieutenants in Washington, including Haley Barbour,
the lobbyist who headed the Republican Party, and Rep. Rob Portman,
R-Ohio, have reassured the governor's supporters on Capitol Hill
about the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just encourage them to take a deep breath and look at the
results in Delaware,'' Portman said of Bush's triumph this week in
the primary there.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a Bush supporter, said that he,
for one, was worried that Bush ``took for granted that he was going
to win this thing.'' He said of McCain: ``There is some
appreciation that this guy is a war hero and has a clean record.
There are people that are concerned, and logically so, that this is
a big election in South Carolina. If McCain wins, it's going to be
a marathon to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Bush strategy is to tamp down any perception in the
press and among political professionals that Bush's eventual
emergence as the inevitable nominee is in doubt. As part of that,
the campaign is portraying the governor's win in the low-profile
Delaware primary as a monumental triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Rove went as far as to cite Bush's victory in the caucuses in
Alaska on Jan. 24, which campaign officials had barely mentioned in
the past. ``Bush has won three and lost one,'' he said. ``You
should be asking the McCain campaign if it could sustain a fourth
loss out of five.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Bush official said that while the governor could
endure a defeat here next Saturday, it would be a crippling setback
with the potential to lead major supporters to defect to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be nervous,'' the official said. ``There's not a
soul in this sort of high-pressure contest who doesn't think of all
the scenarios that are possible. The good ones make you feel warm
and fuzzy. The bad ones make you nervous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In seeking to undercut McCain, the Bush campaign has had some
help from independent groups that are running commercials attacking
McCain: the National Right to Life Committee and the National
Smokers Alliance. While Tompkins insisted that the campaign did not
work in tandem with the outside groups, which would be illegal, he
said their advertisements were useful for the cause.

GIULIANI PUSHES PRESIDENT ON OIL HEAT COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SENATE-RACE) 
(nk) 
 By THOMAS J. LEUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move clearly meant to attract the attention of upstate
voters in his bid for the Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Saturday that he had urged President Clinton to tap the nation's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring down the soaring price of home
heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the president on Friday, copies of which
were released at a City Hall news conference Saturday, the mayor
estimated that the average New York state resident would pay $350
more for oil heat this winter unless federal officials intervened
by opening the spigot to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, almost
600 million barrels of oil stored in salt domes in Texas and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe the impact this is having on Waterville,
N.Y., and other parts of the state where, obviously, it is even
colder than New York City,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, the mayor's staff said Saturday that home
heating oil prices had tripled in the city since Jan. 1, from 72
cents a gallon to more than $2.50 a gallon. The rising prices are
the result of reduced output by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and a cold winter.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani emphasized Saturday that he was appealing to the
White House on behalf of residents across New York state.
``Apparently, the president doesn't feel our pain,'' the mayor
said, adding that his letter was meant to ``politicize this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe politicizing this will get the attention of the
president,'' he said. If the White House does not agree to release
part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he said, ``this is
something we are going to bring up every day until they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and other members of Congress have
been making the same argument for months. But Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson has resisted, contending that the reserve is intended
only for severe supply disruptions, not to control market prices.
</P>
<P>
   While not pumping more oil on the market, the White House has
released $175 million in emergency assistance over the last two
weeks to subsidize oil purchases by low-income people across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Richardson said $37 million of those
subsidies had been designated for New York residents. ``Our
immediate objective is to help consumers who are being hurt,'' he
said, adding that the federal government would continue to provide
cash subsidies instead of oil from the strategic reserve.

 &HT;    Wife shares husband's passion for skeet shooting
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Heat shouldn't bother a person who grew up in
Savannah. But Chris Patton wouldn't be going to her husband's skeet
tournaments if he had not gotten her a ``mobile air conditioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon Patton, 51, an All-America shooter, began competing
in skeet two years after their marriage 12 years ago. Until he
presented Chris with a 40-foot Winnebago Ultimate Freedom
recreational vehicle, the podiatrist was missing in action most
weekends, spring through fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Winnebago worked so well that Chris is taking up skeet
herself. She can relax, read, take a nap and watch her husband
shoot _ while she's in cool comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Patton reached the world-class level of skeet a lot
quicker than most. He won the world .410-gauge title at the World
Skeet Shoot in San Antonio last year and was named to the National
Skeet Shooting Association's 2000 All-America Open Honorable
Mention team.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to that level requires lots of traveling, because the
NSSA requires a number of out-of-state shoots. Patton also needs to
compete against the best to maintain his sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   The sport requires long hours at the range and a level of
discomfort only the dedicated would endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about our smarts, but the game is so
addicting we'll put up with just about anything,'' Patton says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sport is noisy, shooting ranges are isolated and
some are built over landfills.
</P>
<P>
   And ranges are for shooters, not spectators. Since the major
part of skeet season takes place during the summer, it's hot and
humid outside and the only place to get relief is the clubhouse,
which usually isn't built for comfort. Those ranges built on
landfills add a new element to the heat _ occasional eruptions of
foul-smelling methane.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Chris Patton, 44, many 12-hour days at the range
to decide that she would rather be at home, alone but at least
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said if I got her a portable air conditioner she'd go with
me,'' Patton said. He found just what she was looking for through
another All-America shooter, Carl Hudson of Albany, who traveled to
shoots in an RV.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You really need to think about this,''' Patton said.
``We spent some time visiting in his camper, got one in April of
1998, and my shooting took off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was love at first trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``After their first trip in the motor home, on the way back, she
asked Gordon, `When is the next shoot?''' says Mark Tuggle of
Bleakly Campers, who sold the Pattons their camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed her whole take on the game,'' Gordon said. ``She
likes to read. She gets the air conditioner going and goes out when
she wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a place to go,'' Chris said. ``You can rest, take a
shower during the day. We've got our own things with us. We're able
to bring the foods we like and to cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our own bed and that's great,'' she said. ``When
he's shooting, we're sleeping in the RV more than at home.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped to move Patton from one of the lesser categories
of All-American the past five years into the coveted Open class.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Childersburg, Ala., last August, the ambient temperature
was 117. I'm sure I won that shoot because I had a cool place to
go, take a nap, keep my cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris found another plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the people we meet, whether on the shooting circuit or
at campgrounds. The people are just
</P>
<P>
   terrific,'' she said. ``It's like a traveling family. One couple
we travel with, we call them our weekend neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, for a married couple, RVs keep you close to each other.
At home, you might be in separate rooms, watching different TVs,
but in the RV, you talk more, share the same TV.''

   NEW YORK _ For centuries, great minds have searched for a way to
describe and understand the soul of American culture. A Columbia
University professor and his colleagues think they have found that
metaphor in the spontaneity, improvisation and resiliency of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is the best soundtrack we have for contemporary American
living,'' said the professor, Robert O'Meally, 51, a literary
scholar. ``Americans' impulse to be casual, to speak in a certain
way, to dance in a certain way, is affected by this swinging music
and by the people who made it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meally is the founder and director of the Center for Jazz
Studies, which opened last semester on the Columbia campus.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say the nascent program is the nation's
first academic center dedicated to exploring the role of jazz in
American culture. It is a bold assertion for an enterprise that,
for now, sponsors only three courses, which students can take as
electives in a liberal arts program.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other jazz programs at major universities, the center
at Columbia is not performance-oriented. It is not focused on
training musicians, nor is it housed in a music department where
students typically study music theory and composition. Its founders
hope to go further, to show how the influence of jazz reaches
beyond the music.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's center offers an interdisciplinary program structured
within the university's arts and science curriculum; its founders
plan a series of courses leading to a certificate of jazz studies
for undergraduate and graduate students. Students majoring in
political science or anthropology, for instance, could indicate
that they had specialized in jazz. A professorship in jazz studies
is also planned.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Association of Jazz Educators,
Columbia's approach is uncommon and, by lending jazz a sense of
academic legitimacy and import, sends a powerful message about an
art form only a century old.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McFarlin, the association's executive director, likened the
center's ambitious effort to the elevation of the jazz program at
Lincoln Center, which in a decade has become the nation's flagship
jazz organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having one of the nation's leading academic institutions place
such a high priority on the study of this music and its impact on
American culture can be compared to the impact felt when Jazz at
Lincoln Center was placed on a par with the New York Philharmonic
and the Metropolitan Opera,'' McFarlin said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The other night, Columbia's new jazz studies center presented a
discussion on Louis Armstrong as part of its inaugural lecture
series. The conversation was between the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis,
who is the artistic director of Lincoln Center's jazz program and
the first jazz artist to win a Pulitzer Prize, and Stanley Crouch,
a critic. Armstrong was celebrated as a cultural icon, a musician
whose trumpet became more emblematic of the United States than the
image of Yankee Doodle Dandy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meally, the moderator, used the sold-out occasion to announce
that the center, which operates out of O'Meally's small office on
the sixth floor of Philosophy Hall on the Columbia campus, was
settling in.
</P>
<P>
   The center grew out of a study group of jazz experts brought
together by O'Meally during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz represents to me a gesture toward perfection when it
comes to our democratic ideals,'' said O'Meally, who holds the Zora
Neale Hurston Professorship of American Literature. ``It suggests
we have a culture in which people are insistent on individuality
but at the same time we are struggling to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, which received a $300,000 grant from the Ford
Foundation, offers its three courses in collaboration with the
university's English and music departments. In the fall, O'Meally
teaches a course called ``Jazz and American Culture.'' This
semester, the center is offering a graduate seminar on Miles Davis
taught by John Szwed, a visiting anthropology professor from Yale
University, and a lecture course on Louis Armstrong by Phil Schaap,
a historian and record producer.
</P>
<P>
   During his class, O'Meally touched on everything from the use of
jazz in Ralph Ellison's novel ``Invisible Man'' to the jazz
aesthetic in paintings by Jackson Pollock and Romare Bearden, to
the jazz music of Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway in Betty Boop
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Wasserman, a junior, was one of O'Meally's 75 students. A
literature major, she said she found the range of jazz a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His course brought in everything from literature to the visual
arts,'' she said, ``anything in culture touched by jazz, which is
everything American.''

TOWNS COLUMN: MANY COMPLEX TRUTHS IN HURRICANE CARTER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. _ The bar where the triple murder in the Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter case took place 34 years ago is now called
Len's Place. The neighborhood has gone from white to black and
Hispanic, as have the bar's patrons. But you can still get the
local buzz along with your drink. As for the famous case, now the
subject of a hit film, the woman behind the counter one night last
week said, ``I don't think people even mention it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the scene of the crime has changed, the meaning of the
case keeps evolving with the politics of the times. Amid the urban
unrest of the 1960s, prosecutors cast the crime as two blacks
avenging a shooting by a white man in a black bar. In the Watergate
era, celebrities rallied around the famous boxer as yet another
casualty of government misconduct. Now comes ``The Hurricane,''
depicting Carter as a black man battling abusive white authority,
as racial profiling and the Diallo case have put racism and
policing on the national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was freed from prison after a federal judge ruled in 1985
that prosecutors withheld evidence, constructed a questionable
racial theory of the case and violated his constitutional rights.
The movie presents his innocence as unambiguous. But for those
touched most by the case, time has only magnified the real-life
ambiguities, as news conferences and Web sites by Carter's
detractors and defenders revive the bout for the title of victim.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Tanis was a 56-year-old waitress, just months from
becoming a grandmother, when she was gunned down at the bar, then
called Lafayette Bar &AMP; Grill. Her daughter, Barbara Burns, stayed
with her for 28 days as she struggled to survive, her midsection
shredded by bullets. It is an article of faith for Burns that
Carter and his co-defendant, John Artis, are the murderers. They
were convicted twice. Besides, her mother said so.
</P>
<P>
   In her split-level home in Flanders, 35 miles west of Paterson,
Burns re-enacted her mother's begging for mercy on the bar floor:
```Why are you doing this? I'm a mother. These are innocent
people.' John Artis hesitated, and Carter said: `Finish her. Finish
her.''' With fresh fury, she recalled her mother's words: ```You
don't look a man in the eyes and plead for your life and forget
what he looks like.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' brother, Rick Burns, says just hearing ``Strangers in the
Night,'' a favorite of his mother's, brings back the pain, as does
Carter's renewed hero status. ``Poor Rubin Carter,'' he says with
sarcasm. ``How about poor Hazel Tanis?''
</P>
<P>
   Another song, Bob Dylan's 1975 ``Hurricane,'' was the first
piece of popular culture to celebrate Carter's struggle against
``criminals in their coats and ties.'' Rudy Langlais had a similar
view of Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a Newark housing project, Langlais would watch
Friday night boxing matches on the family black-and-white
television with his father. He watched Carter then, and later
covered parts of the case as a reporter. Now, as a movie producer,
he helped make ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rubin Carter case is part of the myth, part of the sacred
history of New Jersey,'' Langlais said. He has told the story
unabashedly from Carter's point of view, portraying him as a
victim, even in his youth, when he stabbed a man.
</P>
<P>
   In making a movie, Langlais said, ``you have to decide on a
truth.'' He says the Carter story is one of ``grace and
redemption'' _ a man crushed by hatred, freed through the love of
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the truth is in any historical event,''
Langlais said. ``To the families of the victims, Rubin Carter and
John Artis committed the murders. The truth to Rubin Carter and
John Artis is that they were unfairly convicted, and there's
evidence to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no rhetorical arguments at Len's Place. The big news
is a pregnant woman in Paterson who recently accused police
officers of slamming her head through a car window. She had about
100 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Vera Ames, an advocate for the woman, said she knew
few details of the Carter case. But because of cases like the
woman's, which she said was under investigation, Ames understands
why people believe the truth according to Hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need no movie to remind me what's going on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the week since a young woman was slain at Columbia University
and her boyfriend committed suicide shortly afterward, the
university and its students have grappled with an issue of
increasing concern on campuses around the country: violent
relationships among students.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Renzulli, a spokesman for Columbia University, said
students there had turned to counseling sessions and support
groups, and that they were able to receive peer counseling over the
telephone. The university has a Rape Crisis/Anti-Violence Support
Center, and students can consult a health adviser on the Internet,
known as Go Ask Alice (www.goaskalice.columbia.edu), which offers
advice on subjects like relationships, emotional health and
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of the student, Kathleen Roskot, a sophomore, and two
other recent attacks at other area campuses have underscored the
problem of abusive relationships. The statistics are particularly
chilling: one in five college students has reported at least one
incident of abuse when dating, from slaps to more serious violence,
according to the Corporate Alliance to End Partner Violence, an
advocacy group in Bloomington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies show that about 28 percent of high school and
college students experience dating violence.
</P>
<P>
   In about three-quarters of violent dating relationships,
problems surface after the couple is seriously involved, according
to the alliance, and drinking or drug use contribute to about 60
percent of violent incidents among young couples.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signals that a relationship may turn violent include
possessiveness, controlling behavior, unpredictable mood swings,
and rushing the relationship, said Kim Wells, executive director of
the group.
</P>
<P>
   A partner who threatens to hurt himself or others, makes many
groundless accusations of infidelity, or isolates his girlfriend
from friends and relatives could also be headed toward violence.
(Of reported domestic crimes, 95 percent of the victims were
female, she said, citing FBI statistics.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Westchester Community College in Valhalla, N.Y., on Monday,
Olonzo Davis, 19, shot his ex-girlfriend, Joy Thomas, 18, in the
head, leaving her critically wounded. He then shot himself to death
in a nearby grove of trees. He had previously smashed the windows
of her car and home, and she had sought an order of protection
against him.
</P>
<P>
   A freshman at Montclair State University in New Jersey, Chimere
McCrae, 18, was killed on Jan. 21 in Newark. Her boyfriend, Price
Hollace, 21, was charged with murder and weapons charges. He told
the police the shooting was accidental, though McCrae's family said
there had been tensions in the couple's relationship over her
spending time with friends at college.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Women in their teens and 20s are more likely to be victims of
domestic violence than older women, said Sally Goldfarb, an
associate professor at Rutgers Law School who specializes in
domestic violence and family law, and violence is more prevalent in
dating than in marriages.
</P>
<P>
   College students may be more likely to accept traditional sex
roles, in which the man dominates the woman, she said, and they
tend to go to peers for help, rather than to more informed older
people. They are susceptible to peer pressure to stay in a
relationship, which they often see as preferable to being alone,
and they may be so inexperienced in relationships that they accept
a violent one as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Dating relationships are not always covered by state domestic
violence laws, which makes obtaining an order of protection
difficult, especially for minors.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Best, a former coordinator of sexual assault prevention
programs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
remembers working with 60 to 70 victims of dating violence in group
sessions in her four years there, and many more individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been astounded at the lengths to which young college
abusers will go to keep control over their victims,'' she said.
Often, victims ended up leaving school for protection.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Justice Department announced $8.1 million in
grants to 21 colleges to address violence against women on campus.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the University of Connecticut will be training male
peer educators to fight violence, the Rochester Institute of
Technology is offering a mandatory violence prevention program for
incoming students, and Michigan State University is creating a
phone line for hearing-impaired students who need help from Safe
Place, the campus domestic violence shelter, established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The grants have to include community groups outside the school.
``Campuses often don't want students who are victimized to report
to local police,'' said Bonnie Campbell, director of the Violence
Against Women Office at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for victims have been surprised by how poorly students
understand dating violence. They may not identify with the
traditional portrayal of abuser or victim.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Columbia Men Against Violence, a group with 15
active members, attracted about 200 people to the university's
``Take Back the Night'' march, which protested violence against
women.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Warshawer, 21, the group's treasurer, said the group
tried to fight ``pluralistic ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are good guys, but think they would be yelled at
or laughed at if they speak up,'' he said. ``People remain unaware
that they are in the majority of men who might want to work on
feminist issues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Justin Carver, 23 and a law student at St. Louis University,
remembers seeing a housemate of his at Illinois Wesleyan University
chasing an ex-girlfriend and grabbing her. It was enough for him to
pull his friend aside and tell him that such behavior was
inappropriate, unsafe and unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that as long as he felt he could engage in this
behavior, that I didn't feel I could associate with him,'' Carver
said. ``When he did come to realize he had a problem, I credited
him for this, he was willing to take some steps. He did end up
going to counseling.''

NFL'S NEW LINE IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was late in the regular season, and the Buffalo Bills wide
receiver Andre Reed, in one of many frustrating outbursts, said
something prophetic to a small group of reporters. His words may be
remembered for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never see players like Bruce, Thurman and me again,''
Reed said. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was referring to the great trio, who along with the
quarterback Jim Kelly, transformed the Bills into one of the top
franchises in football. Bruce Smith is going into the Hall of Fame
as one of the best defensive linemen of all time. Thurman Thomas
was one of the great offensive weapons ever, and some would argue
that Reed was the most crucial piece of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on what can only be called traumatic Thursday, the
Bills, because of salary-cap reasons, in one swift, brutal move,
cut Reed, Smith and Thomas, ending one of the most productive, and
sometimes emotional, player-team relationships in sports. The three
men were key reasons that the Bills made four Super Bowl
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all across the league, teams were making hard decisions
to get under the $62.172 million salary cap. Such stresses produced
the single most stunning day of player cuts ever. Pro Bowlers and
future Hall of Famers both found themselves in the unemployment
line. The Vikings released the 11-time Pro Bowl guard Randall
McDaniel. The Giants released center Brian Williams, who is
irritated that the team said he planned to retire. Williams plans
on playing for another team next season. Offensive tackle Bruce
Armstrong was let go by the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, quarterback Dan Marino voided the last two years of
his contract, and the Dolphins made perhaps the saddest cut of all.
Marino was miffed that when he recently talked to team officials,
few expressed interest in keeping him. Marino told friends that
when he met with the new coach, Dave Wannstedt, Wannstedt rarely
looked him in the eye. So Marino figured it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is strongly considering retiring, but wants to explore
his options, and will meet with Tampa Bay, Seattle and Oakland. If
Marino hears the right thing from any of those teams, such as he
can have a chance to earn his way into the starting lineup, he will
probably play again. If not, he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers denied any interest in Marino, but they have to
play coy, at least for now, because they do not want to get into a
bidding war for Marino's services. Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff,
met with at least one Tampa Bay official at the Pro Bowl, where the
team's coaching staff was leading the National Football Conference
squad, and the Bucs expressed slight interest.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo had its own emotional mess to deal with. What happened
to Smith, Reed and Thomas proves that an accomplished veteran NFL
player, because of a hardened salary cap, can no longer retire
gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is second on the career sack list to Reggie White. Reed
and Jerry Rice entered this season tied for first with 12 seasons
of 50 or more pass receptions. Thomas is seventh in combined yards
from scrimmage. Only Smith has one or two seasons left, mainly
because Smith takes good care of himself. Saturday, he signed a
five-year contract with the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The three men have had a love-hate affair with the city of
Buffalo, the Bills and the news media there. In some ways, Reed and
Thomas became bitter in the end. Especially Reed. In his last few
years, he often complained about his role in the offense, and this
season he lashed out at quarterback Doug Flutie, saying the success
Flutie was having swelled his ego. And he never forgave some
teammates who questioned his physical courage at the end of the
1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas scowled a lot and sometimes cursed at reporters, and
Smith was always thought of as selfish by the Buffalo beat writers,
though with the national media, Smith was always pleasant and
gracious.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing should take away from the accomplishments of Reed,
Smith and Thomas. Reed is right: the Bills may never see a group of
special players like them again.
</P>
<P>
   Franchise Tag Saves Money
</P>
<P>
   If you want to understand why players hate the franchise tag,
and teams love it, look no further than the Detroit Lions and the
sticky situation involving their star defensive lineman, Robert
Porcher.
</P>
<P>
   Porcher is considered one of the top three defensive linemen in
the game. He is blessed with great speed, power and a tremendous
work ethic. In the locker room, he is respected and a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the 4 p.m. Thursday deadline teams had to meet to
declare their franchise players, the Lions offered Porcher a
contract worth $35 million over 5 years, which included a $13
million signing bonus. Sounds like too much money for a lineman,
and the offer could indeed fuel the economy of a small country. But
consider that Porcher's 49 sacks in the past four years are the
most among defensive linemen. Because teams rarely get a player of
his caliber, they will do whatever it takes to keep someone like
Porcher, even if it means offering him the largest deal in Lions
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Largest contract. Largest average per year and largest signing
bonus,'' said the team's general manager, Chuck Schmidt. ``Largest
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Porcher countered with a $41.5 million, 5-year proposal that
included a $15 million signing bonus. Detroit respectfully
declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, fearing an agreement might never be reached, tagged
him as their franchise player, meaning he would receive the average
of the top five highest salaries at his position, which is $4.235
million. So Porcher will make his millions next season, and no one
should cry for him. But on the free-agent market, Porcher would
have made $7 million to $8 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   So the franchise tag may, in the end, cost Porcher up to $4
million. That is something to cry about. And no team is likely to
trade for Porcher because of the franchise tag, since to trade for
the player, a team would have to give the Lions two first-round
picks.
</P>
<P>
   Nine players were tagged with the franchise label by their
individual teams, and few players were happy about it. Among them
are the Miami offensive tackle Richmond Webb ($4.081 million
franchise number), Kansas City guard Will Shields ($4.081 million),
Jacksonville defensive end Tony Brackens ($4.253 million), San
Diego defensive tackle Norman Hand ($4.727 million), Washington
running back Stephen Davis ($3.532 million), and the Jets' Mo Lewis
($4.187 million). Lewis is believed to be extremely irritated by
the designation, since he may have been able to earn $7 million a
season as an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Several general managers said that they expected this to be the
thinnest free-agent field in years, mainly because so many of the
top potential free agents have been franchised.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one of the franchise players may find his
off-season to be interesting. Rumors persist that the Redskins are
considering trading Davis to Detroit for the rights to Barry
Sanders, who various team officials believe may soon announce his
return to football. The Redskins have denied any interest in
Sanders.

PRESSURE AT HOME COULD HURT NEW ZEALAND CREW

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The opportunity was just too tempting to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, on their respective ways home at the close of a
long day of training on opposite sides of the Hauraki Gulf, Team
New Zealand and Italy's Prada Challenge engaged in a brief,
inaugural, highly unofficial scrimmage in advance of their much
anticipated duel for the America's Cup. The five-of-nine-race
finals begin here next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the encounter took place between the syndicates'
second-team boats and crews, or that the sails under which they
jousted were tired and perhaps not optimally trimmed, or that
nothing of substance was learned or given away.
</P>
<P>
   The important point was that they lined up at all, a violation
of the cup protocol, which states that, in prematch mode, the
defender and challenger must give one another at least a
200-meter-wide berth. This is, in theory, a weighty rule to prevent
spying. In actuality, it's a buffer against that old cup malady
known as creeping paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   So one must not take too much from the fact that Dean Barker,
the young Kiwi backup helmsman, was able to nose away from the
Italians in the five-minute drag race. What will really matter is
how much the veteran New Zealand driver, Russell Coutts, is able to
discern about his opposing skipper, Francesco de Angelis, in the
first five minutes of next weekend's opening windward leg.
</P>
<P>
   Still, symbolically, the small tussle spoke volumes. Clearly and
unequivocally, these two crews are aching to mix it up.
</P>
<P>
   The America's Cup match, like any regatta, will be decided not
only by how well each crew sails, but by two critical items known
as speed and smarts. As every racing sailor knows, a surplus of the
former can make up for a deficit in the latter. So, as the date for
the first race draws near, here's a highly subjective breakdown of
how the two teams match up and what to expect on the water.
</P>
<P>
   BOAT SPEED
</P>
<P>
   Who's faster? The answer to that simple question will play a
major factor in determining whether the cup remains under the
auspices of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron or takes up new
residence at Yacht Club Punta Ala in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Prada is a rocket ship in 10-to-15 knot
breezes, the conditions it enjoyed in the last two clinching races
in the challenger's finals against Paul Cayard's America One.
Cayard now admits that Prada was the faster boat in those deciding
contests. ``That's their sweet spot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, knows for certain what the Kiwis have up their
sleeve in this all-important category. Only one challenger, Japan's
Nippon Challenge, decided to break ranks and unofficially race
against Team New Zealand. But Nippon skipper Peter Gilmour said
last week that he came away very confident of his ability to tangle
with the New Zealanders and, by extension, felt that Prada owned
the faster vessel. Of course, Team New Zealand may well have
reworked its boat in the intervening weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom says the Kiwis should hold the edge in
fresher winds, the Italians in the light stuff. It's high summer in
New Zealand, and if the winds will ever be consistently moderate,
now's the time.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Prada.
</P>
<P>
   CREW WORK
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, as yacht racing's Grand Prix ranks turned
more open and professional, the Kiwis proved that, nation for
nation, they produce the world's top competitive sailors. The cream
of that crop has formed the nucleus of Team New Zealand since 1992,
not to mention countless Whitbread crews and other international
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   And they are led by Coutts, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist who was
at the helm of New Zealand's cup winner in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian afterguard of de Angelis and the tactician, Torben
Grael, though prodigiously talented, had no match-racing experience
before joining Prada just over two years ago. But while the Kiwis
have been competing against in-house competition over the last four
months, Prada has been battle-hardened by a grueling series of
elimination trials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the New Zealanders have been racing on the tricky, fluky
Hauraki Gulf all their lives, and their figurative home-court
advantage, coupled with their vast experience, is formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   INTANGIBLES
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the Kiwi team is huge. Tiny New Zealand has
invested millions of dollars, as well as hearts and souls, on its
hometown boys, and in return the populace expects nothing less than
a successful first defense.
</P>
<P>
   If Team New Zealand loses a quick race or two, the heat will
intensify. When the New Zealand rugby team, the beloved All Blacks,
lost to France in the last World Cup, the news media outcry was
swift and merciless. Should matters turn bleak, expect history to
repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Prada's yacht designer, Doug Peterson, has
produced the last two cup-winning boats and still appears to be on
top of his game. Furthermore, after their victorious performance in
the trials, the Italians are loose and confident.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: Prada.
</P>
<P>
   PREDICTION
</P>
<P>
   In its 149-year history, the America's Cup has never been
successfully defended by any country outside of the United States.
That string will remain unbroken. In a tight, emotional series that
will go eight or nine races, Prada will win the America's Cup.

CALL BY GRIFFEY'S AGENT HAD PROPITIOUS TIMING

<P>
   ``Hypothetically,'' said Sandy Alderson, who doesn't like to
deal in hypotheticals, ``it's conceivable that under some
circumstances a trade could be nullified as a result of prior
conduct of the parties.'' But, the commissioner's executive vice
president for baseball operations said, the trade for Ken Griffey
Jr. does not appear to fit those hypothetical circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my understanding of the facts in this case,''
Alderson said, ``I don't think that would be the result.'' He
declined to say what the facts are, but it is indisputably known
that the Seattle Mariners gave Griffey's agent permission to talk
to the Cincinnati Reds when they didn't have the right to grant
that permission. It also has become known that the Mariners took
the step they weren't supposed to take at a most propitious time.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck Armstrong, the Mariners' president, was telling Brian
Goldberg last Tuesday that he was free to find out first-hand from
the team in Griffey's hometown the chances of something happening,
Reds officials were contemplating how they should tell the world
that a tradQKT)r Griffey wasn't going to happen and furthermore
that the Reds needed to get on with their business; so would
everyone quit focusing on a player who wasn't theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed our business to go back to normal and to let our
players know there's no deal, you can come to spring training
now,'' Rob Butcher, the team's media relations director, said. ``It
was getting to the point where the Griffey thing was slowing down
our entire business operation. Every other phone call we were
getting dealt with a player who wasn't even on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was aware of what the Reds might do. ``He mentioned
the Reds were probably about two hours away from issuing a
statement saying they pulled out of trying to make a trade for
Junior,'' Goldberg related. ``He gave me permission to call the
Reds to see if there was anything I could say or they could say so
that Junior would know it was a dead issue. I wanted Kenny to be
convinced that there wouldn't be a trade with Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg called John Allen, the Reds' chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't call to negotiate,'' the agent said. ``No money terms
of a contract were discussed. No players were talked about. It was
more like, are you guys going to issue a statement and, before you
do, is there anything we can do? I just wanted to find out if they
were really interested because that was the only place Junior would
like to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``John said our approach all along has been if a trade could be
made that didn't break the farm system or the current roster, we'd
love to have Kenny here long term as long as he understood the
parameters of how we could work it. If we could work out the
players and if you guys are reasonable, we'd like to do a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   What was reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `John, I'm not going to discuss any specific dollars
or terms,''' Goldberg related. ```You tell me what you're looking
for, I'll tell you about Junior's long-term goals.' He said, `We
don't want him for a year; we want him to finish his career in
Cincinnati.' I said I think that's what he wants; maybe he'll
accept less money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds issued no statement that day. Instead, Allen called
Armstrong, and suddenly the names flowed through the phone line
more easily. By 9 p.m. Wednesday, the teams had agreed on players.
Armstrong called Goldberg and told him that he and the Reds had 72
hours ``to try to work out something on a long-term contract
because it was the Reds' desire to trade for Junior only if they
could do a long-term contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and Allen met twice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out saying, let's try to get it done quickly; Kenny
doesn't have to be the highest-paid player,'' Goldberg recounted.
The Reds made an offer; Goldberg countered it. The Reds came up in
their offer; Goldberg lowered his proposal. They had a deal, a deal
that would stun baseball officials, executives of other clubs,
other players and agents.
</P>
<P>
   The raw number itself, $116.5 million for nine years, was low
enough considering the escalation of contracts for the best players
in the game and the Mariners' offer of $138 million for eight years
last year. But with $57.5 million deferred without interest, the
present-day value is reduced to about 75 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to mislead people that this is some charity
case,'' Goldberg said. ``The Reds are paying Kenny an awful lot of
money over the next nine years. But he did his part to show that
money wasn't the most important thing.''  &QL;

PITCHING IS AT A PREMIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBO-GRIFFEY-DEAL)

<P>
   Two years earlier, the Boston Red Sox traded for Pedro Martinez,
who had compiled the National League's lowest earned run average
and won the Cy Young Award. A year ago, the New York Yankees
obtained Roger Clemens, who had won the American League's Triple
Crown of pitching and an unprecedented fifth Cy Young Award. This
winter the New York Mets acquired Mike Hampton whose 22 victories
were the most in the National League. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hampton didn't win the National League Cy Young Award; Randy
Johnson did. But Hampton was by far the best pitcher who changed
teams in the off-season, and the Mets look forward to having him
win for them as he did for the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton and a large assortment of other movable pitchers will be
on display in their new teams' uniforms this week. Yes, it's time
for spring training and it's time for teams to begin finding out
just how well they fared in bringing in new pitchers to fortify
their starting rotations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitching has become the scarcest commodity in the game so teams
scramble for the available pitchers every winter. Some teams get
Pedro Martinez; some get Pat Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1989 season, the Yankees took their annual plunge in
the free-agent market and snatched two players they thought were
among the best pitchers available that winter. Dallas Green, the
Yankees' manager, proclaimed Andy Hawkins as the anchor of the
pitching staff. His fellow free agent was Dave LaPoint. For their
careers, the pair was a combined three games over .500. That first
season for the Yankees Hawkins earned a 15-15 record, LaPoint a 6-9
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets look for Hampton to be their anchor, though with
considerably better results. Although last season was his first
great season, Hampton, at 27 years old, could join a shrinking
group of pitchers considered to be No. 1s. Martinez and Johnson
head that group, solidifying their membership each season.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was not the only pitching move the Mets made in their
attempt to catch the Atlanta Braves in their division and for the
NL pennant. They let Kenny Rogers and Orel Hershiser leave as free
agents and traded away Masato Yoshii, both to alleviate their
payroll where they felt they could and to open a spot for a younger
pitcher. They traded a good young pitcher, Octavio Dotel, but he
went in exchange for Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   For Yoshii, the Mets acquired Bobby Jones, a left-hander who is
said to have a good arm and comes with reports that suggest he can
be better than he performed with Colorado. The Mets also added a
platoon of left-handed relievers, another element of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Mets, the Texas Rangers have made changes in their
rotation, bringing back two pitchers who used to work for them and
adding a young pitcher with a recovering arm. One of those pitchers
has to replace Aaron Sele, who earned 37 victories the past two
seasons, then rejected a four-year, $28 million offer to stay
around.
</P>
<P>
   The change is in more than names. All three newcomers, Rogers,
Darren Oliver and Justin Thompson, are left-handers, a departure
for a team that had only four starts by left-handers last season.
How many starts Thompson makes will depend on his surgically
repaired shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals also orchestrated wholesale changes in
their starting rotation. With injuries having decimated their
rotation last season, the Cardinals signed Andy Benes as a free
agent and obtained Pat Hentgen and Darryl Kile in trades.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Duncan, the celebrated pitching coach, has the assignment
of restoring Hentgen and Kile to their former levels of
performance. Hentgen won the AL Cy Young Award in 1996 when he was
a 20-game winner for Toronto; last season he struggled to an 11-12
record. Kile was a 19-game winner with Houston in 1997, then
suffered two excruciatingly poor seasons in Colorado, winning 21
games and losing 30.
</P>
<P>
   If not much else, Hentgen and Kile should give the Cardinals a
lot of innings, which will help preserve the relief corps and make
that element of the staff stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis rotation is expected to feature another face that
is relatively new. A 20-year-old left-hander, Rick Ankiel started
five games for the Cardinals last season. Now they are prepared to
put him in the rotation from the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado added three starters, trading for Rolando Arrojo, Scott
Karl and Yoshii. Tampa Bay brought in a pair, Juan Guzman and Steve
Trachsel, an 18-game loser last season.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby has moved to Philadelphia, Sele to Seattle, Hershiser
back to Los Angeles, Ismael Valdes to the Chicago Cubs, Jamey
Wright to Milwaukee, Hideo Nomo to Detroit and Hideki Irabu to
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley, who has squandered his prime years in Anaheim, has
taken his 37-year-old left arm to Cleveland, a town that has
desperately sought a No. 1 starter for several seasons. The
question the Indians quietly worry about: Does he have enough left
to be a No. 1?

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning that continuing cuts at the Internal Revenue Service
threaten the nation's tax system, the Clinton administration is
proposing more money to find cheaters and make them pay up. And the
agency's top official has begun emphasizing that catching cheaters
is as important as helping honest taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is seeking a 9 percent increase in the
agency's budget, the largest increase, adjusted for inflation, in
13 years. That would allow the IRS, whose auditing staff is down
one-fourth since 1995, to raise the number of auditors for the
first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress who have criticized the IRS said they
were open to the idea that more money might be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the request for an increased budget is taken up by
Congress, IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti is moving to ensure
that the agency does a better job of collecting taxes owed by
companies and individuals, he said in an interview last week. For
example, he has summoned all 665 managers in the collections
department to a three-day meeting in Chicago next month to insist
that they act when taxpayers do not pay.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such meeting of collection managers in the
agency's history, said Jody Patterson, an IRS spokeswoman. At the
meeting, Rossotti will drive home the message that collection
managers cannot allow delinquent taxpayers, especially those who
flout the law, to get away without paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stanch the decline in collection activity,''
Rossotti said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton's budget request is approved, part of it would pay
for 633 more auditors, a 5 percent increase. They would hunt for
cheating by people with incomes over $100,000, especially business
owners, professionals and investors in partnerships. In the last
three years, audit rates among such taxpayers have fallen by
two-thirds, to about one in 131 returns.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said it would also focus on illegitimate business tax
shelters that make profits invisible to the IRS. These shelters are
growing so fast, IRS officials say, that despite soaring profits
the taxes paid by large companies have actually begun to decline.
These officials say that less than 70 cents of each dollar of
profit reported to shareholders in 1998 was reported by companies
as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also wants to hire more people to answer
telephone calls to the agency, allowing about 300 auditors detailed
to this kind of customer service work to resume examining
questionable returns.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that ``we need to begin
increasing capacity'' to enforce the tax laws ``to maintain
people's confidence that this is a tax system that works.''
</P>
<P>
   He said enforcement must go hand in hand with improving service
to cooperative taxpayers. ``Better customer service and greater
collection volumes go together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the president have kept such a tight rein on
spending that the IRS has hired only 20 new auditors even as more
than 2,000 have quit or retired since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that this year fewer than one in 300 personal
returns is expected to be audited, down from one in 63 two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in enforcement has become so significant that
Rossotti now warns that it threatens to ``undermine our entire
system of voluntary tax compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti and others worry that understaffing and a growing
timidity by front-line auditors and tax collectors have allowed
more Americans and businesses to get away with not paying what they
owe.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also has fallen down at the job of collecting from those
who fail to turn over taxes due, mostly small businesses and the
self-employed. Since hitting a record $38 billion in 1996, taxes
collected through enforcement actions like audits and levies on
bank accounts have fallen by 13 percent, or $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS came under fire in Congress two years ago, in hearings
at which taxpayers said they had been bullied and harassed.
Congress answered with, and Clinton signed, legislation intended to
give taxpayers more protection against overzealous tax agents.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was passed, Rossotti, a wealthy businessman
brought in to fix the agency, made improving service to customers _
as he calls taxpayers _ his theme.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the mission statement _ ``to collect the proper
amount of tax due'' _ was replaced by ``provide America's taxpayers
top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and
fairness for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But recently Rossotti has begun to emphasize the catching of
cheaters as much as helping taxpayers. Earlier this month, for
example, he told the Senate Finance Committee, ``Customer
satisfaction is not achieved by failing to collect taxes that are
properly due.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has spoken out about the agency's weaknesses in enforcing
the law.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about shrinking resources, for one thing. This year,
full-time IRS payroll has fallen nearly 16,000, to 81,834
employees, a 16 percent decline since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the last five years the number of income tax returns has
grown 11 percent and the number of complex returns filed by people
making $1 million or more is doubling every three years. About
250,000 households will report an income of $1 million or more for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   And this at a time when the agency has had to comply with more
than 1,200 changes imposed by Congress that essentially make its
job more demanding. Some of those changes make it easier for
taxpayers to get answers from the IRS, such as having people
available around the clock to answer telephone inquiries. Others
require the agency to take many more steps in the audit and
collection process to make sure that taxpayers are not abused.
</P>
<P>
   The equivalent of 3,000 more workers have been assigned to
comply with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the shrinking size of the work force has been its
attitude toward pursuing tax cheats. Many IRS employees are now
operating extremely cautiously for fear that under the new rules
they can be fired for the way they once did their jobs. In
interviews with The New York Times in the last year, collection
officers across the country, all of whom insisted on anonymity,
said that even in cases where they had followed the rules
faithfully their managers were unwilling to approve seizures and
levies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem,'' Rossotti said, ``is that there is a lot of
confusion, and sometimes managers are backing off to the point
where they are not managing.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, tax revenues have been soaring in recent years as the
economy has boomed and profits have jumped. But IRS officials say
many forms of cheating have proliferated and tax revenues should be
even higher. Their concern is that if people think they can cheat
without being caught, many more people will do it and honest
taxpayers will sour on the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our entire tax system depends on the vast majority of
taxpayers who attempt to pay their taxes that are due having
confidence that they are being treated fairly and that their
competitors and neighbors are also paying what is due,'' Rossotti
told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month. ``If the
public concludes over a period of time that the IRS cannot meet
these basic expectations, the risk to the tax system will become
very high and the effects very difficult and extraordinarily
expensive to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his new budget proposal earlier this month, has
asked for $8.84 billion for the IRS in 2001, up 9 percent from the
$8.11 billion Congress approved for this year. The $729 million
increase includes $174 million this year and next to hire 1,633
more people, including 633 more auditors and 33 more tax
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money would allow the IRS to replace about one-sixth
of the auditors, collectors and related personnel it has lost since
Clinton took office. It would also allow the hiring of more people
to answer telephone inquiries from taxpayers, a job that diverted 3
percent of auditors and collectors from their primary work last
year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Republicans who control the House
Appropriations Committee said that adding a total of 2,800
full-time employees, as proposed in the budget, is a rather large
request, one that will be discussed in hearings next month.
Republicans have long held a suspicious view of the IRS and have
criticized the agency for what they call its plodding pace and its
emphasis on catching tax cheats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to look very closely at this request,''
said Elizabeth Mora, the spokeswoman, adding that Congress has had
a different set of priorities for the IRS in the past. ``We have
been concerned and remain concerned about modernization. We are
also very concerned about a balance between law enforcement and
customer service. We need to make sure there is a correct balance
between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Two architects of the recent laws overhauling the IRS said they
were open to the idea that more money may be needed for
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House Ways and Means
Committee, said he ``will do what's necessary so the IRS can serve
the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who chairs the Senate Finance
Committee, said, ``It's important that the IRS have sufficient
funding to ensure successful execution of the current
reorganization plan in order to make tax collection more efficient,
and provide better service to taxpayers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IRS has also backed away from an interpretation of the new
tax act that required collectors to demand full payment of taxes
past due _ or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under that new approach, tax delinquents who did not pay in full
were having their cases put aside. Tax experts said that many
people who owed money would bet that the statute of limitations
would expire before the IRS pursued them, and that therefore people
who could have paid something would no longer do so.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy directs agents to collect as much as possible
from such taxpayers, just as was done previously.

   ATLANTA _ Lawyers representing the All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis
on Saturday detailed the step-by-step movements of the football
star from the time he left a post-Super Bowl party at an Atlanta
nightclub and minutes later became entangled in a street brawl that
left two local men stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kaleidoscope of confusion,'' said Ed Garland, the
lead criminal lawyer defending Lewis, 24, who was indicted Friday
by a grand jury on two counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all took place within a minute or so, and there were a
bunch of people moving, running and struggling in a dimly lighted
spot, with maybe 100 witnesses seeing different parts of what was
going on,'' Garland said of the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   It began sometime before 4 a.m. on Jan. 31, Garland said, when
Lewis, dressed in a full-length black mink coat and black cowboy
hat, and 10 male and female acquaintances, left the Cobalt Lounge
in the fashionable Buckhead section of Atlanta and walked a block
and a half to his 35-foot-long leased limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were guys on the street who start `jawboning' _
harassing them _ and one of the men with Lewis breaks back and
starts a loud argument with them,'' Garland continued. The lawyer
identified this man as Reginald Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting, 35, of Miami were
also indicted by the grand jury on murder charges. Both men are
being sought by the FBI and police agencies in Maryland and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Garland provided this description of what happened next based on
information provided by Lewis and other witnesses:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray goes back and snatches Oakley up and drags him back to the
limo. At that point, Ray and all the men and women in his party get
into the limo except Sweeting. About four or five guys, and one
short guy with the biggest mouth, come up to the door of the limo,
yelling and taunting. All the while, people leaving the clubs are
passing by on the sidewalk or across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Oakley jumped out of the vehicle and was hit on the
head with a Champagne bottle by one of the men on the sidewalk.
``Then everybody piled out of the limo, including the driver,''
Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis pushed his date, a woman identified only as ``J,'' back
into the limousine as two groups of brawlers fought on the sidewalk
and the street, Garland recounted. ``It's clear others from the
limo engaged in a fight with some people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Ray Lewis acted only as a peacekeeper, trying to
pull people away. The great danger in our case is because of the
confusing scenery. It is dark, and who can be sure who you're
seeing?
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't attribute criminal liability to him, much less
murder, because there was a sudden, spontaneous event and he's
there trying to break it up.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fighters separated, Garland said, everyone got back
into the limousine and it pulled away with all the original
passengers. Then, the lawyer continued, someone on the sidewalk
fired five .45-caliber slugs into the back of the departing vehicle
``and everyone inside hit the floor in a jumble.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the back tires was flattened by a slug, and the limo
stopped at a hotel more than a mile away. Lewis and his date took a
cab from the hotel to his suite at the Georgian Terrace Hotel,
close to downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Lewis was unaware of the stabbing deaths of Richard
Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of suburban Decatur, and
learned of them only later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, Lewis, this time accompanied by his pregnant
fiancee, Tatayna McCall, who had been staying with the couple's two
children at the Atlanta home of her aunt, left for the Atlanta
airport to catch a plane for Hawaii, where Lewis was scheduled to
play in the Pro Bowl representing the Baltimore Ravens the
following Sunday, Garland said. He said they missed the plane,
however, and went to her aunt's house, where he soon was notified
that the Atlanta police wanted to question him about the Buckhead
killings.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning by a homicide detective _ a session in which
the authorities described Lewis as uncooperative and misleading the
police on the identities of those who had been with him in the
limousine _ Lewis was arrested later that night.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has been held in isolation at the Atlanta jail. A
bond hearing will be held Monday, and his lawyers will argue that
he should be allowed to post bail because he is not a significant
risk to flee the court's jurisdiction and does not pose a risk to
the community. His lawyers plan to present several witnesses and
letters at the hearing testifying to Lewis' good character and
charitable works. Among the letter writers is Warren Sapp, All-Pro
defensive lineman for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Lewis' former
teammate at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities charged that Lewis was a combatant in the melee,
saying he ``punched, encouraged and assisted others in the
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the investigation have indicated that Duane
Fassett, the 51-year-old limousine driver who took Lewis to Atlanta
from Baltimore several days before the Super Bowl, and who
chauffeured him on the night of the killings, told investigators he
saw Lewis punch someone.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, however, said his staff of four full-time investigators
learned that the driver would corroborate the defense's claim that
Lewis became involved only to break the fight up.

NEW BUILDINGS RISE AROUND NEW YORK'S GRAND CENTRAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1994, when it still had eight years remaining on
its lease at 245 Park Ave., smack in the middle of the tony Grand
Central area between 46th and 47th streets, the investment banking
firm of Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. began looking for a new home, and soon
its name was linked to sites from Times Square to the financial
district.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is well along on its planned 45-story headquarters,
sections of its steel structure already thrusting above much of
Manhattan's East Side skyline. Once the new site, the entire block
bounded by 46th and 47th streets and Madison and Vanderbilt
avenues, became available, said James E. Cayne, the chief executive
of Bear Stearns, ``it was our first choice, our second choice, our
third and our fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   While the renaissance of Times Square has been more dramatic,
largely because of the depths to which the area had plummeted in
the 1970s and '80s, the area around Grand Central Terminal is
undergoing a significant transformation of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Bear Stearns skyscraper, another new office
building is rising in the district and several others are in
various stages of planning. Construction has also begun on a
54-story residential tower, while two boutique hotels are scheduled
to open in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-foot walkways under the Helmsley Building at 230 Park
Ave. leading to Grand Central Terminal are to undergo extensive
renovation later this year, while the 34-story building itself _
bought by Max Capital Management last year for $225 million _
undergoes extensive refurbishing. And any number of buildings have
recently completed multimillion-dollar makeovers or modernizations,
or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square has been the focus of development,'' said Tara I.
Stacom, executive director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the real-estate
services group, ``but in a few years Grand Central will be the main
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the flurry of face-lifts and upgrades is
economic, to command higher rents, or, at the very least, to
dissuade tenants from bailing out when their leases expire. But
there is also the matter of pride _ of many landlords wanting to
keep up with the neighboring Joneses, who in turn were inspired to
dress up their properties because of the example set by the
acclaimed makeover of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   That makeover not only improved the experience for the
half-million commuters who pass through it on an average day, but
``it amounted to a vote of confidence in the area's potential,''
said Robert L. Billingsley, vice president of Colliers ABR, the
leasing agent for many properties in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Even the success of Times Square, which until recently had been
a model only of urban decay, served as an example for what's going
on in Grand Central. ``The ripple effect of Times Square
development and energy can be felt all the way to Third Avenue,''
said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, the real estate
services group.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Bear Stearns building was intended to
accommodate the business of the firm, not to attract tenants
(although it will have retail tenants along Madison Avenue, as
required by zoning regulations), its raison d'etre from the
beginning was decidedly pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had your druthers and could afford it, this is what you
would do,'' Cayne said. ``It was the only major site available on
the East Side of Manhattan, and its location and design convey
convenience, stature and commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Between December 2001 and the expiration of its current lease in
2002, Bear Stearns plans to move most of its 4,500 employees in New
York into the new site, which is owned by CS First Boston and the
al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Until it was leveled to build the Bear Stearns building, the
12-story Knapp Building stood on the site, at 383 Madison Ave.,
although it remained unoccupied for a dozen years. At one time it
was the headquarters of the Manhattan Savings Bank and the Webb &AMP;
Knapp real estate domain of William Zeckendorf Sr., whose circular
penthouse office was designed by I.M. Pei.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns signed a 99-year lease for the land beneath its new
building in 1996. But some employees will remain at its current
headquarters, 245 Park Ave. at 46th Street, where its lease on the
almost 600,000 square feet of space it has been occupying includes
options for the 25 years beyond its 2002 expiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the space we will have for internal growth,'' Cayne
said, referring to 245 Park Ave., ``so we will end up using all or
most of the space available to us under the agreement with
Brookfield.'' Brookfield Properties Corp. owns the building.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cayne and Samuel L. Molinaro, the firm's chief financial
officer, said that a major factor in their decision had been the
restoration of Grand Central Terminal, which they said greatly
enhanced the aesthetics and quality of life throughout the broader
Grand Central area.
</P>
<P>
   They were equally lavish in their praise both of the
administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and of Metro North, whose
train tracks run beneath the new Bear Stearns building, as well as
beneath those of most buildings between Lexington and Madison
avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was only one of the problems we confronted,'' said David
M. Childs, a senior partner at Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, the
architectural firm that designed the Bear Stearns building.
</P>
<P>
   Other challenges included the design, which calls for the base
of the building to rise nine floors (seven of them trading floors
with 2,000 trading positions) before two setbacks between the 10th
and 17th floors. From there the building becomes an octagon until
it reaches the crown, 777 feet above ground, where it is sheathed
in a patterned, rolled, laminated glass _ or, in the architects'
phrase, ``crinkled glass.''
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Gottesdiener, the architectural firm's managing partner on
the project, added that the building would be unusual in New York
because ``it's a square full-block site, and there are so few of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we took advantage of this geometry,'' he said, ``by
designing a skyscraper that starts square at the base and
culminates in a crystal octagon in the skyline.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within the Bear Stearns building will be a pedestrian arcade _ a
block-long passageway that will connect with Grand Central Terminal
through a new north end passageway that can be accessed at either
Madison Avenue at 47th or Vanderbilt Avenue between 46th and 47th
streets.
</P>
<P>
   All this costs a great deal of money, of course _ almost $280
million for construction alone. But Cayne, a world-class bridge
player and a self-described ``pretty good'' poker player, does not
regard that investment as a risk. ``It's the closest thing to a
sure thing I've ever seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How so? ``Because opportunities like this don't come along
often,'' he said. ``You couldn't duplicate it because New York real
estate has since gone through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Axel Stawski had the foresight to buy his properties almost
20 years ago at 360 Madison Ave. and just around the corner at 17
East 45th St. Now his Kipp-Stawski company is knocking down the
building on 45th Street and keeping only the steel frame, columns,
beams and slabs of the Madison Avenue building and combining the
new and the old structures into a single 24-story office building
at the 360 Madison address _ a mere chip shot from the new Bear
Stearns tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Central has always been special,'' Stawski said, ``and
it's extra-special since the terminal was restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of heavy-duty restoration is taking place in and around the
terminal, the very heart of Grand Central. The 200-foot-long
Helmsley arcades, which connect Grand Central Terminal with Park
Avenue through the Helmsley Building at 230 Park Ave., will be shut
down one at a time for 18 months starting later this year while
they are spruced up.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover will include 30-foot-high ceilings (double the
existing height), a 15-foot by 40-foot center skylight that will
fill the passage with natural light, new double-height retail
spaces facing 14-foot-high video screens along the walls, a glass
floor beneath the center skylight revealing trains below street
level _ and, not least, direct access to Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Helmsley Building itself _ originally the New
York Central Building, but whose most recent name will remain on
the facade of the building, as part of the sales contract, under
the new ownership _ will be extensively gussied up.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Hochfelder, the president of Max Capital, said that the
limestone and granite of its four-story base would be restored, its
glazed terra cotta roadway tiles would be cleaned, and that he is
considering restoring the building's copper mansard roof and its
gilded golden cupola (which previously had been restored in July
1998).
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby the installation of the original brass fixtures,
marble trim, travertine walls and floors is nearly completed, while
the public corridors are being redone with custom screened wall
coverings and Persian carpets.
</P>
<P>
   By late summer people who visit the 24-story building at 350
Madison Ave. _ formerly the Conde Nast Building, until that
publishing company moved into its skyscraper in Times Square _ will
have an unusual urban experience awaiting them. As they enter the
building they will cross a glass bridge that can be illuminated
from underneath, and once inside they they will find themselves in
a 22-foot-wide lobby that is also made of glass, thus affording a
rare unobstructed view of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``By breathing new life into these older buildings in Manhattan,
where there's almost no space to put up new buildings, you preserve
the archaeology of New York,'' said Roger Duffy, a design partner
at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the architectural firm that
designed the bridge and glass lobby. Duffy also designed the
Helmsley Building arcades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two new buildings now under way on opposite
sides of Madison Avenue, several other new office buildings are in
advanced planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Speyer Properties, part owner of Rockefeller Center and
the Chrysler Building, is planning to build a 365,000-square-foot
speculative office building at 222 East 41st St., near Third
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   And at the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue
Mitchell B. Rutter, the president of Essex Capital Partners,
intends to put up a 30-story office building that will include
retail stores on the street level. That building is also expected
to be put up as a speculative building.
</P>
<P>
   Brookfield Properties has announced plans to buy a site at the
equally conspicuous corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue to
build a million-square-foot building, which is likely to be
occupied by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's
biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the activity in and around Grand Central involves office
buildings. The office vacancy rate in the area _ 38th to 47th
streets, Fifth Avenue to the East River, was 7.1 percent last
month, according to Barbara Byrne of Colliers ABR, compared with
6.7 percent in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But a sprinkling of residential properties are also under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of these is RFR Davis' 54-story limestone and brick
residential tower at 425 Fifth Ave., at 38th Street, on which
construction started three months ago. Eighteen floors are intended
for extended-stay residents, while the remainder will house
apartments. The building, designed by Robert A.M. Stern and H.
Thomas O'Hara Architects, will also have space for commercial
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   At 52 East 41st St., between Madison and Park avenues, in the
former Chemists Club building, the 108-room Dylan hotel and the
separately owned Restaurant R are scheduled to open in April. The
Dylan's owner, Morris Moinian, said that more than $1 million of
the overall $30 million renovation is devoted to architectural
details, including a marble staircase that spirals up three floors.
(The architect is Jeffrey Beers of Manhattan.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 41st
Street, a former 12-story office building is expected to open at
the end of April as the refurbished 16-story, 60-room Library
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the husband-and-wife design team of Stephen B. Jacobs and
Andi Pepper, each floor will be keyed to the Dewey decimal system
used to catalog books. Not only will floors will be named after
various subject headings (Social Sciences, Economics, etc.) but
rooms on each floor will contain books on the appropriate topic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Library Hotel's developer, Henry Kallan, said he was
undertaking the $10 million restoration largely because Grand
Central is about to become a mecca for tourists as well as visitors
on business. ``The whole area,'' he said, ``from Grand Central
Terminal to Bryant Park'' _ at 42nd Street and Avenue of the
Americas, behind the New York Public Library _ ``is already dynamic
and will become more so.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find an important building in the area that is not
being upgraded, or has not been upgraded recently. The $100 million
refurbishment continues on the Chrysler Center, the name recently
bestowed on the 76-story Chrysler Building at 405 Lexington and the
32-story East Building (formerly the Kent Building) at 666 Third
Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The work on the landmark Chrysler Building, which is nearing
completion, includes refurbishing the entire facade as well as the
signature stainless steel and nickel top. It also includes
modernizing the system that controls and operates the 20 elevators
and employing artisans to renovate the landmark elevator cabs. The
building will have new heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems, and a new generator will provide emergency backup for both
Chrysler Center buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, work on the East Building is expected to last at least
a couple more months, according to Valerie Peltier, senior director
of Tishman Speyer Properties. That ranges from changing its
white-brick exterior to aluminum and glass, enlarging the lobby,
modernizing offices, improving the heating and ventilating systems,
replacing the elevator cabs and much more. By adding space on each
floor, the East Building will have an additional 150,000 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two small buildings and three floors of a
five-story in the middle of the Chrysler Center have been torn down
and will soon be replaced by three glass trylons (one 75 feet high)
designed by Philip Johnson that will house a restaurant accessible
from 42nd Street. (The East Building's main entrance will remain at
666 Third Ave.)
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of two years S.L. Green Realty, which has
extensive holdings in the Grand Central area as well as elsewhere,
has been busy rewiring and otherwise upgrading all its buildings,
most of them Class B.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to our tenants to have speedy access to the
Internet,'' said Jerry Nocera, Green's executive vice president of
leasing, ``so we're putting in fiber-optics that will take us into
the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Green is carrying out an extensive renovation of
the Graybar Building attached to Grand Central Terminal. This
includes a new bronze and glass entrance, a renovated lobby, a
steam-cleaned facade, and new floors, ceilings and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   At the landmark former Bowery Savings Bank at 110 East 42nd St.,
where the Cipriani family leased the ground floor and basement for
its catering service _ and where the taped voice of Enrico Caruso
resonates from the marble mosaic floor as well as the 65-foot-high
ceiling _ S.L. Green was able to redo the lobby and install new
elevator cabs without running afoul of the landmark preservation
strictures.
</P>
<P>
   The former bank has been host to bar mitzvahs reunions, weddings
and similar happy occasions _ and according to Charles Kasper, the
doorman at the property, ``we've even had some divorce parties.'
</P>
<P>
   A block west, the Lincoln Building, owned by East 60 East 42nd
St. Associates, of which Peter Malkin is the general partner, is in
the midst of a $28 million refurbishment. The original ceiling has
already been restored by a New York firm that specializes in
historic restorations. A new concierge desk was added recently, and
a new corridor, new windows, a new conference center, new public
bathrooms on each floor and a covered lobby entranceway are either
already completed or will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lest art and history buffs rise up in arms, they can rest
assured that Daniel Chester French's sculpture of the ``Seated
Lincoln,'' the model used for the creation of the Lincoln Memorial
in Washington, still reposes in the building's lobby.

O'NEAL HAS HIS HEALTH AND A HEALTHY ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ He occupied the farthest corner of the hotel
ballroom, away from the madness encompassing Kevin Garnett and
Vince Carter. You can't keep a low profile at 7 feet 1 inch and 320
pounds. But Shaquille O'Neal tried on Friday afternoon, attracting
less attention from the news media than some of his more acrobatic
peers did.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised about not being asked to participate
in Sunday's dunk contest, he laughed and said, ``They didn't want
me to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it is the same old Shaq. Cornball humor. Life of
the party. A man who is said to be renting an entire hotel this
weekend for a grand total of $700,000. But beyond O'Neal's
extravagances and carefree attitude off the floor, he is a
different kind of player this season.
</P>
<P>
   He moves his feet better on defense, helping out and playing
with passion on both ends. And he keeps extending the range on that
pretty little jump hook, enough so that you wonder why he just
doesn't start shooting his free throws that way.
</P>
<P>
   He is averaging more than three blocked shots a game, double his
output last season. In 12 games this season, he has scored more
than 30 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. Second in scoring, first in
field-goal percentage, he is playing on a Lakers team that has
dabbled with the league's best record.
</P>
<P>
   If this keeps up and he overcomes his team's recent string of
being swept out of the playoffs, a most valuable player award may
be in the offing. Only Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Grant Hill,
Alonzo Mourning or Jason Kidd can compete.
</P>
<P>
   You can credit Coach Phil Jackson, O'Neal's injury-free status
or the lack of many bona fide centers to contain such an awesome
force. But maybe that little, fragile Shaq action figure is growing
up into a bona fide superhero, the self-proclaimed Man of Steel he
always wanted to be. Maybe O'Neal is less sensitive about criticism
and more secure about his game and his goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're reaching a little bit,'' he said, laughing.
``You just make that stuff up or they tell you to write that?
Honestly, I'm healthy. That is a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of playing for Jackson, he added: ``Obviously, he's a great
coach. He never gives me any room to slack off. He expects a lot
out of me; I expect a lot out of myself. We don't have a problem
and I'm sure we'll never have a problem. I don't have a problem
with respecting authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's the general and I know I'm the lieutenant.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jackson ever signed on with the Lakers, O'Neal had enough
motivation to kill perception about his lack of commitment. Swept
out of the playoffs in consecutive seasons by the more-disciplined
Utah Jazz and San Antonio Spurs, a fringe candidate in the MVP
balloting and relegated to second-team All-NBA, O'Neal has been
force-fed the idea that Duncan and Garnett were the only ones
genuinely dueling for the league's top player award.
</P>
<P>
   They have been proclaimed more complete franchise players and
much more capable of leading than O'Neal, the Lakers' center.
</P>
<P>
   Knee injuries robbed him of 31 games in 1996-97, his first
season with the Lakers. A strained abdominal muscle, small but
intensely painful, knocked him out of another 22 games in the
1997-98 season. He missed just one game last year in the
lockout-shortened season, but that abdominal strain never healed
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because I'm injury-free,'' O'Neal said recently.
``Injury-free is big. When I pulled my stomach muscle, I couldn't
reach to block shots. I could only muster up enough energy to do
what I was asked to do on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past O'Neal wasn't committed to protecting the paint and
providing a safety net for teammates. He wasn't rebounding
aggressively enough. He often forced shots way out of his range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's no stopping him,'' his teammate Rick Fox said.
``None whatsoever. The Diesel is just too big, strong and
skilled.''

RUDD MAKING A NEW START AS A DRIVER FOR THE YATES TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's like something from a Hollywood script. Before last season
the veteran NASCAR driver Ricky Rudd tells his main sponsor, Tide,
that it needs to double its financial commitment in order to
compete with the sport's heavyweights. After a study, the detergent
company decides to do so, but in the process severs ties with Rudd
at season's end. For the next month, Rudd scrambles to find a major
sponsor, a time of soul-searching and uncertainty for the
43-year-old. Suddenly, though, comes an offer that figures to
change his life dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The prestigious Robert Yates Racing Team, the defending Winston
Cup champion Dale Jarrett's team and one with an envious long-term
commitment from big-bucks sponsors, offers Rudd the team's second
car in a three-year deal straight from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably couldn't have been smart enough to plan that,''
chuckled Rudd, who will make his Winston Cup debut for Yates in
next Sunday's Daytona 500. ``I was so busy trying to get my own
team up and built that I almost didn't see that opportunity when it
knocked on my door. I finally realized that this is everything I
want, and without the headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, so accustomed to making do with less than $5 million for a
season's racing when the top teams were spending $8 million to $10
million, now has all the support to challenge for his new
teammate's title. And he arrives with a reputation for being able
to find the winner's circle in less optimum circumstances. He holds
the Winston Cup record for having won at least one race a year for
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're up against the best in the world at what they do,'' he
said. ``They're very competitive. They don't sleep a lot. They lay
awake thinking of new ways to make their cars run better.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak ended last year, along with his six-year
struggle to be competitive on a relative shoestring budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to lay blame, but as a team we weren't prepared
aerodynamically when the season began,'' Rudd said. ``We had
switched engine companies for the first time, and the motors just
weren't getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   His team eventually switched engine companies again and finished
the season strong, but, as he said: ``Three-fourths of the year was
gone before that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates understood. Even before the Yates team knew Rudd
might be available, Rudd drew nearly 70 percent of the votes as the
replacement for Kenny Irwin in a poll conducted by Yates' son Doug
among the team's personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a few guys I wouldn't have been afraid to do business
with, but this took a lot of variables out of the equation,''
Robert Yates said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Yates has respected Rudd since they worked together
for a year when Rudd was 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are successful as you want to be in this business,
sometimes you end up creating a monster _ somebody you can't handle
or maybe who doesn't deserve it,'' Yates said. ``I knew right off
it'd be a great situation with Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   As a testament to his return to a more simplified, focused life,
Rudd is about a month into a physical fitness program. In the
late-1980s, Rudd set a workout standard among drivers that few
could match and he said it gave him more confidence on the race
track. Then in 1994 he became an owner-driver, juggling the sundry
responsibilities of fund-raising, sponsor relations and overseeing
the business while driving the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that got sacrificed was my workout
schedule,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   The added responsibility of running his team did not stop him
from winning. The son of a Chesapeake, Va., salvage yard owner
still notched six of his 20 career victories and finished in the
top five 31 times.
</P>
<P>
   If he had not accepted Yates' offer, he could have driven for at
least several other teams. And never mind that he has reached an
age where he would be viewed as a dinosaur in most other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and tell you I'm more physically fit than a
guy that's 21 years old,'' he said. ``But in this sport it comes
back to sort of brainpower and experience. Every driver has his own
peak. But it seems like in the Winston Cup, it's in the mid-40s.
I'm taking it year by year, but I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody questioned Rudd's determination even before he put on a
display of courage in the 1998 race at Martinsville, Va., that
still resounds in Winston Cup circles. His cooling system failed on
one of the hottest days of the year, and the thin aluminum seat on
which he sat became a hot coal. This happened about 30 laps into a
500-lap race. By race's end, Rudd had severe blisters on his back,
lower thighs and buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   He had something else, too: the winner's trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was everything I could do to block the pain,'' he said.
``The car was going so well _ that's probably the main reason I
stuck with it. You just dig down deep.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if Jarrett and his new partner happen to be battling for
victory in the last laps of Daytona next Sunday, Yates' sentiment
is simple: let the best man win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked monopolies,'' Yates said. ``I'm more of a person
who likes to rob from the rich and give to the poor. Sitting in the
grandstand, I wouldn't want to say, `That guy only won because he
had a teammate helping him.' I look at it like this: they're both
capable of winning. Let's see what happens.''

<P>
   Ed Viesturs, clad in a charcoal sweater and jeans, stood
chatting with acquaintances last Monday evening in a corner of the
chapelesque auditorium of the Society for Ethical Culture on West
64th Street in New York, shortly before he would present a slide
show to a standing-room crowd on his exploits as a mountaineer. A
beefy, 20-something man dressed for success in a smart wool topcoat
shouldered his way through the growing throng and inserted himself
in front of Viesturs. ``Hey, dude, sorry to interrupt,'' he
interrupted. ``But you are, like, the man, you are, like, totally
.'' The young man jerked his head toward a smaller fellow,
hunched over and talking to a cell phone. ``Me and my bud, here,
are doing our first climb this summer. We're stoked, and wondering
if....''
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs, 40, imperceptibly drew back. He could be forgiven for
not high-fiving this arriviste to the largely conservative
fraternity of Alpine climbers, but then Viesturs has learned that
you can no longer tell just what _ or who _ will pop out of the
avalanche of public interest in outdoor adventures. The attention
has been caused by, among other things, the climber Jon Krakauer's
1997 best seller (``Into Thin Air''), a book about disaster and
death on the shoulders of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs welcomes the interest, partly because it makes it
easier for him to find sponsors for his expeditions. But, Gore-Tex
notwithstanding, he is strictly an old-school mountaineer. He
climbs mountains the old-fashioned way, without the help of bottled
oxygen. As he puts it: ``Using oxygen feels like cheating. I want
to climb the mountain as it is, for what it is, not reduce it to my
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this self-imposed handicap, Viesturs plans by the summer
of 2001 to become the first American to scale each of the world's
14 8,000-meter-plus summits. Only eight climbers have achieved that
feat. Viesturs has already accounted for 12 of those peaks,
including the one deemed most formidable (K-2, on which Viesturs
and his former climbing partner, Scott Fisher, performed the
high-altitude rescue of another climber and were also caught in an
avalanche before their own successful vault to the summit), and, of
course, the highest peak in the world, Everest, at 29,030 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs has reached the summit of Everest five times, twice
without the aid of oxygen. And the last time he stood at the base
of that mountain and gazed upon its threatening, mist-shrouded
flanks, he experienced a unique reaction. He shrugged, and thought:
``Been there, done that. It's time to move on, Ed.'' Earlier on
Monday, Viesturs sat beneath a pastel, vaguely cubist mural in a
boutique coffee beanery near Gramercy Park. Clear-eyed,
square-jawed and fond of java fuel (Viesturs may like his air thin,
but he ordered a double latte grande coffee), he could have been
mistaken for any of the countless software engineers lounging about
in similar haunts in his adopted hometown of Seattle. Despite years
of exposure to the powerful ultraviolet rays of the Alpine sun,
Viesturs doesn't even look weathered. The only clue to his status
as a mountaineer for the ages can be found in the way he walks,
with the rolling, bow-legged gait of a beat-up athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about Viesturs' background carries even a faint whiff of
predestination. He grew up in pancake-flat Rockford, Ill., about 90
miles from Chicago, the son of a design engineer. A good student
and a competitive swimmer, he recalls being highly motivated and
goal-oriented. He did not know then that he had the extraordinary
constitution usually found only in people like Sherpas, who are
born and raised at high elevation.
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs has a lung capacity of seven litres, two more than the
average for similar males. He also has a very high anaerobic
threshold, which enhances his ability to function effectively at
times when his body demands and uses oxygen at a higher rate than
it can take it in. Viesturs has a rather ordinary explanation for
all of this: ``My father, Elmars, is of good, strong, Latvian
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 15, Viesturs came upon the book that changed his life,
``Annapurna,'' by Maurice Herzog. After reading it, he took up rock
climbing and vowed one day to make an expedition to the Himalayas.
He attended the University of Washington, where he studied
veterinary medicine and spent all his free time climbing in the
nearby Cascade range. Soon, he was guiding for Rainer
Mountaineering Inc., but he insisted on finishing vet school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard worker and I pay great attention to details,'' he
said. ``So, I hate leaving things unfinished.''
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs finished vet school three months early, in order to
make his first expedition to Everest, where he came within 300 feet
of the summit before turning back because of bad weather. The
subsequent, nagging sense of failure felt by this natural-born
i-dotter and t-crosser ensured that Viesturs would not spend much
more time ministering to overweight tabby cats. He soon cobbled
together enough money to continue climbing through guiding, and
worked in construction and carpentry in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Although he loves animals, his favorite places are among the
most barren and hostile to living organisms on earth. ``Up there,''
he said, ``there is nothing. Just ice, snow and rock. We go up to
visit and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the allure is that it demands utter self-reliance.
Anywhere else on earth, in the desert, in the middle of the ocean,
you can now get on the cell phone, call someone, and have a plane
come and rescue you. You can't do that on the high peaks. If you
drop a glove, in 30 minutes your hand is frozen, then you drop your
ice axe because you can't hold it and then, well, that's about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Viesturs robustly denies that he has any romance with death,
describing his urge to climb as a ``life wish,'' and points out
that his wife, Paula (a frequent companion on trips, but not as a
serious climber), and his 2-year-old son, Gil, have increased his
well-documented caution. ``The main reason I take a cell phone on
my climbs now is so that I can be in touch with my family,'' he
said. ``I want them to know I'm safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cell phone has also become an indispensable tool in one
of the toughest climbs contemporary mountaineers face, the
relentless struggle to secure and service sponsors in an age when a
typical Himalayan expedition, regardless of the outcome, can carry
a six-figure price tag. Viesturs will use his cell phone on coming
climbs to post daily progress reports for one of his principal
sponsors, Mountainzone.com.
</P>
<P>
   His sober message will undoubtedly disappoint some of the
erstwhile climbers and dot-com cowboys who already have the phone,
but not much else in the way of climbing gear: ``Getting to the
summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory. It only counts if
you make it back down.''

THE STREAK AND WOODS ARE THE TALK OF THE TOUR
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ After his thrilling victory Monday at Pebble
Beach, Tiger Woods received a phone call from his close friend Mark
O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and O'Meara love to compete. They also love to needle each
other. By winning at Pebble Beach, Woods reached 17 career
victories on the PGA Tour, one more than O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Woods ammunition that he didn't waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call to congratulate him, and Tiger says, `I just passed you
in all-time wins,''' said O'Meara, smiling and shaking his head.
``I said, `Tiger, I don't need this from you.'''
</P>
<P>
   It has been like that for months, Woods having his way, at the
rest of the tour's expense. Consider this: Woods has won 10 times
since Davis Love III's last victory on tour. Woods has won 10 times
since Phil Mickelson's last victory. Woods has won nine times since
David Duval's last victory. Heading into Saturday's third round of
the Buick Invitational, Woods was threatening to win again.
</P>
<P>
   Woods began Saturday six strokes off the lead at five under par,
trailing Mickelson, Kirk Triplett and Shigeki Maruyama of Japan,
who were tied for first at 11 under. Yet everyone in the field knew
that Woods could devour a six-stroke lead like a lion devouring its
prey.
</P>
<P>
   So with two rounds to play, on a Torrey Pines course that he has
played on since he was a kid, everyone else on the leader board
would be keeping a close eye on Woods, who continued to chase
history. Woods has won his last six starts on tour to tie Ben
Hogan, who won six consecutive starts in 1948, for the
second-longest streak in tour history.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson has the record with 11 victories in 1945, a mark
that looked unreachable until Woods went on his current winning
binge. The tournament expected record-breaking crowds this week,
the largest gallery would be tracking Woods and a worldwide news
media contingent would follow his every shot.
</P>
<P>
   Even other players were having a hard time avoiding streak talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great to see, all this interest,'' Triplett said.
``It's right there on the front page, not the sports page, but the
front page. This is fantastic. Everybody thinks golf is a really
great game, and they're excited about it. A lot of it is because of
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, a neighbor of Woods in Windermere, Fla., has seen him
handle the spotlight since he came on tour, and nothing he does
surprises O'Meara. When Woods won just once on tour in 1998, some
believed that he had been overrated, that he would not become the
tour's most dominant player. Instead, Woods has raised the bar of
excellence in his sport at age 24, and for the past six months,
everyone else has failed to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lived up to everyone's expectations, even gone beyond
them,'' O'Meara said. ``Tiger has a gift. I said this before the
streak, he's got the most talent of any player I've been able to
play with in the 20 years I've played on tour. Jack Nicklaus may
not tell you this, but he thinks Tiger has the most talent of any
player he's ever seen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The record that Woods most covets is Nicklaus' 18 major
championships. Woods has won two majors, the 1997 Masters and last
year's PGA Championship. To win 16 or 17 more majors, Woods will
have to remain one of the game's best for the next 15 or 20 years,
something he fully intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest record of all is 18 professional majors,'' Woods
said before this weekend's tournament began. ``That's a testament
to how good Jack played for a number of years, to win the big
events, year in and year out, for a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, Woods will focus on winning the Buick, where
he hopes to author another comeback victory. Woods will also play
next week at the Nissan Open, and he will play the following week
at the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, the year's
first event in the World Golf Championships series.
</P>
<P>
   Woods does not often play four consecutive weeks, which will
make keeping the streak alive even more difficult. However, O'Meara
has learned to never say never with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for him to keep winning every week,''
O'Meara said. ``But with him, nothing is impossible.''

A CONDO OR CO-OP? READ ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People thinking about buying an apartment usually
know that there are two kinds available _ condominiums and co-ops _
and that the main difference is that the owner of a condominium
owns real estate while the owner of a co-op owns shares in a
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   What many do not know, however, is that there are other
differences that range from subtle to quite significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, buying an apartment is like falling in
love,'' said Dennis Greenstein, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
``The first thing that matters is the apartment itself, not whether
it's a co-op or a condominium. But the bottom line is that people
do have to make themselves aware of the differences so they know in
advance exactly what they're getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the different forms of ownership used for co-ops and
condominiums, he said, the distinction most buyers will notice is
likely to be the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had two identical buildings, and one was a co-op and
the other a condo, it's a good bet that apartments in the condo
would be selling for more than apartments in the co-op,''
Greenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the disparity, he said, is the belief that it is
more difficult to buy or sell a co-op than a condominium _ a
perception fueled by the fact that co-op boards generally have more
power to block sales than boards of managers in condominiums do.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein said that while condominium boards usually have a
``right of first refusal'' _ the right to buy an apartment at the
price agreed to by the seller and the prospective buyer _ co-op
boards have broad power to reject potential purchasers, subject to
prohibitions against discrimination. As a result, he said, those
who would rather not run the gantlet of a co-op board admissions
committee might opt for a condo.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that some co-op apartments might be less
expensive than equivalent condominium units, Greenstein said, is
that there is a hidden financial obligation in owning a co-op. This
is the unit owner's proportionate payment on the underlying
mortgage on the building, the debt owed by the co-op corporation
that is secured by the building itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy an apartment in a 10-unit co-op for $100,000, and
there is a $100,000 underlying mortgage on the building, the
purchaser's lender would view the total purchase price as $110,000
because it would take into consideration the borrower's
proportionate share of the underlying mortgage,'' Greenstein said.
``But when you buy a condominium, there is no underlying mortgage,
so you are only paying the price you are paying for the unit.''
</P>
<P>
   With condominiums, he explained, no underlying mortgage on the
building is permitted. But that could also be a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have nothing to mortgage, it's harder to borrow money
when you need it,'' said Marc Shernicoff, a Manhattan certified
public accountant. ``If you need $100,000 to replace the roof, and
you don't have the $100,000 available, you're going to have to
assess the unit owners to raise the money.''
</P>
<P>
   A co-op, on the other hand, has other options. For example,
Shernicoff said, if there is already a mortgage on the building,
that mortgage can be refinanced for an amount that includes
whatever additional money is necessary. And while the shareholders
will ultimately have to repay the money, they can do so over an
extended period of time _ by paying higher maintenance charges,
rather than having to pay a one-time assessment.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible for co-ops that have unused space or
commercial tenants to raise cash by renting out the vacant space or
increasing the commercial rents when existing leases expire.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ability to raise income from outside sources may
be a good thing, Shernicoff said, some co-ops have to be careful
not to raise too much outside income.
</P>
<P>
   Under current federal tax law, he explained, no more than 20
percent of a co-op's total income can come from ``nonshareholder''
sources. If that limit is exceeded in any year, he said, the co-op
loses its status as a housing corporation for tax purposes and
co-op shareholders lose their income-tax deductions for property
taxes and interest on their share loans.
</P>
<P>
   (There is no such problem in condominiums, he said, because
condominium-unit owners own real estate rather than shares in a
housing corporation and pay their taxes directly.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shernicoff said, co-ops have an advantage over
condominiums when dealing with unit owners who fail to make common
charge or maintenance payments. When a shareholder stops making
payments to the co-op and the lender, the co-op is first in line to
get the money that it is owed upon the sale of the delinquent unit
owner's shares.
</P>
<P>
   With a condominium, on the other hand, the lender who holds the
mortgage on a particular unit would generally be first in line to
receive money owed by a defaulting borrower. Any common charges
owed to the condominium association, Shernicoff said, would be paid
only after the mortgage lender has been made whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rarely have a situation where a co-op doesn't ultimately
collect its arrears,'' he said. ``But it is not uncommon for a
condominium to take it on the chin when a unit owner defaults.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan co-op lawyer who is also president
of the New York Council of Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that
there were some significant quality-of-life differences between
co-ops and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, since condominium boards have only
limited power over the subletting of apartments, it is more likely
that such buildings will have higher numbers of rental and
transient tenants. On the other hand, he added, most co-ops have
strict policies regarding sublets, thus exercising more control
over the number of renters in the building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Luxemburg said, it is much easier for a co-op board
to deal with unit owners who violate the rules than it is for a
condominium board of managers.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that if a co-op shareholder violated the bylaws or
house rules, the co-op board could terminate the proprietary lease
and start eviction proceedings. And since the shareholder's right
to occupy the apartment is dependent upon compliance with the
proprietary lease, he said, co-ops are generally successful in
evicting truly troublesome tenant-shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In a condominium, however, the board of managers does not have
the power to evict a unit owner who violates the house rules,
because the condominium does not own the apartment. And while some
people prefer condominiums for just that reason, Luxemburg said,
there are others who prefer co-ops because of the stability they
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of condominium-unit owners to do their own thing
is attractive to some people,'' Luxemburg said. ``But if you're the
kind of person looking for a building occupied by people as their
principal residence, and you don't want to see a new face with a
suitcase in the hall every week, then you would probably want to
live in a co-op.''

 &HT;    Two cooks in the kitchen
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every relationship begins with a meal to remember. For
Clifford Harrison and Anne Quatrano, it was a hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   The co-chefs met at the California Culinary Academy but didn't
really care for each other at first. Harrison thought Quatrano was
``some snotty East Coast chick.'' He was a self-professed surf and
ski bum from Hawaii _ a guy whose yearbook quotes were ``Surf 'til
it hurts!'' and ``I'm flying in the face of fashion so I give you
the BIG ALOHA.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in their last semester of school, they found themselves side
by side in pastry class. Quatrano was having trouble making creme
patisserie, the heavy vanilla goo that cements strawberries to
sweet crust in a classic fruit tart.
</P>
<P>
   So she asked Harrison for help. He lent her a hand.
</P>
<P>
   She offered him a ride after school. He invited himself up for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And she made him a hamburger, served rare on focaccia with
Gorgonzola, pickled onions and a bottle of Pommard to wash it down.
Harrison, dazzled, never left.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since this big aloha some 13 years ago, Harrison and
Quatrano have been a personal and professional team. They now share
life on a 60-acre farm passed down through her mother's family.
Though they haven't gotten around to children (or a marriage
certificate for that matter), they count among their charges five
horses, two potbellied pigs, seven squat-legged Jersey cows, a
vague number of cats and dogs, chickens galore, 55 employees at the
highly regarded Atlanta restaurants Bacchanalia and Floataway Cafe,
and a newly minted gourmet food market.
</P>
<P>
   It is the market, Star Provisions, with its idealistic agenda
and thorough integration with the relocated Bacchanalia, that may
be their great contribution to American food arts. Nothing quite
like it has ever been attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Set alongside the railroad tracks near the Atlanta Water Works,
Bacchanalia and Star Provisions occupy one side of a rehabbed
factory that will eventually contain home furnishing stores at the
other end. It is in a seedily picturesque part of town where the
abandoned shell of industry has been appropriated by the hermit
crab of home design.
</P>
<P>
   The complex opened this month after lengthy construction delays.
Harrison and Quatrano moved their immensely popular Bacchanalia
from a snug cottage and threw in Star Provisions as an added
attraction. The market is a corridor of small shops leading up to
the restaurant entrance and selling the same gourmet provender the
chefs use. There is fish, meat, bread baked in a wood-fired oven,
pastry, fine wines, hand-rolled pasta, locally grown organic
produce, artisanal cheeses aged on the premises and estate-bottled
olive oils from the world's top regions. New York state foie gras,
Perigord black truffles and Caspian Sea caviar are available near
cost. There are also classic cookbooks for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Star Provisions isn't just a market, it's an epicurean
laboratory. Bacchanalia in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, high-end markets and restaurants have explored a
different kind of synergy. Draeger's in San Mateo, Calif., a
gourmet supermarket that sells everything from toilet paper to
$200-a-vial aged balsamico, opened an ambitious restaurant called
Viognier within its massive square footage. In London,
super-restaurateur Terence Conran has set a serious cafe, Bluebird,
above a top-tier gourmet market.
</P>
<P>
   But with these examples the markets are the focal points, and
the restaurants are the icing on the cake. Star Provisions, on the
other hand, has grown out of a destination restaurant. It's as if
Quatrano and Harrison threw open their walk-in cooler and invited
you in. The new Bacchanalia is an avant-garde theater of fine
dining with an exhibition kitchen and an exhibition larder.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of chefs would attempt such a high-stepping concept in
such a lowbrow area? Only ones who are confident of their customer
base, embraced by their community and fully committed to nonstop
work would even have the nerve to try. But is the city ready?
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is never ready for what you do if you try something
unconventional,'' says chef Guenter Seeger of Seeger's restaurant
in Atlanta. ``So you need to make them ready. Annie and Cliff can
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen people who work harder than they do,'' adds
local chef Scott Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock took immediate notice of Bacchanalia when it opened in
late 1992. ``I liked the simplicity of the food. It wasn't gussied
up. It was so straightforward and pure, with nothing intimidating
about it. It had that elusive `easy' quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought so. Within its first year Bacchanalia became
Atlanta's hottest table. By its second, it was gaining a national
reputation, and Harrison and Quatrano were selected for the list of
``America's Best New Chefs'' by Food &AMP; Wine magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's signature cuisine was actually a collaboration
of two distinctive _ sometimes polarized _ cooking styles. Harrison
says he is ``more of a logical and technical cook grounded in
standardized French cooking.'' Adds Quatrano, ``Clifford is a
consummate researcher, and I'm not. I'm more of a palate.''
</P>
<P>
   His building blocks are classic stocks, hers are locally grown
vegetables. He loves France for its starred restaurants, she loves
Italy for its peasant dishes. He is known as a loud, autocratic
chef, while she is a fan of quiet teamwork. They have two bottles
of truffle oil next to their stove at home _ black for him, white
for her.
</P>
<P>
   They are different people in every way, and their match is a
mystery. Says their in-house buyer and cheese expert, Raymond Hook,
``The secret to Annie and Cliff is what makes them tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison is 39 but wired like a 12-year-old _ a bundle of
testosterone-fueled squirm. He jumps up out of his seat, giggles
mischievously and tries to get her goat. He also collects firearms
and hangs a cheesy girlie calendar in his cookbook-strewn office.
The big aloha lives on.
</P>
<P>
   His cooking interests lean toward the macho as well. With
old-growth oak trees littering the farm with acorns each fall, he
briefly considered raising acorn-fed pigs for prosciutto. That is,
until one of their dogs attacked the potbellied pigs they keep as
pets, killing one and nearly offing another. ``It was so hard on
Annie,'' says Harrison. ``She really loves animals. The pig was on
the operating table, and I told the vet, `Save this pig!''' Two
hundred stitches later, potbellied Patrick shows his scarred back
and sweet face as he delights in an organic salad for lunch.
Patrick's haunches are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Quatrano, 41, is an old soul _ warm, gentle and centered.
Responsibility edges her voice, and she seems the kind of person
who wakes up with a list of things to do each morning. She keeps
her sandy hair short, doesn't use makeup and wears loose linen
clothes in plain but stunningly resonant blacks and browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just has this natural style,'' says Peacock. ``It's in
everything she touches.'' Even though she didn't want Harrison to
get a motorcycle, she persuaded him to exchange a boss black BMW
for the classic but now rare beige.
</P>
<P>
   Quatrano's sense of style pushed them beyond the cramped
confines of the original Bacchanalia. In 1997 she and Harrison
opened their casual second venture, Floataway Cafe, in a cluster of
rehabbed industrial buildings. But it was very much her vision and
her project, with peasant-style European country dishes cooked in a
wood-fired oven and a focus on organic local produce. She became
chef there while Harrison stayed at Bacchanalia and continued to
refine and simplify his cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Floataway Cafe, an immediate sensation, was largely inspired by
Zuni Cafe in San Francisco, the restaurant where Quatrano first
worked as a waiter in cooking school and whose owner, Judy Rodgers,
she considers a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Recalls Rodgers, ``Annie was worth her weight in gold whatever
she was doing. She was a server who asked to help out in the
kitchen because she was so zealous, and in about 15 minutes she was
better than anybody. She was a sponge for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was the famous Zuni burger that Quatrano first served
to Harrison. And dishes from that restaurant, including kumamoto
oysters with mignonette sauce and a chocolate cake called gateau
Victoire, have shown up in homage on her menu at Floataway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now that Bacchanalia has moved into a larger and more
luxurious space better suited to fine dining, Quatrano has given
the helm at Floataway to a capable sous-chef and rejoined Harrison
at Bacchanalia. The team is reunited.
</P>
<P>
   The new restaurant has an open floor plan and a romantic view of
the Midtown skyline. It also features a long glass wall that
separates the kitchen in full view of from the dining room. For
Quatrano and Harrison, their cooking is an open book.
</P>
<P>
   And their plate is fuller than ever. Quatrano sat at the rolling
utility cart that serves as her kitchen table at home early one
morning and admitted, ``There's not a day I wake up in the morning
that I don't have to work.'' After five hours of sleep, she leaves
by 7:30 a.m., makes the hour-plus drive to work and stays in town
until midnight, first taking care of the books and payroll for both
restaurants, then cooking dinner. ``But I'll go on the record,''
she says over a cup of custom-roasted coffee, ``I don't do anything
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is the funky farmhouse they built from their own
design, one that is clearly echoed at Floataway Cafe. The front
door opens to the middle of a dream kitchen, and visitors
immediately find themselves in a setting of clean architectural
lines, beautiful furnishings and the promise of fine cooking. A
12-foot ``library table'' runs nearly the length of the kitchen in
front of a tall cinder-block hearth. It is a homey and
unpretentious but aesthetically exacting environment.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison tends to the house, the animals, the gardens, the fruit
groves and the honeybees. He orders deliveries for both restaurants
from home, then drives into Atlanta around noon, sometimes on his
motorbike.
</P>
<P>
   After the old Bacchanalia closed but before the new one opened,
he worked as the chef at Floataway for a couple of weeks. ``I
couldn't believe it,'' he recalls. ``There was no veal stock!''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he notes with a wink in her direction, ``Annie's
walk-in (refrigerator) is not as neat as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She puts her arm around him. Her goat wasn't gotten. Quatrano
and Harrison have a complex, interlocking relationship that defies
casual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But they clearly fit together like two halves of a
three-dimensional puzzle, balancing each other even in their
personal contradictions and seeming cross purposes. Bacchanalia and
Star Provisions promise the same.

 &HT;    S.C. to again play a major role for GOP politics
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Watching television in the 1960s, Columbia
native Mark Carman was shocked by the black-and-white footage of
state police and their snarling dogs attacking civil rights
marchers in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says the unflattering national spotlight has turned on
South Carolina, its image tattered by the prolonged, angry fight
over the Confederate flag, as Republicans descend for Saturday's
pivotal presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing how ugly we are, and it is tough,'' said Carman,
39, manager of Capital Newstand on Main Street, less than a block
from America's last state capitol to fly the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is shaping up to be the real loser in the
bruising, neck-and-neck primary between front runners George W.
Bush and John McCain. With Steve Forbes dropping out of the race
last week, Alan Keyes is expected to finish a distant third _ but
with a public image well ahead of the Palmetto State, still
fighting 135 years after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a controversy where we are tearing each other apart
in this state,'' state Sen. Ernie Passailaigue (D-Charleston) said
last week, urging warring colleagues to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, says Walter Edgar, a history professor at the
University of South Carolina, the unfavorable national covarage
could spark some needed changes by showing ``people in South
Carolina that the outside world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature raised the Confederate flag in 1962 as
part of a Civil War centennial. Recently, Gov. Jim Hodges, several
former governors, the NAACP, the state chamber of commerce and
numerous other groups have called for the flag's removal. But the
legislature has failed to act, torn by the flag's clashing
symbolism _ heritage to Confederate ancestors and slavery to civil
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing the growing frustration over the political stalemate,
University of South Carolina economist Doug Woodward joked that
U.S. Army soldiers from nearby Fort Jackson ought to march over and
take down the banner.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said bad publicity from the flag could cost the state
more than the estimated few million dollars going into Republican
primary ads and accommodations for campaign staffs and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfortunate that we are having this primary now while
this flag debate goes on,'' Woodward said. ''It does not reflect
well on the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did last month's Republican candidates' debate in
Columbia, staged in an old home improvement store where the
national broadcast picked up catcalls by apparently drunken people
in the audience. A second televised debate is planned for Tuesday.
Alcohol will not be available to the general audience this time,
said Dana Mishoe, spokeswoman for debate sponsor, the Business and
Industry Political Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce Republican campaigning has brought excitement to
South Carolina, not to mention unexpected advertising revenue to
radio and television stations. Through Friday, Bush and McCain had
purchased $380,000 worth of air time on NBC affiliate WIS-TV in
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are expecting more dollars,'' said WIS-TV sales manager
Debbie Johnson, explaining that the close race is forcing Bush and
McCain to spend heavily.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by stinging comments last week on national programs
such as ''Larry King Live,'' C-Span's ''Washington Journal'' and
National Public Radio, the flag fight has overshadowed South
Carolina's achievements, such as attracting last year more than $6
billion in capital investments, a record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner the flag issue is resolved, the better,''
Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley said. ''It has the potential to
incorrectly and unfairly portray our state.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina peacefully integrated its public colleges, said
Riley, also noting that retiring state Supreme Court chief justice,
Ernest Finney, is black.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rancor over the flag has dredged up ugliness from the
past, some of which, fortunately for South Carolina's reputation,
hasn't yet drawn national attention.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state without a permanent, paid
holiday to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King' Jr.'s birthday. A
state House committee last week endorsed such a holiday, but not
before a Charleston Republican attacked the slain civil rights
leader's character.
</P>
<P>
   King was ''an enthusiastic serial adulterer who wandered through
life in adulterous relationships,'' state Rep. John Graham Altman
told the House Judiciary Committee. ''Perception has overtaken the
reality of the life he led.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, state Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian
said he regretted Altman's slap, though it made Republicans look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes (South Carolinians) look like a bunch of ignorant
rednecks who can't deal with one another with any degree of common
civility,'' Harpootlian said.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, the flag fight has unleashed hostilities, including
a racist handwritten death threat last week against one of the
flag's most vocal opponents, state Sen. Darrell Jackson
(D-Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   The letter, being investigated by state police, told Jackson he
didn't have ''the right or the class to shine Arthur Ravenel's
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel is a Republican senator from Mount Pleasant who refused
to apologize to the NAACP after telling a Confederate heritage
rally last month that the group stands for ''National Association
for the Mentally Retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   From South Carolina's rancor, the Confederate flag has suddenly
emerged as a lightning rod in America's uneasy debate over race. It
has dogged the Republican presidential candidates since last
month's debate in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain said South Carolinians ought to decide the
flag's fate, a position that Democratic presidential contender Bill
Bradley last week, during a Columbia stop, denounced as ignoring
''a hateful and shameful past.''
</P>
<P>
   The fierce campaigning has dredged up another skirmish. Visiting
Columbia last week, Democratic presidential contender Bill Bradley
criticized Bush for kicking off his South Carolina campaign with a
speech at Bob Jones University. In 1984, the fundamental Christian
college in Greenville lost its federal tax exempt status for
banning interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am afraid the primary is getting a little more press than we
would like,'' said Tom Sponseller, president of the Hospitality
Association of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group represents 1,500 hotels, restaurants and other
tourism businesses, increasingly worried about the NAACP's economic
boycott of South Carolina until the flag is removed.
</P>
<P>
   At least 96 groups have canceled plans for conventions and
meetings in South Carolina in response to the boycott, Sponseller
said. Those cancelations total more than $40 million in lost
revenue to businesses, according to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Columbia, the flag fight has hurt Capital Newstand's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mark Carman said sales of magazines such as ''Ebony''
and ''Jet'' and of books by black authors have fallen by a third
since the NAACP announced its tourism boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Black people, he said, ''are not going to support a white-owned
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Carman is even more fearful of the possibility that the
Confederate flag would be relocated from atop the Statehouse to the
Confederate soldiers' monument, a short distance from the newstand.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were at eye level, I'd hear about it five times as
much,'' he said.

MANY IN NORTHERN IRELAND SEE ONLY WAR OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Most people woke up here Saturday as passive observers
of the latest political crisis to hit Northern Ireland _ the
suspension of their power-sharing government just 72 days after its
birth.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone is panicking, they aren't showing it.
</P>
<P>
   While some politicians have issued dire warnings that the peace
process is at its lowest point ever, many ordinary people seem more
relaxed. They seem disappointed but not depressed that the
power-sharing government, intended to transform Northern Ireland
into a modern, stable democracy, was put on ice only 10 weeks after
it was created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, those boys are always fighting, but at least they're
fighting with their words now,'' said 66-year-old Frank Maguire,
pausing near the euphemistically named ``peace line'' that
separates Catholics and Protestants in West Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, a retired pipe fitter, has seen it all _ burned out of
his home in 1969, running gun battles on his street, nephews jailed
for Irish Republican Army activity _ and he knows the difference
between what a crisis here means now and what it meant only a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively muted reaction of many people in Northern Ireland
to the latest crisis is testimony to how much the place has changed
in the last decade as the peace process has made the force of
argument, rather than the argument of force, the preferred currency
here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the argument over how best to get rid of the
instruments of force, namely the IRA's hidden arsenal, that has led
to the suspension of the power-sharing assembly and the
cross-border institutions that were meant to forge unbreakable
bonds between Protestant unionists and Catholic nationalists in
Northern Ireland, and the people of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when the last power-sharing government collapsed after
five months in the face of a general strike organized by
pro-British loyalist paramilitary groups, there was no hope of
reinstituting it.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA and its loyalist enemies quickly filled the political
vacuum with some of the worst violence of The Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But many people today seem to accept at face value pledges by
the IRA and the two main loyalist groups, the Ulster Volunteer
Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, that their cease-fires are
in no imminent danger of ending. While paramilitary groups continue
to dole out punishment beatings, ``kneecappings'' and the
occasional murder, there is no sense that the latest crisis will
see a sudden return to widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the power-sharing government was the exclusive domain
of moderates, who were pushed aside by extremists determined to use
violence to sort out the age-old dispute over whether Northern
Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom or become part of
the Irish Republic. This time around, the power-sharing government
was more inclusive, containing political representatives of the
same paramilitary groups that wrecked the 1974 arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the most recent power-sharing executive lasted
less than half as long as the ill-fated 1974 incarnation, there is
a palpable sense here among many that it is only a matter of time
before the weapons stalemate can be worked out and the local
government can get back up and running. No such optimism existed
five years ago, let alone in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has changed for the better since 1974,'' said Mae
Frazier, as she did her weekly shopping on Shankill Road, in the
Protestant working-class heartland of West Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   But Frazier's eyes wandered across the street to the storefront
that used to be Frizzell's fish shop, which the IRA blew up in
1993, killing nine Protestant men, women and children. On Shankill,
people do not include the IRA bomber who died in the blast in the
fatality count.
</P>
<P>
   While there remain those capable of violence, many people here
either believe or hope that politics can isolate those few. Most
people here, Protestant and Catholic, unionist and nationalist, see
no alternative to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Many people were impressed by how seriously the 12 members of
the power-sharing Cabinet took their duties. It was evidence that
even politicians here could set a positive example for a more civil
society.
</P>
<P>
   George Quigley, chairman of Ulster Bank and a tireless advocate
for building a more equitable, stable Northern Ireland, said the
creation of the power-sharing government, and the sight of locally
elected people responding to local problems, gave people heart. The
suspension, he said, leaves them craving more local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an asset that needs to be unfrozen fast,'' said Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's last-minute pledge Friday to eventually put its
weapons ``beyond use'' was not enough to prevent the British
government from suspending the local assembly and restoring direct
rule from London. But the decision by British Secretary of State
Peter Mandelson was seen mainly as a way to save Ulster Union
leader David Trimble, under pressure from his own backers to win a
gesture from the IRA, from resigning and allowing the assembly to
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson's decision infuriated republicans _ who see it as
evidence of Britain's refusal to stand up to unionist intransigence
_ and frustrated the Irish government, which was hoping the IRA's
belated flexibility could save the political institutions created
under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the IRA's critics quickly pointed out that its pledge was
vague, others say the fact that the pledge was made at all is
remarkable proof that the peace process remains viable and capable
of producing compromise, in a society where compromise was once
viewed as treason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA is saying the war is over, but they can't bring
themselves to say the war is over,'' said Michael Sheehan, 55, a
taxi driver originally from Kerry, a republican stronghold of the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here, meanwhile, seem to believe the war is over,
too, but can't bring themselves to say it either. The fact that
they are thinking it, though, means there could, finally, be light
at the end of the tunnel.

 &HT;    New job? Here's the plan
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Congratulations. You landed the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors and experts have some advice about starting a
new job _ strategies, observations and some of their own
experiences to encourage the newly hired and newly promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Keema Small is a recruiter and a member of the Resume Referral
Committee of the Atlanta Chapter of the Society of Human Resource
Management. Through her work at SHRM, Small advises workers looking
for internships and entry-level jobs in human resources.
</P>
<P>
   For a great start, she advises, network. Establish a mentor,
someone who can tell you the ins and outs of your company or just
someone who's willing to help you learn the ropes of your business.
</P>
<P>
   Get a company directory. You can look at a person's title and
get an idea of what he or she does. Maybe the person is in the area
you want or where you eventually want to be. Just tell them who you
are. ``I'm an intern,'' or ``I'm just starting here, and I want to
know more about the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Always get a lot of feedback from your manager. Always ask,
``How am I progressing?'' A lot of people assume they're doing
well. Even if the manager doesn't take the initiative to interact
with you, you should interact with your manager.
</P>
<P>
   Common mistakes: Getting complacent. Thinking you're not
replaceable. Maybe you have done the job before but with a
different company. You need to find out all you can about the
company you're working for. Maybe this company has a certain way
they want you to do things.
</P>
<P>
   Small's experience: ``I started out in health care recruiting.
That's the one thing that allowed me to move into technical
recruiting. Initially, when I started, some interviewers would give
me a hard time because they'd say, `You recruited health care.' In
my opinion, a recruiter is a recruiter. I'd go to meetings and pass
out business cards. I'm not afraid to walk up to someone, introduce
myself, tell them who I am and what my business is. I always tell
them, `If you hear of something, please give me a call.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Van Horn, co-founder of the career Web site
SUCCESSisFUN.com based in Pasadena, Calif., offers these insights:
</P>
<P>
   For a great start: Focus more on listening than talking, arrive
a half hour early and leave an hour late while adjusting, be
patient with others the first few months as relationships (and
office politics) unfold. This is stuff our moms told us a long time
ago, but common courtesy never goes out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Common mistakes: Too often we are given part of the equation in
the interview process and then must assume what type of effort,
communication or result is needed. That can lead to
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Ask directly the first day or week to have expectations defined.
Look at it as a 30-day initiative. What must be accomplished by you
or your team in the first week or month you are on the job? And
then formally or informally review at the end of the month with
your boss how reality compared with expectation. From that, find
out how misunderstandings should be cleared up and productivity
improved. Approach this in a polite, positive manner and the result
can be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's experience: ``My partner and I literally started
SUCCESSisFUN with just two guys, two computers and a pool table ...
and total chaos in our lives from the long hours. Then we stopped,
assessed the damage, created a strategic site and marketing plan,
and started behaving like the executives and companies we make fun
of (except we wear shorts and sandals all the time). We've been
blessed with positive results. It's easy to be an `expert' on other
people's careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Corcodilos, author and career guru at Ask the Headhunter.
Based in New Jersey, his Web site is www
</P>
<P>
   .asktheheadhunter.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a great start: Get adopted by someone on your new team so
you can learn the ins and outs of how the work is done. No matter
how good you are at the job, what matters most in the first few
months is how well you are accepted. And having a mentor is
critical. This gives you someone to bounce ideas off, someone to
ask for guidance, and someone who can introduce you to others in
the company. The whole key to initial success is other people: Get
close to them.
</P>
<P>
   Then jump in and start doing the job. ``Doing the job in the
interview is critical to actually winning an offer. You must carry
this approach into the job itself. Don't wait to be given work.
Find work, do it, then go to your manager and ask him or her to
grade you.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep your focus on the work rather than on the
formalities of interviewing or the politics of your department, you
will establish the necessary foundation for success in your work.
</P>
<P>
   Common mistakes: Many new hires expect that new ideas they bring
with them are just what the company needs, and they often go
overboard in acting or sounding like a breath of fresh air. While
it's good to jump right in and participate, it's important to
respect the culture and social structure of the team. You have to
earn your way in, by helping, not by taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Corcodilos' experience: ``The first time I worked for a company
other than my own, I devoted the first couple of weeks to getting
to know everyone. I was head of a sales team for a company that had
several locations, and our customers were spread all over. I'd
spend half of each work day getting to know the people in my
location and half locked in my office calling everyone else,
including our customers. I wanted to learn from them and give them
a chance to complain. The reaction was very positive. I was able to
solve most of their problems, and each customer immediately got to
know me as the guy who fixed things. It got us off on the right
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle A. Olson, regional manger, Employers Group, Orange
County, Calif.:
</P>
<P>
   For a great start: Be sure the job is right for you. The
employer typically uses the interview, reference checks, testing
and sometimes tools to measure a candidate's personality and
potential. However, it is as critical for the candidate to analyze
his or her fit with the company. There is nothing worse than
wearing a shoe that is one size too small. It is equally confining
to take a job that is not suited to the individual. Be sure that
your expectations for challenge and advancement are in sync with
the opportunities offered by the employer.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest with yourself. Don't settle for a job that is below
your capability. You'll find that your days are mundane. Challenge
is what motivates us to be better.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's experience: ``I wanted to be sure I went to work for a
company with a solid reputation and a positive focus. To me,
integrity is as important for the company as it is for the
individual.'' Man Jit Singh, president of Futurestep
(www.futurestep.com), the online recruiting arm of Korn Ferry
International:
</P>
<P>
   For a great start: Two things are essential. First, understand
and clearly define the performance expectation, and second,
understand the culture of the department in which you will work and
the style expectations the culture will place on you.
</P>
<P>
   Common mistakes: ``We see people jumping at opportunities
without assessing whether the new opportunity will leverage their
strengths, the culture of the organization is one with which they
feel an affinity, and the job content is something they would
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh's experience: ``I moved from being a partner in a
consulting firm to the CEO of a temporary staffing firm. I think
the most important element in succeeding was adopting a
participatory management style and soliciting input from all levels
of the organization.

 &HT;    Black history yard display creates controversy
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski and Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No pink flamingoes for Josie Dean.
</P>
<P>
   In her front yard on a thoroughfare, she has created a tableau
of historical hate, complete with a lynched black baby doll and
signs with racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the homemade tourist attraction has created a traffic
problem and more than a little discontent in the racially mixed
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who is black, has lived on the corner for 11 years, and
she has routinely decorated her yard during holiday seasons and
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   To mark this year's Black History Month, she created a display
which she calls ``Real Black History.'' The stark depictions of
racial atrocities are mixed with shreds of the Confederate flag and
a white sheet arranged to suggest a Ku Klux Klan night rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been this drastic before,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said she received a divine inspiration to create a display
that would evoke some of the most dire images of this country's
racial history. A spirit voice asked her, ``Why was I lying to his
people?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So she set out to feature events that she thinks many people are
too quick to forget.
</P>
<P>
   In the week or so it has been on display, there has been a
steady and sometimes heavy stream of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   One mother made a 90-minute bus trip, taking two buses and a
train to bring her three sons to see the display. ``I want them to
know the truth about black history,'' said Tameca Tyson, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Her 8- and 4-year-olds roamed through the display and stared at
the lynching scene while her 1-year-old sat quietly in his
stroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always talk about the good of black history and try to
leave out the bad,'' Tyson said. ``They should talk about it all
and this is what happened to us. Sometimes people forget about the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Phrrya Rivers was there, too, with her three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their history,'' said the elementary school teacher.
``I thought this was a very bold and courageous thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some of Dean's neighbors said they fail to see any
historical or artistic merit in the display. All they see is
traffic congestion and racial divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's upset with her for turning our neighborhood into a
three-ring circus,'' said David Weathers. ``I think it's offensive
for people of both races all I see is hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dozen or so, black and white, said they were
personally offended by the display, though a few added that they
thought Dean was within her rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some said black residents had called white residents to
apologize for the offensive display and to disassociate themselves
from it.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Murray, a black neighbor of Dean's, said the display has
generated tension in what had been a quiet, caring neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm offended by it,'' Murray said, adding that she would not
take her young son to see the display because of its hostile
message.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, she and others have been disrupted by the stream
of strangers in the neighborhood. ``When I come home, I just want
to be home and left alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Klingel, a white resident, said the traffic problem has been
a serious one. ``When I come home, I can't even get into my own
driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she can't understand why local authorities don't
do more to restrict and control the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got cited for having an old truck in my yard, and yet she's
allowed to display something like that,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean dismissed her neighbors' complaints, saying, ``They're
jealous because they didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And to those who might question the taste of what she calls her
``free museum,'' Dean said, ``If a white woman had done this and
put it in a museum, it would be art.''

MUGABE PUSHES CONSTITUTION, BUT FEW IN ZIMBABWE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe _ John Gazi has a knack for opposing things.
</P>
<P>
   He fought against the whites of former colonial Rhodesia, and
then against the new black leaders of renamed Zimbabwe. He can't
stand the local music. He voted ``no'' in this weekend's referendum
on a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't interested in this thing,'' said Gazi, a builder
of low-cost housing. ``Why do we need a quick vote for an
unacceptable constitution? Even if we all vote no, the result will
come out yes. It's meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. Observers said that after weeks of pitched
campaigning by the government and its critics, poor turnout on the
first day of voting Saturday in Zimbabwe's first-ever referendum
probably ensures that President Robert Mugabe will get his way: a
new constitution that swells his already considerable power.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrrhic victory, Gazi said. Until Gazi and people like him get
what they are looking for, the president _ and Zimbabwe _ rests on
a throne of sand.
</P>
<P>
   Gazi is a veteran of the bush rebellion against white-ruled
Rhodesia. By the time he was 19, he commanded a platoon. His
targets were the large, fertile farms owned by the sons and
daughters of British settlers. He fought for seven years, and when
rebels won independence in 1980, Gazi and his comrades thought they
had finally get back the lands taken under colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen. Instead of confiscating farms for black
resettlement, Mugabe left the whites on their land. Zimbabwe's new
ruler understood that agriculture was the backbone of his country's
economy, and that disrupting production would be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, Gazi was back at war. His target was again the
white farmers, but his enemy had changed. ``Land is what we fought
for,'' he said, ``but our government sold out. I'm not disgruntled.
I'm angry.'' He spent six years in solitary confinement in Mugabe's
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land is a life-and-death issue for Mugabe in the literal
sense, and not just in the sense of his tenure in office,'' said
John Makumbe, a political scientist at the University of Zimbabwe
in Harare, the capital. ``War veterans are very bitter about the
economy. They feel . . . destitute and landless in the country they
liberated. Mugabe knows they could remove him.''
</P>
<P>
   War veterans make up 60 percent of the military and 40 percent
of the police force, Makumbe said, and wield considerable
influence. In December 1997, amid a sudden and sharp economic
plunge, they took to the streets demanding payoffs and pensions.
When Mugabe could not impose a tax increase, he paid the veterans

   Ordinary Zimbabweans are running thin on patience for the
veterans. Everyone suffered during the liberation struggle, Makumbe
said, and everyone expected land after independence. A new
opposition movement growing out of the trade unions would cut
veteran pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, however, seems beholden to his former comrades in arms.
But he is in no position to deliver what they want, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the most arable lands lie behind the fences of a
few white and black owners, while the majority of blacks live in
crowded urban townships or on stony, government-owned communal
plots. To solve that problem, the draft constitution states that
``the people of Zimbabwe must be enabled to reassert their rights
and regain ownership of their land; accordingly . . . the
government of Zimbabwe has no obligation to pay compensation for
agricultural land compulsorily acquired for resettlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November 1997, however, the government has repeatedly
threatened to take white-owned farms, with neither a plan nor the
money to resettle blacks on the land. Many of those already
acquired have fallen into the hands of Mugabe's cronies. Others lie
fallow. With the economy grinding to a halt amid critical shortages
of foreign currency, the government still has no money for land
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling party safeguards the hoarding of land by commercial
farmers,'' Gazi said. ``None of the land that has been acquired has
been given out. Most veterans don't even have houses. Mugabe must
remember that war veterans are the only armed and trained group
that can oppose government. They can rise up anytime.''

 UNDATED: their suspicions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not until 1976 that the State Department took a critical
look at the killings. The move was prompted by a disaffected
Chilean intelligence officer, Rafael Gonzalez, who told reporters
that he had witnessed Horman being held prisoner by Chile's chief
of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez quoted the intelligence chief as saying that Horman
``had to disappear'' because he ``knew too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also described a ``cozy relationship'' between U.S. and
Chilean intelligence services to destabilize the Allende
government, and said that American operatives had even given their
Chilean counterparts lists of suspected leftists to be rounded up
in the first days of a military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   (In its hearings, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
found that the CIA had in fact compiled arrest lists, but said it
had no evidence they were passed to the Chileans. Those lists are
among the documents the CIA has not released.)
</P>
<P>
   Facing pressure from Congress, the State Department ordered two
internal reviews in 1976. The first, completed in August, was
carried out by Rudy V. Fimbres, regional director for Bolivia and
Chile in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. The second was
conducted by Frederick Smith, a State Department lawyer, in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were permitted to examine only documents
either publicly released or already available in the State
Department. Their reviews appeared to confirm doubts and
inconsistencies that American newspapers had already reported but
that State Department officials had repeatedly discredited.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed that an embassy official had received a tip
that Horman had already been killed before his father arrived in
Chile. That tip was not followed up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, embassy officials told Edmund Horman that leftists may
have kidnapped his son, contradicting their own cables home, which
quoted neighbors who said they had witnessed Chilean security
forces taking Horman away.
</P>
<P>
   The internal reviews also questioned the time of Horman's death,
saying there was no reason to accept the Chilean government's
assertion that he died just before the U.S. Embassy learned of his
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet government had ignored numerous requests from the
United States for an autopsy report on Horman, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   One review asked why Davis, who had driven Horman and Simon to
Santiago, had taken their registration card from the hotel where
they were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Davis at first denied that he had taken the card, but changed
his mind when read a passage from a letter he wrote to one of the
investigators, now among the declassified documents, mentioning the
registration card. ``I don't see why it's important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Horman family believes the card was given to the Chilean
military, and tipped it off to the new address of the Hormans, who
had moved just a few days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we have,'' the first inquiry concluded, ``we are
persuaded that the government of Chile sought Horman and felt
threatened enough to order his immediate execution. The government
of Chile might have believed this American could be killed without
negative fallout from the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said that there was ``circumstantial evidence'' that
the CIA ``may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death,''
as well as Teruggi's. It also said that the State Department had
the ``responsibility'' to refute baseless allegations and ``to
proceed against U.S. officials if this is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The second investigation, completed a month before Gerald Ford's
presidency ended, drew a similar conclusion. It blamed the Chilean
government for both deaths and said it was ``difficult to believe''
that the Pinochet government would have carried out the killings
absent some signal, perhaps even an inadvertent one, that the
deaths would not cause ``substantial adverse consequences'' in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, to Harry W. Shlaudeman, the assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, recommended interviewing
Gonzalez, the disaffected Chilean intelligence officer, again and
going back to the CIA for a full accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an explanation exists,'' a memo in the investigation said,
``it does not appear in the files and must be sought elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But both inquiries appear to have ended there. Shlaudeman
himself recommended interrogating Gonzalez further, even submitting
a detailed list of questions for the purpose that the CIA was
allowed to review. But he dismissed the call for investigating the
actions of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed recently, Shlaudeman said that he remembered little
about the issue. ``A lot of things have happened since then,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until jarred loose by Pinochet's arrest in London in October
1998, these reports remained largely hidden from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, State Department officials debated how much of the
documents to show the Horman family, which was then suing the U.S.
government for ``wrongful death,'' a case that was dismissed
``without prejudice,'' meaning that it could be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   One official, Frank McNeil, then deputy assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, urged the department to err on
the side of greater disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classification should not be used to prevent embarrassment of
government agencies or officials, which would be the principal
reason for withholding when one gets down to the bone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the documents released to the Hormans omitted large
swaths of material on the grounds of national security and
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that executive privilege protects the president's
deliberations with his advisers, in this instance, Henry Kissinger,
who served presidents Nixon and Ford as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said that he had never seen the documents or the
recommendations, and that he was out of the country much of the
time. ``It's very easy, 30 years after the event, to be so heroic
and to create the impression that one had nothing else to do except
follow one particular case,'' he said. ``If it were brought to my
attention, I would have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres himself, who is now retired, said recently that he was
not surprised at the State Department's apparent failure to pursue
the investigation further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this easily goes into the black hole,'' he
explained. ``And everybody watches it go down.''

REAL ESTATE: ONE-TIME GRISTMILL BECOMES OFFICES AND SHOWROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, N.J. _ The first thing noticed by a visitor to the
Behrle Group's offices is wood _ lots of unpainted, exposed wood.
There are tan horizontal timbers bolted to the darker wooden
columns that support the interior of the building. The roof is
supported by more massive wooden beams, all visible from the second
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Today the building houses modern offices and is a showroom for
the office furniture that Behrle sells, much as an auto dealership
displays different makes of cars. But the structure has roots
extending back to the United States' earliest years. According to
local historians, a least part of the building dates back to 1790,
when it housed a gristmill, powered by the flow of water in the
nearby Peckman River.
</P>
<P>
   This is an example of the successful reuse of a building whose
interior wooden columns and roof supports _ some as much as 15
inches wide on each squared-off side _ are made from the trunks of
single trees and would be almost impossible to duplicate today.
Indeed, much of the new structure is composed of smaller pieces of
wood glued together to match the dimensions of the older, and still
sound, columns and beams.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story of a tenant who could see the possibilities in a
gloomy, one room building that had stood vacant for more than 10
years. It is also about a developer who prefers to preserve the
past rather than bulldoze it and an architect who helped make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Behrle Group consists of 10 companies involved in office
design and furnishing, residential furnishing and country-club
remodeling, eight of which are located here. Since the company is
in the design business, Peter Behrle, the chief executive, said he
was unusually sensitive to the appearance of his own headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted something that was fun and unique,'' he said. ``It
would not be acceptable for us to be in traditional space.''
</P>
<P>
   The main building at the old mill complex is at 271 Grove Ave.
in the northeastern part of this Essex County town. From the late
1800s through the 1940s, it housed a bronze powder mill, where
large hammers pounded sheets of bronze into powder that was used in
inks, labels, flocked wallpaper and other decorations. After
operations moved elsewhere, the place remained a working factory
until 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although a relatively new owner had started replacing the old
windows with modern insulated models, the building still had a
grim, abandoned look and all the wood that is so gloriously exposed
today was covered with layers of green industrial paint. Even
though it had stood empty for 10 years, the roof had been
maintained, so the wood inside had not been damaged by rain, which
is often the undoing of old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The building consists of several parts, evidently built at
different times, although no one is completely sure, because many
of the records of the bronze powder mill were discarded by a
subsequent owner. At one end of the building the roof is supported
by a conventional wood truss structure.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main space, the roofline is higher and supported by
the massive timbers with no truss structure. This greater height
and volume of space, presumably built to accommodate the brass
powder machinery, was the key to the project, because it allowed
the installation of a second floor with a dramatic two story
entryway.
</P>
<P>
   Behrle said he had been looking at space in northern New Jersey
for about a year before looking at the building in Verona and
deciding it could work as an office and a showcase. ``I like
putting traditional furniture close to the old beams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had some experience in adapting old industrial
buildings to a new use as a result of a related company's
conversion of an old clothing mill in Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took a good bit of imagination to see the dreary old
mill as the lively office and design center it has become. ``It was
not a happy place,'' said Charles O. Logan Jr, the president of
Aztec Corp., the architect for the project. ``The floors were
chopped up and everything was covered with paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Once arrangements had been made to lease the building, the
architect and his workers started scraping away the layers of paint
and found that the walls were made of brick piers that supported
roof timbers with concrete block between the piers. The brick was
sandblasted down to its natural finish along with the wooden
columns and beams. The concrete block was painted over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered up the things that were not attractive enough to
enhance,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big questions was whether the old wooden columns were
strong enough to hold the weight of a second floor. It turned out
the old timbers were, for the most part, up to the job, but the
concrete they stood on was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a structural engineer do borings into the footings, and
we had to add support there,'' Logan said. Two steel columns were
also added to ensure the integrity of the second floor, but they
were hidden so as to not detract from the historic wood.
</P>
<P>
   Adding modern utilities such as electrical and
telecommunications wiring, and plumbing, without destroying the
character of the building was a challenge as well, since all the
design and business functions of the Behrle Group are done on
computers. The solution for most of the infrastructure was to cut
trenches in the floor to take the wires and pipes to where they
were needed.
</P>
<P>
   What couldn't be hidden is blatantly displayed. The sheet-metal
heating and air-conditioning ducts contrast sharply with the dark
fir timbers to which they are attached. To provide adequate
headroom on the second floor, angled wooden braces between the
vertical columns and roof beams had to be removed from their
original placements and moved upward.
</P>
<P>
   The work was painstaking and time-consuming. Behrle said he
signed a lease in January 1998, but was not able to move in until
last June. ``It was a complicated project,'' he said. ``So we
didn't rush. We wanted it to be done right.''
</P>
<P>
   The mill complex, which contains some other, smaller buildings
that have also been restored, is owned by J. Webster Realty, one of
the corporate vehicles operated by Steven Plofker, a lawyer and
developer based in Montclair. Plofker said that, where possible, he
tries to preserve old buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said he was particularly drawn to the massive fir columns and
beams in the building now occupied by the Behrle Group when he
first saw them about four years ago. ``I have never seen new lumber
like that,'' he said. ``It would be painful to demolish something
of that sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to leave the beams completely visible, he put insulation
on top of the roof rather than the usual placement underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said some changes had to be made to improve the
marketability of the complex. He said he took down some smaller
mill buildings, that he said were beyond repair. ``The columns were
too close, the ceiling were too low,'' he said. An old house on the
property was demolished as well, because it had been remodeled so
many times and in so many different styles that it had little
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The site needed modification as well. ``There was a hill behind
the Behrle building, so there was no flat land for parking,''
Plofker said. ``We had to move a lot of dirt to make it suitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the demolition, there is a vacant site available
where Plofker said he plans to put up a building to house doctors'
offices. He said he plans to be sensitive to the history of the
mill complex and not plunk a modern glass and steel building
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I build new, I try to make it look old,'' he said. ``The
nicest compliment I can get in those cases is when someone looks at
a building and says, `Nice restoration.'''

   AUSTRIA-EU _ VIENNA, Austria _ Austria's new government took

the government's inclusion of the Freedom Party, which is described
as somewhere between neo-Nazi and American Republican. So far, the
greatest affect of the domestic and international indignation is to
greatly enhance Joerg Haider's popularity in Austria and perhaps to
encourage other right wing parties seeking power across Europe.

<P>
   Maria Paasche, who helped Jews escape from Nazi Germany on the
back of her motorcycle and whose father and brothers conspired to
kill Hitler, died Jan. 21 in a San Francisco nursing home. She was
90.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Paasche was the daughter of Gen. Kurt von Hammerstein, who
was commander in chief of the German army from 1930 to the winter
of 1934. He was known as the ``Red General'' for his friendliness
with trade unions and Russian generals during the years when
Germany and the Soviet Union were allies.
</P>
<P>
   The general plotted unsuccessfully in 1939 to lure Hitler to his
headquarters on the Western front and kill him. Chancellor Heinrich
Brening called the general ``the only man who could remove Hitler _
a man without nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Paasche's brothers, Ludwig and Kunrat, were part of
another conspiracy to kill Hitler, in 1944. Unlike many plotters,
both escaped. From growing up in military headquarters, they knew a
secret passage to reach the subway in Berlin. Ludwig died two years
ago, and Kunrat lives near Bonn, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Therese von Hammerstein was born in Magdeburg, just
outside Berlin, and grew up in an army family. Her grandfather,
Gen. Walther von Luettwitz, was involved in the 1920 putsch against
the Weimar Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But young Maria and her six brothers and sisters were allowed
freedom to prowl a broader intellectual and political landscape.
They made many Jewish friends, and though Maria was a Christian,
she planned to join her Zionist friends in Palestine, said her son,
Gottfried Paasche, a sociology professor at York University in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   She began her education at a convent but left to attend a public
school, where she studied agriculture to prepare for life in the
Middle East. She attended the University of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried Paasche learned about his mother's past only in recent
years, when he applied to have her admitted to the Jewish Home for
the Aged in San Francisco. She had previously talked little about
her past, and now memory loss was setting in. Still, he was able to
compile compelling evidence of her wartime aid to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he realized that his mother represented part of
a largely missing history. ``The work of women in the early years
of Nazi power had been forgotten'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that history is contained in a documentary about Maria
Paasche completed last year. The still unreleased film, ``Silent
Courage: Maria Therese von Hammerstein and Her Battle Against
Nazism,'' was sponsored by B'nai B'rith and the German government.
Last week Gottfried Paasche returned to Germany to continue
research about his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of the great political activism of the three older von
Hammerstein sisters, of which Maria was the middle one. In the
1930s, after the meaning of Hitler's rise was becoming clear, she
began riding her motorcycle to Prague, which was still a free city
not under Nazi domination.
</P>
<P>
   She would transport Jews and intellectuals out of Germany into
Prague, and also take newspapers and other materials to the
anti-Nazi community there. She would also warn Jews they were in
danger, on the basis of intelligence information from her father.
</P>
<P>
   The von Hammersteins lived in military housing under constant
supervision, as Hitler tightened his grip on Germany. This meant
that when Maria married in 1935, the ceremony was held in a rented
apartment. Her father did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Her new husband was John H. Paasche, who was of Jewish ancestry.
He did not at first seem a perfect fit for a German military
family: His father, Hans, a navy captain who became a pacifist and
was a pallbearer at the funeral for Rosa Luxemborg, the socialist
leader, was assassinated by right-wing German naval officers in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   But Maria's father, von Hammerstein, only wanted one answer: Did
his future son-in-law's father have an honorable discharge from the
navy? The answer was yes, and so the general blessed the union.
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds moved to Palestine to join Zionist friends there,
but a typhoid epidemic forced them to return to Germany. John
Paasche, as a Jew, was not allowed to study law, so he studied
Oriental languages instead. They decided to emigrate to Japan after
being interrogated several times by the Gestapo about the
activities of friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Von Hammerstein died of cancer in 1943, and after his sons'
participation in the failed coup attempt, Maria's mother and her
youngest siblings, a brother and sister, were placed in
concentration camps in an attempt to force them to disclose their
brothers' whereabouts. They never did. The three were freed by
Allies at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Gottfried Paasche said, his parents lived in fear that
their politics would become known by the heavily Nazi German exile
community. His mother tried to prepare the family for being taken
away to camps, urging them to memorize poems. ``You've got to learn
things by heart,'' she said. ``You may need it when you go to
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried Paasche said the Japanese police would sit in front of
the house spying on the family, but the children were never told
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brought up to be loyal Japanese,'' he said. ``My
parents never told me as a child what side we were on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, John Paasche worked as a translator for the
American occupiers until 1948, when the family emigrated by ship to
San Francisco. At first he worked in a tomato-canning factory and
his wife cleaned houses. After John Paasche earned his master's
degree from Berkeley, he worked for the Library of Congress in the
Chinese section.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Paasche read avidly in German, Russian, French and
English. She worked as a literary researcher.
</P>
<P>
   John Paasche died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son, Gottfried, Maria Paasche is survived by
three daughters, Joan Briegleb of Hannoverisch-Muenden, Germany,
Michaela Grudin of Portland, Ore., and Virginia Dakin of San
Francisco; 12 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives regret that they may never know her complete story.
``She never lost her fear of naming names,'' Gottfried Paasche
said.

2 SKATERS, 2 DIFFERENT PATHS TO THE SAME PATCH OF ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Minn.)  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the through-the-looking-glass world of figure
skating, 17-year-old Heidi Pakkala and 14-year-old Sarah Hughes are
on career paths that, like railroad tracks, will run parallel but
will never intersect.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hughes who was being celebrated as a potential champion
at the national championships, a veteran of tough international
competition, while Pakkala was making her first appearance at any
level. She had no visibility as a novice, or as a junior, and when
she read a recent newspaper article about her competitors in the
senior women's division, she became nervous and lightheaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost had to go to the school nurse,'' Pakkala said.
</P>
<P>
   They trained together during the week, preparing for Friday's
short program. Hughes, of Great Neck, N.Y., finished second, while
Pakkala, of Bloomington, Minn., was 13th. Yet each had worked
equally hard and each could claim her own successes. Hughes planned
an unprecedented set of combination jumps for Saturday night's long
program, while Pakkala hoped for the happy anonymity of the lower
reaches of the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes earned two marks of 5.9 for presentation in the short
program and positioned herself to upset Michelle Kwan. Pakkala
landed an exquisite triple lutz-double toe combination, but she
managed only a single rotation on a mandatory double axel, and the
judges were unforgiving. One gave her a 4.0 for technical merit.
But she recovered with a couple of 5.1s for presentation and the
crowd loved her, booing when her low marks were flashed on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   That was worth the trip. She had arrived here as a nobody, and
she had stirred an audience to support her by voicing disapproval
with the judges. Pakkala had been so nervous before the
performance, said her coach, Kathleen Schmetz Gazich, ``I thought
she would totally bomb.'' After her combination jump, she looked up
at the scoreboard, saw herself skating and felt an odd moment of
disconnection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming,'' said Pakkala, a 5-foot-5-inch high
school senior with cropped blond hair and a soft voice. ``But it
was fun, at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   If she had not won any kind of championship, she had at least
won a victory of perseverance. It is exceedingly rare for a skater
who has made no imprint at the novice or junior level to qualify
for the senior championships. As a 6-year-old, Pakkala had skated
an exhibition before the king and queen of Sweden in Minneapolis.
She had portrayed Sonja Henie, and she even had her own dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   But, as recently as a year ago, she was discouraged, not
believing in herself or her coach. So she made a switch, her
confidence inflated like a balloon and she earned her way to the
nationals by finishing second at the Midwestern sectionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pessimistic about skating,'' Pakkala said. ``I knew it
was my last chance. So I decided to work as hard as I could.
Everything is a lot better now. I'm glad I didn't peak when I was
14. I think I have a lot more appreciation now. I'd like to keep
doing this for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at 12, Hughes won the national junior
championship, which is seldom a sign of future success at the
senior level. The last junior national champion to win a senior
national title was Jill Trenary, a decade ago. Bodies change,
interests change, injury hobbles promising careers. But Hughes has
made an ascendant transition so far. She has not experienced
problems with jumping as her body has matured and her center of
gravity has migrated. In fact, reliability has become her
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution in her skating occurred quickly last year. At the
nationals, she skated deliberately, with a paint-by-the-numbers
caution, which could be expected of a 13-year-old, and she finished
fourth. A month later she delivered a relaxed, fluid, grown-up
performance and finished seventh at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's long-legged and tall and she's still able to do her
triple jumps while being an elegant skater,'' said Dick Button, the
two-time Olympic champion. ``I think she's in a perfect place at
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   This season Hughes has worked diligently on the artistic side of
her skating, attempting to draw the audience into her performance,
to feel the music, to show more expressiveness in her face, to
extract what she is feeling inside and to portray it on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more seasoned,'' Hughes said. ``It feels weird. I'm
only 14. But it feels different from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a freshman at Great Neck North High School, determined to
continue living at home and maintaining some connection to a
regular life. Each morning she takes classes in honors biology and
world history from 8 to 9:30, then travels an hour to a rink in
Hackensack, N.J., and trains until about 3 p.m. Two of her teachers
visit her house to tutor her in English and math. She also plays
the violin in the school orchestra and intends to become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can go to school, why not be around other kids my age and
not spend all my time around a rink?'' Hughes said. ``When you go
to school, a lot of people don't know anything about a triple lutz.
It brings you back into reality. I think I get the best of both
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   She is known in the hallways as Sarah the Skater. On Saturday
night she planned to become the first American woman to land triple
salchow-triple loop and triple toe-triple loop combination jumps.
It would be Hughes' best chance to pull off the grand upset, to
skate a more difficult program and hope that her technical ability
could overcome Kwan's artistic superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what sports is all about,'' said Robin Wagner, who
coaches Hughes. ``It's about getting faster, driving faster,
swimming faster. I told Sarah, `Isn't it nice being the first one
doing it instead of having to be the chaser?'''

DANIEL EGAN, 84, DRUG FIGHTER KNOWN AS `JUNKIE PRIEST' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Daniel Egan, whose tireless work in
rehabilitating drug addicts brought him the nickname ``the Junkie
Priest,'' died on Thursday at a hospital in Peekskill, N.Y. He was
84 and lived at the Graymoor Friary in Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's work with addicts began in 1952, when he was preaching in
a church in Manhattan and saw a troubled woman. She was addicted to
narcotics and in need of help. He telephoned a number of hospitals
in the city, he recalled later, but none would take her. ``She was
considered a criminal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Egan, a Franciscan Friar of the Atonement, became a certified
alcohol- and drug-abuse counselor and a chaplain of Narcotics
Anonymous. In 1962, he founded Village Haven, a halfway house for
women who were addicted to drugs, in New York's Greenwich Village.
Before long, eight or 10 women a week, most of them newly released
from jail, were going to Village Haven for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women face a crisis the moment they are freed,'' Egan
said in a 1963 interview. ``The simplest things become their
deepest need _ a place to eat and sleep, a job, a coat to wear, a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   His work took him far afield. He established a center for drug
addicts a decade ago in Calcutta, at Mother Teresa's request. In an
interview last year he recalled, ``She was like all saints _ very
stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor praised Egan in his homily at a Mass
attended by Egan last September. At the time, Egan was serving in
nursing homes for AIDS patients and continuing his work against
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said that when Egan was referred to as ``the Junkie
Priest,'' it was ``with great affection and great admiration.''
</P>
<P>
   When Egan was a young priest, the cardinal recalled, ``He used
to roam the streets of Times Square, and that area in general,
looking for ways of helping prostitutes, so many of them addicts to
one form of drug or another. God knows how many lives and souls
Father Egan has saved in that terribly difficult kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Franciscan Friar of the Atonement, the Rev. Walter
Gagne, said that in the 1950s, when Egan was beginning his work
with addicts, he would go to the old Women's House of Detention in
Greenwich Village. Many of its inmates were addicts who had worked
as prostitutes. ``He would stand on the sidewalk by the prison and
start talking to the women up in the prison windows,'' said Gagne,
and pretty soon: ``They'd be yelling at him, and he'd be yelling
back at them. He was ministering to them even before they got out
of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how he carried out his ministry, Egan thought of
the afflicted in spiritual terms. ``If we had the vision of
faith,'' he once wrote, ``we would see beneath every behavior _ no
matter how repulsive _ beneath every bodily appearance _ no matter
how dirty or deformed _ a priceless dignity and value that makes
all material facts and scientific technologies fade into
insignificance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1965 interview at St. Patrick's Villa Retreat House in
Nanuet, N.Y., where he was ministering to women who had broken
their heroin habit, he said the best way of dealing with drug
addicts was through personal counseling.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that government agencies fighting drug abuse
``save themselves money and trouble'' by setting up storefront
offices in high-addiction neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the human salvation, think of the prison expenses
you'd save,'' he said. ``You could pay these girls $5 a day to just
sit there and talk to the junkies who wandered in for a cigarette
instead of a fix.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he founded New Hope Manor at Graymoor for teen-age
girls who were addicted to drugs. Over the years, he also worked as
program director at St. Joseph's Rehabilitation Center at Saranac
Lake, N.Y., and in programs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He received various honors, including awards for pioneering
anti-drug programs in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he was the son of a police lieutenant,
Thomas J. Egan, and the former Mary Bierne. He went to schools in
the Bronx, entered the Friars of the Atonement in 1935, professed
his first vows in 1937 and received a bachelor's degree in
philosophy and a master's degree in religious education, both from
Catholic University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three brothers, John, Philip and Gerard; and a
sister, Veronica Egan.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was the no-look bounce pass to complete a
3-on-1 break. There were the windmill hands that knocked the ball
loose, followed by the natural reflex of banging it off Villanova
center Malik Allen's knee. Then, Erick Barkley lofted an alley-oop
pass to Lavor Postell. In just four minutes of basketball, Barkley,
the St. John's guard, rediscovered a smile that had been missing
for a week.
</P>
<P>
   He shot a finger toward the roof of Madison Square Garden. He
hopped on his toes. He was free of the NCAA and back on the court.
If only Villanova would have acted as overjoyed as the 15,208 fans
who showered Barkley with applause during warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Wildcats harassed him and took advantage of the
rust that accumulated while he missed two games and practiced with
other matters on his mind. He was an awful 6 of 16 from the field,
missed four 3-pointers and, uncharacteristically, missed four free
throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Barkley finished with 16 points and St. John's
prevailed, 78-75, in a game that neither team looked eager to win
for the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   For seven minutes, Villanova and St. John's traded baskets and
were deadlocked at 57-57. When Chudney Gray sank two free throws
and Bootsy Thornton followed his own 15-footer with a tip-in
basket, the Red Storm took a 61-57 lead with 7 minutes 40 seconds
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, who finished with 25 points, muscled inside twice to
tie it again, at 61-61. It took a while, but Barkley finally found
his 3-point range, hitting a pair, to put the Red Storm up by 69-65
with just over three minutes left to play. After Thornton posted up
in the lane for a turnaround jumper, it looked as if the Red Storm
had beaten the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   No. Jermaine Medley stepped behind the professional 3-point arc
to launch a line drive that ripped through the nets to bring the
Wildcats within 71-69. When Barkley missed a free throw and Allen
hit his 25th point of the afternoon, the Wildcats were still
hanging in at 72-71.
</P>
<P>
   After St. John's Anthony Glover and Villanova's Gary Buchanan
exchanged nifty drives, it was up to Postell to give the Red Storm
the edge. With 21.4 seconds left, the senior co-captain hit a pair
of free throws. It was 76-73 when Buchanan dribbled the ball off
his leg and into Barkley's hands. Barkley was fouled but made only
one of two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Wildcats did not fade. With 16.9 seconds left, Medley
dribbled the length of the floor and banked in a runner from the
middle of the lane to cut it to 77-75. Villanova fouled Postell on
the inbounds pass and, with 10.5 seconds left, he made one of two.
Allen dribbled past midcourt but had the ball knocked away from
behind. So with 3.3 seconds left, the Wildcats had an inbounds pass
under their bucket and a chance to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The ball went to Buchanan in the left corner. He leaped to
attempt a tying 3-pointer, but Glover pinned the ball and it rolled
out of bounds. With eight-tenths of a second left, Villanova
couldn't get another pass to Allen in time for a shot. It was over
_ the third straight victory for the Red Storm (16-6, 8-3).
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first half, Barkley's burst of three assists and
two steals powered the Red Storm to an 18-7 lead, and it appeared
that St. John's was on its way to an easy victory. But Villanova
bombed its way back to a 33-33 halftime tie as Medley hit his third
3-pointer as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats made their 3-pointers count, hitting 6 of 10, while
the Red Storm, one of the Big East's worst 3-point-shooting teams,
hit only 4 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Between the poor shot selection and sloppy ball-handling _ 12
first-half turnovers that led to 16 Wildcats points _ St. John's
blew a seven-point lead by not scoring for the last 6:22 of the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent early that Barkley intended to hustle away the
blues that shrouded him throughout a difficult week in which he
missed victories against Boston College and Providence because of
an NCAA suspension. But on Thursday, an NCAA appeals committee
sliced one game off the three-game penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA ruled that Barkley had received an extra benefit when
he traded a 1996 Jeep Cherokee for a 1995 Chevrolet Suburban owned
by a Rucker League coach who has known Barkley since he was 14.
Although the borrowed Suburban was a year older than the Cherokee,
the NCAA determined it had a higher book value. On Tuesday, it
suspended Barkley for three games.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the appeal, St. John's documented that the Suburban'swindshield wipers and odometer did not work, that it got worse gas
mileage and that it couldn't possibly be worth more than the
Cherokee, according to an associate of Barkley's.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Barkley's six assists and five steals gave
the Red Storm energy _ just as his 2-of-9 shooting took it away.
His first four shots were misses from beyond the 3-point arc; he
finally got on the board with a layup with 8:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served my punishment even though I felt I didn't break any
rules,'' Barkley said in a statement released through St. John's on
Friday. ``Now things can get back to normal with school and playing
basketball again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm will have Barkley back for six more regular-season
games _ a treacherous stretch that will decide whether the team
makes the NCAA tournament. St. John's meets No. 3-ranked Duke and
the Big East rival Miami on the road, and will play host to No. 4
Syracuse , No. 13 Connecticut and surging Seton Hall at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm needs to win at least three of its remaining games
to make the NCAA field of 64. If St. John's regroups and finishes
strong with five victories, its tournament seeding will improve
because of the strength of those opponents.

UCONN WOMEN CAN'T BE SLOWED DOWN BY RUTGERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ On one end of the floor, Rutgers was
desperately trying to stick to its game plan, slowly working the
shot clock as it passed the ball around the perimeter until the
final tick of almost every possession. And on the other end,
prodded by the stomping feet of its head coach, Connecticut tried
desperately to break the slow-ball shackles and run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if the pressure of facing the No. 1-ranked team in the nation
was not enough, the Scarlet Knights were trying to convince
themselves that there was nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   And Rutgers fought it from the opening tip until the final
minute. But when Connecticut's Sue Bird went barreling into press
row, calling a timeout as she was about to crash, with 6.2 seconds
left, the Scarlet Knights finally lowered their heads and accepted
the harsh reality that they could not stop the Huskies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut squeezed out a 49-45 victory at the Rutgers Athletic
Center, staying out of the Lady Knights' grasp long enough to score
enough to escape with the victory. And for the ninth time in 10
tries, Rutgers found itself on the short end of the score against
Connecticut (21-1).
</P>
<P>
   While the point total for the Huskies was a season low, the
Knights found themselves unable to score when they needed to most.
Rutgers (15-5) scored 19 points in the second half and eight points
in the final 9 minutes 5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights had started the season at the top of some polls, but
tumbled after a season-opening loss to North Carolina State and
then unexpected defeats to George Washington University and
Villanova. Entering this game as the nation's No. 10-ranked team,
and enduring the familiar position of looking up at Connecticut,
which has held the No. 1 spot for 14 weeks, Rutgers saw it as a
chance for revenge and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a first half in which his Huskies could not find the
basket, UConn coach Geno Auriemma sat passively. He walked slowly
and deliberately to the locker room at halftime. When Auriemma
emerged for the second half, he would not sit for a second, and
neither would his team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies came and pressed Rutgers, with the huge contingent
of Connecticut fans who filled the upper half of the RAC screeching
their team on. With 13:38 to play, the Huskies pulled even, 34-34.
UConn had trailed by as many as 11 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers pushed ahead again, 37-36, on a free throw by Tammy
Sutton-Brown. But the Huskies continued to apply the pressure,
taking their first lead since 3-2, on a jumper by Kennitra Johnson
that made it 38-37 with 8:50 to play. When Swin Cash followed with
a layup, it gave Connecticut a 40-37 advantage, its biggest lead of
the game to that point.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers tied the score on a 3-pointer by Tasha Pointer, but the
Knights' efforts to slow the pace were taking a toll. With Auriemma
shuttling in fresh bodies and Rutgers countering by milking the
30-second clock to its end almost every possession, the foul
trouble and pressure continued to mount against Rutgers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Pointer tied the score, 40-40, Rutgers did not score again
for 3:20 as the deficit grew to 48-40 before Usha Gilmore somehow
banked in a 3-pointer from the deep right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's only defeat this season had come three games
earlier, a 72-71 loss to Tennessee. But UConn had followed that
setback with a 52-point decision over Seton Hall and a 47-point
mastery of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had in the first meeting between the teams this
season, a 65-50 Connecticut victory, the Lady Knights raced to an
early lead Saturday. In the first meeting, Rutgers led by 21-12
before seeing it all disappear under the weight of a 17-0 run by
the Huskies. In that game, Rutgers had held the Huskies to 29
points in the first half, a season low for Connecticut. Saturday,
whether it was the Rutgers defense or miserable shooting by
Connecticut, the Scarlet Knights built a 26-20 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The only semblance of offense by either team came from Rutgers'
Shawnetta Stewart, who hit 4 of 5 shots, including three
3-pointers, for 11 points in the opening 12 minutes, as Rutgers
built a 17-10 lead. But she left the game at that point, spending
the rest of the first half on the bench with an ice pack strapped
to the back of her neck after colliding with UConn's Svetlana
Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Stewart out, and its offense stalled with four
shot-clock violations, Rutgers was able to extend the lead to 21-10
before the Huskies began to inch back. An 10-2 run, capped by an
Asjha Jones layup with 9 seconds left, closed the gap to three
points. But Rutgers answered with a 3-pointer by Pointer at the
buzzer to gain its halftime advantage.

REAL ESTATE: SPACE FOR RESEARCH IS EXPANDING IN CAMBRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Developers and life-science companies are
planning to invest about $1 billion to build over 3 million square
feet of new research labs in Cambridge, more than doubling the
amount of research and development space in this six-square-mile
city.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buildings will go up within a few blocks of Kendall
Square, where the region's biotechnology industry first put down
roots in the early 1980s. Five new buildings with 1.2 million
square feet of space are in construction or were recently completed
in the area. Four other projects in the neighborhood with a total
of 2.1 million square feet of research space have received city
approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are not building
themselves have agreed to lease most of what is in construction,
some at annual rents approaching $50 a square foot. The buildings
themselves are among the most costly commercial structures, costing
about $350 a square foot to build, from conception to fit-out.
</P>
<P>
   The lure for this new construction is the intellectual firepower
of the Cambridge work force, forged at some of the world's top
colleges, research institutes, medical schools and teaching
hospitals here and across the Charles River in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On the Boston side of the Charles, where the medical schools of
Harvard, Tufts and Boston universities conduct training programs,
1.3 million more square feet of biomedical and pharmaceutical labs
are being developed, according to E. Owen Donnelly, deputy director
of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies of
the life-science industry put a premium on locating in areas with
plentiful academic links because new products usually spring from
lab discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep our pipeline full, we want to be in the Cambridge
market,'' said Peter J. McCawley, development manager for Amgen
Inc., which with 1999 revenues of $2.4 billion is the United
States' largest biotechnology company. ``It's no secret that
Cambridge has the largest and best pool of scientific research
talent in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen sells products based on genetic information unearthed by
biotech research, such as Procrit and Epogen to enhance red blood
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., started work
last year on a $100 million, 285,000-square-foot lab on a
71,000-square-foot site that it bought for $1.4 million in the slow
market of 1994. Instead of building then, it developed a research
center near Boulder, Colo. But in 1998 it converted that lab into a
manufacturing plant and started to plan its Cambridge project.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's sliver of a site here, once part of a sprawling plant
that made fire hose, will be wedged in front of the research lab
for Genzyme Inc. and across the street from a new lab being built
for Biogen Inc. by Boston Properties Inc. Once its building is
completed, Biogen will occupy 740,000 square feet in the
neighborhood where it first leased space in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three biotechnology companies make five of the
industry's 10 best-selling products, according to a 1999 report by
Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Amgen shimmied into this little site because, like most
life-science companies, it wanted to be near industry colleagues
and researchers to share knowledge and insights. ``We can't
convince these companies to take cheaper space in the suburbs,''
said Steve Buckley, regional director of the life-sciences practice
for Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   The presence here of an industry giant like Amgen, therefore,
creates a new critical mass for the life-science industry that will
attract even more companies, according to John A. Southard Sr., an
economist for Tordo Wheaton Research, which is a unit of the
international real estate firm CB Richard Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it signals that the region's real-estate market is
finally moving to the next level of growth after one of the
nation's worst downturns,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge has about 11 million square feet of offices, 8 million
square feet of which is in the East Cambridge neighborhood bordered
by Kendall Square on the west and the Charles River on the east. It
also has 2 million square feet of research labs for bench
scientists who work in controlled environments, known as wet labs.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1999 the labs had a vacancy rate of less than 1 percent,
vs. 24 percent in 1995. Since then, rents have risen as much as 150
percent to reach $50 a square foot annually for some new space,
said Gregory W. Hoffmeister, a broker for Spaulding Slye Colliers
International.
</P>
<P>
   Star attractions for these companies are Harvard and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which together own about
half of the city's land, said Jean E. Strain, Cambridge's director
of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Another magnet is the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. Center for
Genome Research in Kendall Square, which is about halfway between
the two colleges. Scientists there are mapping the human genetic
material. Such research could revolutionize health care with the
ability to grow new organs and design drug therapies for a person's
genetic profile.
</P>
<P>
   With wet lab space set to jump from 2 million to about 5.3
million square feet, the city will adopt new zoning rules to
prevent overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   With the real-estate boom of the 1980s, new zoning rules and
special permit requirements appeared. Last month Cambridge passed
an 18-month moratorium on new permits for projects larger than
20,000 square feet around Kendall Square, and in April it is
expected to adopt a new zoning code to control future growth
citywide, said City Councilor Henrietta Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, property owners worried that it would become
more difficult to build and they could lose value,'' said
Hoffmeister, the broker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the city may reduce the ratio of usable building space
to site size, from a floor area ratio of 4 to 2.5, said Lester W.
Barber, Cambridge's director of zoning. For Amgen, that could have
meant a building of 200,000 square feet rather than 285,000 square
feet, for a loss in value of $30 million. Amgen's new eight-story
building, designed by Stubbins Associates, is to be completed in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The current strong demand increases existing property values,
said Thomas Ragno, a vice president of Beacon Capital Partners Inc.
Beacon owns Technology Square, a five-building complex with a
million square feet of space in Kendall Square. The complex,
completed in 1975, is currently being renovated and expanded. Ragno
projects $50-a-square-foot rents for the new research and
development space, designed by Sasaki Associates.

PETER TRIPP, 73, POPULAR 1950S DISC JOCKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Mich., Mo., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Tripp, a popular disc jockey in New York in the late 1950s
whose career peaked when he stayed awake for more than eight days
as a stunt, but later plunged when he was found guilty of accepting
thousands of dollars in payola, died Jan. 31 in a hospital in
Northridge, Calif. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a stroke, said Richard W. Fatherley of
Kansas City, Kan., a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's career was indelibly tarnished by the 1960 payola
scandal, in which the better-known Alan Freed and several other
disc jockeys and radio-station employees were indicted on charges
of accepting money from record companies in exchange for playing
their records.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp attracted just as much national attention, though, for his
sleepless promotional gimmick a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 201 hours and 10 minutes awake, much of it sitting in a
glass booth in Times Square, spinning records and bantering into
his microphone three hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   When Tripp began to fall asleep, nurses shook him; doctors joked
with him, played games with him and gave him tests to take. After a
few days, he began to hallucinate, seeing cobwebs, mice, kittens;
looking through drawers for money that wasn't there; insisting that
a technician had dropped a hot electrode into his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   His last 66 hours awake were spent under the influence of drugs
administered by the doctors and scientists observing him. Asked at
the end of his stunt what he wanted the most, Tripp said, not
surprisingly, that he wanted to sleep, which he then did for 13
hours and 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tripp was born on June 11, 1926, in Port Chester, N.Y.,
and started his career in radio at WEXL in Royal Oak, Mich., in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 he moved to KUDL in Kansas City, Mo., where he called
himself the ``Bald Kid in the Third Row,'' based on a remark one of
his parents had made upon spotting him among the infants in the
hospital after he was born.
</P>
<P>
   He later moved to WHB, also in Kansas City, and started the Top
40 format for the station; he rebilled himself as the
``Curly-Headed Kid in the Third Row.'' And in 1955 he got a program
on WMGM in New York called ``Your Hits of the Week.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a golden time for rock 'n' roll disc jockeys, an era when
figures like the Big Bopper often reached greater stardom than the
musicians whose records they played.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a time of quirky publicity-grabbing, like
record-playing marathons and Tripp's staying-awake stunt.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just after he set what was called a world record for
sleeplessness, several other disc jockeys immediately tried to best
him; one of them, Dave Hunter, in Jacksonville, Fla., reportedly
did so less than a week later, going without sleep for 225 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp was indicted a few weeks after his stunt on a charge
that he had accepted $36,050 in payola. He was found guilty of
commercial bribery, fined $500 and given a six-month suspended
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp left WMGM, all but penniless, his lawyer said, and bounced
around the radio business as a journeyman disc jockey, taking spots
at KYA in San Francisco, KGFJ in Los Angeles and WOHO in Toledo,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 Tripp left radio for good, moved back to Los Angeles,
took a national sales-training job with Slim Gym and founded
DynaGym exercise products.
</P>
<P>
   He also freelanced as a motivational writer and speaker and
worked as a stockbroker and in investment marketing. Later he
retired in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who spent his last years in West Hills, Calif., was
married and divorced four times. He is survived by two sons, Peter
Jr. of West Hills and Jeffrey of Levittown, N.Y.; two daughters,
Terri Lanciault of Guilford, N.Y., and Candi Tripp of Holtsville,
N.Y.; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

GEORGE KOLTANOWSKI, 96, EXPERT AT BLINDFOLD CHESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Belgium)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Koltanowski, an international chess master and author who
excelled at beating opponents without looking at the board, died
Feb. 5 in a hospital in San Francisco. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Koltanowski, known as Kolti, won several chess titles in Europe
in the 1920s and '30s but was best known for his skill at blindfold
chess, in which a player never looks at the board but makes his
moves after being told of his opponent's.
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes used a blindfold for stage effect and often played
against more than one nonblindfolded opponent at the same time. In
1937 he defeated 34 players simultaneously without looking at any
of the boards, setting a world record. In 1960 he set another world
record by defeating 56 opponents simultaneously while blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Koltanowski attributed his skill at blindfold chess to memory
games he played as a boy and to what he called ``the gramophone''
in his head. ``I record everything I hear,'' he told The San
Francisco Chronicle, where he was chess columnist for the last 52
years. ``I repeat the moves to myself, and they come back to me,
like in football _ an instant replay.''
</P>
<P>
   Koltanowski was born in Antwerp, Belgium, on Sept. 17, 1903. He
took up chess at the age of 14 and quickly became the champion of
Belgium. He was so good that he gave up his day job as a diamond
cutter to become a full-time professional chess player.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Guatemala when World War II broke out and he remained
in Latin America through much of the war. In 1944 he moved to the
United States, with the aid of a chess-loving American diplomat who
had seen him play in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 he began writing a chess column for The Chronicle, and a
column appeared seven days a week until his death; the more than
19,000 columns were often done in advance, a week's worth at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   He was made an international master by the International Chess
Federation in 1950 and an honorary grandmaster in 1988. He was
president of the U.S. Chess Federation from 1976 to 1978 and was
inducted into its Hall of Fame in 1986. He was the host of radio
and television shows on chess and wrote several books on the game.
</P>
<P>
   Koltanowski is survived by his wife, Leah, who never learned to
play chess and often joked that her husband could not remember to
bring bread home from the grocery.

ED LINN, 77, MAGAZINE WRITER AND AUTHOR OF BASEBALL BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Linn, an author and magazine writer who collaborated with the
maverick baseball owner Bill Veeck on three books and wrote widely
on the Yankees and the Red Sox, died last Monday at his home in
Spring Valley, Calif. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Linn covered the trial of Jack Ruby for The Saturday Evening
Post and worked with the infamous bank robber Willie Sutton on his
autobiography, ``Where the Money Was'' (1976). But he was best
known for sportswriting, having been a contributing editor to Sport
magazine and co-author with Veeck for ``Veeck _ As in Wreck''
(1962), ``The Hustler's Handbook'' (1965) and ``Thirty Tons a Day''
(1972).
</P>
<P>
   Linn also collaborated with Sandy Koufax, Bob Cousy and Leo
Durocher on their autobiographies.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Inside the Yankees: The Championship Season'' (1978),
``Steinbrenner's Yankees'' (1982) and ``The Great Rivalry'' (1991),
an account of the Yankee-Red Sox duels.
</P>
<P>
   The last of his 17 books was the biography ``Hitter: The Life
and Turmoils of Ted Williams'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Edward Allen Linn, a native of Boston, graduated from Boston
University in 1950, then wrote for the Voice of America in
Washington before turning to freelance work.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times in 1986, Linn told of working with
Veeck, the owner of the Indians, Browns and White Sox, on ``Veeck _
As in Wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   After going over the manuscript for the presumed final time, the
pair had ``the only real argument we were ever going to have.''
</P>
<P>
   As Linn remembered it: ``That late in the game, Veeck had
decided that he had given Rogers Hornsby a worse pummeling than an
old guy, long out of baseball, was worth. I accused Bill _ if you
can believe this _ of running scared, and he informed me that it
didn't matter what I thought. `It's my book, and those two pages
are out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, of course, right on both counts. In order to explain
away my temper tantrum before I left the next day, I said, `You
have to understand, Bill, that by this time I think I made you up.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Don't worry about it,' Bill said. `You have to understand
that by this time I think I wrote the book.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the perfect response. From that day on, we understood
each other completely. Meaning that when Veeck got blacklisted from
baseball for turning out such an honest, hard-hitting book, I could
decide whether I wanted to be ashamed of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Linn is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, David of San Diego; a
daughter, Hildy Angius of Spring Valley; a sister, Edith Goldman of
Carmel, Calif.; and two grandchildren.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morris Sosnow, a residential real estate developer on
Long Island, particularly during the post-World War II suburban
boom, died Jan. 15 in Manhasset. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Sosnow and a partner, Leonard Schwartz, founded
Birchwood Park Homes in Mineola, in response to new
government-backed home mortgages, a wave of returning war veterans
and a spate of private financing available for construction.
</P>
<P>
   Birchwood Park built thousands of Cape Cods, split-levels and
ranches, mostly for middle-income buyers, in Long Island towns.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnow, who lived in Kings Point and in Miami Beach, was born on
May 6, 1906, in Kolno, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Kate; three daughters, Bernice
Lieberman of Palm Beach, Fla., Lorraine Aaron of Kings Point and
Sheila Nagler of Piedmont, Calif.; a sister, Henya Joskowitz of
Rehovot, Israel; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

HOUSTON, A STAR AT LAST, TAKES IT IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On occasion, Allan Houston and his wife will pull into the
parking lot of a movie theater. And as Houston unbuckles his seat
belt and gathers his things in the slow, smooth motions of a scuba
diver, Tammy Houston has already hustled to the line, has a ticket
in her hand and is heading for the concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   There is the unhurried Houston, left behind to arrive at the
pace of a happy-go-lucky whistler.
</P>
<P>
   On some nights, Houston and Latrell Sprewell will hit the
Madison Square Garden stage together like the Odd Couple. And as
Houston lofts up jumpers with a cashmere touch, the kinetic
Sprewell will plunge a dunk through the hoop and begin flexing like
Popeye.
</P>
<P>
   There stands the amused Houston, the content wallflower during
his teammate's dunk party.
</P>
<P>
   On television, the faces of Eddie Jones and Ray Allen are
illuminated against a dark background as handpicked commercial
stars for Michael Jordan's shoe line. As Houston, the uncelebrated
Nike endorser, takes note of the national ad, he is at peace with
the perception of his personality, game and lifestyle as more
suburban than street, more poetry than pomp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't _ and I'm glad I'm not the type to do it _ but I don't
look at a Nike commercial to decide where I rank among players in
the league,'' Houston said. ``I think when Jordan and his people
decide who to highlight, I think it has to do with the charisma you
bring to the game. It's not that I don't have it, but Jordan and
his staff are looking at that, looking for something exciting, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this weekend, Houston finds himself in the middle of
the hip and at center stage in the hype. But as much as anyone
worth his crossover move, Houston belongs as an All-Star. Maybe
Madison Avenue hasn't caught on to the guard's understated
elegance, but the coaches who voted for the All-Star team reserves
did.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are the ones who have sent their defenders out to
bump him, harass him, even whack his shooting hand. Still, Houston
scores. And in this way, this most benevolent of players can
inflict unspeakable cruelty on an opponent, as Heat coach Pat Riley
has witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become a superstar, not just an All-Star,'' said Riley,
who watched Houston's deft runner eliminate his team in the first
round of the playoffs last May. ``Anybody can be an All-Star. There
aren't many who can do what he can do. He's just developed and
worked and he's become what he is. He's right there with ... I
can't think of anybody else at the two spot in this game now. The
other guy left.''
</P>
<P>
   That guy was Jordan. But how did this happen? How did the
unassuming shooting guard who was picked No. 11 in the 1993 draft _
behind players like Calbert Cheaney, Bobby Hurley, Rodney Rogers
and Lindsey Hunter _ make such a leap?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the 10 to 15 pounds of muscle he has added, and the
diligence he has shown in his summertime workouts, a lot of his
rise can be attributed to that passive temperament of his. If
Houston had been packing a large ego when he arrived in New York
four years ago, he could not have withstood the isolation behind
John Starks and tough-love approach used by Jeff Van Gundy. If he
had been self-absorbed or insecure about his position on the team,
he would have never accepted the arrival of Sprewell last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of us would have been selfish, it wouldn't have worked
out,'' Houston said. ``Neither one of us had an ego about it. Last
year, there came a point when we were trying to get each other
going. We wanted each other to do well. There could have been a lot
of things that could have ruined it. In New York, you can let a lot
of bad stuff get in your head to make it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston could have prejudged Sprewell. His wholesome
sensibilities could have been offended by Sprewell's past. After
all, Houston's father was a coach. Despite their fundamental
differences _ Houston slips into chapel after his pregame warm-ups
while Sprewell is just slipping into the arena parking lot to make
tipoff _ they are much more similar than the surface indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people look at me as the good guy who doesn't make
mistakes, but I really do,'' Houston said. ``I'm not perfect. And
then I think people don't see the other side of Spree. I see a guy
who is very giving and cares about other people. I see that all the
time. He's not what you might think.''
</P>
<P>
   When Houston was called by a team official on the morning of
Feb. 1 and told he had made the All-Star team, his first thought
was not of himself. The team official said the first words out of
Houston's mouth were: ``What about Latrell, did he make it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell didn't make it, but Houston did. Houston was
disappointed. He wanted to go to Oakland as a group, with his
teammate and his coach. Instead, Van Gundy will be there, and so
will Houston's father, Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just a blessing,'' Houston said. ``This past year has
been a blessing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It began with his runner in Miami and his spectacular Game 6
against Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals. A day later, on
June 12, Houston became the father of a baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed the way I go out and treat the game,'' Houston
said. ``I treat it more like it's fun. I still work as hard but I
don't take it home anymore. In the past, I would. I'd get really
quiet. A bad game would just really put me in that pensive state.
Tammy would try to pull me out of it. I still do my preparation,
but I don't take it home like I used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he just wants to be Daddy when he walks through the front
door. He just wants to plop down on the floor with his 7-month-old
daughter and pull out her PlaySchool piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We taught her how to bang on it, and she starts making these
sounds with her voice,'' Houston said. ``It's amazing, at seven
months, she's putting it together. Tammy, she's humble about it,
but she can sing. And I've been telling Tammy that our little girl
is going to be musically inclined. I said, `Tammy, we've got a
little gospel singer or the next Whitney Houston or something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Houston is at peace, on the court and off it. And yet some
mischief lurks inside him. A week ago, Houston spotted a clear path
to the basket against the Portland Trail Blazers. But as his eyes
opened wide, and his body floated through the paint, he whacked a
sure one-handed dunk off the back of the rim as hard as ax splits a
log.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to make it fun sometimes,'' Houston said. ``But I
know what I am. I know who I am. And I know what I do best. It's
not about making the highlight with a spectacular play. The way I
look at it, it'll all be made up for when and if I have a ring. In
the finals, where there are only two teams playing, that's when
I'll worry about public perceptions. I want to be looked at as a
champion.''

 &HT;    Former NBA player talks of life after drug addiction
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He was a tragic case. An all-star talent with a
self-destructing drug habit. ``The ship be sinking,'' was Micheal
Ray Richardson's most famous quote. He was talking about his team,
the New Jersey Nets. He could have been talking about his life.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is a few weeks from turning 45 now, which is an
accomplishment in itself when considering the path he travelled
during his NBA days in the 1980s. Cocaine addiction cut short his
career in the league, as he was banned for life because of repeated
violations of the drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   More than one concluded that viewing the nightly news would one
day reveal Richardson was found somewhere in a drugged stupor - or
worse. ``I don't even know if I would be living,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he saved his own life by abandoning the States
and playing professionally in Europe. Eleven years later,
Richardson professes to be healthy, wealthy and looking forward to
retirement. Getting to this place, however, was an odyessy that
merits your attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Happened to Micheal Ray?'' is a piercing and
emotional account of the life and wild times of Richardson, a
former New York Knick and New Jersey Net, that airs Wednesday night
at 10 on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's honest,'' Richardson said of the account of his life.
``It's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Isaiah Rider is a handful? Richardson's behavior makes
Rider look like the guy next door who cuts your grass for you just
because it's the neighborly thing to do. Drugs had a firm hold over
Richardson. There was the time in 1985, after remarrying and
signing a multi-million dollar contract that Richardson vanished
for three days following a team Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   Then-coach Dave Wohl found him in a New Jersey hotel room wiped
out, with drug paraphernalia strewn all over the place. There were
many times like that for Richardson, a sad fact that stunted a
career that could have been special. Finally, on Feb. 26, 1986,
Richardson was permanently banned from the NBA after failing
another drug test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs and life just don't mix,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Europe saved his life, he contends. After a year
playing there, he said the Philadelphia 76ers offered him a
one-year contract to return to the NBA. But he wanted two years,
and decided to return to Europe. That was his last NBA opportunity,
which fazes him in the least. He now makes his home in the south of
France. And he claims to have been drug-free for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about (drugs) anymore,'' he said. ``That's
over. I experienced that when I was young. I'm at a different phase
in my life now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Richardson said he plans to enjoy life while every so often
looking back at how far he's come. He and Ray Williams formed one
of the most dynamic backcourts in the league in the early `80s with
the Knicks. But their reckless behavior cut short their glory.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson found it again playing professionally overseas. ``It
helped me a lot, getting out of the environment here,'' he said.
``Out of sight out of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not out of sight now. ``Whatever Happened to Micheal Ray?''
puts him firmly back in the public's mind. Ultimately, it's a
feel-good story because Richardson is alive and healthy and able to
tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people to hear from Micheal Ray,'' he said. ``A lot
of things have been said about me, but I didn't say it. . . I could
have probably played 12 or 13 years in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   He played only six before being barred. ``But when I was
there,'' he said, ``I know I was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Richardson was outstanding. A torrid defender and cunny
playmaker, the 6-4 guard puzzled teams with his ability to slash to
the basket to score or set up teammate or to pull up from long
range.
</P>
<P>
   And he was brash. One night, with the Nets down by three with
three seconds left, Wohl designed a play for Richardson to take a
trey to tie the game and force overtime. After the timeout,
Richardson came over to the press table and sought out a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to hit this (expletive) shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did. That was Richardson; confident and good. Of course, a
month later, he was AWOL from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good career,'' he said. ``There were bumps and bruises
on the way. But I'm still here.''

 &HT;    ADVICE CORNER
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Miami coach Pat Riley coached nine NBA All-Star games,
so many that the league came up with the rule that the same coach
could not participate in consecutive years. Like everything else he
does regarding the game, Riley now says he took it too seriously,
and told his former assistant, Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, to not
make the same mistake as he heads the East squad tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should wear some earrings and try to relate to the
players,'' Riley joked. ``Maybe some tattoos and baggy pants and
shorts and stuff, and get with it. That's what I was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too serious,'' he said. ``I did nine of them. In every
single one of them the players looked at me like, `What's this
about plays and strategy and curfew and all this stuff?' ''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLS SAVED FATHER
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bobby Phills Sr., the father of Charlotte guard Bobby
Phills, who died in a car accident last month, said his son saved
his life on Christmas eve.
</P>
<P>
   The men and the player's daughter went fishing on Lake Norman.
``There was about 3 feet between the dock and the boat,'' the elder
Phills said. ``As I went back on the boat to get (his
granddaughter's) hat, my left foot gave way. I suddenly knew I was
underwater _ completely submerged in 20 feet of very cold water.''
</P>
<P>
   Phills Sr. can't swim, and he said he was certain he would die
in the freezing water. Suddenly, his son pulled him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a miracle,'' Phills Sr. said. ``If it had happened
two minutes earlier, he would have been at the front of the boat
and I would have drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse. Instead of playing the cool role,
as virtually all NBA players do, Stackhouse has been outwardly
joyous about making the All-Star team. It's refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To Utah's Karl Malone. Malone hedged all week about whether he'd
play in today's classic because of a sore back. You'll recall
Malone said he'd never play in another All-Star Game in 1998 after
Kobe Bryant refused a screen he wanted to set. He should have just
stuck to that.

 &HT;    Back-of-the-pack starters winning in Winston Cup
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ When the Winston Cup drivers last fired up
their engines for a race, Bobby Labonte and others made a mockery
of the NASCAR qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last November during the circuit's season finale at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. Labonte, who claimed he had mechanical
problems, was so slow in qualifying that he had to take a
provisional to earn a spot in the 43-car field.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 18 Pontiac started No. 37 in the NAPA 500, but being at
the back of the pack had no effect on Labonte. Over the next
several hours, Labonte carefully weaved his way to the front of the
pack and won the event. It was one of the lowest starting positions
for a race winner in Winston Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte's efforts were just the beginning of a trend for
that race. Tony Stewart, who started at No. 23 and also was held up
41 seconds during an infamous pit stop, took third place. Three
other drivers who started 35th or worse rounded out the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The wacky differences between the starting and finishing
positions, which occured at numerous races last year, appeared to
render qualifying meaningless. To some race teams, it was a
flat-out waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is making the race,'' said No. 55
Chevy driver Kenny Wallace. ``As long as you can make it into the
race, it doesn't really matter where you start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is because these races are so long. We're going 500
miles here at Daytona. We've started from the back in long races
like this and made it all the way to the front, as long as you have
a good car. And we've done the same things at short tracks, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other impressive winners were Jeff Burton, starting 38th at the
Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire and Dale Earnhardt at The Winston
500 (27th starting position) at Talladega and the Goody's 500 in
Bristol (26th).
</P>
<P>
   ``What (Labonte) did in Atlanta was remarkable; it hardly ever
happens like that, where drivers pass just about the entire field
to win,'' claimed Rusty Wallace. ``If you don't qualify well, you
need a long race to make up some of the lost ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Dale Jarrett consistently qualified in the top 10
last year, but never won a pole position. It was a rare
non-achievement a Winston Cup champion. However, Jarrett's
perspective on the importance of qualifying may speak for many in
the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to go out and get a pole (or good qualifying
run), but sometimes that just don't not happen,'' said Jarrett, who
won the circuit's 1999 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the pole wasn't something on our minds a lot
throughout last season. Now you go through the week and try to get
your car in the best condition for qualifying. If it happens, it
does. But it is not something we feel is a huge part of what you
have to do to win the Winston Cup championship. Race day is the
most important day.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Jarrett's crew is more concerned with setting up
the No. 88 Ford Taurus for the race day rather than qualifying.
It's the procedure for many of the top drivers: Mark Martin
finished third in the final standings despite capturing only one
pole; Jeff Burton, who established a notorious reputation for his
erractic qualifying efforts, posted the second-best number of race
wins (6).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried about qualifying, but not to the point where we
are going to make a big deal out of it if we don't do so good,''
Labonte said. ``You know, if we don't sit in the first or second
row on race day, we're not going to be miserable because there is a
lot more to look forward to in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnny Benson, ``You spend a lot of time setting up for
qualifying, then have to spend the entire next day preparing the
car for the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace is a prime performer in qualifying. He had the
fastest times at qualifying for four races. Wallace ended up having
only one win to show _ the spring race at Bristol _ for the four
pole positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qualifyng is not meaningless, but it is a pain,'' Wallace
said. ``It gives your race team a lot of exposure for your race
team when you qualify good. But I think ... it's just another
(NASCAR) procedure we go through that I am not sure why we have to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he has heard garage talk of NASCAR requiring
drivers to use the same engines in the race as they do for
qualifying. There may be better ways of doing the qualifying
competition, but it will alway be needed in some form. For example,
58 cars are trying to earn a spot in the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of good race cars with good team and
good sponsors,'' Dale Earnhardt said. ``It's really a shame someone
has to go home this weekend. It would be just too hard for NASCAR
to start 60 cars in a race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen cars are leaving here early,'' Mike Wallace said.
``That is the worrisome part of this qualifying deal. You've got a
big sponsor and driver that will have their heart and soul in it,
then be disappointed and have to go home.''

 &HT;    Gore attacks Bradley in California convention speech
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Riding a wave of support from Democratic
activists here, Vice President Al Gore on Saturday went for the
jugular in his nomination battle with former New Jersey senator
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to 3,000 Democrats at the state party convention,
Gore assailed Bradley as a disloyal Democrat who abandoned the
party when he left the Senate in 1997. He also accused Bradley of
launching attacks that were based on ``talking points from the
Republican National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Democrats don't aid and abet the Republicans,'' Gore
said. ``Standing together we stay and fight the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also spoke to convention delegates, delivering a
40-minute speech that asked voters to choose between a more timid
leader and one who was committed to the Democratic Party's history
of ``big ideas and big ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates presented starkly different campaign styles
to delegates, and their respective entrances into the convention
hall reflected the degree to which Gore is the strong favorite of
the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley was surrounded by a handful of local elected
leaders and a lone member of Congress, Gore was joined on stage by
almost every major office holder in the state, including Gov. Gray
Davis, who gave Gore a glowing endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stood on stage for a full five minutes before he began
speaking, allowing the cameras to capture him arm in arm with Davis
and Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Still somewhat unknown in California, Bradley devoted a portion
of his remarks to his small-town upbringing in Crystal City, Mo.,
and his conversion to the Democratic Party as a Senate intern
witnessing passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told several jokes, and seemed to stumble over some of
his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, delivered a focused, fiery speech, using some
version of the word ``fight'' dozens of times, and even in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight for you,'' said Gore in a refrain he repeated
over and over. ``I will never give in.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to make polluters pay for pollution, raise the
minimum wage $1 an hour and ``defeat the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   He bragged about the economic success of the 1990s and ridiculed
Bradley for ``running down the Democratic achievements of the past
seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other night senator Bradley attacked the Democratic
Party, demeaning the Democratic Party as in his words, a job
placement bureau,'' Gore said. ``Well, I guess with 20 million new
jobs ... that's pretty good job placement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also responded to Bradley's recent criticisms of Gore for
his involvement in the 1996 fund raising scandals, which Bradley
has said will hurt Democratic chances against the Republicans in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley claims he's doing us a service because he
doesn't want to see Democrats bashed in the fall,'' Gore said.
``His proposed solution is to bash Democrats in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to delegates, Bradley mention Gore by name only
once, referring to him simply as ``Al.'' Bradley outlined three
differences with Gore on policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Gore's health care proposal would insure only seven
million new people, while his would reach 30 million. He said his
proposal for gun control would require the licensing of all of the
nation's 65 million handguns, while Gore proposed to license only
the 2 million new handguns sold every year.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Bradley said his new proposal to require schools
receiving federal money to ensure their teachers are properly
qualified would affect more teachers than what Gore has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, perhaps, Bradley mentioned Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
before he even got around to discussing his differences with Gore.
For the first time, Bradley acknowledged that McCain was attracting
some support from Democrats, a trend that analysts say could be
coming at Bradley's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is moving in the polls, getting some democratic
support,'' Bradley said. ``He's moving because he's standing up for
reform. And if we don't stand up for reform, we have a special
vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Gore by name, Bradley said that Democratic
fund-raising scandals had created a ``crisis of identity'' within
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are expected to be in the pockets of special
interests,'' he said. ``We are not. ... That's why the fundamental
objective here is campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his remarks to delegates, Bradley spoke to about 300
supporters in a conference room adjacent to the San Jose Convention
center complex. Bradley acknowledged that he trailed Gore in the
Golden state, which sends 10 percent of the delegates to the
Democratic convention. The California primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are going to make it up,'' said Bradley, before turning
to a basketball metaphor to describe his predicament. ``I remember
one game we were down by about 19 points with five minutes to go
and we won the game, so we've got plenty of time here in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of his California supporters were less certain. Asked
if Bradley could stage a comeback, Joyce Theios, a convention
delegate and supporter from Sutter Creek, Calif., said, ``I don't
think so. The party is so entrenched.''

EDITORIAL: DANGEROUS PLANS FOR COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Feb. 13:
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is Latin America's most complex and troubled country.
Its two overwhelming problems _ a booming trade in cocaine and
heroin, and a vicious, nearly 40-year-old civil war _ are
intertwined and getting worse. Increasingly they threaten not just
Colombia, but neighboring countries as well, including Venezuela,
one of the largest suppliers of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clinton administration has unveiled a $1.3 billion plan
to help Colombia, including $955 million in security assistance.
Colombia is already the largest recipient of American security aid
after Israel and Egypt. The plan reflects neither a realistic
strategy to fight illegal drugs nor an effective long-term approach
to establish peace and stability. Instead it risks dragging the
United States into a costly counterinsurgency war.
</P>
<P>
   Both the drug trade and Colombia's stability are legitimate
American concerns. The administration and supporters of the plan in
Congress have concluded that the most effective American response
is to increase military assistance and forge a close alliance with
Colombia's armed forces. Washington should have learned long ago
that partnership with an abusive and ineffective Latin American
military rarely produces positive results and often undermines
democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia produces 80 percent of the world's cocaine and about
two-thirds of the heroin consumed in the United States.
Administration officials insist that the security assistance would
be aimed primarily at fighting drug trafficking and not at
counterinsurgency operations against leftist guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   But in many areas of Colombia the distinction is meaningless. In
recent years both the guerrillas and murderous right-wing
paramilitary squads associated with the army have earned millions
of dollars from the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana is well intentioned and deserves
American support. But this plan is overwhelmingly skewed toward a
military approach to problems that for years have stubbornly
resisted military solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should be devoting a far greater share of its support
to the Pastrana government's own admirable efforts to strengthen
civil institutions and address social and economic inequities that
fuel the war and the drug economy. They include reorganizing and
strengthening the judiciary, as well as alternative development
strategies that would help farmers grow conventional crops, like
coffee and cotton, and subsidize the construction of roads and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's security problems cannot be ignored, and there may be
ways for the United States to work with the Pastrana government to
strengthen the Colombian military. But this should be done with
stricter conditions and an emphasis on reforming the armed forces
rather than on equipping them to fight a protracted civil war in
which civilians are the main casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks aimed at a negotiated settlement represent the best
solution to both the drug problem and the war. The Clinton
administration has provided intermittent support for Pastrana's
early efforts to talk peace with guerrilla leaders. He has had
little success thus far. But in recent days key rebel leaders have
signaled a new interest in negotiations, agreeing to meet with
government representatives in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should redouble its support for these talks. Throwing
its weight behind Colombia's military at this stage will only
escalate a war that neither side can win.

BUSH TREATING SOUTH CAROLINA AS A MUST WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite throughout. Deletes reference to $45,000 as the
value of the advertising time abandoned by Forbes.)  
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ In a determined all-out drive to stop Sen.
John McCain from winning the primary here on Saturday, Gov. George
W. Bush's campaign has scrapped its original travel schedule,
bought virtually every extra dollar of broadcast advertising time
still available and expanded its mail and telephone appeals to
300,000 more homes of voters who might be leaning toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The contest in South Carolina has become so consequential that
Bush campaign officials said they added tens of thousands of
dollars to their state advertising budget in the last several days.
In the end, they will have pumped close to $3 million into
advertising in the state, they said, roughly the same amount they
spent in the hard-fought New Hampshire race over a longer stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But the most unusual new move is an appeal to independents and
Democrats, which had not been planned until McCain jolted the Bush
campaign with his landslide in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said that their biggest fear was that those
voters would flock to McCain. The objective of the telephone and
mail program _ on top of an already planned outreach to homes of
300,000 reliable Republican voters _ is to persuade them to back
Bush or, at the very least, discourage them from turning out for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the overtures to moderates, the campaign is pressing its
cause with conservatives. Beginning on Monday, a recorded message
from Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee and a revered figure among anti-abortion groups, will be
telephoned to homes of 100,000 conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts, coupled with a stepped-up drive on Capitol Hill
to keep Bush's congressional supporters on board, reflect a
consensus among the governor's aides that unless he prevails in
South Carolina, his prospects to capture the Republican nomination
will be far more perilous. Several of Bush's advisers said they
were uneasy about their prospects _ yet buoyed by surveys late last
week suggesting that McCain's momentum is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd have won New Hampshire,'' said Warren Tompkins, Bush's
chief strategist in this state, ``McCain would have been gone, so
there wouldn't have been a heck of a lot going on down here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our immediate challenge,'' Tompkins said, ``was to settle
everybody down and overcome the aftershock after New Hampshire.''
Now, he said, ``I don't know what else we can do. We've got people
working in every county. We've got people out doing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the overt changes, like Bush's new emphasis on
depicting himself as the genuine reformer, and his more energetic
style on the stump, the Bush campaign has taken several steps
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's emergence as a threat has forced the Bush operation to
tear up its earlier game plans for winning the nomination. In the
same way that former Sen. Bob Dole mistakenly focused on the
challenge from Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, four years ago, Bush
advisers were preoccupied for more than a year with Steve Forbes
and his hefty war chest, and never seemed particularly worried
about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Bush official said the campaign may have been slow to
react to McCain because ``when the budgeting was done, the doomsday
scenario was Steve Forbes unleashing a huge negative attack that we
had to respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the broadcast time for television commercials in
South Carolina had to be bought in advance, Bush officials said
they grabbed up the leftover advertising time made available by
Forbes' departure from the race last week, bringing to nearly $3
million the sum the campaign is pumping into television and radio
advertising in the state, according to Bush campaign aides.
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials said they were spending closer to $2.5 million
on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of the importance of this state, Bush shelved
his original post-New Hampshire schedule, which called for campaign
trips to California and Arizona, and is campaigning virtually
exclusively in South Carolina. Arizona and Michigan hold their
primaries three days after the voting here. But given the time
constraints, Bush's advisers concluded that the best way for them
to assure success in those states was to emerge triumphant from
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush advisers said they should have reacted more nimbly
to McCain after New Hampshire, and that it was a mistake for Bush
to have appeared here with former Vice President Dan Quayle after
that defeat. The advisers said it undermined the governor's message
that he, not McCain, was the anti-Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake or not, Bush is increasingly campaigning with public
figures from South Carolina. And his aides have spurned requests
from several of Bush's supporters in Congress to campaign in this
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some trepidation about bringing in too many people
from the outside,'' Tompkins said. ``We're trying to use as many
home-grown surrogates as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush's most prominent supporters here, like Tompkins
and former Govs. Carroll Campbell and David Beasley, are keeping
some distance at public events.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to stop McCain and help Bush is not limited to South
Carolina. Late last week, Joe Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager,
held a conference call with many Bush backers in Washington _
including people close to former President Bush _ to explain how
the governor would win South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush lieutenants in Washington, including Haley Barbour,
the lobbyist who headed the Republican Party, and Rep. Rob Portman,
R-Ohio, have reassured the governor's supporters on Capitol Hill
about the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just encourage them to take a deep breath and look at the
results in Delaware,'' Portman said of Bush's triumph last week in
the primary there.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a Bush supporter, said that he,
for one, was worried that Bush ``took for granted that he was going
to win this thing.'' He said of McCain: ``There is some
appreciation that this guy is a war hero and has a clean record.
There are people that are concerned, and logically so, that this is
a big election in South Carolina. If McCain wins, it's going to be
a marathon to the end.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy of the Bush team is to tamp down any
perception in the press and among political professionals that
Bush's eventual emergence as the inevitable nominee is in doubt. As
part of that, the campaign is portraying the governor's victory in
the Delaware primary as a monumental triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief national strategist, went as far as to
cite Bush's victory in the caucuses in Alaska on Jan. 24, which
campaign officials had barely mentioned in the past. ``Bush has won
three and lost one,'' Rove said. ``You should be asking the McCain
campaign if it could sustain a fourth loss out of five.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior Bush official said that while the governor could
endure a defeat here next Saturday, it would be a crippling setback
with the potential to lead major supporters to defect to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be nervous,'' the official said. ``There's not a
soul in this sort of high-pressure contest who doesn't think of all
the scenarios that are possible. The good ones make you feel warm
and fuzzy. The bad ones make you nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to undercut McCain, the Bush campaign has had some
help from independent groups that are running commercials attacking
McCain: the National Right to Life Committee and the National
Smokers Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   While Tompkins insisted that the campaign did not work in tandem
with the outside groups _ which would be illegal _ he said their
advertisements were useful for the cause. ``There are instances
when people run independent expenditures that are not helpful,'' he
said. ``Some of these groups are not very sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long, the McCain campaign has accused the Bush
operation of a major effort at ``push polling,'' in which voters
are told they are being contacted for polls but actually are given
negative information about a candidate. Bush officials insist they
are not making such calls.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign officials said they had stepped up efforts to call
likely voters in this state _ they are now reaching out to as many
as 600,000 households _ to urge them to back Bush, and in some
cases raise questions about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In calls on Friday, people expected to vote were reminded of
Bush's ``strong victory'' in Delaware and told, ``Don't be misled
by McCain's negative campaign tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   While such calls are often effective, the efforts to criticize
an opponent do not always work. One respondent chastised a Bush
caller, telling her: ``I saw an ad yesterday that Bush had on. I
didn't like him saying something back about McCain. To do one
negative against another. To me they both look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another respondent told a Bush caller, ``I like Bush, but I
don't like running people down like that.'' The respondent also
groused that there were no Bush signs in her part of the state. ``I
just don't understand why we haven't got any signs,'' she said. ``I
see McCain's!''

EDITORIAL: A BLOATED TAX CUT FOR MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Feb. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a Republican-sponsored bill last week that
would give a big tax cut to all married couples _ even those who
are benefiting from the existing tax code and not suffering at all
from the so-called ``marriage penalty.'' The GOP points to married
couples who, under the current code, pay more in tax than they
would as two unrelated individuals. That penalty, say the
Republicans, amounts to an unconscionable attack on marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Republicans gloss over is the fact that the tax
code also provides a bonus to many other married couples. Indeed,
over 40 percent of married couples pay less tax than they would as
separate individuals. Yet the GOP bill hands them an additional tax
cut anyway. About half of the total tax reduction would go to
families already enjoying a tax bonus.
</P>
<P>
   This scattershot approach would eventually cost about $30
billion a year _ more than President Clinton proposes to spend on a
drug benefit for Medicare and nearly half as much as Bill Bradley
wants to spend on health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the marriage penalty might seem like an elementary
issue of fairness. But ``marriage neutrality'' is only one
principle at stake. The income tax code also aims to be
progressive, taxing high-income taxpayers at a higher rate than
low-income taxpayers. The code is also designed to achieve
``horizontal equity'' _ imposing the same tax on married couples
with the same total income no matter how the earnings are split
between spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that these three principles of fairness are at
war. As a matter of mathematical logic, no code can achieve all
three. The principles have to be balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The current code, which provides bonuses to almost half of all
married couples, can hardly be labeled anti-marriage. Yet some
families are hurt in undesirable ways that can be remedied without
much damage to the other principles of fair taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The code penalizes families with two earners, especially if the
two spouses earn approximately the same amount. Worse, the code
hits hard at low-income families receiving housing benefits, food
stamps and tax credits. Marriage can push such couples into income
brackets for which the benefits are substantially reduced if not
eliminated. That can discourage single mothers from marrying.
</P>
<P>
   So tax relief for some married couples is warranted. But the
House bill lacks any such focus. It would raise the income at which
all married couples jump from the 15 percent tax bracket to the 28
percent bracket, a move that has the perverse effect of benefiting
the richest third of all families.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also increase the standard deduction for all
married couples. Both provisions would apply to families whether
they now pay a marriage penalty or receive a marriage bonus. The
one provision that does focus on needy families would increase tax
credits for low-income married couples with children. But this tax
cut accounts for a very small part of the total tax reduction under
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, by contrast, would focus on raising the standard
deduction for two-earner families, those who suffer most from the
marriage penalty. Gov. George W. Bush's tax plan provides a
deduction for the earnings, up to a ceiling, of the second spouse.
This too is focused on eliminating a penalty on low- and
moderate-income spouses who work.
</P>
<P>
   None of the proposals takes care of the problem of individuals
who receive housing benefits and food stamps and decide to marry.
But the Clinton and Bush plans rightly focus on the plight of
two-earner families. The House would scatter about $180 billion
over 10 years across all married couples, needy or not. That money
would be far better spent on Medicare, education and even smartly
targeted tax cuts.

EDITORIAL: COMPLETING STERLING FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah) (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Feb. 13:
</P>
<P>
   Two thoughts came to mind when Gov. George Pataki announced last
week that nearly all the money had been found to complete the
purchase of Sterling Forest, some 19,000 acres of unspoiled
woodlands, streams and lakes 40 miles northwest of New York City
that were very nearly lost to residential and commercial
development. One was that the citizens who supported the cause of
Sterling Forest deserve great credit for sticking with an endlessly
frustrating project over the years. The second was that there must
be an easier way of doing business. This saga would have been
concluded much more expeditiously had Congress honored a promise
made back in the Johnson administration to provide a reliable
annual stream of money for open space acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The fight to raise the $65 million or so necessary to buy the
land from a Swiss company _ Pataki's announcement involved only the
$9 million needed to buy the final 2,200 acres _ began back in the
1980s and eventually engaged the governors of New York and New
Jersey, the U.S. Congress, the federal Forest Service, various
quasi-public commissions, at least 20 private foundations and
hundreds of individual donors.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chunks of money were $13 million raised by two
nonprofit groups, the Open Space Institute and the Trust for Public
Land, $16 million from New York state and $17.5 million from
Congress. The congressional contribution, the linchpin of the deal,
was the hardest to get because Western Republicans kept holding it
hostage to all manner of truly awful legislation. In one case, the
Utah delegation attached the Sterling Forest authorization to a
bill that would have denied wilderness protection to millions of
acres of public land in Utah. With the help of a political odd
couple, Bill Bradley in the Senate and Newt Gingrich in the House,
Sterling Forest was de-linked from this and other
anti-environmental bills and the authorization was eventually
passed as a freestanding measure.
</P>
<P>
   Most public land purchases involve a certain amount of scurrying
around for bits and pieces of money. But preserving Sterling Forest
would have been easier if Congress had been fully financing the
federal Land and Water Conservation Fund. As originally conceived,
the fund, which is supported by a tax on offshore oil, was to
provide about $350 million a year for federal land purchases and a
like amount for open space purchases by the states. In most years,
Congress has provided less than half the money for federal projects
and almost none for the states.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton intends to remedy this. His new budget would
provide nearly $250 million that could be tapped by the states for
projects like Sterling Forest. Congress should approve this request
to make up for its longstanding indifference.

LEETCH HAS RETURNED TO FIND A TEAM TRANSFORMED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After missing 11 weeks and 32 games with a broken
right forearm, Brian Leetch returned to the New York Rangers'
lineup last week. After a 5-2 thrashing of the Boston Bruins at
Madison Square Garden on Friday night, Leetch was asked if it felt
as if he had returned to the same team he had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``it really doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just because the Rangers would qualify for the
postseason for the first time in three years if the season ended
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four guys here now that I haven't really played
with,'' Leetch said, citing Valery Kamensky, Alexandre Daigle,
Radek Dvorak and Rich Pilon. Kamensky was a free-agent signing, but
he missed 23 of the Rangers' first 32 games with a stress fracture
in his right forearm. Daigle, Dvorak and Pilon were all added this
season by Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Daigle was obtained from Tampa Bay on Oct. 3 for future
considerations (in other words, basically for nothing), but he was
not recalled from the minor league Hartford affiliate until Nov.
19. Pilon was claimed off waivers from the Islanders on Dec. 1.
Dvorak was obtained from Florida in a three-way deal on Dec. 30
that sent Todd Harvey to San Jose and Mike Vernon to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The insertions of Dvorak, Kamensky and Daigle into the lineup
have helped transform the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a lot of speed,'' said Leetch, the team captain.
And that speed has helped the Rangers turn their season around.
</P>
<P>
   When Leetch went down, the Rangers were six games under .500.
The night they claimed Pilon, the Rangers fell to seven games under
.500. And many felt that both Smith and coach John Muckler were in
danger of losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief spurt in December pulled the Rangers to within
three games of .500, a streak of seven games without a victory
dropped them back to seven games under .500, tying their season
worst. On the morning of Jan. 4, the Rangers were 12-19-7 with
three regulation ties and going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the Rangers are 12-5-1, the streak not
coincidentally beginning when Muckler formed the Czech Connection
line of Petr Nedved centering Jan Hlavac and Dvorak. For the
season, the Rangers are now 24-24-8 with three regulation ties.
With 59 points, the Rangers were seventh in the Eastern Conference
after Friday night's game. In other words, with 26 games left in
their season, a playoff spot was the Rangers' to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday night, Smith was asked if his current roster was the
best lineup the Rangers have dressed since they last qualified for
the playoffs in the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our fastest lineup,'' Smith said, after some thought.
``It's our most skilled lineup.'' Those responses came after Smith
had asked a question of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it our youngest lineup?'' Smith asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, is no. This
season's Rangers (who had an average age of 29.4 years for Friday's
game) have on average been older than last season's, but younger
than the team Smith assembled two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that the team's better players this season
have been younger, so the team seems younger. Dvorak is 22; Hlavac
is 23; Nedved is 28. Since Muckler formed the Czech line, Nedved
has had two hat tricks, Dvorak one and Hlavac one _ the first hat
trick of his fledgling NHL career, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great skaters,'' Muckler said. ``They could be as
good as they want to be. I hope it continues. It's something we're
going to need to get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Smith, Muckler did not hesitate when he was asked if the
Rangers' current lineup is the best Muckler has had to work with
since he became the Rangers' head coach on Feb. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Muckler said. ``With Val in the lineup, with
Devo in the lineup, with Leetchie coming back, that's three pretty
good additions. That gives us an abundance of speed. And it's
changed our options, it's changed the things we can do. In the
first period'' _ Friday night _ ``we moved the puck as well as
we've moved it all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Mike Richter agreed. ``The big thing we have going
for us now is we have more speed,'' Richter said. ``That alone
really opens up everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter and Leetch have the most tenure on the Rangers. They
know better than anyone else how difficult the last two seasons
have been. But you could sense some optimism exuding from Leetch
late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team definitely has the most offense,'' the
offensive-minded Leetch said when asked to compare and contrast the
last three seasons. ``It creates the most scoring chances. And
that's been our biggest problem. We've had to grind it out the last
two seasons. We've had to rely on Mike and on our special teams to
win close games.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Friday, when the Rangers overcame a lackluster second period
to blow out the Bruins on skill alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get some goals,'' Leetch said.
</P>
<P>
   He could have added: for a change. &QL;

`PUSH-POLLING' THROWS MCCAIN OFF TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ He is trying to get beyond it, but so far, it
just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Stuggling to regain his focus after last week's advertising war,
and to reinvigorate the outsider image that brought him success in
New Hampshire, Senator John McCain did some old-fashioned door
knocking in a quaint Florence neighborhood Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But when McCain, trailed by a legion of garden-trampling
reporters, knocked on his first door, the owner had discomfiting
news: Someone had called him on the pretext of doing a poll but let
loose with attacks on the Arizona senator instead.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest episode of ``push-polling,'' in which a
caller acts as if he were conducting a poll, but instead pushes his
message or candidate. Sniping over the issue with George W. Bush
has been dominating McCain's days, drowning out his policy comments
and detracting from his effort to appear as a new kind of
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the debate about education, about
telecommunications, about Medicare, about Social Security? Whatever
happened to that?'' a frustrated McCain said aboard his bus. ``I'm
the one who gave the policy speeches last week. I'm not attacking
him. I spend my time responding to the daily Bush talking points.''
</P>
<P>
   And when McCain got off his bus at his next stop, the Darlington
Raceway, resident Ed Cheek was waiting to tell him that he, too,
had been push-polled. Three days ago, somebody had called to tell
him McCain was too much like President Clinton. Cheek said he had
called Bush's Columbia, S.C., campaign office to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has flatly denied that his campaign has engaged in any
push-polling, and at a news conference Saturday in Orangeburg,
S.C., Bush said his supporters also had been victims of underhanded
telephone tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Callers posing as Bush campaign workers had been rude to voters
in an attempt to turn them off the candidate, the Texas governor
said. He said callers had cursed at residents, and left a number
for Bush's Virginia campaign office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any accusations whatsoever,'' Bush said, when
asked who he thought might be responsible. ``I just know it's not
someone for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the campaign was trying to trace the calls and to
convince those who had received them to notify the media. ``We are
on full alert,'' he said. ``This is not helping my campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Todd Harris scoffed at the idea that his
campaign could be connected to such calls. ``Unlike the Bush
campaign, we have to operate within the federal limits,'' he said.
``We don't have the money to hire armies of phone bankers to make
calls like that, nor would we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   While the charges and countercharges are exchanged, the dispute
is threatening to put McCain off stride.
</P>
<P>
   During the Darlington town hall meeting, which was held in a
tent by the raceway and attended by 200 people, a much smaller
crowd than he usually draws, McCain was distracted, and for most of
the time, lacked his usual energy. However, that returned to him
later in the day, when he appeared before a fervent crowd of 1,200
in Fort Mill.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the issue arose when a 20-year-old woman began to cry as
she told of being push-polled last Thursday. She ended by saying,
``I just want to say I believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the campaign bus, McCain accused Bush of launching
attacks because ``He's lost the battle of the major issues.'' He
said Bush's strategy lately had been simply to imitate him. ``The
next thing you know, he'll be moving to Arizona,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides have accused McCain of feigning moral outrage over
negative campaigning to distract the public from inconsistencies
between his words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get his campaign back on track, McCain on Friday
withdrew his most aggressive televison ad, which accused Bush of
``(twisting) the truth like Clinton,'' and said he hoped his
opponent would do likewise. The Bush campaign denied that its ads
were out of bounds and refuses to alter them.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he realizes that running only positive
advertisements from now on could cost him politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rolling the dice,'' he said. ``But at the end of this
campaign, I'm very interested, and committed, to having my kids
proud of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has often said he fears the sniping will turn off voters.
But on Brunwood Drive, where McCain took his huge entourage door to
door, at least two voters were unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll let his warts show,'' said Steven Coker, 36. ``He's not
afraid to voice his opinion. He wants to do what he feels is right.
I think we need a veteran in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see a little street fight from time to time,'' said
his brother, Chris Coker, also of Darlington. ``Let's see what
these guys are made of.''

GORE TAKES SPOTLIGHT AT CALIF. CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ It was officially an open party, but for Bill
Bradley, the Democratic presidential candidate, it appeared that
the guest of honor had already been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was clearly the star at the California
Democratic Party's state convention Saturday, even before he
delivered his shots against Bradley, calling him pessimistic and a
quitter.
</P>
<P>
   At what is typically a somewhat rowdy affair, Bradley chose to
play the role of distinguished statesman. The former New Jersey
senator, who has been delivering blistering attacks on Gore's
candidness and commitment on such key issues as abortion rights and
gun control, kept his criticism of Gore muted in his address to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a difference here in boldness,'' Bradley said, saying
that his proposals on health care, handgun control, and education
were more sweeping, and by extension, more traditionally
Democratic, than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, seeming more energized than in past speeches, said the
country should seize this period of ``unprecedented prosperity'' to
eliminate child poverty, establish comprehensive health care
coverage, and improve education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not settle. Democrats don't settle,'' Bradley told the
crowd of thousands, receiving polite applause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, after stepping up to the podium to the blaring
sound of ``Love Train,'' unleashed an assault on Bradley as a man
who abandoned the Democrats when the going got tough. Bradley
retired from the Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley seems to suffer from a kind of
Demo-pessimism,'' Gore said. ``Senator Bradley gave up too soon. We
stayed and fought.''
</P>
<P>
   After saying, ``I have never attacked Bill Bradley personally,''
a phrase that brought a derisive chuckle from Bradley supporters in
the audience, Gore went on to call Bradley a quitter several times.
The vice president also took on Bradley's suggestion that Gore is
not a ``real Democrat,'' accusing Bradley of being positively
Republican in his campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real Democrat is not the one who takes his talking points
from the Republican National Committee,'' Gore said. ``Real
Democrats don't aid and abet Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never give up. I'll never give in,'' Gore said as his
supporters waved blue-and-white Gore signs. ``I'll never quit and
I'll never walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also spoke several lines of elementary Spanish, finishing
with, ``Si, se puede!'' (Yes, it can be done.) Latin supporters
flipped signs that said ``Gore 2000'' one one side, and ``Viva
Gore'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appealed to Democrats' desire to win in November,
suggesting that Gore's record on campaign finance reform _
particularly his acceptance of campaign contributions from a
Buddhist temple event in California _ would make the vice president
less electable.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican saide, the success of Senator John McCain
against the well-financed Texas governor, George W. Bush, indicates
the mood of the public, Bradley said. McCain ``is moving because he
is standing up for reform,'' Bradley said, ``and if we don't stand
up for reform, we have a special vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Bradley renewed his attack on Gore, citing the
administration's appointment of Bradley Smith to the Federal
Election Commission. Smith has expressed opposition to overhauling
the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's exhortations, however respectfully received by the
audience, didn't appear to sway Gore's support among the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters were overwhelmed by legions of Gore loyalists
in the crowd of 3,000. Before and after Bradley's speech, a parade
of state Democratic leaders rallied the crowd for Gore, including
Governor Gray Davis and Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats are ``a lot more pragmatic now'' than they
were 20 years ago, said Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the
California Democratic Party, and are more likely to be won over by
Gore's incremental approach to policy. Bradley would probably have
been the choice 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has trailed by more than 25 points in some opinion polls
in the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   But at a rally before the event, Bradley drew on his basketball
career as he sought to put a bright face on his poll numbers. ``I
remember once we were behind by 19 points with five minutes to go
and we won the game,'' Bradley told about 250 supporters, recalling
a game he played with the New York Knicks. ``So we have plenty of
time here in California.''

 UNDATED: their suspicions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not until 1976 that the State Department took a critical
look at the killings. The move was prompted by a disaffected
Chilean intelligence officer, Rafael Gonzalez, who told reporters
that he had witnessed Horman being held prisoner by Chile's chief
of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez quoted the intelligence chief as saying that Horman
``had to disappear'' because he ``knew too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also described a ``cozy relationship'' between U.S. and
Chilean intelligence services to destabilize the Allende
government, and said that American operatives had even given their
Chilean counterparts lists of suspected leftists to be rounded up
in the first days of a military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   (In its hearings, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
found that the CIA had in fact compiled arrest lists, but said it
had no evidence they were passed to the Chileans. Those lists are
among the documents the CIA has not released.)
</P>
<P>
   Facing pressure from Congress, the State Department ordered two
internal reviews in 1976. The first, completed in August, was
carried out by Rudy V. Fimbres, regional director for Bolivia and
Chile in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. The second was
conducted by Frederick Smith, a State Department lawyer, in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were permitted to examine only documents
either publicly released or already available in the State
Department. Their reviews appeared to confirm doubts and
inconsistencies that American newspapers had already reported but
that State Department officials had repeatedly discredited.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed that an embassy official had received a tip
that Horman had already been killed before his father arrived in
Chile. That tip was not followed up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, embassy officials told Edmund Horman that leftists may
have kidnapped his son, contradicting their own cables home, which
quoted neighbors who said they had witnessed Chilean security
forces taking Horman away.
</P>
<P>
   The internal reviews also questioned the time of Horman's death,
saying there was no reason to accept the Chilean government's
assertion that he died just before the U.S. Embassy learned of his
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet government had ignored numerous requests from the
United States for an autopsy report on Horman, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   One review asked why Davis, who had driven Horman and Simon to
Santiago, had taken their registration card from the hotel where
they were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Davis at first denied that he had taken the card, but changed
his mind when read a passage from a letter he wrote to one of the
investigators, now among the declassified documents, mentioning the
registration card. ``I don't see why it's important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Horman family believes the card was given to the Chilean
military, and tipped it off to the new address of the Hormans, who
had moved just a few days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we have,'' the first inquiry concluded, ``we are
persuaded that the government of Chile sought Horman and felt
threatened enough to order his immediate execution. The government
of Chile might have believed this American could be killed without
negative fallout from the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said that there was ``circumstantial evidence'' that
the CIA ``may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death,''
as well as Teruggi's. It also said that the State Department had
the ``responsibility'' to refute baseless allegations and ``to
proceed against U.S. officials if this is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The second investigation, completed a month before Gerald Ford's
presidency ended, drew a similar conclusion. It blamed the Chilean
government for both deaths and said it was ``difficult to believe''
that the Pinochet government would have carried out the killings
absent some signal, perhaps even an inadvertent one, that the
deaths would not cause ``substantial adverse consequences'' in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, to Harry W. Shlaudeman, the assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, recommended interviewing
Gonzalez, the disaffected Chilean intelligence officer, again and
going back to the CIA for a full accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an explanation exists,'' a memo in the investigation said,
``it does not appear in the files and must be sought elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But both inquiries appear to have ended there. Shlaudeman
himself recommended interrogating Gonzalez further, even submitting
a detailed list of questions for the purpose that the CIA was
allowed to review. But he dismissed the call for investigating the
actions of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed recently, Shlaudeman said that he remembered little
about the issue. ``A lot of things have happened since then,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until jarred loose by Pinochet's arrest in London in October
1998, these reports remained largely hidden from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, State Department officials debated how much of the
documents to show the Horman family, which was then suing the U.S.
government for ``wrongful death,'' a case that was dismissed
``without prejudice,'' meaning that it could be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   One official, Frank McNeil, then deputy assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, urged the department to err on
the side of greater disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classification should not be used to prevent embarrassment of
government agencies or officials, which would be the principal
reason for withholding when one gets down to the bone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the documents released to the Hormans omitted large
swaths of material on the grounds of national security and
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that executive privilege protects the president's
deliberations with his advisers, in this instance, Henry Kissinger,
who served presidents Nixon and Ford as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said that he had never seen the documents or the
recommendations, and that he was out of the country much of the
time. ``It's very easy, 30 years after the event, to be so heroic
and to create the impression that one had nothing else to do except
follow one particular case,'' he said. ``If it were brought to my
attention, I would have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres himself, who is now retired, said recently that he was
not surprised at the State Department's apparent failure to pursue
the investigation further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this easily goes into the black hole,'' he
explained. ``And everybody watches it go down.''

 &HT;    Who's the NBA's best?
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For so long, the consensus was unanimous: Michael
Jordan reigned, without challenge, as the NBA's best player. It's
also been pretty well established that Jordan is irreplaceable, as
a talent, gate attraction and winner. But as the league moves
forward in the two seasons since his retirement, a new debate
rages: Who's the best player in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are many, and so the answers vary depending on
who is speaking. And when.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be anybody on a particular week,'' Milwaukee's Glenn
Robinson said. ``One week it could be Allen Iverson. Another week
Ray Allen. Another week Shaquille (O'Neal). It's just not that
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan, Gary Payton and
Jason Kidd, Grant Hill and Chris Webber. Getting the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you put a finger on it?'' Charlotte all-star guard Eddie
Jones said. ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   A canvassing of several participants in today's 39th NBA
All-Star Game at the Arena in Oakland did not reveal a ``best
player.'' But it did reveal a ``most dominant,'' which comes in the
form of 7-foot-1, 315-pound O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team needs a Shaquille O'Neal, a big man,'' Robinson
said, ``and he's the best. You can only foul him. Otherwise, it's
his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, the Suns' brilliant point guard, faced O'Neal last week
and came away thoroughly impressed. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played against Shaq the other night, and, gosh,'' Kidd
said. ``He's incredible. He can dominate any night. We're men, but
he makes it like men against boys. He's just so much stronger than
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Indiana power forward Dale Davis: ``I don't know about a
best player in the league. But I know the most dominant is Shaq,''
Davis said. ``He really has come out this year. He's stronger,
that's for sure, and playing in a forceful way that no one can
really handle. Not one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's size and strength are not the only elements that make
him virtually unstoppable. His agility, remarkable ability to get
up the court for a man his size and the development of an array of
inside post maneuvers have elevated him to a plateau many believe
is slightly above his peers.
</P>
<P>
   However, he will not pin the ``best player'' tag on his massive
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's the best player in the NBA, O'Neal said: ``No. The
way the system is set up, I don't get to show all my skills. Am I
the most dominant? Yes. The way the system is, Tim Duncan can show
all he's got, Jason Williams can show all he's got because the
system allows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't (because of where he plays on the floor). That's a
shame, but it's OK. I'm the most dominant player and I'd rather be
that then the best.''
</P>
<P>
   And while O'Neal generally is regarded as the player who is most
valuable to his team _ ``If I played with that guy,'' Iverson said,
``there's no way we'd lose a seven-game series to anybody'' _
different people rank others on that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Gary Payton,'' former Boston Celtic great K.C. Jones
said. ``He's a phenom. He'll defend with the best of them. He'll
get nine rebounds and 13 assists and still get 25 points. Most
great offensive players are not that committed on the defensive
end. But Gary Payton will play both ends great. Michael Jordan was
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Magic Johnson revolutionized the game. They were
solid ballhandlers whose strengths were as much mental as it was
physical. It will be some time before others are compared with
those multiple-championship winners. But Garnett and Duncan already
possess the physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like me and Tim Duncan transcend what traditional
7-footers do,'' Garnett said. ``We've shown that you don't have to
be just a post-up player. You can be a perimeter player, be mobile,
get out on the break, take guys off the dribble. We can do it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's any one answer to the question,'' the
Hawks' Dikembe Mutombo said. ``There are so many best players in
the league right now. In the East, you have Alonzo Mourning and
Allen Iverson. In the West, you have Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin
Garnett. But if I had to choose one, I would say this year it's
Alonzo Mourning. I'm very proud of what he's doing on a daily
basis. He's scoring, rebounding, blocking shots. And his team is
winning. I think when all is said and done, you have to look at the
great player and what his team is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Iverson was ripped by many former players who
said his game was selfish and out of control. Tonight, he starts in
his first All-Star Game. ``I never looked at it like others did,''
Utah great John Stockton said. ``I make my own judgments. And all I
know is this: From playing against him, Allen Iverson is a good
competitor and a heck of a player. People can say what they want,
but you cannot take that away from him. He deserves his due. He's
one of the best players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many in that category, which makes labeling the best
that much harder. ``So many guys bring so much,'' Kidd said.
``Iverson plays with speed, Vince Carter plays above the rim, Gary
Payton does it with defense. Shaq has power. Kobe (Bryant) slashes.
Garnett and Duncan can post you up and go outside. (There's) just
so much talent out there right now.''

 &HT;    Woods hoping for his seventh consecutive win at the Buick
Invitational
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ OK, maybe it's a little early to beef up the
security for Riviera Country Club, site of next week's Nissan Open.
Maybe it's a bit premature to sweep out all of the celebrities from
the clubhouse or add a few truckloads of extra sushi.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger Woods Streakmobile still could be pulling into the Los
Angeles area Monday, all fueled up and on the move. While Woods
didn't storm to the absolute top of the Buick Invitational
leaderboard Saturday at Torrey Pines Golf Course, after a 5-under
par 67, he's within striking range for today's final round, tied
for fourth and six shots behind leader Phil Mickelson, in his quest
for a seventh straight PGA Tour win.
</P>
<P>
   What's that? Six shots back and still in range? Hey, you tell
the guy he can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, the tendency would be to expect a successful
close from Mickelson, a San Diego native and the 1993 champion,
despite a 1999 Sunday scoring average (72.5) that ranked 134th on
tour. But these aren't normal times. It's a time when Woods, who is
trying to match Byron Nelson's 11 straight wins, can come from
behind with one foot in the parking lot. After erasing a seven-shot
deficit in seven holes at Pebble Beach last Monday, truly anything
is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Do you expect to win (Sunday), Tiger?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh,'' he said. ``I'm going to try. We'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Will you be more disappointed than ever if you don't win?
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh-uh, huh-uh,'' Woods said. ``That's just the way it is
sometimes. You give it everything you have, and there's no regrets.
If I went out there tomorrow without the determination or the fire
and lost, yeah, I would be disappointed in myself and kicking
myself, but that's not the way I play . .I play for the thrill of
it, the chance. You play for three and a half days to give yourself
a chance on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who shared the lead after 36 holes, broke out
Saturday with a 67 to move to 16-under 200 and set up a splendid
final-round scenario. Without a victory in 1999, he'd enjoy nothing
better than to end Woods' streak in his own backyard. Also winless
last year was Sea Island's Davis Love III, who had a 69 and is at
11-under one ahead of Woods and five behind Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Shigeki Maryuma is at 14-under, two shots behind
Mickelson. Jeff Sluman and Fred Couples are at 10-under, tied with
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Woods' comeback miracle at Pebble Beach,
Mickelson suggested, ``I think he's going to have to do something
pretty extraordinary. Obviously, you don't want to rule anything
out, but if I go out and play a solid round, I'm going to be in a
position to force him to shoot a ridiculously low round, like 10 or
11 under.''
</P>
<P>
   With any amount of putting success Saturday, Woods could have
been four or five shots better on the board. He power-lipped an
eagle try at the par-5 13th. He rammed a 10-footer for birdie by
the hole at the 18th. But that's the way things can go on Southern
California's spongy, poa annua greens, where the ball doesn't roll
as smoothly as on bentgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Highly ``disappointed'' with his performance on the greens,
though pleased with his technique, Woods frequently muttered
unprintables to himself and slammed down his putter.
</P>
<P>
   ``God almighty,'' he said, ``it was just one of those days when
I didn't make any putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the leaderboard changed a bit from when Woods finished
_ he was only two back at the time _ he said, ``I'm right in the
ballgame....There's not too many guys to pass, anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the hoopla connected with The Streak, Woods is the most
cool and collected of anyone. Asked if he's more nervous than
normally, he said, ``To tell you the truth, I'm actually more calm
now....I think it's just because I've dealt with it before. This
doesn't compare to the way it was in `97.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Love had Mickelson far more prominently on his
mind than Woods, recent history notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be a little closer to Phil,'' Love said. ``He's
going to be hard to beat.''

RUSSIA AGREES ON A PLAN FOR REPAYING SOME OF DEBT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia has reached an agreement with foreign commercial
creditors to restructure $31.8 billion of its external debt,
handing acting President Vladimir Putin an important political
victory and helping to clear the way for the country to tap
international money markets again.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was effectively barred from borrowing overseas after the
August 1998 economic crisis, when it defaulted on domestic treasury
bills and stopped making payments on its debts to foreign banks and
governments. Over the last 18 months, Russia has met with
representatives of the London Club of commercial creditors, a loose
affiliation of banks and investors, to draw up a repayment schedule
to ease Russia's debt burden and to restore its image.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Friday evening in Frankfurt by
creditors' representatives and First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov of Russia, would basically write off about half of
Russia's foreign commercial debt, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While its terms are slightly worse than those originally sought
by Russia, the deal should enhance Putin's standing with
businesspeople and politicians at home and abroad ahead of the
March 26 presidential election. Putin is expected to win handily,
but to foreigners wary of his past in the KGB, he still has to
prove he can right Russia's muddled economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal shows that Putin wants to move forward on some
things, that he wants to show some accomplishment before the
elections,'' said Peter Halloran, president of the Pharos Fund,
which manages about $75 million in investments in Russia. ``Through
this, he's saying that while the previous administration may have
left things broken, he can fix things, that he's different from the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were also a test for Kasyanov, the finance
minister who has been functioning essentially as Putin's prime
minister. Putin has hinted that should he win the March election,
Kasyanov might become prime minister. The agreement Friday seems
likely to bolster Kasyanov's standing both with the acting
president and parliament, which must approve any prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Russia will resume talks with foreign
governments, grouped together as the Paris Club, to which the
country owes about $42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Russia's debt _ much of it stemming from the
Soviet era _ needs to be restructured at all is something of a
puzzle. Some Russian politicians have called the deal a disgrace,
noting that a country with superpower pretensions should not be
pleading poverty. More important, Russia, according to key economic
indicators, should have the money to meet its debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's revenues come from the export of natural
resources, especially oil, the price of which is nearing an
unprecedented $30 a barrel. The cost of producing a barrel of oil
in Russia, about $7, is among the lowest in the world. The
government should therefore be reaping high taxes from the profits
of Russian oil companies. In fact, the state has a huge trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But successive Russian governments have watched money slip away
in capital flight. Companies have multitudinous schemes for
stashing income overseas. Finance Ministry economists recently
estimated that capital flight totaled about $25 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To combat capital flight, Russia would need to drastically
reform, especially taxes and customs, steps the government has been
unwilling to take for fear of upsetting interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Blitzer, chief international economist for the brokerage
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said, ``This isn't so much a question
of ability to pay as willingness to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Although London Club creditors were aware of Russia's potential
wealth, they were apparently ready to make a deal now rather than
risk further deferral of payments or worse terms. ``They probably
figured that half a loaf is better than no loaf,'' Blitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement returns to Russia a measure of credibility among
foreign investors. ``This is a big step to bringing Russia back
into the fold,'' said David Herne, portfolio manager for Morley
Investments, an equity fund active in Russia. ``People are looking
for a reason to invest in Russia now. It's partly driven by the way
other markets look and partly because Putin is providing some
stable leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, $22.2 billion in Soviet-era debt and $6.8
billion in Russian state debt will be exchanged for new 30-year
Russian Federation Eurobonds. But the new bonds for Soviet debt
will be offered at a 37.5 percent discount, and the Russian debt at
a 33 percent discount. In other words, rather than getting 100
percent of the value of the Soviet debt, for instance, creditors
will get 62.5 percent.

GOVERNMENT EDICT SEEKS HOME CARE FOR MANY DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following up on a Supreme Court decision, the
Clinton administration has told states to evaluate hundreds of
thousands of people in nursing homes, mental hospitals and state
institutions to see whether they could be receiving care in their
own homes or elsewhere in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy statement with far-reaching implications, the
administration has informed states that to comply with the court
ruling they will almost certainly have to provide more medical and
social services and shift more people out of institutions and into
small group homes or apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``No person should have to live in a nursing home or other
institution if he or she can live in his or her community,'' Donna
Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said in a
letter sent last month to all governors. Moreover, she said,
``unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities
is discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act.''
</P>
<P>
   People with disabilities welcomed the administration's action,
saying it would help them enforce their rights. But state officials
said the federal policy went beyond the court ruling and could
impose substantial new costs on states.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials said that compliance would cost tens of
millions of dollars in individual states and could cost over $2
billion a year nationwide. Federal officials said they had no
immediate estimate of how much it would cost states to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has some power to force states to comply
with its new instructions, both because the states are required to
meet federal standards as a condition of receiving Medicaid money
and because the federal government enforces the Americans With
Disabilities Act. But officials said they would prefer that the
states cooperate in developing acceptable practices.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave institutions to live in the community often
need housing assistance, job training, medical care and personal
attendants to help them with everyday activities. Many people spend
years in institutions  these kinds of services are not
available in less restrictive settings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they wanted to know about any disabled
person being unnecessarily confined to an institution, and they
promised to investigate every complaint. They said they had
received 43 complaints from people in 20 states. But the number of
people eventually affected by the policy would be vastly greater.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court case, Olmstead vs. L.C., involved two Georgia
women, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, who had been confined to a
state institution for years, even though doctors had said they
could receive appropriate care for their conditions _ mental
retardation and mental illnesses _ in their community.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 decision last June, the court said, ``States are
required to provide community-based treatment for persons with
mental disabilities when the state's treatment professionals
determine that such placement is appropriate,'' considering a
state's resources and the needs of other people with mental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials contend that the ruling applies to people of
all ages with all types of disabilities in all institutions and all
state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Auberger, a co-founder of Adapt, an advocacy group
for disabled people, said state officials ``see the Olmstead
decision as potentially busting the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   William Waldman, who represents state officials as executive
director of the American Public Human Services Association, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling has deep and profound implications for all
states,'' Waldman said. ``It affects not only people in state
psychiatric hospitals and centers for the mentally retarded, but
also people in nursing homes and children in institutions who want
to live somewhere else. States can redirect spending from
institutions to community services. But very likely there will also
be new expenses for states.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration policy, combined with the Supreme
Court decision, is likely to lead to tangible changes in the lives
of people with disabilities. Even before the court decision, state
officials had been moving fitfully to increase community-based
care, but the wait for such services exceeds eight years in some
states.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal policy ``will force states to step up the
pace,'' said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy
at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   In its letters to state officials, the Clinton administration
made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Supreme Court ruling applies not just to people with
mental impairments but also to those with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ruling applies not just to people in state institutions
but also to Medicaid recipients in private nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ruling applies not only to people in institutions but also
to people who are living at home and might have to enter an
institution if they do not receive proper services.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration told states it expected them to
evaluate ``all individuals with disabilities in institutional
settings (such as state institutions, intermediate care facilities
for the mentally retarded, nursing facilities, psychiatric
hospitals and residential service facilities for children)'' to see
if their needs could be met in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Roger M. Auerbach, a senior official at the Oregon Department of
Human Services, said he was ``surprised at the broad interpretation
that the federal government has given to the Olmstead decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, a lawyer who is vice chairman of the National
Association of State Medicaid Directors, said, ``In a huge majority
of cases, serving people in the community is much less expensive
than serving the same people in an institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Clinton administration's reading of the law
could increase costs overall because it could require states to
serve a larger population, including disabled people in their
communities who have not received services they need.
</P>
<P>
   Ira A. Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental
Health Law, an advocacy group, said states should not be allowed to
``claim poverty'' as an excuse for not providing community care,
but should try to get more money from Medicaid, state legislatures
and other sources.

</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision has prompted advocates for the
disabled to file other suits, helped them win lower-court judgments
and put new pressure on states to settle pending cases. Recently,
advocates for the disabled have won court victories in Hawaii,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, Judge Robert C. Chambers of U.S. District
Court ordered the state to eliminate long delays in providing
community services to people who were mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the New York State Health Department said they were
still reviewing the Clinton administration's letters and had not
decided how to respond. Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the
department, said the number of people in state institutions had
declined sharply in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah J. Gilmour, a disability rights lawyer in Rochester,
N.Y., said: ``Thousands of people now in institutions in New York
should be receiving home health care or personal care in their own
homes. So far the state has done nothing to respond to the Olmstead
decision.'' Disability rights advocates will soon file complaints
about the state's inaction with the civil rights office of the
federal Department of Health and Human Services, Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many states have tried to increase community
care, but advocates for the disabled say that spending still favors
institutions. Nationwide, Medicaid spending on long-term care
totaled $59 billion in 1998. Seventy-five percent of that sum was
for institutional care, while 25 percent was for community care.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not known as a leader in health and human services, but
is ahead of many other states in responding to the Supreme Court
decision. It has developed a plan to identify people in
institutions who could be served in their communities, and it is
setting a timetable for action.

   Experts suggest several reasons for the state's progress. Texas
has a strong coalition of disability rights groups. Gov. George W.
Bush is running for president. And his father signed the law that
the Clinton administration is now enforcing.

<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, as the forces of Gen. Augusto Pinochet
overthrew the Socialist government of Salvador Allende, two
American supporters of President Allende were killed in Chile under
circumstances that stirred suspicions of CIA involvement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials categorically denied any role in the young men's
deaths, which were dramatized in the 1982 movie ``Missing.''
Compelled by the Freedom of Information Act, the government in 1980
released the results of classified internal investigations, heavily
censored in black ink, that appeared to clear the American and
Chilean governments of any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But now, those thick black lines have been stripped away.
Spurred by the arrest of Pinochet in 1998, President Clinton has
ordered the declassification of ``all documents that shed light on
human rights abuses, terrorism and other acts of political violence
during and prior to the Pinochet era in Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those documents make clear for the first time that the
State Department concluded from almost the beginning that the
Pinochet government had killed the men, Charles Horman, 31, and
Frank Teruggi, 24. The investigators speculated, moreover, that the
Chileans would not have done so without a green light from U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in
Horman's death,'' said one newly declassified memo. ``At best, it
was limited to providing or confirming information that helped
motivate his murder by the government of Chile. At worst, U.S.
intelligence was aware the government of Chile saw Horman in a
rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing to discourage
the logical outcome of government of Chile paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   With most of the blacked-out portions now restored, the
documents declassified by the State Department illustrate how
exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act _ a law that was meant
to reduce secrecy _ can be misused.
</P>
<P>
   Two principal exceptions the department used allow the
government to withhold information on the grounds of national
security and executive privilege. ``They're not protecting national
security information at all,'' said Peter Kornbluh of the nonprofit
National Security Archives, which promotes the declassification of
government documents. ``Preventing embarrassment is not an
exemption clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after extensive Senate intelligence committee hearings in
the 1970s, the U.S. role in the overthrow of Allende remains a
matter of dispute and conjecture. Kornbluh said that other
government agencies responsible for carrying out U.S. policy in
Chile, including the CIA and the Pentagon, have so far failed to
release key records on the era.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Horman's death, Mark Mansfield, a spokesman for the
CIA, recently released a 22-year-old letter denying any role by the
agency and said the agency would show the public files on the case
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department refused to address questions about the two
deaths, saying few of the people involved in the case still work
for the government. The former officials, most of them retired and
scattered around the country, largely disavow any responsibility
for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Horman's widow, Joyce, is hoping that enough has changed to
finally learn what really happened to her husband. She is asking
for Washington's help in her quest for an honest explanation of his
murder from the new Socialist government in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know who gave the order,'' said Horman, who has
never remarried. ``Nobody's held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and Teruggi were friends who belonged to a group of
young left-of-center Americans attracted by Allende's socialist
experiment in the early 1970s. In Santiago, they worked for a
newsletter that reprinted articles and clippings from American
newspapers critical of U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   When Pinochet seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, Horman was at Vina
del Mar, a coastal resort, with Terry Simon, a family friend from
New York who was vacationing in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said she and Horman saw U.S. warships offshore and spoke
to U.S. naval officers stationed in nearby Valparaiso, who appeared
elated at the coup's success. The two interpreted what they saw as
proof of U.S. connivance in the military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to return to Santiago, they rode back with Capt. Ray E.
Davis, chief of the U.S. Military Group at the U.S. Embassy, who
had been making his weekly visit to the naval station.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, as Pinochet's forces moved to arrest thousands
of people around the country, men in military uniforms abducted
Horman, ransacking his apartment. His wife, Joyce, was out at the
time. She never saw him again. Simon searched with Joyce for Horman
and eventually flew home to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, security forces arrested Teruggi and his
roommate, David Hathaway, at their apartment. They were held at the
national stadium with thousands of other political prisoners.
Teruggi never returned from his second interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway was released alone and later flew home to the United
States. A friend identified Teruggi's body in the government
morgue. His throat had been slashed, and he had been shot twice in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Horman was more tortuous. His father, Edmund,
flew in from New York to help. He and Horman's wife followed
whatever leads they could, keeping in close touch with the embassy,
which supplied escorts and pressed Mrs. Horman for a list of her
husband's friends. Doubting the diplomats' motives, she says, she
never supplied it.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, now 74 and retired, said in a recent interview that he
had nothing to do with the deaths and appeared offended by the
resurgence of questions about the killings.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of his close ties to the Chilean military during his
time there and said he had welcomed Pinochet at his home, but was
in no position to demand that Chilean army commanders answer for
the killings, and had not been ordered to do so. ``We weren't down
there to cause trouble,'' he said. ``We sold them weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Teruggi and Horman ``part of the problem'' in Chile.
``They were down there handing out pamphlets against the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, actually, had been supporting the Allende
government, not the one Davis hoped to see in power. He corrected
himself: ``against the people who were trying to do something about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hormans have long contended that despite the embassy's
avowal that it was doing all it could to find Charles, its
officials would merely confirm information the family had obtained
for itself. Taken together, the newly released documents support
their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1976 that the State Department took a critical
look at the killings. The move was prompted by a disaffected
Chilean intelligence officer, Rafael Gonzalez, who told reporters
that he had witnessed Horman being held prisoner by Chile's chief
of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez quoted the intelligence chief as saying that Horman
``had to disappear'' because he ``knew too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also described a ``cozy relationship'' between U.S. and
Chilean intelligence services to destabilize the Allende
government, and said that American operatives had even given their
Chilean counterparts lists of suspected leftists to be rounded up
in the first days of a military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   (In its hearings, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
found that the CIA had in fact compiled arrest lists, but said it
had no evidence they were passed to the Chileans. Those lists are
among the documents the CIA has not released.)
</P>
<P>
   Facing pressure from Congress, the State Department ordered two
internal reviews in 1976. The first, completed in August, was
carried out by Rudy V. Fimbres, regional director for Bolivia and
Chile in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. The second was
conducted by Frederick Smith, a State Department lawyer, in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were permitted to examine only documents
either publicly released or already available in the State
Department. Their reviews appeared to confirm doubts and
inconsistencies that American newspapers had already reported but
that State Department officials had repeatedly discredited.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed that an embassy official had received a tip
that Horman had already been killed before his father arrived in
Chile. That tip was not followed up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, embassy officials told Edmund Horman that leftists may
have kidnapped his son, contradicting their own cables home, which
quoted neighbors who said they had witnessed Chilean security
forces taking Horman away.
</P>
<P>
   The internal reviews also questioned the time of Horman's death,
saying there was no reason to accept the Chilean government's
assertion that he died just before the U.S. Embassy learned of his
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet government had ignored numerous requests from the
United States for an autopsy report on Horman, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   One review asked why Davis, who had driven Horman and Simon to
Santiago, had taken their registration card from the hotel where
they were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Davis at first denied that he had taken the card, but changed
his mind when read a passage from a letter he wrote to one of the
investigators, now among the declassified documents, mentioning the
registration card. ``I don't see why it's important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Horman family believes the card was given to the Chilean
military, and tipped it off to the new address of the Hormans, who
had moved just a few days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we have,'' the first inquiry concluded, ``we are
persuaded that the government of Chile sought Horman and felt
threatened enough to order his immediate execution. The government
of Chile might have believed this American could be killed without
negative fallout from the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said that there was ``circumstantial evidence'' that
the CIA ``may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death,''
as well as Teruggi's. It also said that the State Department had
the ``responsibility'' to refute baseless allegations and ``to
proceed against U.S. officials if this is warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The second investigation, completed a month before Gerald Ford's
presidency ended, drew a similar conclusion. It blamed the Chilean
government for both deaths and said it was ``difficult to believe''
that the Pinochet government would have carried out the killings
absent some signal, perhaps even an inadvertent one, that the
deaths would not cause ``substantial adverse consequences'' in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, to Harry W. Shlaudeman, the assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, recommended interviewing
Gonzalez, the disaffected Chilean intelligence officer, again and
going back to the CIA for a full accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an explanation exists,'' a memo in the investigation said,
``it does not appear in the files and must be sought elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But both inquiries appear to have ended there. Shlaudeman
himself recommended interrogating Gonzalez further, even submitting
a detailed list of questions for the purpose that the CIA was
allowed to review. But he dismissed the call for investigating the
actions of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed recently, Shlaudeman said that he remembered little
about the issue. ``A lot of things have happened since then,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until jarred loose by Pinochet's arrest in London in October
1998, these reports remained largely hidden from the public.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, State Department officials debated how much of the
documents to show the Horman family, which was then suing the U.S.
government for ``wrongful death,'' a case that was dismissed
``without prejudice,'' meaning that it could be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   One official, Frank McNeil, then deputy assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs, urged the department to err on
the side of greater disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classification should not be used to prevent embarrassment of
government agencies or officials, which would be the principal
reason for withholding when one gets down to the bone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the documents released to the Hormans omitted large
swaths of material on the grounds of national security and
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that executive privilege protects the president's
deliberations with his advisers, in this instance, Henry Kissinger,
who served presidents Nixon and Ford as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger said that he had never seen the documents or the
recommendations, and that he was out of the country much of the
time. ``It's very easy, 30 years after the event, to be so heroic
and to create the impression that one had nothing else to do except
follow one particular case,'' he said. ``If it were brought to my
attention, I would have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres himself, who is now retired, said recently that he was
not surprised at the State Department's apparent failure to pursue
the investigation further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this easily goes into the black hole,'' he
explained. ``And everybody watches it go down.''

PEROT SUPPORTERS TAKE BACK REFORM PARTY IN CHAOTIC MEETING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The Ross Perot faction of the Reform Party retook
control of its ruling machinery on Saturday during a meeting here
of party leaders that was so rowdy and divisive that the police
threatened at several points to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover by the partisans of the party's founder, on a
series of 3-to-1 votes, came just one day after Gov. Jesse Ventura
of Minnesota, the party's highest-ranking elected official, bolted
party ranks, charging that it had become a ``hopelessly
dysfunctional'' political entity at one of the most crucial
junctures in its history, the eve of the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Before his departure, Ventura had been mentioned as a possible
Reform Party candidate for president. The party has a hefty $12
million in federal funding to give its nominee this year, and
Donald Trump, the real estate developer, is exploring the
possibility of a Reform candidacy while Pat Buchanan, the
conservative commentator, already is seeking the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who has thus far run twice for president, taking more
votes from the Republican than the Democratic nominees, has given
no indication one way or the other as to what he might do. But
whether he or Trump or Buchanan or someone else ends up on the
Reform ticket, many of the party leaders here Saturday lamented
that the angry division left in the party after a morning and
afternoon of bitter infighting would likely prove to be a serious
political detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's followers took control of the party last year
following his show of surprising political strength in his state's
1998 governor's election. But as was made clear in Saturday's
voting here, at a gathering of the party's governing national
committee, Ventura never had the iron grip on the party that Perot
had for so many years, and now presumably has once again.
</P>
<P>
   The change in control came amid angry shouts of ``fraud'' and
``thievery'' and ``revenge'' by Ventura partisans, but to no avail.
And at the end of the day, a day that saw more than one screaming,
red-faced party member dragged from a floor microphone and more
than one Nashville police officer call out ``calm down, calm
down,'' the party chairman that the Ventura followers had installed
early this year, Jack Gargan of Florida, had been removed from
office on charges that he had grossly mismanaged the party's
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a disaster from the start, ruled by fiat rather than
rules,'' said Pat Muth, a fellow party member from Florida and a
longtime Perot supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan denied the charges and called his removal a fraud
perpetrated during a meeting of the national committee that was
scheduled illegally, on too short a notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the Reform Party I know,'' he told the committee
members after the vote, ``not the party of honesty and integrity.
This was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he vowed to fight for reinstallation as chairman, saying he
would call a party convention to be held in mid-March in Las Vegas.
That vow brought hoots of derision from many committee members, a
number of them already making their way out of the meeting room at
a suburban hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan also raised the possibility of taking his fight to court.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chose Pat Choate, Perot's running mate in the 1996
presidential contest, to succeed Gargan as interim chairman, until
the party can hold a convention. Choate, one of Buchanan's campaign
managers this year, immediately resigned that job, saying that his
``first loyalty'' was to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Verney, the party chairman ousted earlier by the Ventura
forces and one of Perot's closest political aides, said that Gargan
was ``absolutely, totally wrong'' in charging that Saturday's
meeting had been called illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's rules,'' he said, ``hold that one-fourth of the
members of the national committee can call a meeting and, in fact,
more than 40 percent of them did. How else could you have vote
after vote here in which more than two-thirds of the committee vote
against what Gargan is trying to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The infighting was at its worst early on on Saturday when
committee members could not agree on whether the meeting had been
called according to party rules. So many speakers tried to reach
the floor mikes to have their say that floor managers lost control.
Sometimes three and four people were shouting at once, while other
committee members were jostling _ and sometimes engaging in shoving
battles _ in an effort to speak.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S ALL MADNESS BEFORE THE MARCH MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a good thing for college basketball that March
is on the way and a sport that is creatively defined by hypocrisy
will emerge from the madness it descends into the other 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get these kids involved in changing the system,''
Mike Jarvis said Saturday after his St. John's team hung on to
defeat Villanova, 78-75, at Madison Square Garden. ``The way it is,
it's not for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The way it is in college basketball, the coaches rake in
hundreds of thousands of dollars and practically wear sandwich
signs for sneaker companies and open their programs to flesh
peddlers from the street and honor signed contracts at the rate
most players make 3-pointers. Good for Jarvis if he believes there
is something wrong with this picture (sure he does), along with
those arbitrary and superficial punishments meted out by the N CAA.
</P>
<P>
   There was, nonetheless, old-fashioned activism in the air at the
Garden Saturday. Jarvis called on players to rise up against ``the
system,'' and point guard Erik Barkley began by scribbling ``Only
God can judge me'' and ``Free at Last'' on his sneakers and the St.
John's cheerleaders joined in by fastening the Barkley Band-Aid of
honor across their cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Tom Wolfe was taking notes for a novel.
</P>
<P>
   The Band-Aid sure was the appropriate symbolic prop for how a
sport that is choking on ethics polices itself. As ridiculous as
the NCAA can be, Jarvis responded to the suspension of Barkley by
comparing it to the Gestapo and by saying that he felt raped. He
apologized the next day but _ you know what? _ he sounded just as
hopelessly self-righteous Sunday, albeit with less inflammatory
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a better job of educating my kids about their rights,''
Jarvis said. ``Everything happens for a reason. Hopefully, I'll be
able to say I made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if he continues targeting the NCAA for college basketball's
major ills, which is akin to blaming clowns for the foolishness of
the circus. If he wants to make a difference, he could encourage
David Stern and Isiah Thomas to hurry up with that professional
developmental league that will make college basketball less of the
sad meat market it has become.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said Saturday that someone from the home office in
Kansas City had interrogated him on Feb. 2 into admitting that he
had swapped his 1996 Jeep Cherokee for a 1995 Chevrolet Suburban
owned by a Rucker League coach he has known since he was 14. The
NCAA interpreted this as a violation of its bylaw against receiving
preferential treatment and extra benefits. Barkley was suspended
for three games, but that was reduced to two when St. John's
appealed on the basis that, among other things, the Chevy's
windshield wipers did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothetical question for the new, improved standardized tests
that will be given to basketball recruits once they take Jarvis'
advice and overthrow ``the system:''
</P>
<P>
   Player X is driving along, in his Jeep Cherokee, which he
legitimately purchased with the money he made cutting the athletic
director's grass once during the month of December. A hurricane
suddenly begins _ the windshield wipers will not kick on. What
should Player X do?
</P>
<P>
   A) Call the coach's mechanic and accept free maintenance of the
wipers.
</P>
<P>
   B) Swap his Jeep for a newer car offered by a friend of the
program who just happened to be passing by.
</P>
<P>
   C) Drive the wiper-less vehicle home in the blinding downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the NCAA bureaucrats could have recognized the
Barkley car swap for what it was, a violation only in the most
punitive interpretation of vaguely written rules. If Barkley had
admitted to borrowing a friend's Playstation along with the latest
in sports game software, would that be ``preferential treatment and
extra benefits'' too?
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line here is that the NCAA looks for smoke
because it usually has reason to suspect there is fire. It has to
start somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis used to rail against the influence of Amateur Athletic
Union coaches in the college game, but one of his first moves at
St. John's was the hiring of Dermon Player, formerly of the
Riverside Church AAU program. Why wouldn't the NCAA or anyone else
at least be suspicious?
</P>
<P>
   The kids are always the ones, not the coaches or the athletic
directors or the school presidents, who get punished. In that
sense, Jarvis is right about the inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more worried about my reputation,'' Barkley said. ``I
thought I was going to be labeled as the bad kid from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The ovation he received upon introduction alleviated that fear.
His magnetic dribble and penetrating eyes helped St. John's build
an early lead, and his two 3-pointers down the stretch helped hold
off Villanova. St. John's took another step toward the big
tournament next month, the road to the Final Four, which is the
only drive worth taking in a sport whose wipers too often don't
work.

DECRIPTIONS FOR THE HOUSE VOTES WERE REVERSED. PLEASE MAKE THE
CORRECTION. WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 -- The following chart shows how
senators and representatives voted on key bills and amendments
within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the

<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 64 to 34, a bill that would
require nuclear waste to be shipped to a disposal site in Nevada
from power plants around the country, once a burial site in Nevada
is licensed. Supporters say a plan to remove waste from temporary
storage sites is long overdue. Opponents, including President
Clinton, say the plan does not give the Environmental Protection
Agency sufficient oversight in monitoring the storage radiation
levels. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.

   1) BILL NUMBER: TAXES-DEM
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 192 to 233, an $89 billion,
Democratic-backed measure that seeks to reduce the so-called
marriage tax, but prioritizes saving Social Security and Medicare
ahead of the tax cut. The bill increases the standard deduction for
married couples, but at a smaller rate than the Republican proposal
that was passed. The Democratic measure would also increase the
earned-income tax credit for lower-income couples. Supporters said
the bill addressses the need to eliminate the marriage tax without
jeopardizing Social Security and Medicare. Opponents said the bill
does not go far enough to help married couples. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAXES-GOP
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 269 to 158, a $182 billion
measure that seeks to reduce the so-called marriage tax. The bill
attempts to remedy an aspect of the tax code that leaves some
married couples paying more in taxes than two single filers
reporting the same income. The measure raises the standard
deduction for married couples and also increases the earned-income
tax credit for lower-income couples. Supporters said couples should
not be penalized just because they are married. Opponents said the
Republican-sponsored plan is too costly, provides too much tax
relief to higher-income couples and further risks the future of
Social Security and Medicare. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 64 to 34, a bill that would
require nuclear waste to be shipped to a disposal site in Nevada
from power plants around the country, once a burial site in Nevada
is licensed. Supporters say a plan to remove waste from temporary
storage sites is long overdue. Opponents, including President
Clinton, say the plan does not give the Environmental Protection
Agency sufficient oversight in monitoring the storage radiation
levels. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.

 &HT;    One suspect in Atlanta slayings may surrender
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles and Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reginald ``A.J.'' Oakley plans to surrender to Atlanta
police, a lawyer who knows the Baltimore man _ one of two suspects
still at large in last week's stabbing deaths _ said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, law enforcement officials in South Florida continued
searching for the other suspect, Joseph L. Sweeting of Miami. And
the third man charged in the case, Baltimore Ravens star Ray Lewis,
was moved from the Atlanta Detention Center to the Fulton County
Jail, where his supporters plan to stage a rally today.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Oakley and Sweeting were indicted Friday by the Fulton
County grand jury for the killings of Richard Lollar, 24, and
Jacinth Baker, 21, early Jan. 31 after a night of post-Super Bowl
partying at an Atlanta nightclub, Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, 31, intended to turn himself in to police Saturday, said
Jesse Ingram, a suburban Baltimore sports and entertainment lawyer
whose son, also a lawyer, has previously represented Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   He said Oakley, to whom he spoke several days ago, had traveled
to Atlanta to surrender, but that he did not know the name of
Oakley's Atlanta attorney. He said the source of his information
was Oakley's brother, Brian, with whom he has been in close
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley had not surrendered as of Saturday evening, and his
brother could not be reached. Ingram said Oakley told him he did
not know the two men in Atlanta had died until Oakley returned to
Baltimore from Atlanta and saw the story on the TV news. Ingram
said Oakley, a barber, met Lewis through a mutual friend, Garfield
C. Yuille, 36. Ingram said Yuille and Lewis used to hang out at
basketball games and nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, who is also a professor of psychology at Bowie State
University, said Oakley did not go to police immediately because he
was afraid for himself and afraid that if he were arrested, his
6-month-old son, Reginald Oakley Jr., might grow up without a
father at home.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta on Saturday, Lewis was transferred from the Atlanta
Detention Center, where he had been held since shortly after the
killings, to the Fulton County jail in northwest Atlanta, where a
prayer vigil in his honor is planned today.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Movers Ministries, which works with professional
athletes, is staging the 4 p.m. vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Richard Harris, who said he has known Lewis since he
was in high school, believes that the linebacker is innocent and is
``the third victim'' of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a spiritual gathering,'' said Harris, whose
news release on the vigil claims some NFL players will attend. ``We
don't want curiosity seekers. We are praying for this young man's
spirit.'' The Baltimore Sun reported Saturday that Baltimore
Ravens' owner Art Modell plans to appear at Lewis' Monday bond
hearing as a character witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see him out of jail,'' Modell told the newspaper.
``I've had a relationship
</P>
<P>
   with him for four years. I know him as a devoted, extremely
devoted son and father. I've got some good anecdotes and stories
about him in his involvement with the Police Athletic League. He is
a good citizen with some flaws we'll address later.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in South Florida, the search continued for Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer who arrested Sweeting several times when
Sweeting was younger said he was not surprised by news of his
alleged involvement in the murders of Lollar and Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of a violent, drug dealing gang involved in
burglary and robbery in the early 1980s,'' Deputy Carl Baaske said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Baaske walked the beat in the
neighborhood where Sweeting grew up. He later left the Miami-Dade
Police Department to take a job with the Walton County Sheriff's
Office in the Florida Panhandle. He said Sweeting was ``one of the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members offered a vastly different view of the former
high school wrestling star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been involved in anything like this,'' his brother,
Arthur, told The Miami Herald on Friday. ``Joe is part of a good
family. He grew up in the Baptist Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Sweeting, 34, no longer resides at their
home in Goulds, a poor area in unincorporated south Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting attended Southridge High and, although he was shorter
than many other wrestlers, the Herald singled him out in 1983 for
his athletic prowess.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise Sweeting showed in high school evaporated when
he hooked up with a neighborhood gang.
</P>
<P>
   Dade County police said Sweeting's arrest record began in the
1980s, when he was booked on two charges of possession of a firearm
by a felon, carrying a concealed firearm, robbery, altering the ID
on a firearm, grand theft, burglary, resisting arrest without
violence and violation of probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald reported Saturday that the FBI tracked Sweeting in
1993 as a possible subject involved in a group that specialized in
jewelry heists and cocaine shipments in three states. Although 18
members of the group were indicted, Sweeting was not.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how or when Sweeting met Lewis, although the
relationship likely started during Lewis' days as a football star
for the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Said brother Arthur Sweeting: ``We know Ray Lewis. But we know a
lot of people.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Whatever brought down Alaska Airlines Flight
261 is only half of the airline's problem. The other half is in its
maintenance hangar here, where workers and supervisors sign their
initials to thousands of work orders as they complete them.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few cases, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration, they may have signed papers approving work that
they did not do.
</P>
<P>
   When the agency finds violations, it levies civil penalties. But
in this case, in an unusually harsh follow-up, federal prosecutors
convened a grand jury. Even before the airline got a formal notice
of the modest $44,000 fine the agency was proposing, the hangar
here got a visit from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in with guns drawn, flak jackets and everything
else,'' John R. Fowler, Alaska Airlines' executive vice president
for technical operations, said in a voice of dismay.
</P>
<P>
   In the kind of enforcement action that is almost unheard of in
aviation, federal agents seized the records of several of Alaska
Airlines' MD-80s. The first raid was in 1998, and covered three
planes; the investigation has continued, and last November the
records of eight more planes were seized. Prosecutors have brought
at least 10 of the airline's mechanics before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   At the hangar here, where Alaska Airlines maintains its 34
MD-80s, the investigation comes at a time when the company is in
shock over the crash of one of its planes off the Los Angeles
coast, which killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of that crash is not known, but it appears to involve
the mechanical failure of a part of the tail, the horizontal
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   (On Saturday, the FAA reported that Alaska Airlines had found
four planes with suspected damage in the mechanism that moves the
horizontal stabilizer, and that Delta Airlines had also found four;
Air Tran, the airline formerly known as ValuJet, found two, and
five airlines found one plane each: American, Continental, TWA,
Northwest and Hawaiian Air.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a company mechanic, John Liotine, a former president of
the mechanics union, who sparked the investigation 15 months ago
with a complaint to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   He had been hired in 1989, when the hangar here was bought by
the airline, and worked as a lead mechanic, supervising a handful
of others. He complained about work on three planes being done out
of sequence, or not done at all, in a rush to return them to
service.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of his assertions are known in detail, the company
professes not to know exactly what the government is investigating
as the inquiry drags on and expands. Asked what the planes have in
common or what the mechanics are being asked, Karen A. Gruen, a
company lawyer, simply turned her palms up. (The plane that crashed
was not one of those covered by the investigators' subpoenas.)
</P>
<P>
   Gruen and other executives said that after the crash they wanted
to dispel the idea that there was any connection between the
charges and the crash of Flight 261. There is no obvious
connection, but it is hard to know for sure because the cause of
the crash is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are not talking about the scope of their
criminal investigation of the airline. Todd Zinser, the
Transportation Department's assistant inspector general for
investigations, would not comment on the specifics of the case.
Neither would spokesmen for the FAA or the U.S. Attorney's office
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Zinser said that to justify criminal prosecution, violations
must be knowing and willful, and that prosecutors generally take
into account the rank within the company of the people accused of
violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Alaska inquiry has not produced any indictments, the
only indication of what is happening comes from a sketchy notice of
violation from the FAA and documents from the agency's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   They include statements by Liotine, the mechanic who first
reported the violations to the FAA. He told the agency that other
mechanics had signed their names to work cards indicating they had
done work on three planes although they had not actually done the
work.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, for example, as mechanics rushed to finish work on
an MD-80, he observed that managers and mechanics were filling out
a so-called Post-maintenance final run checklist before all the
checks had actually been carried out.
</P>
<P>
   He removed the card, he said, and asked that the mechanics start
over. A new card was produced and filled out, he said, but by a
mechanic not qualified to taxi the plane or check the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said that some of the accusations involved
misunderstandings of the paperwork system at the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   On another airplane, Liotine complained, the throttle knobs for
the two engines were out of alignment, and he filled out a form
that should have led to them being fixed. Instead, a supervisor
``cleared'' the entry from the aircraft log by noting that previous
tests had found the throttles acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA inspector, alerted by Liotine, wrote in a report that the
supervisor ``proceeded to `sign off' the throttle split discrepancy
just written in the aircraft maintenance log, without actually
performing any maintenance to correct the discrepancy!''
</P>
<P>
   But airline executives now say that while this was not the
proper procedure, it was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on the shop floor said they were not sympathetic to
Liotine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual was a fanatic; he wanted it perfect,'' said
John Kelly, Liotine's fellow mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, which traces its roots to the 1930s, flies an
extensive system on the western edge of the continent, from
northern Alaska to Mexico. The company is well regarded in the
industry for having developed new satellite-based navigation
techniques for landing in treacherous Alaskan mountains, among
other innovations.
</P>
<P>
   It has also had some prior run-ins with the FAA. For example,
when one of its MD-80s developed a fuel leak, the airline drained
and sealed the tank and assigned the plane to shorter routes. The
agency said the modification was improper and proposed a $250,000
fine, later settling for $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in a statement that it plans to release on Monday,
asserts that Liotine was trying to slow maintenance down as a
pressure tactic during contract negotiations, and was bitter about
having been passed over for promotion. Liotine, who has declined to
talk to reporters, has denied in statements to the FAA that any of
his charges was a negotiating tactic. He was president of the
mechanics union at the time he made the charges, but the union
later removed him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.

JARRETT WON'T MIND REPEATING HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ And so it begins for Dale Jarrett. The
driver of the No. 88 Ford Taurus starts a new chapter in his racing
career when he attempts to repeat as NASCAR Winston Cup champion.
So, after he delivered car owner Robert Yates their first
championship last season, what will Jarrett do for an encore? What
will serve as his motivation this time around?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the thrill of victory,'' said Jarrett, who will sport not
only a new mount in the Y2K Taurus but also a new look _ sans
moustache. ``It's got nothing to do with money; it's got to do with
accumulating victories, major victories, and trying to add to our
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has proven capable at winning NASCAR's ``majors,'' with
victories in the Daytona 500 (1993, '96), the Coca-Cola 600 at
Charlotte (1996), the Winston 500 at Talladega (1998), and the
Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis (1996, '99). And last year, he proved
capable of winning championships. He collected four of them, while
recording 24 top-five finishes, 29 top-10s, and just one DNF, when
he crashed between Turns 3 and 4 at the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I feel with more experience that I've become a
better race driver,'' Jarrett said. ``But, along with that, with my
equipment it's amazing how much better a driver I became. You have
to have equipment and the people around you, and Todd Parrott is a
big reason for the success. He, Robert Yates, and (engine builder)
Doug Yates give me equipment, week in and week out, to go out and
get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Daytona 500, patience is what it's about. The
first 400 miles are for show, to get yourself in position, to see
what everybody else has and to see what you have _ where your car
is the best and what you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use those last 100 miles to position yourself and try to
get in the right spot so you can make the moves. If that means that
your car works better out front, you've got to get yourself in the
lead to try and make them pass you. If you feel like you've got a
car capable of making a pass late in the race, you get yourself in
a position to set someone up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen drivers will get a glimpse of their cars' ability to
circumnavigate the 2.5-mile trioval at Daytona International
Speedway when they dice it up Sunday in the 2000 Bud Shootout, a
25-lap race for the 14 Bud Pole Award winners from last season and
the winner of a 25-lap qualifier. As a non-pole-winner in 1999
(amazingly), Jarrett will be in that qualifying field.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he won no poles last year in no way diminished
Jarrett's season, in which he joined his father, Ned, as a NASCAR
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very special,'' he said. ``This was something that I
could kind of pay my dad back. Obviously, I couldn't pay him back
with money or anything else, but a championship was something we
could enjoy as father and son, especially knowing that there's only
one other father-son team (Lee and Richard Petty) to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And after hiring five members of Jeff Gordon's Rainbow Warriors
pit crew, he appears to have bolstered his chances for a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in as the championship team, we realize that people are
going to be watching what we do and paying attention to what
contributed to our success, and I think it's nice,'' Jarrett said.
``Hopefully, we'll be able to withstand their challenges and maybe
have another championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt driving on
</P>
<P>
   Though he took a month off at the end of the year to have back
surgery, Dale Earnhardt signed a contract extension with car owner
Richard Childress that will keep him behind the wheel of the No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet for the next three years. ``It's good through
the year 2003 with options for more, so there's no retirement
clause in there or anything,'' said Earnhardt. ``So we're in good
shape.'' Earnhardt returned to the driver's seat Jan. 31 for a test
at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where he eased into it with a fast lap
of 161.162 miles per hour. ``I feel great,'' Earnhardt said . . .
Northern Light Technology Inc., an Internet firm based in
Cambridge, has made two significant ventures in racing. It has
agreed to a five-year, $50 million title sponsorship of the Indy
Racing League. ``Northern Light's commitment increases the forward
momentum of our series, and is a genuine marketing and media forum
for both of our groups,'' said Tony George, IRL founder and
president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Then last week, Northern
Light announced it was joining forces with Roush Racing as primary
sponsor of Jeff Burton's No. 9 Busch Grand National Series car . .
. Robbie Buhl won the IRL season opener at Walt Disney World
Speedway Jan. 29. It was the second career victory for Buhl, a
graduate of New England College in Henniker, N.H., who won his
first IRL race at New Hampshire International Speedway . . . Dario
Franchitti, who finished runner-up to Juan Montoya for the FedEx
CART championship last season, will likely be out six weeks after
suffering a fractured pelvis and multiple small contusions of the
brain in a single-car accident during a CART Spring Training
practice session last Wednesday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

LEWIS MUST GUARD AGAINTS BIG MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Grant was peeved, which is not his usual
state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tuesday morning in Manhattan and Grant was standing next
to the source of his peevishness and within a few feet of that
man's associates, all of whom had irked him no end. Hot emotion
roiled through Grant's 6-foot-7-inch body, boiling up like steam
before he let it drift away.
</P>
<P>
   Grant intends to vent those feelings soon, at the expense of the
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. Grant intends to
coldcock Lennox Lewis for what he has done, or at least for what
Grant thinks he has done.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not the day for that.
</P>
<P>
   This was a day for business suits and TV lights, a day for hype,
not hypertension at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. The more
kinetic moment will come April 29, in the same building where Grant
was standing back-to-back with Lewis. That will be a night of heat.
This was an afternoon for cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the jump, I've felt disrespected,'' the undefeated No. 2
contender said when asked about the days that led up to the making
of this fight. The world had little reason to anticipate this
matchup until Lewis's forces made the offer to an opponent they
clearly believe is ill-suited to face down their more experienced
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed this fight and those guys were already looking over
my head to see who Lennox Lewis would fight next,'' said Grant.
``That really offended me. I have to say they've really got some
hell to pay for that. They gave me no respect in this whole
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant is not prone to speak that way. He understands better than
most that prizefighting is a business. He accepts that with a
patience rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   So Grant has pounded out 31 straight victories, 22 by knockout.
Because he is a stablemate of Evander Holyfield, Grant would not
fight him even if offered the opportunity. He would wait for
another chance to become a world champion.
</P>
<P>
   Now that chance has come earlier than expected because Holyfield
was unable to conquer Lewis. The opportunity arrived only after
Grant battled his way to a win over Andrew Golota and took a
beating doing it. Twice Grant was knocked to the floor in the first
round, and his features were badly rearranged. Wise beyond his
years, Grant knows it was the sight of him face-down on the canvas
that convinced Lewis and his people to give him this chance.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, is the business Lewis is in. Champions are in the
as-little-chance-as-possible business when it comes to picking
opponents. So when he saw Grant on the floor, Lewis knew he had
found his next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had just walked through Golota, I'd be fighting (No. 1
contender) John Ruiz (in a boxoff to pick a mandatory challenger to
Lewis),'' Grant said. ``What happened to me against Golota was fuel
for them, and I'm glad they took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the fight and I wanted the fight. It's a good
situation for myself, even if a lot of people are underestimating
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, though a large and powerful man, showed inexperience
against Golota, who battered Grant before he rallied and made
Golota quit on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Grant showed great heart and formidable punching power,
withstanding the early beating to come back to destroy Golota. When
Lewis faced Golota, he stopped him in the first round, so his
thinking is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   To Lewis's advisers, this is a chance to mix without risk.
</P>
<P>
   Grant understands why they should be confident; Lewis has more
experience in big fights and holds all the title belts worth
holding after beating Holyfield last November. What Grant finds
off-putting is that Lewis's camp already announced a July title
defense in England, where Lewis sometimes lives.
</P>
<P>
   To Grant, that is not confidence, it is disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what he thinks of me,'' Grant said, ``but
I'll be honest with you. He isn't thinking highly, and I think he
should. I always think highly of my opponents. I've never gone into
a fight mad until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got some hell coming to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs

   There are two ways to look at what happened last week to Tiger
and Rock Allen. Either it was a failed attempt at brotherly love,
costing the identical twins their shots at making the US Olympic
boxing team, or it was proof they've learned early about the
sport's chicanery. Tiger, a featherweight, was 4 1/2 pounds over
the limit and was disqualified. Then he allegedly weighed in for
his brother, Rock, a 132-pound lightweight also struggling with the
scales, and signed paperwork on Rock's behalf at that weigh-in.
While a grievance was being filed, Rock was allowed to compete and
defeated the top-ranked lightweight, Mahlon Kerwick, 16-9. Later,
there was a disqualification, and Kerwick was moved to the
championship bracket of the double-elimination tournament. The
Allens' father and coach, Naazim Richardson, refused to allow
either to appear at the grievance hearing and declined to discuss
the issue. Once USA Boxing officials declared the signature on Rock
Allen's paperwork to be that of his brother's, what else was there
to say? That it was a case of mistaken handwriting? . . . One
interesting scenario at the US trials in Tampa, Fla., would have
been brothers Nonito and Glen Donaire fighting each other in the
semifinals of the 106-pound division, but Glen was beaten in a
controversial decision . . . One thing worries Lewis about Mike
Tyson. He's worried somebody is going to destroy Tyson before he
gets the chance to. ``I'm definitely worried about that,'' said
Lewis. ``I want to fight Tyson because he's the only man of my era
I didn't fight. He paid me not to fight him (which is one way to
look at step-aside money). Tyson has a lot of fans who believe in
him. At this point, he is the only person of consequence for me to
fight. I don't need to be fighting these new heavyweights like
Grant. They're not of my era. Tyson is the mark for me to think
about retiring. There would be a very good possibility of that
after beating him. I've still got a goal to reach. Once I reach it,
I can retire. That's to box Mike Tyson and retire undefeated.''
Although the public still believes in Tyson, Lewis does not.
Frankly, some people think Tyson knows it, too, which is why he
puts himself in the ring with guys like Julius Francis, the stiff
he knocked down five times in two rounds in his last fight. ``The
public still thinks Tyson is Tyson,'' Lewis said. ``He's not. He
said himself (before the Francis fight) that he's not ready to
fight me. I would agree with him.'' . . . Here's Lewis's view on
World Boxing Organization champion Vitali Klitschko. ``Who is he?''
Lewis said of the towering Russian who fights out of Germany. ``Who
has he fought?'' Good questions . . . Lewis did agree that the
Klitschko brothers, who stand 6-8 and 6-6, are the spectre of the
heavyweights of the future, as is the 6-7 Grant, who is 2 inches
taller than Lewis. ``The days of the small heavyweights are over,''
said Lewis. ``No more 215- to 220-pound champions. They're coming
around now at 245-250.'' . . . Holyfield, a small heavyweight who
still carries some clout, will be back in action in May or June,
most likely in Las Vegas, although no date or opponent is in place.
What is sure is that he will not retire, as some have speculated
(or suggested). Holyfield still believes his destiny is to retire
as champion. He just doesn't want to start the final quest until
his divorce proceedings are over . . . Laila Ali's opinion of the
opening performance of 38-year-old Jacqueline Frazier-Lyde,
daughter of Joe Frazier: ``She stinks!'' Frazier-Lyde apparently is
on a course to take the same kind of whipping from Muhammad Ali's
daughter as Ali twice put on her father . . . Ali has fights in
Canada and China this spring while Frazier-Lyde seeks other
pushovers, like her debut, to build up enough of a ``record'' to
square off with young Ali. Meanwhile, lurking in the wings against
the wishes of her father is 23-year-old Freeda Foreman, daughter of
George, who turns pro April 1 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a Roy Jones Jr.-Joe Calzaghe fight has begun. The deal
at present is for Jones to receive the US television money,
Calzaghe the British television money, and they split the gate for
what would likely be a London fight. The way Calzaghe looked in his
last outing vs. David Starie, it won't be an easy sell, but HBO
will buy it. What other choice does it have for Jones? The hard
part comes when his promoter, Murad Muhammad, tells Jones what
he'll be getting paid. TV rights fees for overseas fights are
usually halved in the US . . . Former WBO heavyweight champion
Herbie Hide has yet to be paid for losing his title to Vitali
Klitschko. He is in a battle with promoter Frank Warren and the
British Board of Boxing Control . . . The night Ms. Foreman fights,
she'll be on the undercard of a show featuring ex-Olympians Chris
Byrd vs. Lawrence Clay-Bey. This is a real test for Clay-Bey, who
has struggled with several injuries, slowing his development since
he was captain of the 1996 US Olympic team. The fight led John
Hornewer, an adviser to Byrd, to comment, ``Clay-Bey must have a
bonus clause in his contract if he goes 12-0. Why else would
America Presents put him in with Chris? He can't beat him.''

YATES HAS TWO SEATS IN DAYTONA FRONT ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Robert Yates had the winning quinella in
Saturday's Bud Pole qualifications for the 42d Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   His winning combination? The No. 88 and 28 cars.
</P>
<P>
   After Dale Jarrett delivered Yates his first Winston Cup
championship last season, the NASCAR owner presided over a sizzling
start to the 2000 season when his two-car stable swept the front
row for next Sunday's Daytona 500. Jarrett put his No. 88 Ford
Quality Care Taurus on the pole position with a fast lap of 191.091
miles per hour while teammate Ricky Rudd put his No. 28 Havoline
Ford Taurus alongside on the outside pole with a lap of 190.384
m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have two spots that are given out today and we got to
capture both of those,'' said Yates. ``There's nothing like this.
It's awesome. Now we can really focus and concentrate on our cars
and our chassis, we don't have to worry about the other races.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jarrett's second career pole at Daytona since 1995, which
also happened to be the last time a Ford started at the front of
the 43-car field, thus snapping a General Motors streak of four
consecutive Daytona 500 poles. The next 28 spots will be determined
in Thursday's Twin 125-mile qualifiers, with the next six
determined by qualifying speeds and the final seven going to
provisional starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky and I are fortunate to be the ones sitting in these
cars,'' said Jarrett, who captured his first championship title
despite going without a pole last season. ``It shows the effort
that's put forth at Robert Yates Racing the last couple of years
when we've come here and we haven't been as strong as Robert and
the team are used to at this race track, especially in qualifying.
We've run good in the races, but it's been because of a huge effort
in getting the cars driving really good. Now we have two fast race
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of effort put forth, a lot of talking back and
forth between the two teams,'' Jarrett added, ``and it's paid
off.''
</P>
<P>
   It proved especially beneficial for Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, a crestfallen Rudd held a press conference in the
Benny Kahn infield press room at Daytona to announce that Tide had
severed its ties as sponsor of his struggling racing team. It dealt
a mortal blow to Rudd Performance Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, it seemed like it was the end of the world,''
Rudd recalled. ``I mean, you didn't understand. You had such tunnel
vision, you were focusing on one thing trying to build that race
team into something that amounted to something and something that
would be here for a while. All the hours you're awake, because you
don't sleep a whole lot thinking of what it takes to make the team
competitive, all I saw at the time was sort of the gloom and doom
if we didn't come up with a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost stupid to the fact that I didn't realize the
opportunity I had in front of me,'' he added, ``because I was still
trying to put together a sponsorship deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd was forced to liquidate his team at an auction when Yates
came calling with an opportunity to replace Kenny Irwin as driver
of the No. 28 car. ``I'm just really fortunate that the opportunity
was there for me,'' Rudd said. ``There's no way I could have been
smart enough to plan this scenario out, the way the events
unfolded, it just fell in my lap. I was just glad I was able to
capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's effort went a long way in rejuvenating Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to sit in a car that goes fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM drivers were hard-pressed to say the same after they
struggled to keep up the blistering pace set by Ford drivers, who
occupied six of the Top 10 qualifying spots. Mike Skinner was the
fastest GM qualifier in his Chevrolet Monte Carlo with a lap of
189.781 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   Former open-wheel driver Scott Pruett, whose last race resulted
in a pole at CART's season-ending event at Fontana with a lap of
235 miles per hour, was the fastest rookie after he qualified ninth
in 189.470. He, too, drove a Ford.

   TAMPA _ For the 12 American boxers who emerge from this week's
Olympic Trials, the road to Sydney does not end at the Tampa
Convention Center with the nationally televised finals.
</P>
<P>
   The winners must fight again in two weeks at Foxwoods in
Connecticut against the winners of the losers' brackets, or someone
else judged the most worthy contender. If the trials champion wins
one bout, the challenge is over, but if the challenger wins two, he
takes the team slot and the trials winner becomes the alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, no American boxer is assured of a spot on the Olympic
team because in 1997, the Association of International Amateur
Boxing voted to limit the number of boxers from the Americas in the
Games. Now only certain countries like Cuba get byes into each of
the 12 Olympic weight classes. The rest, including the United
States, must qualify fighters in one of three regional qualifying
tournaments. Only 22 boxers will earn Olympic spots at both the
North American and Central American qualifiers, and 10 will be
selected from the South American qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   The first qualifier will be in Tampa March 27-April 1. The
second will be April 17-22 in Mexico and the final shot comes May
23-28 in Argentina, where only gold medalists will qualify for the
Games. If the American fighters survive those qualifiers, they will
make the journey to Sydney for the Olympic Games, which run Sept.
16-Oct. 1.

TRADITIONS LEAK AWAY AS VETERANS ARE LET GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Et tu, NFL?
</P>
<P>
   It used to be we could point to baseball, basketball, and hockey
and say how the money destroyed so many of the things we loved
about those sports. There was a time when a Ted Williams or a Carl
Yastrzemski would play his entire career with the Red Sox, when a
Bill Russell or a Larry Bird would play for no one but the Celtics.
You will never see it again.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was once a league in which players would see their
careers through with one team. John Elway, one team. Walter Payton,
one team. John Hannah, one team. Bruce Armstrong . . . Ben Coates .
. .
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots almost preserved that era in these crazy times when
money has destroyed all things warm and cozy about the sports we
grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Coates should have retired Patriots, on their own
terms. They shouldn't have been asked to take pay cuts. They
shouldn't have been told to do it or hit the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Age is here.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on the NFL. Shame on the Buffalo Bills. Imagine, telling
Bruce Smith he makes too much money. Imagine, telling Thurman
Thomas his services are no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   How did it get to the point where Dan Marino has to ask for his
contract to be voided by the Dolphins and he's actually asking to
play in Tampa Bay _ Miami's Florida rival?
</P>
<P>
   Shame on the Vikings. Randall McDaniel, an 11-time Pro Bowler,
returned from Honolulu and is told he has been waived. See ya,
Randall; 11 Pro Bowls are OK, but we have to pay somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't the owners, in the process of lining their pockets with
millions of dollars in television and luxury-box revenue, at least
keep alive some semblance of tradition? Couldn't we have one
player, maybe two, go from rookie season to retirement with the
same team? If you're a sports fan, this is how you remember it
being in your childhood.
</P>
<P>
   What is bothersome about the Armstrong case (and others like it)
is that he already had done them a favor. The Patriots signed him
in 1998 to a four-year, $16.5 million contract. Armstrong then
agreed to restructure the deal last year to help the team's bottom
line. This year Armstrong was asked, ``Can you take a pay cut?''
Actually, it wasn't even that polite. It was more like, ``Take a
pay cut or be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second. It was the Patriots who came to Armstrong last
year and asked if they could redo his deal. He did them a favor. If
they're going to ask him to play for $2 million, why did they sign
him to such a big contract in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Let's be real. The Patriots, like all NFL teams, are restricted
by the salary cap. As the money has grown following the $17.6
billion TV deal signed two years ago, capologists around the league
have attempted to keep their young core players with megadeals. As
a result, the older players have suffered, taking pay cuts or being
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have to be very careful they don't do what the Dallas
Cowboys have done and made six or seven players the biggest part of
their payroll,'' said agent Jack Mills, whose clients include Ted
Johnson. ``Then you have depleted talent on the rest of your team.
Unfortunately, this is what's happening around the league now.''
</P>
<P>
   The capologists don't mean to be unfeeling; they are simply
bottom-line folks who have to stretch a penny in ways that can be
cruel.
</P>
<P>
   We understand the Patriots' stance on Armstrong and Coates;
restructuring contracts for two older players who your organization
feels don't have much left doesn't make fiscal sense.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for older players who have been picked up by teams
later in their careers, but there are some players that teams
simply have to bite the bullet on and keep for the sake of
tradition. Coates and Armstrong are two such players.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Drew Bledsoe is going to find himself in the same
situation. A generation of kids has followed him faithfully since
he came into the league in 1993. How cruel will the Patriots be
with Bledsoe?
</P>
<P>
   As for the players, while they're in the process of breaking the
bank, couldn't they make sure they don't break their team's back?
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy and Ty Law shouldn't feel entirely guilty that
because they've been signed to enormous contracts, Willie Clay,
Dave Wohlabaugh, Todd Collins, Armstrong, and Coates had to be
sacrificed. To hear Ray Anderson, Milloy's agent, tell it, Milloy
was very conscious of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, Lawyer was exposed to the other side of
this issue,'' said Anderson. ``I also represent Denny Green, Brian
Billick, Tony Dungy, Gunther Cunningham, and other coaches so I
know firsthand the problems they're facing with salary cap issues,
and Denny in particular has had to cut veteran players like Randall
McDaniel who were very dear to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Lawyer that while you're getting your deal, one of your
fellow players in our agency, Darnell Walker from the 49ers, is
getting cut as a $600,000-$700,000 player because the 49ers didn't
work the cap properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are very aware of what the Patriots needed to
do. We knew they didn't have a lot of money to work with, so we
structured a deal that Lawyer could be happy with and at the same
time make sure the Patriots could keep their cap number under $2
million the first year. I guess I'm very sensitive to criticism
that Lawyer or I were responsible, because of the contract, for the
team letting Bruce Armstrong or Ben Coates go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Shawn Jefferson, who accepted a five-year, $18 million deal
with Atlanta Friday, wondered, ``I don't know if this salary cap is
good for the game. I think it screws a lot of players. There are so
many guys who get cut because there's a big contract given to one
player. That doesn't make sense. If you sign one guy to one big
contract, what good does it do if you have to let four or five good
players go? That's what happened to the Patriots. It's great to say
you have a good core of six or seven great players, but they can't
win all the games for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy once said that he looked around the stadium and saw fans
wearing the jerseys of the ``big money'' players, but it wasn't
necessarily those players who win football games. Now he's wearing
one of those popular jerseys, and some of the less-popular ones
belong to players no longer with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyer wants to win,'' said Anderson, ``but I told him that,
`You and six other guys can't go out there and carry the team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   We're not advocating that players like Milloy, Law, Johnson,
Willie McGinest, Bledsoe, etc. say, ``Wait, don't give me all that
money; give some of it to somebody else.'' But it's up to owners
and players to realize that the money isn't being distributed
fairly. They should tweak the system so it doesn't go haywire.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in the big-money era that I can remember
so many great players and future Hall of Famers being cut. It means
the system isn't working. Those older players _ many still
productive, some still Pro Bowlers _ should be finishing their
careers with their original teams.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Robert Kraft has proposed the best idea so far _
that the league make more contracts incentive-laced. Players should
perform for the big money. Otherwise, the lopsided pay scale will
only worsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in the business have seen it coming,'' said Jim
Gould, agent for Terry Glenn. ``The players are going to be paid
big dollars earlier in their careers and then they're going to have
to scramble to make a medium-range salary and stay on a roster.
It's unfortunate it's come to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams had to scramble to get under the $62.2 million cap
last week _ and that was after it went up $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had to strip $24 million by restructuring the
contracts of Terrell Owens, Garrison Hearst, Charlie Garner,
Derrick Deese, Winfred Tubbs, Steve Young, Bryant Young, and Gabe
Wilkins, and cutting safety Tim McDonald and linebacker Lee
Woodall, while Charles Haley retired.
</P>
<P>
   All of the restructuring will create more problems down the road
for the 49ers, even though they got $3 million under the cap for
next season. The 49ers should have their signing privileges
revoked.
</P>
<P>
   In this fiscal mayhem, teams must remember their tradition and
the players who helped mold that tradition. Coates and Armstrong
signed contracts that should have been ironclad, for what they did
in the past and for what they were projected to do in the future.
</P>
<P>
   A bond between players and teams has been broken and may never
return. Not in the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Ham-handed action
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hamilton left the Patriots with class and dignity, throwing
no stones. In yet another situation that should have been handled
differently, Hamilton, a longtime Patriot player and coach, is
leaving to become the Jets' defensive line coach. ``The Patriots
were good to me,'' said Hamilton. ``They treated me fairly and gave
me the ability to work at something I love.'' In New York, Hamilton
will coach a three-man line. Even though that's not what the
Patriots were using, said Hamilton, ``I played in a 3-4 my first
nine years in the league and I coached it my first five years as a
coach.'' . . . Coates already has gotten calls from 12 teams, with
the most serious suitors being Tampa Bay, Baltimore, Washington,
and New Orleans . . . Bobby Grier has remained silent during the
Patriots' transition to Bill Belichick, but Tom Donahoe, the man
who almost replaced Grier, said, ``It's a very difficult and uneasy
feeling when you're in Bobby's position. I feel for him, I really
do. It's a difficult job. You're always under scrutiny. But I know
Bobby has worked very, very hard for the Patriots organization and
hopefully things can work out for him.'' Belichick brought in Scott
Pioli from the Jets to be assistant director of player personnel,
which must make that anxiety even greater. But word out of New York
is that Belichick, Pioli, Charlie Weis, and Eric Mangini work very
nicely together . . . Patriots unrestricted free agent defensive
end Ferric Collons could wind up with the 49ers, according to agent
Angelo Wright. Collons would like to remain in New England, but San
Francisco is his home . . . Ohio State's Dave Kennedy, one of the
top strength and conditioning coaches in the country, will stay
put, and continue to train Glenn in the offseason . . . Starting
left guard Heath Irwin will not be re-signed by the Patriots.
Mills, his agent, said the team has shown no interest in him. The
Dolphins are the early bidders for Irwin, who would be reunited in
Miami with former Patriots line coach Paul Boudreau. Irwin will
visit Miami Tuesday . . . The Patriots appear tied to Todd Rucci at
guard, with the possibility that Max Lane will move to left or
right tackle . . . Thinking about McDaniel for the Patriots? Think
not. McDaniel wants to stay in the Midwest, not far from his
Minnesota home . . . Bettors, here's a tip: Whatever the odds are
on Cleveland winning the division, take them. Forget about their
record last season. The Browns have great cap space, and if they
can get the right people around a maturing Tim Couch, they might be
in business quicker than you think. Coach Chris Palmer has already
talked to Armstrong and Coates, he may go after Troy Brown, and he
may try to trade the No. 1 pick to the Saints for Ricky Williams.
The Browns feel it might be better to bring in veteran receivers
around sophomore Kevin Johnson rather than drafting Peter Warrick
No. 1 . . . Belichick phoned Clay Friday to talk about the
possibility of returning to the Patriots. ``I'd love to be back
there,'' said Clay. ``I think Lawyer and Ty and myself really feed
off each other. I think we work so good together that it would be
good to have us playing together again. I know Lawyer and Ty are
rooting for me and put in a word for me all the time. We'll see how
it goes. I think my agent will be speaking to them next week.'' It
appears that Belichick doesn't think Chris Carter can be a starter,
and he still doesn't know much about Tony George. Belichick may
convert Tebucky Jones to safety, but he won't know until he watches
Jones in mini-camp in April . . . Word is that Zefross Moss has
thought about retiring. That would be about a $1.6 million savings
on the cap . . . Robert Edwards continues to make a great effort to
come back to football, but it's still early to start thinking about
that. Edwards has been working out at the University of Georgia and
has been very dedicated to his grueling routine.
</P>
<P>
   A job for Jumbo?
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule out Jumbo Elliott coming to New England for a year or
two. Elliott is having back surgery to repair a bulging disk but
should be as good as new after rehabilitation. Elliott had a subpar
season battling his back problems . . . Which offensive lineman do
you think the Patriots would be looking at? Jon Runyan? As of
Friday, they had had no contact with Runyan's agent, Ben Dogra.
Runyan has visited Philadelphia, and three other teams have called.
The Titans' right tackle could still re-sign with Tennessee . . .
Patriots defensive lineman Chris Sullivan may not have to take the
hometown discount after all. He has four teams interested in him,
one of which is the 49ers . . . Damien Woody is honeymooning in
Hawaii. If he keeps up his workout routine _ which he'd better
under Belichick _ he'll be one of the best centers in the league in
a short time . . . Jeff Blake could be huge in New Orleans. The
former Bengal, who got a four-year deal worth $17.2 million Friday,
is out from under the shadow of Akili Smith in Cincinnati. The
Saints have strugged the past couple of years with Billy Joe this
and Billy Joe that. Now they have a quarterback they can build with
. . . The Patriots shouldn't look any farther than Boston
University for a strength and conditioning coach. Mike Boyle is one
of the best in the country, though most of his work has been with
hockey players . . . Kraft was very close to Armstrong, which made
the team's decision to cut him a painful one. Kraft tried to
contact Armstrong Friday, but he had already left for Boston to
have his right knee examined . . . Don't be shocked if Barry
Sanders returns to football soon and gets traded to Miami. The
Dolphins would love a high-profile running back, especially with
Marino gone. Boudreau was offensive line coach in Detroit with
Sanders and certainly knows how to create blocking schemes for him
. . . Steve Israel is drawing interest from the Bengals, who are in
the market for a corner who won't break the bank . . . The Falcons
wanted a strong veteran presence in their receiving corps and got
one in Jefferson. He seriously considered going to Cleveland, and
at one point Thursday even thought he would stay in New England. In
fact, Weis phoned Jefferson that day and asked what it would take
to get him signed. Jefferson wanted a $4 million-$5 million signing
bonus and a $2.5 million average salary. The Patriots didn't act
and Jefferson was gone. ``I wanted to come back to New England
after I talked to Charlie (Weis) because I've always enjoyed
playing for Charlie,'' said Jefferson. ``I was comfortable with
things in New England and working for Coach Belichick. But I told
them things were going to move quickly. I didn't want it to prolong
into the free agent period. But they didn't act quickly enough.''
Jefferson owns a catering business in Atlanta and will not be far
from his home near Jacksonville.

HAZING: RITE OR WRONG? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hazing? No way. Not this.
</P>
<P>
   Not the shaving of the pubic regions or the donning of togas and
women's thongs that were de rigueur for admission to a University
of Vermont team hockey party the night of Oct. 2 at a house rented
by captain Kevin Karlander, during which nine freshmen went through
their final initiation rites, under the auspices of the
upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   Not the array of party games in which the freshmen, among other
things, were the targets of beer poured and spat upon them by their
elders; participated in a pie-eating contest in which the entree
was seafood quiche with ketchup topped by barbecue sauce _ with a
community bucket at their disposal when several of them vomited;
passed a communal chunk of bread chewed in descending order from
the pie-eating champion to the last-place finisher; consumed 32
warm beers in a dark basement room; performed pushups while naked
over glasses of warm beer into which they dipped their private
parts, the number of pushups determining whether they could drink
their own glass or someone else's afterward; and did the so-called
elephant walk, parading naked around the house while holding the
genitals of the person ahead of them in line.
</P>
<P>
   At least four freshmen who experienced some or all of these
alleged activities consider the ritual harmless, a unifying
vehicle, strictly voluntary, a source of brotherhood that made them
feel like genuine team members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think I was hazed,'' said goalie Shawn
Conschafter, 18. ``We were all given the option beforehand to opt
out, and nobody did. We didn't know anything about what was going
to be going on, but we all looked forward to it and had a good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said forward J.F. Gamelin, 20, when the Catamounts
reconvened for practice the following Monday, ``I felt I knew
everyone on the team much better.''
</P>
<P>
   So they cannot comprehend the volcanic fallout from the
nocturnal gathering: the actions of classmate Corey LaTulippe, a
fourth-string walk-on goalie who has left school and is playing on
a junior team in Rochester, N.Y., after filing a suit against the
university and seven players in which he alleges that his civil
rights were violated, his privacy invaded, and he was the victim of
assault and battery; the scathing report by the Vermont attorney
general, who called for the enactment of an antihazing law and
blasted the school for lax early procedures before it complied with
a state investigation; the outrage among observers and especially
administrators around the nation who denounced the supposed bonding
rituals as acts of depravity and vowed to be more vigilant in
policing their own athletes; and, worst of all, the decision by the
university to cancel the final 15 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing has been blown out of proportion,''
said left wing Ian Morse, 19. ``People haven't seen something like
this for a while. The general public doesn't understand the
(dynamic) within a hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, say experts and college administrators, the
problem is that student-athletes often don't understand the
dynamite that comprises repulsive behavior, as opposed to uplifting
_ or at least innocent _ rites of passage into the team framework.
The UVM case has dramatically revived the issue nationwide. And
while almost all of the NCAA's more than 1,000 member schools have
explicit policies against hazing both printed in handbooks and
emphasized verbally to and by coaches before each season, that
message is now being reinforced with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   At Alfred (N.Y.) University, which last year compiled a landmark
report on college athletic hazing, requests for information and
advice have increased drastically since the UVM case. While she
couldn't quantify the UVM factor, school spokeswoman Sue Goetschius
said, ``It definitely has piqued interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of hazing has everyone's attention on campus right
now,'' said Northeastern athletic director Ian McCaw. ``We've tried
to be proactive since that incident. We've had a mandatory
department meeting, brought in all the coaches and staff, and
brought in university counsel to discuss the state law on hazing,
what signs to look for. Later this month, I'll meet with all of the
student-athletes, 500 of them, to discuss hazing, what students
should do if they feel hazed, and the university counsel will be
there to discuss state law.''
</P>
<P>
   UVM is particularly sensitive to the issue and adopting a
hardcore crackdown. According to assistant AD Jeff Schulman, the
school has assembled a presidential committee that includes experts
in adolescent behavior and met with the student advisory committee
last week. In addition, it is implementing a more intensive
educational system and will require all its athletes to sign a
contract regarding hazing practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must understand that there is no place for degrading,
humiliating behavior,'' said Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools that have been the sites of hazing have taken
action against a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas almost five years ago, a freshman
drowned during a party among the school's spirit group, the Texas
Cowboys, at which recruits were driven out to a lake and forced to
drink as much beer as they could. Since then, in each sport, a
Longhorn senior has been designated as a big brother or big sister
to an underclassman, functioning as both confidant and de facto
guardian.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of North Carolina two years ago, the men's
soccer team held a party that involved freshman hazing. When news
of the incident surfaced, the team captains were stripped of their
titles and the coach banned the Tar Heels from attending a
tournament in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Zero tolerance
</P>
<P>
   Boston University hockey coach Jack Parker, like his peers, has
never tolerated hazing during his 27-year tenure. But it seems
that, unlike the case with some of his peers, his players have
taken him literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a beginning-of-the-year party to get to know the
players,'' said Jacques Joubert, captain of the Terriers' 1995 NCAA
champions. ``It was a welcome-aboard party. We didn't even like to
call it an initiation because we felt if the coaches thought enough
of you to recruit you, that was initiation enough. We didn't have
to put them through anything. The idea was to make them comfortable
instead of saying, `You have to prove yourself.' We'd stress that,
`You're part of the team. We don't want to intimidate you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Joubert's account was independently echoed by Chris McCann
(Class of '91) and the Bruins' Shawn Bates (Class of '97). But
Parker recalls that it took a while to transmit the message about
just how pristine he wanted the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early years, we'd put out a nice spread for the
players,'' said Parker. ``There wouldn't be any trouble at the
party, but after the party, maybe some of the guys would go out to
a bar and maybe someone would have trouble in their dorm because of
alcohol. About the third or fourth year, I told my captains, `No
alcohol. I don't want any of that stuff.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Being watchdogs is a burden shared by all athletic mentors; the
UVM situation merely redirected the spotlight on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is innocent and nobody is guilty,'' said Jack
MacDonald, the former Boston College track coach who now is AD at
Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn. ``We're all responsible. I've
told the kids at our school, `The biggest fear of any college
athletic director, coach, or administrator is that we'll come back
to work Monday morning and find one of you not here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, supervisors can go only so far in monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
   UVM sophomore defenseman Joe Flammia, 21, of Woburn, fears that
coach Mike Gilligan, who preached against hazing before the season,
might become a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like a parent,'' Flammia said. ``They can't watch you
all the time. Once we leave the rink, we're on our own. We just
absolutely disregarded what he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Maine and BC football coach Jack Bicknell
took a hands-on approach to outlawing hazing, even in the bread
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated everything about it,'' Bicknell said. ``By hazing, I
mean seniors coming in late from lifting weights and moving to the
front of the dinner line and making the freshmen move back. I said,
`The heck with this. We're not going to treat people this way.' A
lot of it had to do with the fact that (the upperclassmen) had been
hazed as freshmen and were waiting their turn to make someone else
miserable. And some of the kids doing the hazing wouldn't hit a
fly. They were probably the ones who had been mistreated as kids.
The great players wouldn't be involved. The ones on the fringe
would say, `Well, gee, you should've seen what happened to me.' I'd
say, `Well, I wasn't here when it happened to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Defining the term
</P>
<P>
   There is understandable confusion about what constitutes hazing.
The NCAA addresses the issue only as one of its principles of
student-athlete welfare: ``It is the responsibility of each member
institution to protect the health of and provide a safe environment
for each of its participating student-athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is a matter of interpretation. Forty-one states have
antihazing laws _ including Massachusetts since 1984 _ so what is
permitted in one place may be prohibited in another. The NCAA
leaves antihazing enforcement to the discretion of each member
school. The waters can be so murky that some administrators prefer
to err on the side of caution. Hockey East commissioner Joe
Bertagna says University of New Hampshire coach Dick Umile, who did
not return a call from the Globe, takes a rigid approach to
preclude any hassles: He won't even allow freshmen to be assigned
to pick up pucks after practice, a longstanding hockey tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Alfred study is increasingly becoming the point of reference
for the NCAA, which has wholeheartedly embraced, supported, and
promulgated the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred defines hazing as ``any activity expected of someone
joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers,
regardless of a person's willingness to participate. This does not
include rookies carrying the balls, team parties with community
games, or going out with your teammates, unless an atmosphere of
humiliation, degradation, abuse or danger arises.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the UVM indoctrination would be a clear
violation of Alfred's standards, qualifying as the most severe of
the four categories of behavior listed: acceptable, questionable,
alcohol-related, and unacceptable (potentially dangerous or
criminal).
</P>
<P>
   But athletes who have participated in what they assumed to be
innocuous rites of passage would be surprised that technically,
they, too, were involved in a transgression.
</P>
<P>
   When Bruins forward Anson Carter played at Michigan State, there
was an annual rookie indoctrination party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd do stupid things like Rollerblade down the street with a
dress on, or dress up in goofy clothes, '70s clothes,'' said
Carter, who wore vintage disco attire as a freshman, while the
following two incoming classes skated in drag. ``Nobody had to do
it if they didn't want to. Nobody gets hurt by it. Nobody's in the
hospital. It's just a way of promoting chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also questionable behavior under the Alfred guidelines. And
Dr. Norm Pollard, who directs Alfred's counseling center and served
on the committee that undertook the national survey, said, ``We
found that on campuses, if people were involved in questionable
behavior, they were far more likely to be involved in dangerous
behavior. If they're willing to do this in public, they're likelier
to do far worse in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred's coup was uncovering some of the behavior for the
public, because there is a code of silence that exists among many
athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins defenseman Hal Gill, who attended Providence College,
said, ``There's a fine line between hazing and being part of the
team. I'm not going to lie _ there's things you do _ but every guy
I've ever talked to said the best part is being part of the team.
We'd go out drinking, sing songs as a team. We used to have a
rookie party. It never became a thing where anyone became alienated
or intimidated. You didn't have to do it. If you wanted to do it,
fine. If not, you could go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a voluntary participant does not exclude hazing because
it's impossible to gauge the effect of implicit peer pressure. And
like fraternities _ of which these athletic activities often are an
outgrowth _ teams can function as secret societies of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   Survey breaks the secrecy
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont problems _ and penalties _ were compounded by the
fact that the upperclassmen conspired to cover up the situation
when they were initially questioned by the university, thereby
employing a cherished, if misguided, sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in the locker room should stay in the locker room,''
said Gill. ``What's in the team should stay in the team. The CIA
doesn't tell secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alfred study _ prompted by a football hazing at the school
in 1998 when freshmen were lashed together and forced to drink
until they vomited, resulting in two being hospitalized because of
alcohol poisoning _ exposed secrets the respondents didn't even
think were necessarily worth revealing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee canvassed a random sampling of 10,000 athletes
from 224 NCAA schools who submitted names and addresses of their
athletes to Alfred. The response rate _ 2,027 completed surveys _
was approximately 20 percent and about equally represented each
region and the three NCAA divisions. From that, Alfred extrapolated
that among the more than 325,000 NCAA athletes, 255,637 _ 79
percent _ were subject to some sort of hazing. Yet of the group
that acknowledged participating in activities that would qualify as
hazing, only 12 percent felt they had been hazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It indicates that a lot were involved in hazing they weren't
aware of,'' Pollard said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's principal investigator, Nadine Hoover, mentioned
other forms of harassment were revealed that may not have been as
obvious:
</P>
<P>
   ``Skinny-dipping; streaking, stealing each other's clothes . . .
immersion (in water); going from house to house asking for milk;
putting a pig's head in a football helmet; urinating in lockers;
one kid said an administrator forced him to get into a box-sized
locker; lots of alcohol consumption stuff; exposure to extreme
cold; forced use of steroids, ephedrine; being forced to exercise
until they pass out; being forced to inflict pain until they pass
out; being cruel to animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Or acting like them.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed reaction at UVM
</P>
<P>
   Among the Vermont players who agreed to be interviewed by the
Globe, the reaction was startling, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen seemed almost defiant, blaming their predicament on
a player they perceived as a malcontent _ LaTulippe, whose
attorneys declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He eagerly participated,'' said Conschafter, who, when asked
if he thought the Catamounts had been robbed of their season,
replied, ``Most definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he was abused is ridiculous,'' said defenseman David
Noble, 19, of Cohasset. ``Everybody was excited about being part of
the UVM team. It was one of the many things we did that made us as
close a team as we are. If I thought it went too far, I'd be
jumping on the bandwagon and suing everybody. You don't see anybody
else here doing that, do you? (LaTulippe) was a bad goalie. If he
hadn't been cut, you wouldn't have heard anything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The upperclassmen who commented seemed contrite, or at least
regretful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was a mistake,'' said sophomore center Ryan Cox,
20, of Norwell. ``We've paid the consequences. I just want it to
get over with, but it just keeps dragging on. We suffered the
biggest consequences _ a lost season. I wake up with an empty
feeling in my stomach knowing there's no hockey. It wasn't as if
anybody held a gun to their heads or said, `We're going to beat you
up on the ice (if you don't attend the party).' Maybe peer pressure
got to them.''
</P>
<P>
   And exposure got the Catamounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how things turned out, it's because of that _
yeah, it was a mistake,'' said junior defenseman Martin Wilde, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Flammia indicated that the entire matter might have been caused
by a sense of reluctant obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't regret everything that happened, I'd have to be
crazy,'' he said. ``We lost our season. I wish we didn't do it, but
by the same token, I went through it, other guys went through it,
and nothing happened. Nobody likes doing it _ I didn't enjoy it (as
a freshman). But we all went through it. There was a sense of
pressure that we had to do it. (As freshmen), we were told, `Guys,
we don't want to do it but we have to. You'll have to do it, too.
It brings us together.' Do I think it brings us together? Not now.
But I did then.''
</P>
<P>
   Such seeming role reversal in fact is not as bizarre as it might
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, that's not an unusual reaction,'' said
Eileen Stevens of Sayville, N.Y., an antihazing crusader who has
spoken at some 700 colleges in the 22 years since her son, Chuck
Stenzel, died of acute alcohol poisoning and exposure resulting
from a fraternity hazing at Alfred. ``There's such a strong sense
of acceptance among these young men or women that they feel it's
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a team situation, coaches and upperclassmen have bought
into it and are on such a pedestal. They went through it, then
they'll have their turn. It perpetuates it. Emotionally, (freshmen)
may not be secure enough to realize their rights are being
violated. Even if there's a flicker of discomfort, they feel there
must be something wrong with them. They don't want to be the
whistleblower or the rat. They don't realize that would be
courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, UVM coach Gilligan believes, is to keep driving home
the message until it is observed without supervision or sanctions
being necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge we have as educators is to try to get
these young adults to understand what is hazing,'' said the
embattled coach. ``A lot of them and their classmates don't feel it
was hazing because it was voluntary. They don't understand there's
a condition in the air that (makes them) feel they should
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   The stigma does not belong to UVM alone. The Catamounts'
greatest misfortune might have been detection.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont players also claim to have empirical evidence that
theirs is not an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for a fact that things like this happen all over the
country,'' Conschafter said. ``It's no different. I've got friends
around the country who play Division 3 hockey and football. They've
gone through the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the revelations, Flammia found himself a magnet
for correspondence from strangers with a common theme: concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten e-mails from players as far away as Alaska,'' he
said. ``People I don't even know asking me for details of what we
did because they've done the same things and don't want to get in
trouble. I think what we did was excessive, but I've heard from
other players saying they've done a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catamounts believe the notoriety they've received will end
the practice, and administrators hope they're correct. But college
officials also believe that the cessation will be merely temporary
if they practice benign neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real change is going to have to happen campus to campus,''
Pollard said. ``Each state is going to have to have an antihazing
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Alfred AD Jim Moretti, whose school seems to have
established a model for hazing awareness, takes nothing for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not immune to having it happen again,'' he said.
``Nobody is.''
</P>
<P>
   The imperative is to strike while the issue is prominent, and
Gilligan, who may be a casualty of the shrapnel up in Burlington,
offers a rueful perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will (have a national impact),'' he said. ``My
next job might be on the lecture circuit.''

   CLEVELAND _ Figure skating purists have been debating the
sport-or-art question ever since Mr. Paulsen did his single axel in
1882. After Saturday afternoon, when Tim Goebel jumped out of Gund
Arena and still couldn't take the US men's title from Michael
Weiss, they'll be arguing for another century and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a judge,'' said the 19-year-old Goebel with a shrug,
after he'd nailed a historic three quadruple jumps in the long
program and still lost to Weiss, who couldn't manage even one. ``I
just went out and did my job and I was pleased with what I did.
Michael skated a very solid program and he was the reigning
national champion.''
</P>
<P>
   No men's titleholder had been dethroned since hometowner Rudy
Galindo upset Todd Eldredge in San Jose in 1996. But the
23-year-old Weiss had been nursing an ankle stress fracture all
season and hadn't competed since November. And Goebel, who'd landed
three quads at Skate America at the beginning of the season, had a
much more demanding long program and was skating in front of his
home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you go to a competition, you have to attack,'' said
Goebel, a freshman at Case Western Reserve in Cleveland who trains
in nearby Lakewood. ``Being cautious, being defensive is costly.
Whenever you go out there, you have to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Goebel, who skated first in the final group, did three quads in
a row _ a quad salchow-triple toe combination, a quad toe loop, and
another quad salchow. He also did a triple axel-triple toe combo
and four other triples. His only mistake _ and it probably cost him
the title _ was stepping out of the axel in the combination. Had he
nailed it, Goebel likely would have earned a string of 6.0
technical marks instead of eight 5.9s and a 5.8.
</P>
<P>
   When the music stopped, Goebel knelt and covered his face in his
hands, just as Bob Beamon did when he jumped 29 feet at the 1968
Olympics and created his own airspace. No man ever had landed even
one quad in a US championships.
</P>
<P>
   But his skywalking, and the imbalance it created in his program,
cost Goebel on the artistic side, where he was given mostly 5.7s
and a 5.6. ``You gotta have both,'' mused Audrey Weisiger, Weiss's
coach. ``It's an athletic-artistic combination that succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, derided as a graceless leaper when Eldredge used to beat
him, had worked hard on polishing his programs. Though he never got
around on his planned quad toe Saturday night, settling for a
triple, Weiss hit everything else, including a triple axel-triple
toe, a second combination, and another triple axel, nine triples in
all.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure what Goebel had done, but from the marks and the
cheering, Weiss had a good clue. ``I assumed he'd hit at least one
quad and possibly three,'' he said. ``I knew I'd have to put it all
out there to pull out a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Weiss's technical marks were only 5.8s and 5.7s, he
outpointed Goebel on artistry, with a 6.0 (from Joan Burns), three
5.9s, and five 5.8s. When the math was done, Weiss had prevailed
6-3, with the artistic tiebreaker winning him four judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even put into words how amazing this is,'' said Weiss.
``As everyone says, it's always tougher to defend a title than to
win it. I was really psyched to pull this one off.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In another time, he was the brightest star whose
talent made the golf world stop and take notice. But even though
Phil Mickelson could hit a flop shot into a thimble from 25 paces,
he couldn't do anything about the arrival of Tiger Woods's fire and
magic.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, so used to the spotlight, perhaps has done a low
simmer as he has been pushed to the background by Woods, but he has
the opportunity Sunday to alter that landscape. He birdied four of
the last seven holes Saturday to shoot 5-under-par 67 and complete
three rounds of the Buick Invitational at 16-under 200, good for a
two-shot lead over Shigeki Maruyama. Davis Love shot 69 and is
alone in third at 205.
</P>
<P>
   Though he played near-flawless golf in front of a home crowd at
a course he has known since boyhood (Torrey Pines's South Course),
Mickelson knew what would face him afterward, so he volunteered
almost curtly this assessment of the situation: ``All I know is he
played a very good round today, but started six back and he's still
six back,'' said Mickelson about Woods, who settled for what had to
be a disappointing 67 and is tied for fourth in his quest to win a
seventh straight tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing not because he played poorly _ to the contrary,
Woods climbed past 18 players _ but because it fell short of his
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-five,'' said Woods, when asked what his goal was for the
third round. ``I gave myself a lot of opportunities. I can't tell
you how many good putts I hit that just didn't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh on his mind as he said that was his finish _ birdie
attempts from inside of 10 feet on the final three holes, none of
which fell.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, on the other hand, delivered on his chances down the
stretch to break away from Maruyama (they had been tied at 13-under
through 14) and push Woods even further down the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Woods) is going to have to do something extraordinary
to make up ground,'' said Mickelson, who is still haunted by his
one-shot loss to Woods at the NEC Invitational last August, a
tournament that started this winning streak. ``Obviously he is
capable of doing that. I expect he's going to get out to a quick
start and go low, but if I play a solid round I'm going to be in a
position to force him to shoot a ridiculously low round.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods came from five shots back after three rounds to win last
week's AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, a fact Mickelson is well
aware of. But Mickelson has never been confused with Matt Gogel,
the PGA Tour rookie who squandered last week's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try and play intelligent, aggressive golf,'' said
Mickelson, who will be paired with Maruyama and Love in the final
group. Woods will be with two of the others at 10 under, Jeff
Sluman (66) and Fred Couples (67), just in front of Mickelson, a
fact that doesn't faze him.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson seems determined to get back a piece of the spotlight
that Woods has dominated. Since the end of 1996 when Woods stormed
out of the gates, Mickelson has won just four times, compared with
17 for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus has changed. I'm excited not only about this
tournament, but the entire year,'' said Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   He showed it, too. Starting the day tied with Maruyama and Kirk
Triplett (73), Mickelson began slowly and was in danger of getting
swallowed up by the roars filtering back from Woods's gallery.
That's because Woods, thanks to a knock-down wedge to 2 feet at the
par-4 third and a two-putt birdie at the par-5 sixth, was at 7
under, just four behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt confident,'' said Woods, who elicited more roars when
he reached the par-5 ninth hole with a 2-iron from 245 yards. Two
putts, another birdie, and the charge seemed on. Particularly since
Mickelson had gone out in five consecutive pars and Maruyama had
fallen to 10 under with a bogey at the par-4 fourth.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods knocked a 5-iron to 15 feet at the par-3 11th and
made the putt, he was 9 under with two par 5s to play. Mickelson
had gotten to 13 under by making birdie at each of the par 5s on
the front, but the momentum seemed to be all Woods's.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum that a cool putter took away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a little disconcerting, knowing you are hitting
good putts and they're not going in,'' said Woods, whose biggest
heartache came at the par-5 13th. He had drilled a 2-iron from 244
yards, his ball coming to rest 18 feet from the pin. The eagle putt
was on line all the way, but ``it made a flat line on me, instead
of continuing to break.''
</P>
<P>
   It hit the left lip, spun out, and left him a most frustrating
birdie tap-in. He was 10 under, but wouldn't make another birdie,
not even at the 498-yard par-5 18th, a hole he usually can reach
with an 8-iron. But Woods drove it into the rough, could only get
it to the front of the green, then missed a 6-footer after a good
chip.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had failed to apply even more pressure, which seemed to
relieve Mickelson. The lefthander, after a sloppy three-putt bogey
at the par-4 10th, went on a birdie binge _ the 12th, 15th, 16th,
and 18th. On the closing hole, he laid back with a 3-wood off the
tee, then drilled another 3-wood from 240 yards to set up a
two-putt birdie, a sequence of shots that seemed to put an
exclamation point to his statement that he is still a threat to be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I win six straight?'' Mickelson said, repeating a question
that had been asked of him. He shook his head. ``I'm just trying to
win one.''

BENNETT CAME OUT OF PRISON WITH FIGHTING CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The Toy Store Bandit would like to steal a place on the
Olympic team before the month is out. That's not much time, but
Michael Bennett knows all about time.
</P>
<P>
   He knows about hard time and fast time and how time can
disappear. He also knows that he's running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bennett was a 19-year-old small-college football player
from Chicago who earned money loading trucks for UPS when he wasn't
attending North Park College. He was a product of the hardest place
in the city, the Cabrini-Green housing project, a place so full of
small-time criminals and hate that the federal government finally
gave up on it and shut the place down. When that happened, people
cheered. Unfortunately, the cheer didn't rise up before Bennett
went down.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Bennett had no Olympic dreams or any other kind of
dreams. What he had was a nightmare that began the day he walked
into a Toys ``R'' Us with a friend and a sawed-off shotgun with
mayhem and money on his mind. Not even a month after they left that
store, they were leaving Chicago as guests of the Illinois penal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bennett insists that it was his friend who carried the
gun, he was the one who got the 26 years of hard time because his
friend cut a deal in exchange for fingering Bennett. Such is the
way dreams die in fetid places like Cabrini-Green. They die before
they're born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stupid what I did,'' Bennett said. ``I couldn't even
tell you what I was thinking that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but he can tell you exactly what he was thinking a
few months later, when a Chicago judge told him he owed the state
of Illinois 26 years for his mistake. He was thinking about math.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember was the judge said, `26 years,' and I heard
some woman in the back say, `Damn, that's a long time,' '' Bennett
recalled. ``I went to my cell and tried to figure out how long that
was. I tried to even figure in for the leap years. When I got done
I thought, `Oh my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's because 26 years times 365 days is 9,490 days, and times
24 hours a day is 227,760 hours. There's no reason to multiply
after that because you know what you just lost.
</P>
<P>
   At age 19, you've lost your youth and perhaps your life. That's
an expensive trip to the toy store.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett says he accepted it. Of course, what choice did he
have? He was ``accepting'' what he could not avoid. He was
accepting watching the best years of his life dissolve into dark
nights and dank days in a penitentiary called ``The Pit,'' a cold
place built into an old rock quarry in Menard, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum security. Maximum pain. Maximum time. Minimum future.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett would go to jail a teenager and come out with more than
half his life gone.
</P>
<P>
   So how long is 26 years? A long time to think about a toy store
and a shotgun and a bad idea. But that's what Bennett got. Time to
think.
</P>
<P>
   And, just maybe in the end, he got something else. Maybe he also
got what prison can sometimes bring a man. Maybe he got redemption.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Menard Correctional Institute, Bennett discovered
the boxing ring and three guys named Papa-San, Mongoose, and
Pharoah. How much they knew about boxing is hard to tell, but they
knew enough to pass on what they had to give to Bennett a couple of
years after he got to prison. He took those lessons and to his
first victory in a long time, a prison win over a tough guy with a
big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I started to learn the jab, the hook, and the old
1-2,'' Bennett said. ``I never intended to be a boxer. I just did
it to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried boxing and the Bible, and both worked for him. Seven
years later, he was paroled for good behavior. When he came out, he
carried his boxing gloves and the good book. His two sisters were
waiting with the honey buns that he forgot he used to love. He
showed them the Bible and the boxing gloves and told them the two
might save him yet.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he is, barely 18 months later, captain of the United
States national boxing team and fighting to win a spot on the 2000
Olympic team at 201 pounds. Saturday he won the trials at the Tampa
Convention Center by dominating a man who had twice beaten him,
Colorado's DaVarryl Williamson, and now Bennett must win only one
more fight, in two weeks at the Olympic boxoffs at Foxwoods.
</P>
<P>
   If he makes it, Bennett will not be the first ex-con to fight
his way to freedom, but that doesn't make his story less
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed of my past,'' Bennett said last week. ``It's
something I can't erase. I made a bad choice and paid heavily for
it. Some people have to pay more for their mistakes than others,
but if I hadn't gone to prison I wouldn't have found boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a high price to pay for finding a sport that fits your
talents; Bennett would not recommend this road. But it is his road
and his story and he is on it now, further than he ever expected to
be after winning a silver medal at the US Championships last
February after only nine amateur fights. He won the US Challenge
and then the World Championship in Houston last September.
</P>
<P>
   The World Championship victory was tainted because Bennett never
got to fight the reigning Olympic and World Amateur champion, Felix
Savon, in the final. The Cuban team walked out of the tournament in
protest of earlier decisions. But Bennett still has the medal and
he'll accept the break without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Once Savon refused to get into the ring, all Bennett had to do
to become world champion was walk into an empty ring, hear the
first bell ring, and have his hand raised.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with hearing a judge say, ``26 years, son,'' it was a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Bennett's trials are not over. Even if he
survives the road to Sydney, he still must face his past. Bennett
needs permission from Australian immigration officials to be
admitted into the country because he is a felon convicted of a
violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   USA Boxing officials have already applied for permission in case
Bennett qualifies, which is a strong possibility now that he is
past his nemesis, Williamson. But a strong chance is no guarantee,
just as a fast start at Cabrini-Green was no guarantee Bennett
wouldn't be standing in a toy store with a shotgun, and a friend
who was anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Still, US Olympic officials are hopeful Bennett will be allowed
into Australia in September and his Illinois parole officers let
him travel to box because they realize what boxing is to him.
</P>
<P>
   It is his chance.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fighter's chance, and that isn't always much of one. But
it's a chance, and he'll take it as far as he can. As far away as
it can take him from a toy store and a shotgun and a place where
the doors clang shut at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've learned my lesson,'' Bennett said. ``All I want is
a chance and I think I'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, it will have come the hard way.

VAN GUNDY IS A KNICK WITH A KNACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Of all the factual tidbits that have shaken
loose from the 49th NBA All-Star Game, here is the leader in the
clubhouse: Jeff Van Gundy is a partial Yalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there one year,'' reported the coach of the East
All-Stars. ``I was recruited by Ray Carazzo and he cut me on the
first day of practice! I mean, recruited and cut in one day. I
wanted to play, so I decided to leave. My mother still can't
believe I left an Ivy League school to play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was the second coming of Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, I was just good enough to get my father fired,''
he said with a laugh. ``You know how they say every white suburban
kid can shoot free throws? The problem is, you've got to be able to
get to the line. I could only penetrate with the pass, so I never
got there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yale experience is an improbable story, but just about
everything concerning Van Gundy's presence in the All-Star Game is
improbable. Like, who is this guy, and how did he survive four
Knick coaching regimes to become the head man at age 33? How did
this modestly gifted Division 3 point guard (Nazareth in Rochester,
N.Y.) position himself to be able to say, ``Reggie, go in for
Allen'' in the NBA's great showcase game?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's the son of a coach, but is that such an exclusive
club? Coaches, and there are thousands of them, breed just like
everyone else. Why is Bill Van Gundy's kid the chosen one?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of luck involved,'' said Van
Gundy. ``Players filter up according to their abilities, but it
doesn't necessarily work that way with coaches. There are plenty of
guys in Division 3 who can do as good or better a job at this as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's big break came because he had a player. He was
coaching at McQuaid Jesuit High School in Rochester, N.Y., and the
best player on his team was a lefthanded marksman named Greg
Woodard. College folk started to come around, and one of them was
Providence assistant Stu Jackson. The two hit it off, and when a
vacancy cropped up (Herb Sendek was heading off to bigger and
better things) Van Gundy was offered the position of grad assistant
on Rick Pitino's staff. When Jackson succeeded Pitino as coach of
the Knicks, he invited Van Gundy aboard. Eternal moral of the
story: It's not what you know; it's who you know.
</P>
<P>
   (The P.S. on this one is that Woodard went to Villanova.)
</P>
<P>
   Once ensconced, Van Gundy bit into the job in pit bull fashion,
going the extra mile, and then 10 more extra miles. It turns out
that this really was where he belonged, that having absorbed
basketball knowledge on all those car rides to and from practice
with his dad and having gone to all those practices and having
learned to diagram plays when he was 10 years old, that basketball
is basketball, and there's no reason why he couldn't impart a bit
of his knowledge to highly skilled professional players.
</P>
<P>
   Some people don't get it. They assume players will only listen
to ring-laden men such as Western All-Star counterpart Phil Jackson
or a hoop demigod such as Larry Bird, but Van Gundy says he is
proof to the contrary. You can be a short, balding former Division
3 point guard and you can still get their attention if you've got
what they perceive to be the ``Right Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Players don't care about anything other than you be
competitive, reliable, sincere, and responsible,'' he said. ``They
don't care if you're big or small, black or white. All they want is
someone who can help them become better.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Van Gundy is a phenomenon. You know he's smart,
because in the normal swirl of professional sports little-known
assistant coaches don't survive when Jackson is replaced by John
MacLeod and John MacLeod is replaced by Pat Riley and Pat Riley is
succeeded by Don Nelson. He must have extraordinary political
skills to go along with his basketball acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he just knows where the corpses are stashed. But there
must be more. He quite obviously has something going for him that
the players respect, although he is quick to say that he owes
certain people more than he ever could repay. ``Guys like Patrick
Ewing, Mark Jackson, and Charles Oakley gave me respect before I
earned it,'' he acknowledged. ``What happened as time went on was
that I then made my way in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   So here he is, back where it all began. His father was coaching
in nearby Martinez, Calif. (birthplace of Joe DiMaggio), and this
was home until the end of his freshman year when Bill Van Gundy
took a job in upstate New York. The Bay Area scribes couldn't get
enough of Van Gundy's local references, about the trips he would
take with his dad to local schools, and how his dad would have him
read the box scores aloud or ask him to diagram so-and-so's
out-of-bounds plays. ``I now know he already knew what was in the
box scores, and that he probably threw the diagrams into the waste
basket,'' Van Gundy said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy says he always will take what he calls his father's
``Division 3 values'' wherever he goes. Bill Van Gundy, who spent
15 years coaching at Genesee Community College in Batavia, N.Y., is
from the old school, as you might suspect, and that means you honor
your commitments. That's why he will not be in attendance Sunday.
Though officially retired, Bill Van Gundy is an unpaid volunteer
assistant at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, and there is a
game Sunday. Mom Cindy will represent his interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's him,'' said Van Gundy with a shrug, before quickly
pointing out that his dad was present for his career pinnacle as
Knicks coach in the 1999 NBA Finals. ``He was at both games in San
Antonio,'' Van Gundy said. ``Here's a guy who coached all his life,
and he's much better than I'll ever be. To see the pride in his
face over what I was doing was very satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the game better understands the capriciousness of it
all than Van Gundy, who with three weeks to go in the regular
season last year was much closer to being an unemployed coach than
an All-Star coach. The Knicks won a few games, got on a roll, and
got past Miami when Allan Houston's last-second shot hit the rim,
bounced off the glass, and fell in at the buzzer. That shot lifted
New York into a weird Indiana series (remember Larry Johnson's
controversial 4-point shot?) and into the Finals against San
Antonio. And what did this say about Jeff Van Gundy?
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA is a results-oriented business,'' he said. ``At the
end of the year we got a few lucky bounces. But what happened in
the final 15 games of the season and the playoffs didn't mean I was
coaching any better than I was earlier in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate task is figuring out how to coach in an All-Star
Game. ``I can say we just want to have them go out there and have
fun,'' he said. ``I'd love to see the league have a showcase game,
and the only way I know to do that is for them to play hard and
play together.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his team can exploit its quickness edge. ``We've only
got three guys over 6-9, and their starting front line is all over
7-feet,'' he said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly been a memorable 12 months for Van Gundy. He saw
his name splashed all over the back pages of the New York tabloids
(``Unfortunately, my name lends itself to headlines . . . `Van
Gone,' `Pack Up The Van,' stuff like that''), he went to the
Finals, and now he is coach at the All-Star Game. Not bad for a
Yale dropout. No Skull and Bones for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and I kept trying to break in there,'' he said with
a laugh. ``That was my life's work that whole freshman year.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is he has found his life's work, and you can argue
that it culminates Sunday when a 38-year-old Division 3 point guard
gives orders to the world's greatest basketball players.

WEINSTEIN SPRINTS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALPOLE _ He is from Brookline, a freshman at Harvard, and when
the starter's gun for the 500-meter men's final exploded Saturday,
Daniel Weinstein exploded with it, grabbing an immediate lead that
set off the home fans in explosions of noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great feeling hearing all the noise,'' said the
19-year-old Weinstein. ``In 500 meters, you just go.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the bell lap began, Apolo Anton Ohno, the top-ranked
American ``and a skater who's been skating so well recently, maybe
the best in the world,'' said Weinstein, was at his heels looming
on his inside. ``I had a couple of chances to pass Dan,'' said
Ohno.
</P>
<P>
   And as the skaters entered the final turn of the final lap in
the US Short-Track Championships at Iorio Arena, ``I didn't see
Apolo but I could feel him and hear him,'' said Weinstein. ``He's
such a good skater you just know he's going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering that final turn, Ohno, 17, of Colorado Springs, had to
decide whether to try to pass Weinstein on the inside. ``I had a
couple of chances to go inside,'' said Ohno, ``but Dan would
probably have shut me down.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the narrowest of margins, Weinstein edged Ohno in the
race, their times indicative of the closeness of the event.
Weinstein finished in 43.459 seconds to Ohno's 43.543 seconds.
Rusty Smith was third in 43.616 and Tom O'Hare fourth in 43.760.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 500 meters, old reliable and four-time Olympian
Amy Peterson of Ballston Springs, N.Y., blew away the field. She
took the lead right after the gun and was never threatened by any
of her competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, 27, continues to rule as the top American woman. The
reason for her excellence, she said, is ``the pure joy of
speedskating, which I love. I love the sport, I love the lifestyle,
and I've had a strong family that's been behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson won in a time of 46.924 seconds. Julie Goskowicz, 19,
of Colorado Springs, finished second in 46.990 and surprising
Caroline Hallisey, 19, of Natick, finished third in 47.057,
continuing her good day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in the 1,500-meter finals, Ohno won a race that was
just as exciting as the 500-meter event, edging Weinstein and
Smith. Ohno confidently stayed back in the early laps and took the
lead with about two laps to go and lived up to his top-ranked
billing.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein played it safe, trying to avoid mishaps with
second-tier skaters. Several times he went to the lead to avoid
trouble. But going to the lead early reduces the energy left for
the final laps, and Weinstein finished second with a time of
2:23.589, just behind Ohno's 2:23.369. Smith's time for third was
2:23.746.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 1,500-meter finals, Peterson, as usual, dominated
the field, winning with a time of 2:32.934, ahead of second-place
finisher Goskowicz (2:33.040) and Hallisey (2:33.441).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Hallisey, who had been the fifth-ranked
American woman going into the competition. ``I was able to finish
third behind the two (Peterson and Goskowicz) who everybody
expected to be 1-2. My goal is still to finish in the top two.''
</P>
<P>
   This competition is important for the skaters because it
determines the makeup of the US team that will go to the world team
championships in The Hague, Netherlands, and the world individual
championships in Sheffield, England, both next month.
</P>
<P>
   The top five finishers in both the men's and women's
championships will go to the team championships while only the top
three men and top two women are eligible for the individual
championships. The makeup of the US team is decided by results in
the 500, 1,000, and 1,500 meters, combined with the rankings in the
time trials, which were held Friday. The final race to determine
the makeup of the team is the 1,000 meters Sunday.

HIGH WATER MARK FOR NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ You expect, perhaps, royalty. Or
something close.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a visit to the home of Sir Peter Blake begins with a
ferry ride across to Auckland's North Shore, then a short walk up
Sir Peter Blake Boulevard to the house on terraced gardens that
opens majestically on the skyline of the city shimmering in the
late afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, much of the modern look of the City of Sails _ with
the 1,000-foot Sky Needle and America's Cup Village of waterfront
businesses, restaurants, and condos, its basin full of mega-yachts
in for The Cup _ is attributable to the accomplishments of Sir
Peter Blake.
</P>
<P>
   But royalty? It makes him laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The tall, tousled-hair fellow wearing a rugby shirt, shorts, and
bright red socks looks more like an ageless kid than a ``Knight
Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the
British Empire,'' an honor bestowed on him by the Queen Elizabeth
II five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year when, as leader of the Black Magic sailing
team, Blake fulfilled a 10-year-old dream of his nation to win the
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for Americans, living in a country of 260 million with
the breadth and complexity of the US sports economy, to understand
the importance of the America's Cup to this tiny island nation of 3
million.
</P>
<P>
   But to see the effect now of seven national teams in Auckland
competing all year for the Cup _ and the half-billion-dollar impact
on the economy _ is to understand Blake's assessment five years ago
when his country won in San Diego: ``It's the most important thing
that ever happened to New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake was 47 then, and the achievement of his team culminated an
effort that began in 1985 when a banker named Michael Fay first
fired the America's Cup passion by backing a New Zealand entry in
the 12-meter World Championships in Fremantle, Australia, a
preliminary to the 1986-87 America's Cup there.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Fay pointed out that New Zealand had the strongest
economy in the Southern Hemisphere coming out of World War II but
had been on a slide ever since. The America's Cup, with its huge
international prestige, could focus the eyes of the world on New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand came close on that first try, finishing second in
the Louis Vuitton challenger finals to Dennis Conner, whose Stars &AMP;
Stripes took the Cup to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Blake, an Auckland native, was becoming a growing
presence in New Zealand's sailing world, with victories in the
Sydney-Hobart Race, Admiral's Cup, and the Whitbread
Round-the-World Race on the crew of Steinlager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty well stuck into it,'' says Blake of his sailing
exploits, of which the long-term offshore adventures are closer to
his heart than round-the-buoys racing. ``I've been sailing my whole
life. I wouldn't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he viewed the America's Cup as a job to be finished, and in
1992 he became part of the famous New Zealand team that, on the eve
of victory in the challenger series, unraveled and lost to Paul
Cayard skippering Il Moro de Venezia for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake's reputation for team management made him a natural to
lead New Zealand into the 1995 Cup in San Diego. In the meantime,
the year before that Cup, just to ``get a splash of sea water on my
face,'' Blake shattered the Jules Verne Record as skipper of ENZA
(``Eat New Zealand Apples''), a 60-foot catamaran that made a
nonstop round-the-world voyage in 74 days, 22 hours, 17 minutes,
and 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was he back from that adventure than his team was off
to San Diego with two boats named Black Magic. This time, neither
internal team politics nor the tremendous pressure from
psychological warfare _ two elements that doomed the '92 effort _
would touch Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's personality _ jocular, folksy, good-natured _ was a
contrast to the sharp focus of his mission. He stood as a firewall
between Team New Zealand and the intense off-the-water pressures of
Cup competition. On the water, blessed with the two quickest boats
in San Diego, designed by Doug Peterson, New Zealand sailed to a
victory that was so decisive as to be almost anticlimactic. Blake
rode the boat as mainsheet trimmer. He is credited with being a
calming influence on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Blake also was credited with being one of the most persuasive
voices in getting sponsor dollars behind Team New Zealand: $40
million for this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reckon it was just our time,'' says Blake, always with a
modest tone, always trying to minimize his own part in these
sailing glories. ``We had quick boats, and our sailors did their
part.''
</P>
<P>
   In many speeches and appearances around San Diego in the wake of
the triumph, Blake emphasized that New Zealand's reign as defender
of the Cup would bring rules to ``level the playing field,'' a
much-debated topic.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Yacht Club installed as Challenger of Record _
despite a short-circuit attempt by Bill Koch _ Blake announced that
the next defense would come in 2000, five long years away. There
were groans. Critics said that such a long time between defenses
would ruin the event, that it would be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake's resolve was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed the time to rebuild our waterfront,'' he said at the
time. ``There's nothing there for an event like the America's Cup
and what it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Few critics can be found from those years. Wherever the Cup goes
next time, the Auckland waterfront, with Viaduct Basin holding all
the racing compounds and America's Cup Village surrounding it, is
stunning. This seaport sets a new standard by which all future Cups
will be measured _ all part of the Blake vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Blake's vision or his presence,'' says Alan Sephton, a
syndicate spokesman, ``there would have been no one to pick up from
where Michael Fay left off. It took some convincing to get him into
it, but no one else could have handled the figurehead role. He
really inspired the imagination of the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Blake wants to see Team New Zealand make at least one
successful defense of the Cup (the new black boats take on Italy's
Prada in just over a week). But, he concedes, his head is really
not in the game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is titular head of the defense syndicate, there is a
been-there-done-that feel. He rarely sails on the racing boats, and
the sailing team does not need him as it once did. Blake is a man
who craves change and new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that Sir Peter, now in his 50s, having
accomplished so much for himself and his country, might just sit
back a bit and take life easy. Hosting barbecues on his patio, or
attending wife Pippa's art show opening, or involving himself in
the lives of his children (Jane, 16, and James, 13), Blake gives
every appearance of contentment in life.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances couldn't be further from the truth. As soon as
the Cup ends, Blake will begin his duties as new head of the
Jacques Cousteau Society and begin testing the systems of the
conservation group's latest acquisition: Antarctic Explorer, an
aluminum-plated, 117-foot-long, 30-foot-wide sailing vessel
equipped to handle ice closures in the Arctic winters.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cousteau died in 1997, the society he gave his name to has
floundered. Blake hopes to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we've got about 100,000 members,'' he says. ``We
want to build it up to a membership of 1-5 million. What we have to
do is get it back in front of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for Antarctic Explorer, and perhaps similar teams on
other oceans, to undertake a number of high-profile adventures and
air them on world television.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to care about the ocean, you have to make them
passionate about the beauty first,'' says Blake. ``The earth
depends on the ocean, and people have to care and develop a love
before they think about saving it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues of massive pollution, overharvesting of fisheries,
and even recreational pollution of the coast are all focuses for
the revitalized Cousteau Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not like Greenpeace,'' says Blake. ``We'll make
suggestions of how things could be done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Antarctic Explorer is built like a huge wedge so that as ice
solidifies under it, the hull actually gets pushed up and becomes a
winter dwelling. The big diesel generators convert from water- to
air-cooled, and until the ice melts again, the ship becomes a
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine the beauty of it,'' Blake muses, with a faraway
look. ``Think of the seals and sea lions and polar bears
everywhere. It'll be just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   As his mind wanders to the Northwest Passage, the first
adventure on Antarctic Explorer, it is clear that Sir Peter Blake
has already moved 10,000 miles or so beyond the America's Cup.

FRIVOLOUS CONTRACTS HURT CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I never thought I'd see the day the Celtics would have to trade
two pretty good players in the space of six months because they
felt they could not afford to re-sign them. And now that one of
them is back, does that change anything? No. He'll be traded again,
soon, for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   When, precisely, did this team become the Minnesota Twins? Or,
to bring the analogy closer to home: Don't Paul Gaston's comments
about fielding a ``competitive team'' while running it like a
business sound eerily similar to Jeremy Jacobs's?
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino has been sounding like a member of the Poor Boys
Club. He noted more than once last week that his team could not
compete with the likes of Orlando, Miami, Portland, or New York
because of budgetary limits. Those limits are the reason, we are
led to believe, that Ron Mercer is no longer here and the man who
replaced him, Danny Fortson, once was no longer here, is back, but,
we can be sure, not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's true. It's true because the budget is bloated with
salaries Pitino unhesitatingly handed to players of lesser ability.
He's not restricted by a budget; he's restricted by his own
largesse.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months ago, Pitino emerged from the lockout wearing a
here-to-there grin. The new deal, he said, was a godsend for the
Celtics. It enabled teams to build through the draft, as he was
doing, while retaining their young talent, as he planned on doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pure economic terms, we were in trouble,'' he said that
January day, referring to the old ways. ``It would have been
difficult for the Boston Celtics to survive and for probably half
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he didn't think a nanosecond about handing out $71 million
to Antoine Walker. While he could possibly defend that one _
although the evidence is pretty skimpy _ why on earth did he shell
out $8 million to Walter McCarty, a player who has zero market
value?
</P>
<P>
   Why did he pay $30-something million for Vitaly Potapenko before
Potapenko had spent 72 hours with the team? Because, like Mercer
and Fortson, Potapenko was headed for free agency. (And, like
McCarty, he was represented by David Falk, to whom Pitino steered
most of his Kentucky guys.) Why did he shell out $24 million for
Tony Battie, who plays about once every fifth game? Because, he,
too, was headed for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   It's like going to the store for provisions and coming home
without milk, eggs, and bread because you spent the money on Pop
Tarts.
</P>
<P>
   None of these deals is a budget killer. But totaled, they blow
it apart. Next year, Potapenko, Battie, and McCarty will collect a
combined $10.28 million. Take one of those players out of the
equation _ McCarty is the logical one _ and you've got an extra
$2.8 million to keep Mercer. Instead we've now seen Mercer traded
and McCarty playing about 10 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing is the team's quick decision to move the players
without anything close to give-and-take, toss-numbers-around
negotiations. Fortson's agent, Raymond Brothers, called the
Celtics' move ```ridiculous.'' Was there ever a serious bargaining
session? ``No,'' he said. ``None.'' Maybe they don't think Fortson
is worth what he thinks he's worth. That's what negotiations are
all about. (Fortson would hardly be the first player to overvalue
himself.) Mercer got the same treatment. One meeting. Bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino understood the situation going in; yet it's mind-boggling
to think Gaston could break the bank for a coach and close the bank
on the players. But the bank is closed because the money isn't
there. As the overseer of the basketball treasury, Pitino has, as
Gaston likes to say, breached his ``fiduciary responsibility.'' His
team, and its fans, are now paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   First-half awards
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Fitch liked to say, why judge a movie halfway through?
But we do it anyway; so, here we go:
</P>
<P>
   --MVP: Shaquille O'Neal, LA Lakers. Not even a doubt here. When
the Lakers went through their recent slide, it was due to Shaq
playing like the old Shaq, concerned about scoring. When he's
rebounding, running, and blocking shots the way he's been doing
most of this year, he's unstoppable, and so is his team. He was
transcendent against the Timberwolves last Wednesday, at one point
scoring 18 straight LA points.
</P>
<P>
   --Coach of the Year: Phil Jackson, LA Lakers. They said he
couldn't win without No. 23. Well, he doesn't need No. 23 because
No. 23 is gonzo. He now has the next-best thing, No. 34, and he has
gotten No. 34 to do what no other coach could do before. Why is
that, Shaq? ``He's a white version of my father,'' O'Neal said.
``He's always on me. I like that. I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   --Rookie of the Year: Elton Brand, Chicago. You can say he's
getting points for a bad team, which he is, but the Bulls aren't
that much worse than the Clippers or Rockets. Here's what GM Jerry
Krause had to say about Brand last week: ``Wait until two years
from now. We have him working with Al Vermiel, who is the best
strength coach in the business. He will be the strongest man in the
league. He never touched a weight at Duke. Mike (Krzyzewski)
doesn't believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Sixth Man: Brian Grant, Portland. Yes, he plays only 20
minutes a game, but so what? He represents what the Trail Blazers
are all about and 28 other teams would lust for him. The guy is
your prototypical warrior.
</P>
<P>
   --Most Improved Player: Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas. More than a few
candidates here, but Nowitzki has gone from being buried to burying
treys and showing what the fuss was all about in the first place.
Even Nellie hasn't messed him up.
</P>
<P>
   --Defensive Player of the Year: Eddie Jones, Charlotte. He's the
leader in steals, and it's frightening to see what happened to
Charlotte when he was out of the lineup. The Hornets not only were
2-8 when he wasn't playing, but also allowed 8 more points a game
in those 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   --Executive of the Year: John Gabriel, Orlando. He is doing the
unthinkable, rebuilding while remaining competitive thanks to his
hiring of Doc Rivers. And then wait until this summer. Boom.
Hooterville Chic. Waffle Houses are in again.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing act
</P>
<P>
   If the Trail Blazers keep playing the way they're playing and
win the NBA championship, they will have a leading scorer with the
lowest average on an NBA champion since the shot clock was
implemented. Only eight champions since 1955 have had a leading
scorer average fewer than 20 points a game, including three Boston
titlists (1976, 1964, and 1963). The champions with the
least-productive leading scorers were the Pistons, who were led by
Isiah Thomas and Adrian Dantley in their two title years, each
averaging 18.4 points a game. Portland goes into the All-Star
break, incredibly, without a player averaging even 16 points. Steve
Smith is at 15.9. That's not all. Every NBA champ since 1955 has
had at least one player average 35 minutes a game. Portland has
none; two players are at 34.8. That's a testament to their balance
and depth . . . After yet another tough loss, this one to Philly on
a buzzer-beating tip-in by Larry Hughes, the Nets staggered home
for the All-Star break. Then team president Michael Rowe held a
conference call with beat reporters and basically ripped apart
everyone. Rowe called the Nets' performance ``absolutely
unacceptable'' and said that things would change. One thing that's
going to change: his travel plans. Rowe said he would start
accompanying the team on trips and making his presence known
pertaining to hoop matters. As he put it, he will ``interface''
with the basketball operations. But one thing that won't change, he
said, is the status of coach Don Casey. ```I would like to work
with what we have, and I'd like to get through the season,'' Rowe
said. How, exactly, does that square with: ``When I look at how we
play, I hear a lot of explanations and excuses. I have not heard
solutions.'' . . . Hughes, of course, is one of several players
being shopped. Everywhere. ``I think the Sixers are committed to
trading Larry Hughes,'' said Orlando coach Rivers. ``They are
committed to moving him. They're going to contact everyone.'' . . .
This just in from the Staples Center, where the Celtics will
conclude their Western swing against the Lakers Feb. 25. One
seasoned NBA observer reports that the ``game presentation'' is
decidedly understated. And this is from the team that ushered in
the Laker Girls (who are still there). According to the source, the
grating cacophony so prevalent around the league isn't nearly as
bad as one might think in the entertainment capital of the world .
. . By the way, the Lakers are asking fans, in conjunction with the
History Channel, to pick the top moment in the franchise's history.
There are 10 choices, the most obvious to me being the 33-game
winning streak in 1971-72. Other selections include the drafting of
Jerry West and Magic Johnson, the 1980 title, the 1985 title (Pat
Riley's favorite), the 1972 title (the first in LA), the
acquisition of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, West's 60-foot shot against the
Knicks in the playoffs (a game LA lost), Kareem setting the scoring
record, and the 1988 title. The Lakers arrived in Los Angeles for
the 1960-61 season with no real home court and played in whatever
building could accommodate them (high school gyms, a shrine
auditorium). They also had no radio coverage that year.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent fliers
</P>
<P>
   Here's a comforting but on-the-mark comment from Dana Barros as
the trading deadline approaches. ``Everyone is expendable,'' he
said. ``Very few players in this league are not going to be traded,
or are untradeable. If you don't understand that, then you don't
understand the business of the league. There's always that
possibility that anyone can go at any time. I go through it every
year. I'm sure everyone else does.'' . . . No sooner had the
All-Star selections been announced then jilted Jalen Rose scored 20
or more points in four straight games. The Celtics were the last of
his victims last Wednesday . . . Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak said there
was a 60 percent chance the team won't make a deal in the next 11
days. The Lakers are in the market for a backup center/power
forward. Wonder what they'd give for Fortson? . . . And finally
this: Since Pitino has arrived, here is the staggering personnel
count: He has traded for 19 players, signed 16 free agents
(remember William Cunningham?), and drafted five players (let's not
forget Ben Pepper and Kris Clack). Those numbers do not count the
players he released upon arriving (the nine who were renounced to
sign Travis Knight).

LANGUAGE ONE CHALLENGE FACED BY SANG LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Yes, he is different by design. The orange
hair, now trimmed to shoulder length to satisfy his new boss, Dan
Duquette, was no accident of birth.
</P>
<P>
   But Sang Lee is not simply some knockoff cartoon character
imported from South Korea to pitch for the Red Sox. An early
arrival at spring training, the 28-year-old Lee is thousands of
miles from home, separated from his wife and two young daughters,
trying to adjust to a place where he can't speak the language,
sharing a hotel room with a UMass student hired to be his
translator, his guitar his only familiar companion.
</P>
<P>
   Sang Lee isn't afraid to admit he's lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you were in South Korea by yourself,'' he says to a
visitor. ``Then you would understand. Total alienation. The
language barrier is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Seung-Hyun is studying sports management at UMass-Amherst.
He has finished all of his required classwork, but in an
independent study project approved by his professor, Dr. Mark
McDonald, he has been enlisted by the Red Sox to make Lee's
transition easier.
</P>
<P>
   Parky, as he came to be called last summer in Pawtucket, where
he did some work for the Sox, is from Seoul, the South Korean
capital that is also home to Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a superstar in Korea,'' Park says. ``I saw him in the
stadium and on TV, but this is the first time we met face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very unique, the way he dyes his hair. But when you talk
to him, he's kind of an ordinary person. I've known him only for a
week, but he's a very good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Park has a laptop computer with him, and he has called up some
Korean Web sites for Lee. The pitcher doesn't play video games.
``He says they're bad for his eyes,'' Park says.
</P>
<P>
   The two have visited a Korean restaurant in town, but just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``American food,'' Lee says. ``Outback Steak House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He eats everything,'' Park says, ``but he has given up beer.
He knows how important this is for him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Lee has left home to pitch. Before
being signed by the Red Sox, he spent two years pitching in Japan.
The second year was easier. He'd learned some Japanese by then.
</P>
<P>
   Lee understands some English, too, though his preferred modes of
communication are either through Park or by the use of some often
funny pantomimes. Asked if he knows of Fernando Valenzuela, the
Mexican-born pitcher who knew no English when he arrived to play
with the Dodgers, Lee does a dead-on impression of Valenzuela's
pitching motion, complete with an eye-rolling look heavenward at
the top of his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Sox reliever Rod Beck, and Lee tugs at his long locks,
then sketches an imaginary Fu Manchu moustache above his lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jokes with me,'' Park said, ``about playing guitar with Rod
Beck as his drummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he plans to do with a weekend off, Lee rests his
cheek on folded hands. ``Sleep,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, Lee has been working out with a group of
mostly minor leaguers at the Sox training complex here. Signed to a
two-year, $3.35 million deal, Lee is projected to join Rheal
Cormier as a lefthanded setup man in the Sox bullpen, though he
could also begin the season in Pawtucket. He won 20 games as a
starter in Korea in 1995, but he says he was forced to become a
reliever because of a herniated disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's destiny, whether it will be Boston or Pawtucket,'' Lee
says through Park. ``Baseball is so unpredictable. It's obvious
that I'm going to be nervous on the mound when I begin.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has a clear understanding of the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume that I can speak very good English but can't
pitch,'' he says. ``People will ignore me. But if I can't speak
English and pitch very well, people will have some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier does not mask Lee's playful personality. He
is affable and approachable, looking his questioner in the eye even
as he awaits the translation. When he is told that he seems very
natural, he quickly answers, ``Thank you,'' in English, then adds,
also in English: ``Myself, freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He elaborates, with the help of Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pursue freedom,'' he says, ``but I don't break the clubhouse
rules. I don't care about my image. I just want to be myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be an ordinary person. That's why I pursue
freedom. Fans see players on the field and think we are all
traditional because we are all wearing the same uniform. Then
people look at your outside life and seem surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee has already begun long-tossing. A week from Sunday, he will
participate in his first official workout with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not thinking about the hitters,'' he says. ``I have to
focus on myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But major league baseball is the best in the world. That's why
I want to be here. Playing major league baseball is my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was either that or playing guitar in a rock band. Lee smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm addicted,'' he says, ``to my guitar.''

CARRIED AWAY WITH PROSPECT OF WINTER'S END 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The truck leaves Tuesday. Not a day too soon.
</P>
<P>
   This is flatline time for New England sports. The ground is a
depressing mix of ice, mud, and slush and there's so little to
entertain the local sports fan. That's why in Wednesday's editions
of the Globe, we'll cheer you up with the cornball picture of the
Red Sox truck getting packed for Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   The Truck Day photo has become one of those odd rituals that are
so indigenous to New England. On Jan. 2 we show you the L Street
Brownies swimming at Carson Beach. In July we bring you pictures of
the Fourth fireworks fans homesteading on the Esplanade. Labor Day
weekend annually brings photos of the student U-Hauls on Bay State
Road.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Truck Day, signifying six more weeks of winter
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   And what a waste this winter has been.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics officially stink again. It's 15 years and counting,
and there's no indication that the happy days are coming back.
Alleged savior Rick Pitino is the latest victim of a league that
makes it almost impossible to recover once you have fallen. Pitino
is making Dave Gavitt look good. Like Gavitt, Pitino was great in
every job he had before coming to the Celtics, but he's been
strangled by the salary cap and the initial draft lottery that took
him out of the Tim Duncan sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Little Ricky has been downright Gormanesque. He trades Ron
Mercer for Danny ``We Hardly Knew Ye'' Fortson and now he can't
even give Fortson away for the immortal Alvin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are free-falling in the Atlantic Division, bound to
catch New Jersey before they return from their six-game
post-All-Star Western trip. They have no player you'd pay $50 to
see. And Antoine Walker is playing like Elvin Hayes (one shot per
minute, one technical per game) without the talent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could still make the playoffs, but do we really want
to see another one-and-out at the hands of the New Jersey Devils?
Tracking the future of Pat Burns and Ray Bourque will provide
Boston's only April hockey drama. Burns is on the hot seat, ducking
media bombs and long-range missiles fired from Jeremy ``Neutral
Zone Trap'' Jacobs in Buffalo. The humble, heroic Bourque has
eschewed any Yazlike farewell tour and will probably announce his
retirement by mailing 18,000 thank you notes to citizens of Bruins
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have managed to stay in the news, hiring a new
coach, paying $35 million to another defensive back, and releasing
Bruce Armstrong and Ben Coates. Could we not have any tears for
Messrs. Armstrong and Coates? It's pretty simple. The free agency
agreement the players signed means that older players will be
dumped to make room for young stars coming into their prime.
Armstrong and Coates benefitted when they were the young players,
now they are gone because they won't play for (relatively) short
money. It's cold, but it's business. The Patriots really had no
choice in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the performances of the local teams that make this
such a depressing winter. We've also said goodbye to a couple of
opponents who made regular trips to Fenway and Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Patriot season ticket-holders knew that they'd
have at least one opportunity to watch the most prolific passer in
football history. Now there's no guarantee we'll see Dan Marino
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Ken Griffey situation is worse. Baseball's best player, who
was good for six games a year at Fenway for the last decade, may
never be back on Yawkey Way. Griff has joined the National League
Central, and there are no plans for the Red Sox to play the
Cincinnati Reds unless we reenact the 1975 World Series. It is a
huge loss for Sox season ticket-holders and all those who bought
Seattle game tickets to see Griffey. Junior is going to chase Hank
Aaron's home run record and he's going to do it without hitting in
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and now that the Ryder Cup has come and gone, we know that
Tiger Woods won't be coming here for at least three years, possibly
longer.
</P>
<P>
   This is why we look forward to the Truck Day photo. A week from
Sunday, we'll be reading about Juan Pena's arm, Rich Garces's
waistline, and Jin Ho Cho's visa problems, and all will be right
with the world.

STILL A CUP OF CHEER TO CRENSHAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When the rounds of golf don't go well _ as they did
not these past few days _ Ben Crenshaw still manages a smile. It is
genuine, too. He is a man content, perhaps not with his golf, but
certainly with his life, and much of that comfort stems from the
roars he can still hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countless numbers of people called,'' said Crenshaw. ``So many
wonderful letters and correspondence.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a little more than four months ago that Crenshaw was in
the middle of something that still gives him chills: the dramatic
rally by the United States to win the Ryder Cup at The Country Club
in Brookline. For two years, Crenshaw had poured his heart and soul
into the job of captain, and for it to have ended happily as one of
the sport's most memorable days is more than he could have dreamed
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were desperate for a win, we really were,'' said Crenshaw,
who made his playing debut in 2000 at this week's Buick
Invitational. The US had lost the two previous matches and
Crenshaw, perhaps more than he should have, took it as a personal
crusade to win back the Cup. He put his stamp of approval on nearly
every aspect of the proceedings _ from course condition, team
hotel, dinners, transportation, uniforms, to the all-important
captain's picks.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood on the putting green following his first round at
Torrey Pines Thursday, Crenshaw looked far different from the man
who nearly broke down in front of the national media a month before
the Ryder Cup matches. The money controversy had exploded, Crenshaw
ripped into four particular players, and the event seemed headed
for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Crenshaw, the PGA of America, and the players got
through the turbulence, and months later the captain's demeanor is
far different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been home with my three girls,'' he said. ``I've been
very quiet, and that's what I wanted. It's what I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently turned 48, and most certainly he is in the twilight
of a distinguished playing career. Consumed by his captaincy,
Crenshaw devoted little time to practice, which shows in his
performance. He missed the cut in all 13 starts last year, and
since 1997 he has made just seven cuts in 45 tournaments. He shot
76-74 missed the cut here.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Crenshaw's passion these days is course design (his
Sand Dunes in Nebraska has won great praise and is one of the
country's finest) and his resume remains impressive: 19 Tour
victories, including two Masters. Besides, as a passionate golf
historian, he feels honored to be witness to a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle of something that is phenomenal,'' said
Crenshaw when asked about Tiger Woods. ``We never thought the game
could be dominated because there was too much talent. But he has
such a great flair for the dramatics, he is intent on getting
himself better, takes care of himself, and prioritizes his time
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And his mind. Despite all those great aspects, I think his
mind is his greatest asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods's quest to keep a winning streak alive has been the
central story to this Buick Invitational, but Crenshaw was asked
about something that would be even more incredible. The grand slam?
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw didn't hesitate. ``It's possible with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebble for your thoughts
</P>
<P>
   Leftovers from the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am: Before
Woods hit that wedge into the 15th at Pebble Beach for the eagle
that ignited his dramatic comeback, he backed off the shot. The
hole runs parallel to 17 Mile Drive and it seems a driver going by
yelled something unpleasant. ``I just kind of waited, let things
settle down, and regrouped,'' said Woods . . . One of Woods's shots
that was less dramatic but perhaps more skillful came in the third
round after an approach to the brutal eighth hole got caught in the
wind and landed short, in thick hay beside a greenside bunker.
Woods could only guess that the ball he was hitting was his, for it
was buried about 6 inches on the side of a steep slope (since he
was in a hazard, he would not have been penalized if it turned out
not to be his), and he had to do all he could to keep from falling
over backward as he swung. ``I could not have moved that ball a
foot,'' said CBS's David Feherty. Woods safely negotiated the shot
to the green, about 15-20 yards, then two-putted for his only bogey
of the final 36 holes . . . Talk about misfortune, how about the
two amateurs who drew Joe Ozaki and John Maginnes? They were in the
same group, and neither pro made a birdie in two rounds . . . Matt
Gogel not only missed the birdie attempt at 18 that could have tied
Woods, he missed the 2-foot comebacker. That careless stroke cost
him $80,000, the different between being solo second and having to
share second-place money . . . Tom Lehman had longtime caddie Andy
Martinez back on the bag after he took off the Phoenix Open with
leg cramps. While Martinez was recuperating, Lehman broke a winless
stretch that dated back to the end of 1996 . . . At the end of
Round 3, the odds were 2-1 that Woods would skip the 2001 AT&AMP;T, but
now that he's defending champ, all bets are off . . . Sergio Garcia
may be charismatic but he also seems a perfect candidate for
burnout. He missed the cut in Phoenix, barely made it at Pebble
Beach, then packed his bags for an event in Australia. He will
return to the United States for the World Match Play (Feb. 23-27),
and plans to play Bay Hill, TPC, the Masters, and perhaps the MCI
Heritage. Then comes extensive competition in Europe, with emphasis
on the majors. While he gets in trouble on the course, he is
charming off of it. Asked if it were OK to call him El Nino, a
nickname he reportedly did not like, Garcia said, ``Watever you
want to call me. I know my name is Sergio.'' Told that El Nino is a
bad expression in these parts, because of the horrific weather
associated with it, Garcia blushed and said, ``I'm the one who is
playing, I'm not the one who is up there in the cloud. This Nino is
OK, is not going to give you any problems.'' . . . CBS opted to
show the final round of Pebble Beach on tape delay to viewers in
San Francisco and Los Angeles, which backfired when word leaked out
that Woods had stormed to victory . . . Paul Azinger and Chip Beck
were anything but consistent at Pebble Beach. Azinger opened with a
76 at Pebble, then went out in 40 at Poppy Hills. He scorched the
back side in 29 _ eagle, four birdies, nothing worse than a 4 on
his card _ but shot 72 the next day at Spyglass and missed the cut.
Beck bounced back from an opening 80 at Pebble to shoot 66 at Poppy
Hills, but missed the cut after a 73 at Pebble . . . When Woods's
partner for the AT&AMP;T pro-am was announced, most folks said, ``Jerry
Who?'' But Sue Curtin, director of member services with the
Massachusetts Golf Association, knew exactly who Jerry Chang was.
Curtin and Chang were teammates on the Westlake High School golf
team in Ventura County, Calif. Chang went on to Stanford, where he
was teammates with Woods, another product of the Southern
California golf scene. ``Even in junior golf, all you ever heard
was Tiger Woods,'' said Curtin, who once won the girls' division of
a tournament in which the boys' champ was Phil Mickelson, ``so it's
no different now.'' Two other high school teammates of Curtin _
Chris Zambri and Charlie Wi _ are members of the BUY.com Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Quinn
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonderful start to the season for Fran Quinn, who won
the BUY.com Florida Classic. ``My whole goal was to go out and get
myself in position with nine holes to go,'' said Quinn, who had
closed 1999 with a couple of victories on the Asian PGA Tour after
just missing out on his US PGA Tour card. Three shots behind to
start the final 18 last Sunday, Quinn closed with a 66 to overtake
Mark Hensby. Kevin Johnson of Pembroke was third with a final-round
67_274. Geoff Sisk and Pat Bates, like Quinn and Johnson former
Mass. Open champions, finished at 4-over 288, well down the list.
Bates is back after missing nearly all of 1999 with an injury . . .
At the Florida Classic, Lance Ten Broeck took advantage of his
boss's week off to return to golf battles. Alas, he missed the cut
at 74-77. Ten Broeck caddies for Jesper Parnevik on the PGA Tour .
. . The MGA and New England PGA have joined forces with the Boston
Parks and Recreation Department for a four-week indoor golf camp
this winter. Sponsored by Fleet Boston Financial and Pepsi-Cola,
the program is for children who took part in MGA Inner City Camps
at Franklin Park and George Wright last summer . . . With a
contribution of $251,057 following last summer's tournament, the
PGA Senior Tour event at Nashawtuc CC in Concord has given more
than $2 million to local charities. The event will celebrate its
20th anniversary this year (Aug. 25-27), and a verbal commitment
has been secured from 50-year-old rookie Tom Kite.

MURPHY'S FLAW WAS AUDIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Joe Murphy chapter in the Bruins' history book officially
closed Thursday when the hottest team in the NHL _ the Washington
Capitals _ claimed him off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, the 32-year-old right wing became an asterisk in
Bruins lore a week earlier when he was essentially fired for
insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy arrived with a reputation as an oddball, which wasn't
necessarily bad. Al Iafrate marched to his own drummer, too, and
had Iafrate been healthy _ as he was when he dominated the
Boston-Montreal playoff series in 1994 _ his idiosyncrasies would
have been ignored or at least tolerated. But the difference with
Murphy was that he wasn't a team guy _ on a team that desperately
needed cohesion. The Bruins struggled to find chemistry, struggled
to find their identity, and according to sources within the team,
Murphy's diatribes about ice time, his nasty swipes at coaches past
and present, and his inappropriate fits of temper all contributed
to his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Players have beefs with coaches over assorted things. It's not
that rare. But it is rare when it manifests itself the way it did
with Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fee, Murphy's Boston-based attorney, said Murphy wasn't
planning on telling his side of the story unless a grievance is
filed to recoup back pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe decided, and I kind of recommended, he not get into a `he
said, she said' relative to the episode with the press,'' said Fee.
``I didn't think it was going to be productive and I think it might
have been counterproductive in attempting to get him to another
team, which was our first priority. If and when a grievance is
filed, then Joe's side will certainly be made known.''
</P>
<P>
   Fee said the Bruins were wrong to suspend Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still would contend that the fact they suspended him over
this particular incident was an excessive position to take,'' said
Fee. ``I think every player in the NHL ought to be concerned about
this case because if an angry word is exchanged or it's perceived
there's an angry word exchanged between a player and a coach, then
does the club have a right to terminate their contract or suspend
them for three weeks? I think that's the most important question
that came out of this whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other remedies a club has. There are fines, you can
put him on waivers and designate him for assignment to the minors,
there are a number of things they can do. They took a position of
suspending the player and I don't agree with the suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   Fee bristled at suggestions that Murphy might benefit from
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a doctor,'' said Fee. ``He's a hockey player as far as
I'm concerned. I'm not a psychiatrist and I think it's a dangerous
suggestion because it's unfounded and based on innuendo and
opinions that aren't medically sound. If Joe needs anything, I'm
sure he'll find a way to obtain what it is he needs if he needs
anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fee thinks Murphy needs is a fresh start, which he has with
the Capitals. It could be an ideal situation for Murphy, since
Michael Jordan owns the sports headlines in Washington these days.
Whether Murphy will blend in better with the Capitals remains to be
seen. Coach Ron Wilson seems no more inclined to put up with
insubordination any more than Pat Burns was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people leave him alone,'' said Fee, ``and let him play
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Close calls
</P>
<P>
   Games should be called more closely down the stretch, as
referees will abide by a league edict to monitor obstruction and
goalie interference, among other things. ``There's too much
slashing going on right now,'' said Colin Campbell, the NHL's dean
of discipline. ``What does a team do when you slash a guy once and
nothing happens, then a guy does the same thing with the same force
and he breaks somebody's arm? You get one side saying, `Look, our
guy never does anything like that. It was just a single, not a home
run.' The other team says, `Yeah, well, he's gone for eight weeks.'
The guys who have the puck all the time and take the routes where
they're going to the net like Doug Weight get hit more. It's not
right.'' Campbell acknowledged that the tighter crease has altered
how players operate around the goalies. ``For about six years, the
defensemen could hack and whack and shove players out of the way
and guys were doing their best to stay out of the crease,'' he
said. ``Now players fall the right way (on the goalies) and they've
got it figured out.'' . . . The Canucks received some bad news when
top scoring defenseman Adrian Aucoin was lost for five weeks with a
sliced tendon on the middle finger of his right hand. Aucoin was
hurt against Calgary last Wednesday when the skate of a Flames
player cut through his glove . . . The Capitals continued their
roll Thursday night, shutting out the Canadiens in Montreal, 1-0.
Beating the Habs is hardly a feat these days, but the victory
boosted the Capitals' unbeaten streak at the Molson Centre to eight
games (7-0-1), and the shutout by Olaf Kolzig was his 15th,
surpassing Jim Carey as the team's career leader. ``It feels nice
but he probably did it in only a couple of years,'' said Kolzig.
``I did it in 10.'' . . . Cross-promotion on the Super Bowl and the
blockbuster hit ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' appeared to pay
off for ABC. The network's telecast of the NHL All-Star Game last
Sunday received a 23 percent jump in ratings compared with last
year's game, broadcast by Fox. Wonder how many people would watch
if the game was actually any good?
</P>
<P>
   Broadway bullies
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to good matchups, nothing would be better than
watching the Devils and Rangers go at it in the playoffs. Consider
that the Devils are unbeaten in 19 straight regular-season games
against the Rangers _ but the Rangers have never lost a playoff
series to New Jersey. ``Nineteen games is a lot,'' said Devils
goalie Martin Brodeur. ``You should get confidence from that, and
the other team should get discouraged. But for us, all that will go
right out the window if we play them in the playoffs. Everyone is
going to be telling us that we've never won against these guys in
the playoffs and the next thing you know, we're thinking about
that. That's because the playoffs are a different season.'' As good
as the hockey is, the sideshows are almost as entertaining with
these teams. Last Wednesday, Devils pest Claude Lemieux got into it
with Rangers coach John Muckler after Lemieux slashed Rangers
defenseman Brian Leetch. Lemieux gave the officials enough grief
that they ejected him. On his way off the ice, Lemieux and the
65-year-old Muckler yelled at each other, and it spilled over after
the game. ``He couldn't hit his way out of a paper bag,'' said
Muckler. ``I've seen him fight, he fights like a girl.'' When told
of those comments, Lemieux said, ``I want to see that paper bag so
I can put it over his head and make him better-looking. But I can't
fight him. I'd be embarrassed to fight a senior citizen.'' . . . No
announcement has been made, but it appears that Buffalo goalie
Dominik Hasek may not retire at the end of the year. Hasek had said
this would be his last season because he wants to move his family
back to the Czech Republic, but he is rethinking his position after
a groin injury sidelined him for half the year. ``I like to be on
the ice,'' said Hasek. ``I like to stop the puck and feel this
winning feeling. The situation is completely different than in the
beginning of the season. I was out for a long time.'' . . . The
Flyers, much maligned the last few years because of goaltending,
have denied rumors about acquiring Hasek. ``Bleeping ridiculous,''
was how general manager Bobby Clarke put it. ``He's scheduled to
make $9 million. We've got to do new contracts with (Eric) Lindros
and (John) LeClair. How many guys like that can you have?''
</P>
<P>
   All choked up
</P>
<P>
   Montreal forward Shayne Corson has dealt with colitis for 18
years. A few weeks ago, Corson thought he had cancer of the
esophagus, which killed his father at age 45. Corson found out that
he actually had a hiatal hernia, which causes acid buildup and
trouble swallowing. It can be treated with medication or surgery.
``There have been days where I felt like I was going through
hell,'' said Corson. ``I read up on so many things, went through so
many medical books trying to find out what was wrong. It drove me
crazy.'' Now the 33-year-old is finally relieved to know he'll be
all right. ``It felt so good,'' he said. ``You can fix that
problem.'' . . . When Jacques Lemaire left New Jersey to take over
as Montreal's senior hockey consultant, it was assumed that he
would eventually take over as general manager from Rejean Houle.
But Lemaire said he has no interest in the GM job. ``Why would I
want to do something that isn't fun?'' said Lemaire. ``If I was
ever going to coach (or be a GM) again, I'd probably go somewhere I
would enjoy the work. Not here. Montreal is different. The media
here is so competitive. Look at all the guys who've coached here
before, like Pat Burns. They don't want to come back, either.''
Lemaire acknowledged the change in Montreal, with the team having
such titanic struggles. ``Something is heavy _ and I know the
players feel it,'' said Lemaire. ``It's difficult because sometimes
we see a player we want, someone who could help us, and we hear he
won't come to Montreal. He'd rather play in Phoenix or somewhere
else.'' . . . Speaking of the Habs, defenseman Vladimir Malakhov is
in big trouble. He hasn't been able to play because of a knee
injury but apparently he's well enough to go skiing, which is a
violation of his contract. He has been suspended without pay . . .
Thirty days to the trading deadline. Let's hope the Bruins will
make a move that doesn't involve the coach.

TOM LANDRY, 75, DALLAS COWBOYS COACH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Landry, the taciturn Texan who coached the Dallas Cowboys
for their first 29 seasons and led them to five Super Bowls, died
Saturday night in Dallas. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Landry died at Baylor University Medical Center, where since May
he had periodically undergone treatment for acute myelogenous
leukemia, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was head coach of the Cowboys from the team's inception
in 1960 through 1988, and he created a stir in the National
Football League with innovative schemes and his team's success.
After six mediocre seasons, including an initial 0-11-1 year when
the team played before small crowds at the cavernous Cotton Bowl,
Landry's Cowboys ran off 20 consecutive winning seasons, an NFL
record. During that span, Dallas won 13 division titles, made 18
playoff appearances and won two Super Bowls in five appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark fedora and conservative suit, Landry was
the cool, stoic man on the sideline for the franchise that under
his leadership became known as America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's 270 victories are the third most in NFL history behind
Don Shula and George Halas. His overall record as the Cowboys' head
coach was 270 victories, 178 losses and 6 ties for a .601 winning
percentage. Landry entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his overall success in Dallas, Landry's last three
seasons there produced records of 7-9, 7-8 and 3-13. The team was
bought in February 1989 by its current owner, Jerry Jones, and
Landry was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's contributions to pro football were significant. As a
player-coach and then as an assistant coach for the Giants in the
1950s, Landry devised the 4-3 defense, a formation featuring four
down linemen and three linebackers. It remains a staple of pro
football. Landry's defensive units, featuring Roosevelt Grier, Andy
Robustelli, Dick Modzelewski and Jim Katcavage on the line, Sam
Huff as the middle linebacker and Emlen Tunnell and Jimmy Patton in
the secondary, played a major role in the Giants' successes of the
late 1950s. With Landry running the defense, the Giants won three
Eastern Conference titles and an NFL championship in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas he created the umbrella-like flex defense, and his
Dallas coaching staff was the first to use computers to gain an
edge in scouting, preparation and game planning. He reintroduced
the shotgun formation to pro football, and his offenses presented
multiple formations that confused defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm, the longtime Cowboys president, once said of him,
``He provided the leadership that set our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wade Landry was born on Sept. 11, 1924, in Mission,
Texas. He played fullback at Mission High School (his team
outscored opponents by 322-0 in his senior year) and entered the
University of Texas. After playing in the 1942 season, under the
renowned coach Dana X. Bible, he was off to the Army Air Forces. He
would fly 30 B-17 missions over Europe as a member of the 8th Air
Force in Europe in World War II and survived one crash landing.
</P>
<P>
   Discharged in November 1945 as a first lieutenant, Landry
returned to Texas and played fullback and a bit of quarterback,
behind the all-American Bobby Layne; he also played defensive back
for the Longhorns. He won all-Southwest Conference honors as a
junior and was a co-captain as a senior. He played on Texas teams
that won the 1948 Sugar Bowl over Alabama and the 1949 Orange Bowl
over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After playing for a year with the New York Yankees football team
of the All-America Conference, Landry joined the New York Giants of
the NFL in 1950. He was a Giants star through the 1955 season as a
left defensive halfback, playing on the same side with the Hall of
Fame safety Tunnell. Landry intercepted 31 passes with the Giants,
returned three of them for touchdowns and was named All-Pro in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Giants, under the veteran head
coach Steve Owen, who had only a few assistants, Landry was already
showing leadership. ``I was playing left defensive halfback, and I
thought someone really had to coordinate us back there,'' Landry
would recall. ``If the end moved out into the flat, I had to know
where I was going and where Em Tunnell was going to go, and so on.
So I kind of just took it upon myself at practice to direct a lot
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry became a player-coach, handling the defense, when Jim Lee
Howell was named the Giants' head coach in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as a player after the 1955 season and then served as
the Giants' defensive coordinator from 1956 through 1959, teaming
up most of that time with the offensive coordinator Vince Lombardi,
later the revered Green Bay Packers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince was a pure teacher, but he could not get what he wanted
off films as quick as Tom,'' Wellington Mara, the Giants' owner,
once said. ``In fact, there were few people who were as quick a
study as Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara tried to hire Landry as the Giants' head coach in 1960. But
Landry took the Cowboys' coaching job instead. He was living during
the off-season in Dallas and knew the men building the expansion
team _ Clint Murchison Jr., the owner, and Schramm, the general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Landry remembered that when Schramm offered him the job, ``I
said to my wife: `Oh, well, we might as well try it. We'll probably
be fired in two or three years but what the heck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Lee Roy Jordan once said: ``He taught that if you
depend on emotion and you lost that, the result will be
disappointing. If you play on execution and knowledge, you won't
have those valleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry was known as an emotionless coach who kept a distance
between himself and his players. But describing his last meeting
with his Cowboys players, he wrote: ``This was going to be even
harder than I thought. I tried to clear my throat but a huge lump
remained. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's dismissal from the Cowboys hurt him deeply. He once
wrote: ``People say you have to know when to retire, which is a
dumb thing to say. If you want to go out on top, yeah, it becomes
important when you quit. But I wasn't afraid of that. And I wasn't
worried about getting fired. I knew the risk. To me, it's not an
ego thing. I enjoy coaching. I enjoy helping people achieve
something. But it's all over now. And I can't worry about things
over which I have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry is survived by his wife of 51 years, Alicia; a son, Tom
Jr.; and two daughters, Kitty and Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Landry often spoke of his Christian faith. During and after his
football career he worked nationally for the Fellowship of
Christian Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has the ability outwardly to appear very level, but he is
human,'' Schramm once said of him. ``I know some of the losses must
have torn him up pretty good inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The folded arms on the sideline. The rugged, set jaw. The
fedora.
</P>
<P>
   Landry once said of his headgear: ``My hats did give me an
identity. In fact, if I had a dollar for every time someone has
seen me bareheaded and said, `I almost didn't recognize you without
a hat on,' I could have bought the Cowboys myself.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TOM LANDRY'S CONTROL OF THE COWBOYS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was known as Ol' Stone Face, and on the sideline it was easy
to see why. However well or poorly the Dallas Cowboys were playing,
Coach Tom Landry's expression under his snap-brim fedora never
changed. But that's the way he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is a matter of having people look at you and gain
confidence, seeing how you react,'' he once said, alluding to his
Cowboys players. ``If you're in control, they're in control.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 70, six years after Tom Landry stopped coaching and four
decades after he had flown 30 missions as a B-17 pilot based in
England during World War II, that control was still there. When the
single-engine Cessna he was piloting in 1995 started sputtering
over Ennis, Texas, he calmly landed it in a dirt field next to a
high school. He, his wife, Alicia, and two other family members
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no apparent injuries or damage to the plane,''
federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, Landry's control never wavered. He was considered a
defensive guru for having invented the 4-3 alignment as a defensive
back and player-coach for the Giants. With the Cowboys, he
developed what is known as the flex defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as complicated as it sounds,'' defensive end Harvey
Martin once said. ``We just plug all the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Landry sent in every play to the Cowboys quarterback
(Don Meredith, Roger Staubach or Danny White) so that he would know
what to look for as the play developed. On a running play, he
checked the blocking at the point of attack. On a pass play, he
scanned the opposing team's pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to see me as a cheerleader,'' he once said, ``that
would mean I was only watching, instead of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Landry, who died Saturday night, was always thinking _ about
football. After a game in Texas Stadium heat that hovered above 100
degrees, he was asked why he had not taken off his sports coat, now
soaked through with perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I forgot,'' he said with a sheepish grin.
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone else, Landry built the Cowboys into America's
Team as one of the National Football League's flagship franchises.
For the first 29 years of the Cowboys' existence, he not only
coached the team, he also constructed it. He educated the assistant
coaches, notably Mike Ditka and Dan Reeves, who would be head
coaches elsewhere. He picked and polished the players.
</P>
<P>
   Not just the obvious draft choices, but obscure free agents like
wide receiver Drew Pearson and safety Cliff Harris, who developed
into All-Pro players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Landry's not a yell-type leader; he's almost like a
father, someone you really want to please,'' Pearson has said. ``He
can give you this subtle look at the right time, and it's worth a
thousand words. There's nothing phony about him. Just being around
him, I learned so much about football _ and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny White once remembered a Cowboys meeting when illegal drugs
were beginning to infest pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Landry told us he didn't care if we didn't win a game,
but that we were going to get rid of any drug problems we might
have,'' White said. ``That told me how he feels about people. He
would rather change a person's life for the good than win football
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes,
Landry had a philosophy beyond X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is played with the heart,'' he said. ``You don't
have to drink or swear or hit people in the face when they're not
looking, but you do have to be tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's teams won. When the Cowboys' current owner, Jerry
Jones, unceremoniously fired him in 1989 after purchasing the
franchise for a reported $140 million, his 250 victories were third
among career NFL coaches, behind George Halas and Don Shula. His
Cowboys had won 2 Super Bowls, 5 conference championships and 13
division titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst scenario,'' Landry said of his abrupt
dismissal, ``but I'm not bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry had too much dignity to be bitter, but the day after he
was fired, he broke down during a farewell speech to his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have lasted only five minutes,'' Danny White said,
``but time stood still.''
</P>
<P>
   Time stood still then for the Cowboys' alumni, too, especially
Bob Lilly, the Hall of Fame defensive tackle on their Super Bowl VI
champions. When Lilly learned of Landry's firing, he said, ``A lot
of old Cowboys are crying tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And now those old Cowboys are crying again.

LONGTIME CRITICS AND MANY POLICE OFFICIALS AGREE: END ABUSES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Striking an uncharacteristically harmonious and
conciliatory tone, longtime critics of the police like the Rev. Al
Sharpton joined law enforcement officials from across New York
state in a gathering Saturday to examine what could be done to
combat police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Police chiefs, lawyers, legislators, civil libertarians, clergy
members and police union officials from Long Island to Buffalo
answered the call of Norman Siegel, the executive director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union, to hold a summit meeting at the
Center for Worker Education in Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   While the summit meeting highlighted many of the participants'
differences on the solutions, it was clear that those who attended
agreed there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be open-minded,'' Police Chief John C. Nielsen of
Albany said in an interview Saturday. He acknowledged that he was a
bit nervous about attending the conference. The attraction, he
said, was the chance to listen to other ideas about how to improve
his department's relationship with its community.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speakers _ Siegel, Sharpton and former Mayor David
Dinkins _ avoided attacking the New York City police and made only
fleeting references to the way Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has handled
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue I think that has gone so long ignored that we
have begun to reap the impact of ignoring it,'' Sharpton told an
audience of about 200. ``It should have the attention of everyone,
including police, because this is not an anti-police movement, but
it is anti-police brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants spoke about police brutality in their communities,
asked questions, took notes and compared statistics and programs.
Many of the participants hammered home civil rights themes,
comparing the struggle to fight police brutality to the civil
rights movement and the struggle for sexual equality.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the law enforcement officials who attended the event
said they supported many of the suggested ideas, including
increasing diversity in their departments and requiring officers to
live within the municipalities that they police or providing
incentives for them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   There were also differences of opinion, on subjects like
civilian complaint boards. While many community leaders wanted more
civilian oversight, police officials generally said discipline
should come from within the department.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting came at a time when police agencies across
the state are coming under increasing scrutiny because of highly
publicized allegations of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event highlighted a rift within the New York
department itself, as the city's main police union did not
participate, while the leading minority organizations for officers
jumped at the opportunity. Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the
city's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the largest police
union, was invited to be a keynote speaker but declined because of
scheduling conflicts, the event's organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the suggestions of additional oversight, Eloise
Dowdell-Curry, the president of the Syracuse Urban League, said,
``I don't care how many layers of bureaucracy and special
prosecutors you put on top of things, there will be nothing that
you can do until you eliminate the `blue wall of silence,''' a
reference to a belief that officers tend to protect one another to
avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. James Shepard of the Rochester police acknowledged the need
for change to eliminate brutality. ``But you must return to what
Martin Luther King said: `Do not judge me by the color of my skin,
judge me by the content of my character,''' ant Shepard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't judge me by the color of my uniform, but by the content
of my character.''

<P>
   &UR; WHILE I WAS GONE &LR;  By Sue Miller. Ballantine, $12.95. The
heroine of this fictional meditation on marital fidelity is a New
England veterinarian torn between her complex feelings for her
husband (a minister) and her equally complex fantasies about
another man (an old housemate). The result is ``a beautiful and
frightening book, one that many readers will find it difficult to
forget,'' Jay Parini wrote in The New York Times Book Review last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THROWIM WAY LEG: Tree-Kangaroos, Possums, and Penis Gourds _ On
the Track of Unknown Mammals in Wildest New Guinea &LR;  By Tim
Flannery. Grove, $14. A celebrated Australian scientist recounts
his many long research excursions into the wilds of New Guinea,
harrowing journeys during which he encountered cannibals, ghastly
diseases, a giant gold mine, shrieking frogs and a hungry 10-foot
black python. He still managed to identify at least 17 new species
of mammals. ```Throwim Way Leg' is more than an account of his
fieldwork,'' D.J.R. Bruckner wrote last year. ``It is an
enthralling introduction to the mountain people of New Guinea _
unimaginably remote, charming, cunning, cruel, subtle and appealing
_ and to their magnificent land.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ORIGINAL BLISS &LR;  By A.L. Kennedy. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
In this novel, a Scottish woman, suffering from a loss of faith and
hungry for love and human touch not to be had from her brutish
husband, falls into a dark romance with a pop-psych guru. ``Kennedy
is a world-class fiction writer'' whose ``characters inhabit her
text in full flesh,'' Thomas Lynch wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RAY CHARLES: Man and Music &LR;  By Michael Lydon. Riverhead,
$14.95. This biography seeks to portray the many faces of the
rhythm-and-blues legend: drug addict, womanizer, blind man, black
man, self-reliant businessman and, above all, musical genius. Last
year the reviewer Nelson George praised ``Lydon's dogged detailing
of Charles' rise, triumphs and bittersweet old age.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SINGERS AND THE SONG II &LR; , by Gene Lees (Oxford University,
$15.95), combines material from the author's 1987 collection of
essays on jazz and popular song, including profiles of Frank
Sinatra and Peggy Lee, with seven new essays on Ella Fitzgerald and
other artists of the pre-rock era. ``The earlier pieces have been
expanded ... to good effect,'' Terry Teachout wrote in 1998,
``while the later ones are of uniformly high quality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY GERMAN QUESTION: Growing Up in Nazi Berlin &LR;  By Peter Gay.
Yale University, $10.95. A cultural historian and Freudian scholar
recalls his youth in 1930s Berlin as part of a Jewish family who
believed themselves to be virtually assimilated. In 1998 the
reviewer Frank Kermode called Gay ``a quietly remarkable character,
civilized, learned, yet incapable of wholly forgetting or forgiving
the hideous cruelties that threatened his life as a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREEDOM SONG: Three Novels &LR;  By Amit Chaudhuri. Vintage
International, $14. These three willfully plotless narratives
explore the allure of everyday life in Calcutta, Bombay and Oxford.
``Chaudhuri is an immensely gifted writer,'' Alice Truax wrote last
year. His novels are ``crammed with breathtaking sentences ... and
melancholy grace notes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SISTER OF MY HEART &LR; , by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni (Anchor,
$13), is the tale of two cousins who grow up in the same
upper-class Calcutta household and whose lives diverge after they
are forced into arranged marriages. In 1999 the reviewer Anderson
Tepper called this an uneven novel but admired ``Banerjee's
poetically embroidered storytelling powers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MR. DARWIN'S SHOOTER &LR;  By Roger McDonald. Penguin, $13.95.
Charles Darwin's assistant aboard the Beagle is portrayed as a
devout sailor who becomes embittered by Darwin's failure to
recognize his contributions to ``The Origin of Species'' and
worried that the scientist was out to prove there is no God. The
result is a ``fully imagined'' novel ``imbued with intellectual
curiosity,'' Emily Barton wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOING TO MIAMI: Exiles, Tourists and Refugees in the New
America &LR;  By David Rieff. University Press of Florida, $14.95. This
civic portrait captures a melting pot in full boil, a city of
competing ethnic communities in the process of being transformed by
its Cuban exile population. ``Rieff gives Miami the treatment it
deserves: an anti-travelogue that tours states of mind and basks in
projected images,'' John Krich wrote in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAVING GRACES: Images of Women in European Cemeteries &LR;  By David
Robinson. Norton, $15.95. The wilting, swooning maidens depicted in
this collection of black-and-white images of mostly 19th-century
statuary embody the Romantic link between love and death. ``The
photographs are beautiful, and beautifully reproduced,'' Sarah
Ferrell wrote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERONICA &LR;  By Nicholas Christopher. Spike/Avon, $12.50. This
tale of a New York photographer who is recruited by the daughter of
a time-traveling magician to rescue her missing father is ``a hip,
sexy, trendy fantasy novel,'' David Guy wrote in 1996.
``Christopher is a superbly lyrical and descriptive writer.''
