UNIVERSITY OF SECOND CHANCES

<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ They left Southern California for towns such as
Reno, Pullman, Wash., and Fort Collins, Colo. Then they returned
home, mostly humbled and looking for a new start, a better
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge became that place. The football program,
despite only three winning seasons in the 1990s, has become a haven
for players coming from bigger schools in more prominent
conferences. Thirteen Matadors, about a sixth of the roster, are
Division I-A transfers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, CSUN's opponent tonight, Eastern Washington, has
only one Division I-A transfer on its roster. Montana, which is
ranked No. 2 in Division I-AA and the Big Sky Conference leader,
has only four.
</P>
<P>
   Several reasons have contributed to CSUN's growing reputation as
Second Chance U., including geography, a quirk in the NCAA's
transfer rules, and fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is luck,'' said CSUN interim head coach Jeff
Kearin. ``They remember us from the recruiting process. We tell
them not to forget us. Also, Division I-A coaches will call us and
say, `Hey, we've got a kid. . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with DeJuan Gilmore and Jermaine Hunsaker,
a pair of transfers from Washington State who are planning to leave
tickets for tonight's game for several former teammates who are an
hour away in Pullman; the Cougars play at 1 p.m. at home against
Arizona and the CSUN-EWU kickoff is 6:05.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsaker, a junior from Pomona, played sparingly at Washington
State and is happy he transferred. Gilmore, a senior from Gardena,
is a little frustrated. He left WSU last January because the
starting running back, Kevin Brown, had two years of eligibility
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, however, was kicked off the team in June when he pleaded
guilty to felony residential burglary. He enrolled at UNLV last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to live with the decision I made,'' said Gilmore, who
rushed for 305 yards and three touchdowns last year. ``I thought a
lot about what happened, but there was nothing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who could have been a starting tailback in the Pac-10
this season, isn't starting for the Matadors. He's playing behind
Jaumal Bradley, the Big Sky's fifth-leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN does have four transfers who start: center Julio Alcala
(Colorado State), wide receiver Terrence Jones (Fresno State) and
defensive linemen Levi Line (Nevada) and Jason Mageo (Oregon
State).
</P>
<P>
   Only Mageo, who came to CSUN because he has a wife and young son
in San Diego, was a starter at his previous school. Not
surprisingly, most of CSUN's Division I-A transfers came to
Northridge looking for more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not feel I was getting a fair chance,'' said Line, a
former Royal High standout who was low on the depth chart at
Nevada. ``I wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of playing right away makes CSUN an attractive choice
for transfers. The NCAA allows players going from I-A to I-AA to
have immediate eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin admits there is a downside to being known as a I-AA
school that is transfer-friendly: A player who is a troublemaker in
the Pac-10 might seek CSUN as a refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 90 percent of the kids we get are really solid people,''
he said. ``We like to think (the coaches) are good judges of
character. We try to make a calculated decision on their chances of
succeeding here.''

FEVER COULD TAKE TAILBACK OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Tonsillitis might cost Cal State Northridge a
vital offensive player for tonight's Big Sky Conference opener.
Jaumal Bradley, a senior tailback who leads the Matadors with 201
yards over two games, stayed at the team's hotel and didn't
participate in a light workout Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley missed practice for the third consecutive day. When
asked if Bradley would be ready for CSUN's game against Eastern
Washington, which is scheduled to start at 6:05 p.m., interim head
coach Jeff Kearin said, ``Highly doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless his fever breaks (Friday) night,'' Kearin said, ``he
can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had a 103-degree fever two days ago. He's also battling
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can barely swallow,'' Kearin said. ``We're going to pump
him full of fluids . . . try some chicken soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, an All-Big Sky first-team selection at fullback last
year, had a career-high 109 yards against Kansas two weeks ago. If
he can't play, DeJuan Gilmore, a senior transfer from Washington
State, will split time with redshirt freshman Alan Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   __ Drink it up: A sure bet would be to take the over on
tonight's game. In the last three meetings between the Matadors and
Eagles, the teams have combined to average 924 yards of total
offense, including 736 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate the game to go deep into the fourth quarter,''
Eagles head coach Mike Kramer said, ``and it will be decided by how
much Gatorade one team has left. There will be a lot of points
scored.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Add Kramer: The coach said he is ``intrigued'' by CSUN and
its run-and-shoot offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't consider us a favorite anytime we face
Northridge,'' he said. ``Last year we played as well defensively as
we could have against them, and Marcus (Brady) was 21 of 28
(passing).''
</P>
<P>
   Brady must have impressed Kramer; he was actually 17 of 22 in
last year's 38-35 Matadors victory.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking ahead: Southern Methodist, CSUN's opponent on Nov.
12, is 0-2. The Mustangs lost 26-0 to Arkansas in their opener and
53-19 to Tulane last week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rankings: CSUN is ranked No. 21 in Don Hansen's Football
Gazette Poll, one of the four major Division I-AA polls. The
Matadors are unranked in the other three. Eastern Washington (1-2)
is unranked.
</P>
<P>
   __ Correction: Due to an editing error, it was implied in
Friday's edition of the Daily News that CSUN defensive back Mel
Miller has been academically eligible throughout the season. Miller
was academically ineligible until Thursday.

EXPERIENCE BOWS TO INEXPERIENCE, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Europeans no longer can ignore the charge
that has hounded them since they arrived at The Country Club six
days ago. They are sadly lacking in Ryder Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least they are lacking in sad Ryder Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
   After the first day of this international showdown in which it
was supposed to serve as fodder for the veteran Americans, the
Green Team owns a dizzying 6-2 lead _ almost halfway to the 14
points it needs to accumulate in three days to retain the Cup. And
the Ryder rookies are largely responsible for that plush cushion.
</P>
<P>
   When captain Mark James's 12-man aggregation arrived here
Monday, it appeared better suited for a debutante's ball than this
crucible for world golf supremacy. No fewer than seven of his
players were first-time callers. Six of them automatically
qualified by finishing among the top 10 in the European PGA Tour
point standings. And James added yet more peach fuzz when he made
Scotland's Andrew Coltart one of his two captain's choices,
bypassing Ryder fixtures Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   Friday James employed four of those newcomers, and all they did
was open their Ryder resumes by helping Europe to four victories
and two halves _ 2 1/2 in both the morning foursomes and afternoon
four-balls.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, their records read thusly: Sergio Garcia 2-0-0,
Paul Lawrie 1-0-1, Miguel Angel Jimenez 1-0-1, Padraig Harrington
0-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   After the astounding comeuppance, James was typically
noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected them to play well,'' he said, ``but you never know
how they're going to do. I don't suppose you can count on (such
success), but they've been playing well and I expected them to keep
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   In James's low-key lexicon, ``well'' is the equivalent of
``extraordinary.'' And in the American camp, it would translate
into ``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, at 19 the most ungrizzled Ryder Cupper in history but
already established as a planetary phenomenon, was at the head of
the parade. He teamed with Swedish veteran Jesper Parnevik to
topple Tiger Woods and Tom Lehman, 2 and 1, in the morning and
outlast Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk, 1 up, in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he claimed Woods, the world's top-ranked player, as
one of his pelts, Garcia's performance couldn't be considered
shocking. But the other rookie contributions were bonuses. British
Open king Lawrie got the day started with a flourish, teaming with
the most venerated European, fellow Scot Colin Montgomerie, to beat
David Duval _ who did perform like the Ryder novice he is, losing
two matches _ and Mickelson, 3 and 2. And only Davis Love's 30-foot
birdie putt on the 18th in the afternoon enabled him and Justin
Leonard to prevent a clean sweep of US foes by Montgomerie and
Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikeliest success story, perhaps, was the
Jimenez-Harrington tandem in the morning as they earned a split
with the heavily favored Love and Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington sat out the afternoon because Masters champion Jose
Maria Olazabal, who had been unhappy with his game and declared
himself unready for morning play, joined the lineup. He and Spanish
countryman Jimenez proceeded to dispatch Hal Sutton and Jeff
Maggert, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought it? The Europeans, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a great team; that's the first thing,'' said
Garcia. ``I think we're doing good, and that's very important
during the Ryder Cup, to be doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't be doing much better. These kids are all right.

OREGON WORRIES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Paul Hackett will coach his 16th game for USC
tonight and a compelling argument can be made that this is the most
critical contest of his brief tenure.
</P>
<P>
   A game against Oregon in September that important? It might
sound crazy, but whatever happens in Autzen Stadium could have a
tremendous impact on the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans win, they can legitimately claim to be one of the
conference favorites, with plenty of momentum to face an
increasingly difficult schedule. If USC loses, it will be viewed as
a slightly overrated team with the prospect of road trips to
Arizona, Notre Dame and Cal in October. And no one will think last
week's San Diego State game was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is the kind of game that alters the
confidence of a team for a season. Hackett certainly thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can win in this environment, that really sends a message
about our football team,'' Hackett said. ``This turns a big corner
for us if we win. Are we good enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important game. This gives us a jumpstart on
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   As proof of the ramifications of tonight's contest, Hackett
believes last year's 17-13 loss to the Ducks effectively ended the
Trojans' hopes of being one of the Pacific-10 Conference's elite
teams and put a damper on the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss, that was very painful,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   One potential pitfall that USC (2-0) believes it will avoid is
the confusion on offense that caused a delay-of-game penalty and
nullified a fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Carson Palmer to
Mike Bastianelli in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown would have tied the game 17-17 instead of forcing
Hackett to go for a controversial field goal that cut the lead to
17-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really shot ourselves in the foot,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer expects to avoid such problems, now that the Trojans run
a simplified plan that combines using a wristband with the plays
and signaling with easier hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that is knowing the signals more,'' Palmer said. ``I
know the system better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (2-1) lost star quarterback Akili Smith, but junior A.J.
Feeley has been extremely solid (seven touchdowns, one
interception) in his first three starts. The defense has also been
above average with the addition of linebacker Peter Sirmon, who
missed most of last season with a torn chest muscle after leading
the Pac-10 in tackles in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a difference on that football team, it's Sirmon,''
Hackett said.

IN MUSEUM FUROR, MAYOR CRITICIZES `CATHOLIC-BASHING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MUSEUM-LEHMAN) 
(lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As lawyers for the city plotted strategies to block a
controversial exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani angrily offered another argument on Friday for why
the show is unacceptable: He said it reflects a widespread
acceptance of ``Catholic-bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   On his morning radio show and at a news conference later in the
day, Giuliani reiterated his disgust for one of the works included
in the upcoming exhibition _ a portrait of the Virgin Mary made
from pornographic pictures and elephant dung _ and said that people
who offend Catholics are let off the hook too easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it comes to Catholic-bashing, this kind of thing is
never treated as sensitively as it sometimes is in other areas,''
Giuliani, a Roman Catholic, said on his radio show, on WABC-AM.
``If this were a desecration of a symbol in another area, I think
there would be more sensitivity about this than a desecration of a
symbol that involves Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor threatened on Wednesday to cut off all city
subsidies to the Brooklyn Museum unless it canceled the exhibition,
which is called ``Sensation'' and is to open Oct. 2. The city gives
the museum nearly $7 million a year in operating expenses _ almost
a third of its $23 million budget _ and has reserved another $20
million in the budget for capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Giuliani warned that the museum could also lose its
lease, because it will not allow children under 17 to view the
exhibition unless they are accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The lease states that museums housed in city-owned buildings
``shall at all reasonable times be free, open and accessible to the
public and private schools'' of the city and ``accessible to the
general public on such terms of admission as the mayor'' sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday, Corporation Counsel Michael Hess had sent two
letters to the museum's director, Arnold Lehman, warning that the
museum ``cannot proceed with the exhibit as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman said Friday night that he had no intention of
canceling the exhibition. He said the museum's board of trustees
would meet early next week to discuss the situation. ``Generally,
the trustees all feel that the museum has a mission to present
important works of art to educate the public.'' Lehman said, ``And
that is the goal of this exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani repeated his warning Friday that the city might try to
take over the museum's board of trustees to stop it from showing
offensive artwork in the future. ``I'm not going to have any
compunction about trying to put them out of business,'' he said at
a news conference in Harlem. ``Maybe that's the best way to
preserve the museum and the good parts of the museum for everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vallone, the Democratic speaker of the City Council,
warned Giuliani in a letter Friday that ``the council will not
allow you to de-fund this organization.'' But Vallone can do little
to stop him, because the City Charter gives the mayor the right to
withhold spending if he thinks it is in the city's best interest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Association of Art Museum Directors, a national group,
released a statement supporting the exhibition. ``Every art museum
in this country is a center for the free exchange of ideas,'' the
statement said. ``If the mayor acts on his intentions, it will set
a precedent that could cripple museums across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the directors of many of the city's prominent museums,
attending a dinner on Wednesday at the Whitney Museum of American
Art, expressed dismay about the mayor's threats, most refused to
speak publicly about the controversy Friday. Many museums rely
heavily on the city for funds.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition that opened at the Whitney this week includes
another controversial work: a photograph by Andres Serrano of a
crucifix submerged in a jar of the artist's urine. But aides to
Giuliani said Friday that they had no interest in quashing that
show.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Levine, the deputy mayor for economic development, said
the Whitney was not in the same category as the Brooklyn Museum.
``The Whitney is not in a building owned by the city, and it has
gotten no money from the city this year,'' Levine said. ``It's a
totally different situation.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arnold Lehman, the aggressive, Barnum-esque director
of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, need not look far for an artistic
expression of what is at stake in his standoff with Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who has vowed to deprive the museum of public money
because of his distaste for an exhibit of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the younger of Lehman's two sons made an
animated film for a class at Dartmouth College. The film, by
Zachary Lehman, is about an artist who struggles to win financial
support for a work of sculpture. Again and again, a committee of
bureaucrats rejects his request for money. Too sexist, they say of
his abstract blob. Too risque, they say. Each time, the artist
changes his sculpture to please the committee, until finally, as a
withered old man, he returns with a perfectly smooth, perfectly
bland rectangular object. It becomes his coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Lehman, 26, now a law clerk for the chief judge of the
U.S. District Court in Boston, said his film's themes were rooted
in years of passionate family discussions about censorship and
artistic compromise _ both of which, he said, are abhorrent
concepts to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My character succumbed to the pressure of money, and look what
happened to him,'' said Zachary Lehman, whose film won a Student
Academy Award in 1996. ``I don't see my father succumbing. There is
no question in my mind. He would not move on this issue, even if
Giuliani offered him twice as much money not to show the exhibit.
He cannot be bought. He cannot be bribed. He cannot be
blackmailed.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Lehman's room for maneuver is constricted by principle,
he has also been hemmed in by his own political miscalculations,
and by his ambition to transform a museum with a world-class
collection but an embarrassingly low attendance rate into a place
where the young and the hip go for cutting-edge art _ and maybe
even a little reggae music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves a show,'' said Louise Hoblitzell, former president of
the board of trustees for the Baltimore Museum of Art, where, as
director for 18 years before coming to Brooklyn in 1997, Lehman
raised eyebrows and attendance with exhibits featuring Dr. Seuss
characters and Babar the elephant.
</P>
<P>
   When Lehman, who is 55, tells the story of how he decided to
embrace this show, which includes dead animals suspended in
formaldehyde and a portrait of the Virgin Mary with a breast
fashioned from elephant dung, he cites the importance of the art _
but also the long line he saw outside the first museum that staged
the exhibit, the Royal Academy of Arts in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stretched all the way out to Piccadilly, I have to say,''
Lehman said in an interview. ``I absolutely knew that there would
be controversy _ and that the controversy would help to bring more
audience into the museum _ but when they got there the reward would
be that they'd be seeing really first-rate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman got more buzz than he had bargained for, something that
surprised colleagues in Baltimore who knew him to be, as one former
City Hall official there put it, ``fabulously political.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman seems genuinely stunned by the fury of Giuliani's
response to the exhibit. On Wednesday, Giuliani said he would cut
off all city subsidies to the museum _ nearly a third of the
museum's operating budget _ unless Lehman ``comes to his senses.''
Lehman said he never dreamed that the mayor would take such offense
to the exhibit, and he is clearly distressed that his determination
to raise the museum's profile has instead led to the museum's
greatest crisis in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of gutsiness I don't have,'' he said. ``I'm not an
arsonist.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that Lehman is in a fight with a mayor known to play
rough, his friends and families said they cannot imagine his taking
the politically expedient road. In interviews, they repeatedly
returned to the same point as they discussed how his deceptively
genial personality is likely to shape his response to his greatest
professional test.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman is, they said, a man with a tenacious intelligence, a man
for whom there is no compromise when it comes of his essential
beliefs _ one of those being in the right of free expression. And,
they warned, if Giuliani has calculated that he can intimidate
Lehman into canceling or radically altering the exhibit, he has
picked on the wrong museum director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough as nails,'' a close friend, Peter Marzio, director
of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, said of Lehman. Pamela
Lehman, his wife of 30 years, said: ``Where does it stop if someone
can tell you what to show? I think he would do anything to work it
out, but I don't think he will back off of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman recently explained why he is so determined to go forward
with the exhibit, which includes works by young artists such as
Damien Hirst and Marcus Harvey. ``It's part of the challenge that
artists of our time present us with, because they all seem to abhor
complacency and they look at the world differently from you and
me,'' Lehman said.

METS SPIN CONTINUES WITH 3-2 LOSS TO PHILLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Chipper Jones was safely ensconced in another
country and there had been a team meeting designed to soothe their
minds and boost their spirits. But the Mets continued their
tailspin Friday night with a 3-2 loss to the Phillies. A game that
had seemed in their grasp was ripped away in a bullpen collapse
that is becoming frighteningly familiar for the Mets as they free
fall toward the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The news got worse when the Mets glanced at the scoreboard. The
Reds had come back to beat St. Louis, 5-4, so their lead in the
wild-card race shrank to one game with eight games to go. The Mets
surely do not need to be reminded that they blew a one-game lead
with five games to go last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of gas right now and we've got to try to fill up,''
Mike Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a painful three-game sweep by the Braves, the Mets
wanted to use the Phillies as balm for their wounds and recover, in
the process, just a little of the peace of mind the Braves had
snatched from them this week. The news was cheering that the Mets'
bats still had some life in them after they were outscored by Jones
alone in the Atlanta series and the Mets smacked nine hits Friday
night. The smiles faded quickly in the eighth inning, however, when
the bullpen _ the reliable cog of the machine that had rolled
through the second half of the season _ broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook walked the leadoff batter, pinch-hitter Kevin
Sefcik, and appeared to yell at the umpire as he was yanked from
the game. Then, after Turk Wendell had retired the two batters he
faced, Armando Benitez _ the fireballing closer _ came in to finish
off the inning. Instead, he gave up a run-scoring double to Bobby
Abreu that tied the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Benitez, who did not get a chance to appear against
Atlanta but has been a sturdy closer since John Franco was injured
during the summer, gave up a single to Mike Lieberthal. Abreu,
charging hard, scored what proved to be the winning run and you
could almost hear the air rushing out of the Mets' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had lost some of their edge after Atlanta _ Piazza
admitted the team was tight and Al Leiter wondered whether the
gloominess would hover for long. But they needed only to face the
Phillies to remind them of just how bad things could be. Once
thought to be a prime rival with the Mets for the wild card, the
Phillies had lost 23 of their previous 27 to plummet so far out of
the race that Mets fans easily outnumbered Philadelphians at
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets were never able to blow open a lead on the
Phillies, and their play seemed without energy. There were few
mistakes, calm pitching by Masato Yoshii and a burst of offense
that had been missing in Atlanta. From the second inning _ when
Robin Ventura, who was just 2 for 10 in Atlanta, hit a solo home
run to right field _ it was clear that, while the Mets weren't
exactly going to bludgeon the Phillies, they were not facing
Atlanta. They had no trouble hitting, but never strung together
enough to get a runner past second base.
</P>
<P>
   But being the better team has not mattered in recent days. The
Mets have been busy reminding others _ and reassuring themselves _
that the Braves made mistakes too, but that Jones' home runs
quickly erased them from memory, while the Mets' blunders were the
stuff of headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief lapse in the fourth inning, when the Phillies
got their first hit and scored their first run, Yoshii was masterly
in his seven innings. He allowed just four hits and two walks and
used his pitches to induce a series of groundouts and pop ups.
Except for a walk and a single in the seventh inning with two outs,
the Phillies did not threaten again until the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had won his previous five starts and during that span he
had an earned run average of 1.64. If there is a postseason in the
Mets' future, Yoshii _ banished to the bullpen in July _ may in
fact be their trustiest starter. He even scored his team's go-ahead
run on John Olerud's fifth-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a one-run game and it's one of those hold on games,''
Valentine said. ``There were some wasted opportunities and there
weren't any later in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly must be grave doubts about the bullpen now. Cook
yielded the game-winning home run to Jones in the first loss to the
Braves, and his walk turned into the game-tying run here. And
Benitez had an ERA of 1.84 entering the game, but at a most
horrible time, he lost the cool that has defined his season.
</P>
<P>
   When the final out was recorded, the Mets barely moved off the
top step of their dugout. They were standing still, motionless _ no
doubt wishing the season could be stopped in time, too.

MCCAIN CAMPAIGN REVEALS HULL ENDORSEMENT OF BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER, KRIS MAYES AND JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In a maneuver unusual even for the aerial dogfighting
of Arizona politics, former combat pilot Sen. John McCain announced
Sept. 24 that Arizona Gov. Jane Hull had endorsed a rival, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's office, clearly taken by surprise, denied that the
governor had endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The twists and turns over the long-awaited Hull endorsement
capped a week of bitter skirmish ing between the two camps, with
each attempting to control the timing of the announcement to its
own advantage.
</P>
<P>
   According to staff people in both camps, Hull would like to wait
for Sept. 28, when Bush will be in Phoenix for a fund-raiser, to
make her formal declaration for the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing the news Sept. 24, McCain may have blunted the
impact of the announcement next week, when McCain will officially
kick off his presidential campaign with a four-day tour in which he
will lay out themes for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain statement was as simple as it was surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I was disappointed to learn of Jane Hull's decision
to endorse Gov. Bush,'' the late-morn ing statement said, ``I am
extremely confident that the statewide grass-roots organization of
committed Arizonans that supported me in three consecutive
elections to the U.S. Senate will bring me to victory once again in
our state's presidential primary next February.''
</P>
<P>
   But Francie Noyes, Hull's press secretary, said there had been
``no official endorsement at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign apparently learned of Hull's decision to
endorse Bush on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the kind of secret that keeps very well around the
State house,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's national director of
communications. ``Our understanding is they have scheduled an event
for (Sept. 28).''
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts from both camps, McCain called Hull the
morning of Sept. 24 to apologize for an aide's comment published
that day in ``Political Insider,'' a column in The Arizona
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Howard Opinsky, was asked to comment on reports that
Hull might endorse Bush next week. He declined to speculate, saying
that Hull ``could drop dead of a heart attack next week, too.''
</P>
<P>
   During the brief but reportedly friendly conversation, McCain
asked Hull whether rumors that she planned to endorse Bush were
true. Hull said yes, according to sources close to the McCain
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain expressed concern about the timing of the endorsement,
which would come in the middle of his announcement tour. McCain
will begin in New Hampshire and stop in key primary states before
wrapping up the trip with an appearance in Phoenix. Hull told
McCain she could not delay the endorsement because the event with
Bush had been planned for months, McCain campaign sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes would not comment on reports that Hull refused to delay an
endorsement of Bush, although she said the fund-raiser had been
planned months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been in the works for a very long time,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull aides said privately that they were delighted that McCain
issued the statement, suggesting it would spread the news of the
endorsement over the weekend and into next week, giving the story a
greater chance for national publicity, a hope that underscored the
animosity be tween the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that McCain had underestimated Hull, thinking she
wouldn't have the courage to chal lenge the entire elected GOP
estab lishment in Arizona and endorse a candidate from another
state.
</P>
<P>
   One McCain loyalist agreed that it was bold for Hull to endorse
a non-Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be tantamount to Jerry Colangelo rooting for the
(San Francisco) Giants in the National League pennant race,'' said
Arizona House Speaker Jeff Groscost, a Republican from Mesa.
Groscost is a paid staff member of McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush said the governor would be pleased to have
Hull's endorsement when and if she officially announces it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has worked hard to have the endorsement of 23 gover
nors, and he would certainly wel come the endorsement of Governor
Hull,'' said Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A Hull endorsement of Bush would not come as a complete surprise
to observers of what has been a traditionally lukewarm and
sometimes contentious relationship between Hull and McCain, and
between their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Hull was left off an invitation list for McCain's Oct.
4 fund-raiser at Bank One Ballpark, despite the fact that GOP
presiden tial candidates routinely invite the governor to their
Arizona events. The McCain campaign sent an invitation after The
Republic reported the snub.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush and Hull have been close political allies.
Last September, Bush hosted a fund-raiser for Hull as she was
gearing up her re-election bid for governor. The event raised
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's support for increased edu cation spending, subsidized
health care for children of the working poor and tax cuts is
comparable to positions Bush has taken.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also backed Hull on her efforts to expand the region's
guest worker program, which seeks to legally import Mexican workers
to work primarily in agriculture and service-industry jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have suggested that a Hull endorsement of Bush could
damage McCain's standing in Ari zona, where he already trails Bush
by double digits in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the Feb. 22 Arizona primary would almost certainly be a
fatal blow to McCain. Sandwiched between early contests in Iowa and
New Hampshire and the delegate-rich California primary on March 7,
Arizona is a crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has staked his cam paign on strong showings in New
Hampshire and South Carolina lead ing to a win in California.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, McCain sought to delay the Arizona primary by
several months in an attempt to avoid devoting precious campaign
resources to a costly fight on his home turf. The ploy was defeated
by the Arizona Legislature. &QL;

NEW JERSEY ABORTION LIMITS NEAR AS COURT BATTLE GOES ON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Barring a dramatic last-minute intervention by
the state's highest court, New Jersey will begin Sunday to enforce
a law that requires girls under age 18 to notify at least one
parent before being allowed to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   As abortion clinics and state health officials scrambled Friday
to prepare for the new law, judges in the Appellate Division of
state Superior Court denied an emergency appeal from abortion
rights advocates, allowing the law to take effect as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a
coalition of New Jersey doctors and abortion clinics, swiftly
submitted yet another appeal to the state Supreme Court and
expressed hope that the seven-member panel would rule on the matter
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to the ultimate option,'' said Lenora Lapidus,
executive director of the state ACLU, after Friday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Marguerite T. Simon rebuffed
the ACLU's request to block the state law temporarily. Her ruling
appeared to catch abortion providers and health officials off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides scrambled to comply with the measure's requirements,
including the distribution of fact sheets, which detail the steps
staff members at clinics must take to ensure parental notification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is not ready,'' said Phyllis Kinsler, president of
Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey. She added: ``As a
provider, I do not have the fact sheets that I am required to have
to give to a patient before we can provide an abortion. Even if
they drop it through my skylight tomorrow, when exactly was I
supposed to train my staff to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   State officials scrambled Friday to distribute the information.
Friday afternoon, the state Department of Health and Senior
Services announced that it had just mailed the sheets to 700
hospitals and clinics statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has also established a phone line for health care
providers, he said, and a 24-hour number for the public is to be
available on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of 39 states, and the sixth in the Northeast,
to have passed laws requiring pregnant girls either to gain
parental permission or notify at least one parent before having an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike like similar laws in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Pennsylvania, which require parental consent for a minor to have an
abortion, New Jersey's law demands only that a pregnant girl tell a
parent before proceeding with an abortion, said Jessica Waters of
the National Abortion Federation, a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Several exceptions allow a girl to avoid notifying a parent.
Girls who can demonstrate to a judge that they are ``sufficiently
mature'' can bypass the law, as can girls who have been abused by a
parent.

ROOKIE'S HOMER LIFTS YANKEES OVER DEVIL RAYS, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rookie Alfonso Soriano's first major league hit could
not have been more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   He led off the 11th inning with a home run Friday night to give
the Yankees a dramatic 4-3, 11-inning victory over the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays before 44,932 delirious fans at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano, a slightly built infielder who hit 17 home runs at
Triple-A Columbus before being recalled on Sept. 11, drove an 0-2
pitch off left-hander Norm Charlton into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trailed by two runs in the ninth inning when Darryl
Strawberry showed why he has become so valuable since being
recalled on Sept. 1. Blasting a 1-1 pitch by Roberto Hernandez off
the center-field wall, Strawberry scored Ricky Ledee to pull the
Yankees within 3-2. Then, Chuck Knoblauch, a Devil Rays killer all
night, singled to score Strawberry and send the game into extra
innings. It was Knoblauch's fourth hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With Oakland getting trounced by Texas, 12-4, Friday night, the
Yankees would have clinched a playoff spot whether they won or
lost. Playing down the significance of simply making it to the
playoffs, the Yankees assured reporters before the game that there
would be no postgame celebration after the feat was accomplished.
And there wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win the division,'' said Derek Jeter, who went
0 for 4 Friday night. ``You don't celebrate when you just clinch a
playoff spot. Our goal is to win the American League East. That's
something to celebrate. Obviously, you want to get into the
postseason. It's a big accomplishment, but our mind is set on the
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was outstanding all night. While the rest of the
Yankees struggled against Bobby Witt, who entered the game with a
5.96 earned run average, Knoblauch hit a leadoff homer in the first
inning, his career-high 18th home run of the season, and went 3 for
4 before the right-handed Witt was lifted with two outs in the
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching change, which brought Albie Lopez to the mound, was
more precautionary than reactionary because the other Yankees did
little against Witt. They had chances in the second and third
innings, when runners advanced to second base, but each time they
were stranded. Witt left after surrendering Knoblauch's third hit
with eight strikeouts, including two each against Chili Davis and
Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez was not as hard to solve. The ball seemingly
placed on a tee, he was rocked for seven hits and three runs
through the first five innings before settling down and holding the
Devil Rays without a hit over the sixth, seventh and eighth. Unlike
Saturday's loss to Cleveland, Hernandez, who in that game walked
five batters in seven innings and was hit hard as well, was not
wild Friday night. Barring an intentional walk of Fred McGriff, he
walked only two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had his problems in the third, which he began by
walking Jose Guillen. Guillen moved to second on a passed ball,
then went to third when catcher Jorge Posada, seeing Guillen stuck
between the bases, ill-advisedly threw to second.
</P>
<P>
   The misjudgment turned out to be irrelevant because Tony
Graffanino tripled to the left-center-field gap to tie the game,
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino put Tampa Bay ahead, 2-1, by scoring on a sacrifice
fly by Miguel Cairo, and the next three Devil Rays teed off on
Hernandez. Dave Martinez smacked a line-drive double to the corner
in right field. Jose Canseco slammed a single to center field that
nearly took off Hernandez's ankles en route, and Fred McGriff hit a
hard single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Yankees, Knoblauch and Jeter were able to
turn a double play on Herbert Perry's ground ball to close the
inning at a 3-1 deficit.

IVAN GOFF, 89, WRITER AND PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia) (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ivan Goff, co-creator of the television series ``Charlie's
Angels'' and co-writer of the films ``White Heat,'' ``Captain
Horatio Hornblower'' and ``Man of a Thousand Faces,'' died on
Thursday at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 89 and lived
in Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With his writing partner for 39 years, Ben Roberts, Goff turned
out scripts for 25 feature films starring actors like James Cagney,
Gregory Peck, Clark Gable, Doris Day, Joan Crawford and Mario
Lanza. Among their credits were ``Midnight Lace,'' ``Shake Hands
With the Devil,'' ``Band of Angels,'' ``Green Fire,'' ``King of the
Khyber Rifles,'' ``Come Fill the Cup'' and ``Goodbye, My Fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff and Roberts began their successful partnership with a
highly publicized disaster: their 1947 play ``Portrait in Black,''
about two former Army sergeants dreaming up a red-hot murder
mystery while killing time in their barracks during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which revolved around the murder of a shipping
magnate, opened at the Booth Theater with great fanfare and a cast
led by Clare Luce. But Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times spoke
for most critics when he dismissed the play as ``exasperating,''
``sophomoric'' and ``claptrap.'' When a film version of ``Portrait
in Black'' starring Lana Turner was released in 1960, it, too,
displeased the critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Goff and Roberts turned to screenwriting and won an
Oscar nomination for their screenplay for ``Man of a Thousand
Faces,'' which starred Cagney as the silent movie star Lon Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the pair turned to television, writing a series
called ``The Rogues'' for Dick Powell, David Niven and Charles
Boyer. ``The Rogues'' dealt with the exploits of a charming gang of
international swindlers more concerned with stylish manners than
big scores.
</P>
<P>
   They also produced ``Mannix'' (1967-75) and created ``Charlie's
Angels'' (1976-81).
</P>
<P>
   Goff served as president of the screenwriters council of the
Screen Writers Guild, predecessor of the Writers Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Goff was born in Perth, Australia, the son of two concert
musicians. Starting at 15, he began writing shipping news for a
local newspaper, but became dissatisfied by the remoteness of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Australia made me crazy,'' he said in an interview.
``It took a month for a book to get to Australia, a year for a play
and forever for an idea.'' When he was 20, he and a friend sailed
for the United States and wound up in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s, he sold articles to London newspapers, and
in 1936 became Hollywood correspondent for The London Daily Mirror.
His service in the Signal Corps introduced him to Roberts and a
career in television and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Goff's marriage to the former Natalie Draper ended in divorce in
1964. He is survived by three sons, Kevin of Los Angeles; Trevor of
Malibu, and Brian of Santa Monica, and a brother, Peter, of Pacific
Palisades, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even by Hollywood standards, the partnership with Roberts was
unusually close. ``I haven't bought a book since I started
collaborating with Roberts,'' Goff once said. ``I just steal his.
We call him the Bard of Ivan.''

KARL MENGES, 91, EXPERT ON CENTRAL ASIAN LANGUAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis., Germany) (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Menges, an authority on the strategically important
languages of Central Asian peoples in the former Soviet Union, died
last Monday in Vienna, Austria. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Menges, who picked up new languages almost as casually as most
people buy groceries, had been active conducting research at the
University of Vienna until a few months before his death, his son,
Constantine, said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Menges told a reporter that he handled ``over 50
languages.'' On another occasion, he said the number was 41. His
son remembers his having said that he spoke, read and wrote ``about
24 languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from English and his native German, Menges said he felt
most comfortable speaking any of the Altaic languages; the group
includes 30 Turkic, five Mongol and six Tungusic subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Although generally unknown in the United States, the Altaic
languages are, next to Russian, the most important languages spoken
in the former Soviet Union. For that reason, federal grants became
available during the Cold War for scholars doing research in them.
</P>
<P>
   Menges taught for 36 years at Columbia University. When the
program in Altaic languages there was expanded to include Uralic
languages in 1954, Grayson Kirk, then Columbia's president, said
that because of the Soviet Union's domination it was ``even more
imperative that we develop the maximum understanding of the various
languages and cultures throughout the area as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Uli Schamiloglu, a professor of Turkic language and culture at
the University of Wisconsin, explained: ``The area in which these
languages are spoken was thought to be the soft underbelly of the
Soviet Union. If there was going to be a revolt, it was supposed to
start there, so we were being told to get to know the area. No one
had as much knowledge of it as Professor Menges. Speaking all those
languages, he was a rare bird.''
</P>
<P>
   So unfamiliar were many of the languages that in 1940 Columbia
University invited Menges to teach Slavic languages. It was only
after he arrived that Columbia officials discovered he was teaching
the Altaic languages.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Germany in the early 1930s, Menges, who called himself
a Catholic centrist, joined the anti-Nazi resistance, distributing
literature, organizing meetings and speaking out in public forums.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, he was arrested by the Gestapo, interrogated for five
hours, charged with treason and temporarily released pending a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving Gestapo headquarters, a friendly former fellow
student who had joined the Gestapo told Menges secretly, ``If I
were you, I wouldn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Menges promptly made his escape over the Czech border. After
part of Czechoslovakia was annexed by the Nazis, he fled to Turkey,
where he continued to teach and pick up additional languages.
</P>
<P>
   He published 15 books and hundreds of articles. He retired from
Columbia in 1976 and started a second teaching career at the
University of Vienna. A revised edition of his book ``The Turkic
Languages and Peoples'' was reissued a couple of years ago by a
German publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Heinrich Menges was born on April 22, 1908, in Frankfurt,
Germany. He received a degree from the Lessing Gymnasium and then
pursued graduate studies at the Universities of Frankfurt and
Munich. He earned a Ph.D. from Berlin University in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Menges is survived by his son, Constantine Menges of Washington,
and one grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career at Columbia, Menges said that when he
arrived in the United States he was the only person in this country
who could read and speak Uzbek, the language of Uzbekistan, then a
Soviet republic in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``a colleague of mine also knows it.''

SHEFFIELD WILL GO TO WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield learned a new position, became one
of the few team spokesmen, played with injuries that landed other
players on the disabled list, and is on the cusp of batting .300
with 30 homers and 100 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for the first time in his career, he's going to begin
an offseason workout in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the Dodgers haven't seen the real Gary Sheffield,'' the
Los Angeles Dodgers left fielder said. ``I have a lot more things
to offer than I've been showing. I like putting pressure on myself.
I just feel like I can dominate for two months straight. I think
when the rest of the team isn't hitting well, I can be the guy to
carry us for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who ices his knees and shoulder after every game,
said conditioning is a big part of dominating next season. He
weighed 228 pounds last spring. A large part of that had to do with
offseason shoulder surgery, which limited his workout ability, but
Sheffield said he could have done more to trim down to 210.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he hasn't been comfortable with the strength of his
shoulder, his legs, and that's conditioning,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``He's been great, outstanding. He's a special
player. You don't do what he's been able to do in his career
without working at it. It never hurts to be in better shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield rose to prominence in 1992 by hitting .330 with 33
homers and 100 RBI with San Diego. He's motivated by what people
say he can't accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt it helped me when people said I couldn't do
anything,'' Sheffield said. ``They said, `He can't steal bases,' so
I went out and stole 20 bases (last season). Now they say I can't
steal 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late `90s and going into the new millennium, they want
to see power and speed. I want to do everything better in every
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield entered the weekend series with San Diego hitting .299
with 29 homers, 93 RBI and a team-high 96 walks while batting third
on a team that rarely moves runners over and lacks frontline
table-setters.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: The Dodgers honored Class-A San Bernardino outfielder
Chin-Feng Chen and right-hander Eric Gagne, who pitched most of the
season with Double-A San Antonio, as their organizational player
and pitcher of the year, respectively. . . . For a
major-league-record 14th time, the Dodgers went over the three
million mark in attendance with the crowd of 36,356, bringing the
season total to 3,008,101. The Dodgers have drawn at least two
million in 27 straight and 35 overall seasons, both major-league
records.

EDITORIAL: STRIKING DOWN ABORTION BANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rendered three crucial
rulings on abortion Friday, striking down as unconstitutional the
so-called ``partial birth'' abortion statutes in Nebraska, Arkansas
and Iowa. The language of the Nebraska and Iowa laws was nearly
identical to definitions used in the federal partial-birth abortion
ban proposed in Congress. The court found that all three state laws
placed an undue burden on abortion rights by outlawing even the
procedures most commonly used prior to fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings show that efforts to undermine abortion rights
through the partial-birth ruse will not stand up to constitutional
review. Missouri, which was not a party in the three cases but is
in the 8th Circuit and will be governed by Friday's rulings,
recently enacted an extreme anti-choice law in the guise of a
partial-birth abortion ban. Gov. Mel Carnahan showed political
courage in vetoing the measure, but the Legislature overrode his
veto. The 8th Circuit decision has now shown that Carnahan was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states have passed statutes prohibiting partial-birth
abortion. These laws have been blocked by federal and state trial
courts in nearly every instance in which they have been challenged.
The proponents usually say their legislation is aimed at a single
method used in late-term abortions. But in fact, the statutes are
so broad that they can be used to criminalize the most common
abortion procedures performed at any point, even prior to fetal
viability.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's new Infant's Protection Act is among the most extreme
of these laws. It does not describe any particular medical
procedure, but makes criminal any abortion in which a fetus is
partially outside the cervix, which may occur in common procedures
used in the first trimester of pregnancy. The law provides no
exception to protect a woman's health. Under the law, the woman, as
well as her doctor and anyone who takes a ``substantial step'' to
aid the abortion, could be charged with a Class A felony. What is
most frightening is that the statute would allow people accused of
anti-abortion violence to claim as a legal defense that their acts
were necessary to protect the fetus from an illegal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   By setting a clear precedent that will render the Missouri law
invalid, the 8th Circuit court will protect women's rights and help
shield doctors in that state from a dangerous invitation to
anti-abortionists to use terrorism and violence.

GONZALEZ, SELE LEAD RANGERS CLOSER TO TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers thrust the final dagger deep into
their enemy once and for all. No one pronounced the Oakland
Athletics dead, but only the faintest heartbeat remains.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom suggests that the Rangers' 12-4 victory last
night at The Ballpark in Arlington decided the American League
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably over,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro said,
``but until we clinch ...''
</P>
<P>
   That could occur as early as tomorrow. The Rangers extended
their lead on the fading-out-of-sight Athletics to 61/2 games and
reduced their magic number to three with only nine games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez drove in five runs on the strength
of three powerful swings that produced only the 10th three-home run
game in Rangers history, and right-hander Aaron Sele (18-8)
surrendered only one unearned run during a gallant, seven-inning
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and kicked our \Rbutt\S _ no ifs, ands or
buts,'' Athletics first baseman Jason Giambi said. ``They've been
struggling, but Texas woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   It took only a game-tying, run-scoring single by second baseman
Mark McLemore during the fifth inning before the Rangers unleashed
their fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like somebody let an animal _ a hungry animal _ out of
its cage,'' Palmeiro said. ``We needed a spark like that, and I
think this team responded.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore's single scored shortstop Royce Clayton from third
base, and Gonzalez hit the first of his three home runs off
right-hander Gil Heredia (13-8) only minutes later. Gonzalez's
404-foot blast on a first-pitch fastball gave the Rangers a 4-1
lead, and Sele put the Rangers on cruise control with five
consecutive scoreless innings before departing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McLemore and Juan Gonzalez flat out took this game
over,'' Athletics catcher Mike Macfarlane said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton joined the power display with a two-run
homer of his own during the Rangers' six-run sixth inning, and
Gonzalez punctuated it with the second of his two-run homers off
right-hander Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, he put us on his shoulders and said, `Let's go!' ''
McLemore said. ``He's been known to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez received a curtain call from many of the 40,207
spectators after hitting No. 3 off left-hander Ted Kubinski during
the Rangers' final at-bat. Gonzalez made his way to the top step
and received his well-earned ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for a big night like that for a long time,''
Gonzalez said. ``It's a special night for us because we needed it.
It was a very important game and a big win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   This victory relaxed what appeared to be a tense ballclub that
lost four of its previous five games at The Ballpark to the
sub-.500 Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole ballclub feels relieved,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``The first four innings, we all were pressing. I saw a
ballclub where everyone was trying to hit a five-run homer. All of
a sudden, after we took the lead, it seems all the confidence that
we've shown all year came back instantly.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Few parents could have missed a tongue-in-cheek advertisement
for ``binge beer'' in 17 newspapers this month that was signed by
the presidents of 113 colleges and universities. Intended to alarm
parents about the ``thousands of college students'' who ``binge,''
it was a novel effort by universities to get parents involved in a
dialogue with their children before they leave home. It is
estimated that half the students who engage in high-risk drinking
in college begin drinking heavily in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is promising evidence that college presidents are taking
this issue more seriously than they have in the past. The most
recent survey of college students by the Harvard School of Public
Health describes 43 percent of American college students as ``binge
drinkers.'' Binge drinkers are defined as students who have
consumed five or more drinks in a row at least once in a two-week
period.
</P>
<P>
   But college administrators are sending out confusing mixed
messages. College students are often advised in alcohol education
classes to pace themselves at one drink per hour. But since
research has shown students often attend social events for five
hours at a time, that rate would fit the definition of binging,
making the students both responsible drinkers and high-risk
drinkers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are increasingly adopting the so-called ``social
norms'' approach to college drinking, which was pioneered by
Northern Illinois University in 1990. It uses an intensive media
campaign on campus to correct students' exaggerated perceptions
about the degree of heavy drinking among their peers. This approach
is well designed for a group that is swayed by peer pressure and
wary of authorities who preach about the dark side of drinking.
Schools like Northern Illinois University and the University of
Arizona that use the approach have reported a decrease of about 20
percent in the number of heavy drinkers on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing parents into the discussion at an earlier stage and
informing students about the moderate drinking behavior of their
peers might not change the attitudes of the heaviest boozers. But
it just might work with the majority of college drinkers.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   As he struggles with economic ills and an unpopular war in
Congo, Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, is cracking down on the
independent press and its ability to question his authoritarian
rule. The most egregious violations of human rights were committed
against two journalists who were detained and tortured by the
military in January. Mark Chavunduka, editor of The Standard, a
weekly newspaper, and Ray Choto, a reporter for the same paper,
were taken into custody by the military after they published a
report about the arrest of 23 members of the army who were plotting
an overthrow of the Mugabe government.
</P>
<P>
   The two journalists were severely beaten, tortured by electric
shocks and brought near drowning by having their heads submerged in
containers of water. The brutal treatment was conducted in an
attempt to force them to reveal their confidential sources about
the failed coup. Neither man would give up his sources. A court
ordered that the men be released to civilian authorities, but they
have been charged under the colonial-era Law and Order Maintenance
Act, which makes it a crime to publish false information ``likely
to cause fear, alarm or despondency.'' If convicted, they could
face seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Chavunduka, who is a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University this
year, will have to return to Zimbabwe for a hearing on Oct. 4. He
has appealed to the country's Supreme Court on grounds that the
charges are unconstitutional. International human rights and
journalistic groups have demanded that all charges against him and
Choto be dropped. But Mugabe has criticized the news media and the
judges who urged the journalists' release. The independent press in
Zimbabwe is small and deeply threatened. Unless the Mugabe
government reverses course and brings the torturers to justice,
this harrowing case will be proof that the government is willing to
destroy basic freedoms to silence dissent.

   Now that President Clinton has vetoed the Republicans' $792
billion tax bill as expected, Congress and the White House can
settle down to the difficult business of negotiating on next year's
budget. Time is short. With the budget year starting officially in
less than a week, few of the spending bills needed for the start of
the fiscal year have even passed Congress. Washington seems poised
for another last-minute showdown or a series of continuing
resolutions to keep the government going.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who rejected any tax cut before other more pressing
matters are resolved on Capitol Hill, reflected how much the
political world has changed in recent years. Tax cuts were once as
popular as kissing babies and knowing the words to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' The problems with this tax bill became
obvious in August when members of Congress went home to find that
for many people their anti-tax rhetoric had a stingy ring to it.
Cutting taxes for the already rich began to sound like cutting
benefits for everybody else. Moreover, stimulating a booming
economy with a tax cut could stir fears of inflation and trigger
higher interest rates, economic developments that can cause near
panic in millions of people who watch the Dow like a relative's
heart monitor.
</P>
<P>
   This week the president noted correctly that the Republican bill
he vetoed was ``too big, too bloated,'' burdening the economy while
rewarding the rich, the lobbyists and campaign contributors. The
veto, however, was the easy part. The president now has a far more
difficult task of finding common ground with a Congress that
prefers the politics of Clinton-bashing. It might help that
Clinton's veto statement had less venom than expected, an unwritten
White House invitation to focus on a decent budget package and a
more reasonable use of the federal surplus. Congress and the White
House should find some agreement on how to preserve Medicare while
relieving prescription drug costs for the elderly, protect Social
Security, retire debt and, as political dessert, offer any modest
tax cut with what is still available. Clinton's veto message
Thursday rightly urged Congress not to ``throw in the towel'' or go
home early while these more complicated matters, especially
Medicare and Social Security, remain untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the senior
Democrat on the committee, could push for a ``down payment'' on
Medicare reform. It would offer Moynihan a crowning achievement
before next year's retirement and provide Roth with a crowing point
for what is expected to be his toughest re-election campaign. The
season for working out areas of agreement on these matters is now,
while the president has the budget bills as leverage and before
next year's elections turn complicated issues into political bumper
stickers.

BROWN ONE CLOSER TO 20
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a drama-less season on the field, the Los
Angeles Dodgers finally have some little off-Broadway thing that
could give meaning to a few of their remaining eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Kevin Brown, thanks to his pitching and his bat,
has a chance to be the Dodgers' first 20-game winner since Ramon
Martinez did it in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed one run in eight innings and drove in a run to
beat his old team, the San Diego Padres, for the first time in
three tries. The Dodgers' 5-1 win at Dodger Stadium on Friday also
pushed them past the Padres into third place in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   In his other two starts against the Padres since signing on with
Team Fox for seven years and $105 million, Brown was 0-2 with an
8.05 ERA. That included a horrific nine-run outing in San Diego on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Brown allowed five hits and struck out eight. He
walked one.
</P>
<P>
   The win leaves Brown (18-8) with one more start at San Francisco
Wednesday, and if he wins, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Brown
will most likely be brought on three days rest in next Sunday's
season finale at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Brown won 21 games with the Texas Rangers in 1992. His
next-highest total is 18, which he also accomplished last season.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the opportunity to win 20 games doesn't overshadow
the Dodgers' dismal season, but it does demonstrate how well Brown
has pitched on a team that has managed 73 games.
</P>
<P>
   And while Brown shut down the Padres' lineup with another
awesome display _ he was 7-2 with a 1.74 ERA in his previous 12
starts _ it was his sacrifice fly in the seventh inning that gave
the Dodgers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre led off with a walk, stole second and went to
third on Paul LoDuca's single to left. One of the Dodgers' many
bugaboos this season has been their inability to score runners from
third with less than two outs, but Brown took care of that. He
lined a Sterling Hitchcock (12-13) pitch deep into left field to
allow Beltre to score.
</P>
<P>
   A one-run lead late is usually enough for Brown, but the Dodgers
broke it open with three runs in the eighth. Eric Karros gave the
Dodgers a two-run lead with his team-leading 109th RBI, a single
through the right side of a drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Devon White smashed a two-run homer to right
off reliever Carlos Reyes. White's 13th homer gave the Dodgers a
5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' first two batters reached _ singles by Quilvio Veras
and Tony Gwynn _ and they took a 1-0 lead when Reggie Sanders
grounded into a double play. The next time San Diego had a base
runner was on Veras' two-out single in the sixth. After the
run-scoring double play, Brown retired 15 straight, including six
by strike out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers weren't exactly lighting up Hitchcock, but they did
break through for a run in the third inning. However, it took four
hits to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young led off with a single but was caught stealing
(actually, picked off) for the 21st time in 71 attempts.
Grudzielanek followed with a single and eventually scored on Raul
Mondesi's two-out single to right as the Dodgers tied it 1-1.

1996 LOSS TO D.C. HAUNTS GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As the Los Angeles Galaxy prepares to face
D.C. United tonight at the Rose Bowl, many players wonder what
might have been had L.A. won the inaugural Major League Soccer
championship in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In MLS' most memorable match, the Galaxy blew a 2-0 second-half
lead in the MLS Cup at Foxboro, Mass. United's Eddie Pope knocked
in the game-winner, finishing a Marco Etcheverry corner kick with a
header to the near post to give D.C. a 3-2 sudden-death overtime
victory.
</P>
<P>
   More triumphs followed for United. There was another MLS
championship in 1997 and U.S. Open Cup, CONCACAF Champions Cup and
Interamerican Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, meanwhile, hasn't been able to return to such
heights. It has gone through two coaches, two playoff disasters, a
change of ownership and earned the reputation of winning in the
regular season, but not championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering it's only been four years, I wouldn't compare us
with the Cleveland Indians or Utah Jazz, other pro teams that have
found postseason disappointment in the 1990s,'' said striker Cobi
Jones, one of four Galaxy players left from that '96 team.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you guys are the ones asking the questions and making
the comparisons, not us,'' he said. ``It was a tough game to lose
and it became the league's first big rivalry, but it's too early to
give us that label. The Indians and Jazz have been at it a lot
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but others can understand the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the fans and media; we haven't won anything
yet,'' said midfielder Mauricio Cienfeugos. ``And that perception
is going to remain the same until we do.''
</P>
<P>
   United (22-7, 54 points) and the Galaxy (18-10, 48 points) still
have the league's best rivalry. They enter today's match with the
best records in their respective conferences. If they stay on
course, they could meet Nov. 21 where it all began _ in Foxboro,
site of this year's MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That championship (in '96) is hard to forget, especially when
you're reminded of it all the time,'' said Cienfuegos. ``And now
there's a commercial on ESPN that shows images of that championship
game. It just reiterates what happened. All you hear about is D.C.
United because they won the championship. Nobody ever talks about
the second-place finisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos said the '96 game certainly had a psychological
effect, one that the Galaxy won't rid itself of until it wins it
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (the '96 loss) definitely may have turned the faith
of our team and organization,'' Cienfuegos said. ``But we can't do
anything about it now. We didn't win it then, but now we have a
chance to go back to the same place and win it in November.''

S.A.T. ORGANIZATION IS SET TO JOIN WEB'S EDUCATION GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 4 grafs at end.) (th)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under threat by the rapidly growing online industry that helps
students prepare for and select colleges, the College Board, the
nonprofit organization that administers the SAT, voted Friday to
create its first for-profit subsidiary in a move to establish a
flashy full-service Web site of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote of the College Board's 24 trustees is a
radical shift for a staid 100-year-old group best known as the
objective overseer of college-entrance exams, thrusting an
institution honored for its dispassionate conservatism into the
big-money world of Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It follows a spate of new advertisement-driven online ventures _
including an upgrade just this week of the Princeton Review's Web
site _ focusing on the lucrative high-school and college market, a
trend that has raised concerns about the commercialization of
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not willing to give up our not-for-profit expertise to
somebody who's just in it for the money,'' said Gaston Caperton,
who took over as president of the College Board in July. ``We have
the right values. We have the right goals. What we have to do is
have the right capital and expertise to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a Web site to cater to a college applicants' every
need, from financial aid forms to SAT tutoring, marks the
convergence of two major trends in education in the 1990s: the
expansion of for-profit enterprises, and the explosion of
electronic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in a world of piranha economics in regard to
education,'' said Arthur Levine, a scholar of higher education who
is president of Teacher's College at Columbia University. ``Every
Wall Street firm, seemingly, has an education department. Venture
capitalists are moving into this very quickly. Any nonprofit that
fails to recognize both the opportunities and the challenges that
come from the digital world is destined for extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   While most experts, including Levine, admired the College Board
for diving into a wave they see as inevitable, some said the
venture presents a conflict-of-interest. The plan calls for
Caperton to serve as the new company's chief executive, and the
trustees to retain majority-control of its board.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pure educational mission, the organization would
now have the added motivation of money. That means trying to sell
products to students lured to the site, say, to register for the
Scholastic Assessment Tests, with the knowledge that a successful
Website could eventually go public and make everybody involved
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Caperton said it had to be a for-profit subsidiary in order to
entice the $10 million he has lined up in initial investments, and
to attract technological talent in a sphere where stock options are
essential to any job offer. But critics were more cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is drawing on their reputation and the
institutional endorsement they've had over the years and using that
to turn a dollar,'' said Scott Rice, an professor of English at San
Jose State University who is writing a book about the influence of
money in schools. ``A testing agency should be purer than Caesar's
wife. That's hardly the case if they're going to enter the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site, www.collegeboard.com, would offer free or
low-cost tutoring for the tests the College Board sponsors and
guidance in navigating the admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   It would be funded in part by advertisers hawking computers,
cars and credit cards, with commercial links for everything from
opening a bank account to buying and selling furniture for dorm
rooms. Eventually, Caperton believes the new site could be used to
train teachers for Advanced Placement courses, or even to teach
those classes to students.
</P>
<P>
   The organization hopes to unveil the Web site by late spring.
Viewers who log on to the .com address now are logged into the
College Board's current .org site.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed venture comes at the conclusion of the most
competitive college-admission season in history. It would join a
flourishing cyber-crowd _ including the test-preparation giants
Princeton Review and Stanley Kaplan _ attempting to cater to that
throng.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to www.kaplan.com and www.review.com,
collegeboard.com would also compete with CollegeQuest.com,
embark.com and CollegeNet.com, all Web sites trying to serve as a
kind of electronic guidance counselor holding students' hands
through the college-selection process _ and making money along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's student loans or computers, a lot of people are
starting up these sites because advertisers want to reach these
kids,'' said John Katzman, the president of Princeton Review, whose
site charges colleges $2,000 to post their sales pitches, and plans
to eventually offer $800 test-prep courses online. ``You're hitting
the most achievement-oriented, brightest high-school seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar trend, some 500 colleges and universities have
contracted with a new company, Campus Pipeline, to run Web sites,
complete with advertising, on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   And Harvard University is currently pondering five paths it
could pursue in cyberspace, including a harvard.com venture that
would attempt to exploit for profit the school's platinum name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rule nothing out,'' Harvey Fineberg, Harvard's provost, told
the Boston Globe earlier this month. ``The boundaries between
for-profit and not-for-profit are much more flexible than they ever
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that the 56 million Americans between the ages
of 10 and 24 have some $278 billion of disposable income. About 5
million students are currently online, a number projected to
quadruple in the next three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The College Board's current Website, www.collegeboard.org, gets
about 50 million hits a month, officials said, and if current
trends hold, online registration for the Oct. 9 Scholastic
Assessment Tests will attract about 1 million students, or one out
of every three test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   But the current College Board site _ which will remain active
for guidance counselors and admissions officers _ is
``old-fashioned,'' Caperton said, filled with ``written stuff that
is put on the net.'' Plans for the new site are far more
interactive, with all the bells and whistles of the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be innovative, aggressive, and use the same
kind of resources our competitors are using,'' Caperton said.
``This is an aggressive step. You've got to be aggressive in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture is a somewhat natural brainchild for Caperton, the
former Democratic governor of West Virginia, whose political legacy
was bringing computers to his state's impoverished schools. After
leaving office in 1996, he also focused on technology when he ran
the Institute on Education and government at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a departure for the College Board, a membership
organization of some 3,300 schools and institutions that meets its
$250 million budget mainly through test-registration fees, dues and
sales of practice-exam books. It remains unclear what the role of
the colleges and other member institutions will be in the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change the culture,'' said Donald M. Stewart,
Caperton's predecessor at the College Board, who ran the
organization for more than 12 years. ``Rather than having people as
volunteer educator-consultants, they'll have to be paid. If their
information and talent and ideas are being tapped for commercial
purposes, then this is a different culture. It's a different set of
incentives to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's unanimous vote was the crucial nod from the board
necessary to start the company, but Caperton must return to the
trustees, possibly as soon as next month, for another vote once the
details are worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete change, but it doesn't take us away from the
business we're about doing,'' said Patricia Martin, a trustee who
also works for the Education Trust, a nonprofit in Washington that
focuses on equality in the move for educational standards. ``I
don't think we can survive in the business that we try to do if we
continue to do business the way we've always done it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center
for the Internet and Society at Harvard, said nonprofit educational
organizations would be going down the wrong road if they tried to
compete with Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is out of balance when you have those who should be holding
down the fort for dot-org and dot-edu all jumping on the dot-com
bandwagon when they see what they have merely as a brand to be
exploited,'' Zittrain said. ``The caution for them is if it isn't
your core mission, you're going to get eaten alive by someone for
whom it is.''

THE GOVERNMENT'S CURIOUS CASE AGAINST BIG TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The administration's decision to sue the tobacco
industry for tens of billions of dollars is based on economic
theory that is as mendacious as it is specious.
</P>
<P>
   The action is based on claims that tobacco producers impose
medical costs on society by selling goods that damage the public
health. Therefore, the theory goes, the public has a right to
relief because of the economic burden tobacco use creates for
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   This claim sounds plausible, which explains why so many tobacco
foes have embraced it without question. It is part of the
anti-tobacco crusade mantra, and has become a cornerstone of
government's efforts to add legal booty to the tax-revenue stream
from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all the available evidence points the other way. When
tobacco's critics make such assertions, they lack convincing
research to buttress such claims.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is substantial support for the
contention that both the tobacco industry and smokers more than pay
the costs of dealing with smoking-related illnesses. The work of
Harvard Law School economist Kim Viscusi stands out, but is only
part of the considerable body of research done by credible
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For those disposed to a fair-minded approach, this view should
be at least as plausible as the claim that nonsmoking taxpayers are
unfairly saddled with smokers' medical bills. It's difficult to
imagine either an industry or a consumer group more taxed than
tobacco producers and their customers. Philip Morris chief
executive Geoffrey Bible put the situation into perspective in
remarks at this year's stockholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excise taxes on cigarettes alone,'' he said, ``contribute more
than $13 billion a year to federal, state and local governments
(and) that's before the industry shells out some 40 percent of it
profits in corporate income taxes....At Philip Morris, we are so
heavily and so unfairly taxed that we were the largest single
(U.S.) taxpayer last year. We have also been among the largest
corporate sources of funds in many states....If the rest of the
country's top 150 companies paid as much to the federal government
as we do, (it) could just about eliminate the personal income
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the equation is the morbidity factor. While
tobacco producers and consumers produce more than enough tax
revenue to pay for their medical care, their habit meanwhile
contributes to their early demise and thus saves the public money.
As recently as June, the Congressional Research Service, a federal
agency, issued a report concluding that premature deaths by smokers
actually saved the U.S. $29 billion annually in pension and
health-care outlays.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Justice Department litigators
deal with this sort of inconvenient data when attempting to prove
the administration's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Factual niceties aside, though, what's most curious about this
initiative from an economic perspective is how it risks killing a
goose that lays such huge golden eggs. Given that tobacco is an
incredibly lucrative source of revenue year in and year out, what's
the point of trying to further weaken its viability as an industry
with another potentially crippling lawsuit?

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ drain energy here.
</P>
<P>
   Information on utility readiness has been gathered by the
government and the electricity trade association, but neither group
will release the reports' raw data, which includes readiness levels
of individual power facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights will probably not go out. And a prolonged
nationwide blackout will almost certainly not occur,'' said
Bennett, a Republican from Utah. ``But in order for the public to
have as much information as possible, the names of all unprepared
power facilities should be released.''
Yet another scam
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Tampa, Fla., has been charged with trying to con
motorists into paying $15 for a fictitious Y2K state identification
card from a nonexistent state agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scheme, Cindy Lou Boyer allegedly sent out
official-looking documents from the ``Florida Agency of Registered
Tags'' to some 2,400 residents in two counties, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The notices, which included specific vehicle information, asked
recipients to pay $15 for a state ID tag magnetically coded with
driving records and personal information, records show. Boyer faces
a felony charge, 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just when we thought the Y2K hype was dying
down, a whole new Y2K computer scare is causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Reports have been surfacing recently about the potential for a
deluge of computer viruses that could be unleashed around the end
of the year. One anti-virus software maker was quoted as suggesting
that ``up to 200,000'' viruses could be released around Jan. 1 _
all triggered by a New Year's date or planned to resemble a Y2K
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well...maybe. But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading anti-virus software makers _ Symantec Corp. and
Network Associates _ have said virus makers will try to take
advantage of Y2K unknowns and create computer chaos. One expert,
Carey Nachenberg at Symantec's Anti-Virus Research Center in Santa
Monica, Calif., was quoted earlier this month using the 200,000
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Nachenberg, chief researcher at the center, said his comments
were taken out of context when he talked about the issue with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nachenberg said he said something like ``could be two, could be
200,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Nachenberg said he does expect Y2K to
spark new computer viruses, but he said he doesn't have any idea
how big the problem will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a handful or more,'' Nachenberg said. ``Your
guess as to how many is as good as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone agrees with the two software companies.
</P>
<P>
   A British software company, Sophos, said its competitors were
using Y2K as a ``scare-mongering'' tactic to sell products.
</P>
<P>
   And ICSA Inc., an independent consulting firm that tests and
certifies anti-virus software, said the problem may not be as
severe as the hype would lead us to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our take is that, while there's a little bit of potential
extra danger, it's nothing extreme,'' said Roger Thompson,
technical director of malicious code research for ICSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly the possibility that virus writers could
exploit the danger,'' Thompson said. ``But anti-virus companies are
all going to be vigilant around that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, four viruses that target the fear or hype
around Y2K already have been released by virus writers ``out in the
wild,'' Nachenberg said. The most common targets Microsoft Corp.
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft customers have receiving bogus e-mail claiming to be
from ``Support &LR; Microsoft.com.'' The e-mail says it includes a
special Year 2000 countdown clock for Microsoft Windows. The
attachment carries a name like ``y2kcount.exe.''
</P>
<P>
   The attachment actually is a Trojan horse program that, when
opened, loads and executes files that steal a user's personal
information _ including password, login and user name. The e-mail
states:
</P>
<P>
   From: support &LR; microsoft.com
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Microsoft Announcement
</P>
<P>
   To All Microsoft Users,
</P>
<P>
   We are excited to announce the Microsoft Year 2000 Counter.
</P>
<P>
   Start the countdown NOW.
</P>
<P>
   Let us all get in the 21 Century.
</P>
<P>
   Let us lead the way to the future and we will get YOU
</P>
<P>
   there FASTER and SAFER.
</P>
<P>
   Area businesses are taking the Y2K virus threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabotage is what it is,'' said Rick Yarnell, director of
internal audits for the Board of Public Utilities in Kansas City,
Kan. ``And all it takes is some 16-year-old out there who just
can't resist the temptation. Y2K is the perfect time.''
</P>
<P>
   To fight back, the Kansas City, Kan., utility, along with
several other companies across the country, is considering pulling
employees off the Internet a day or two before Jan. 1, Yarnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   No outside e-mail would be permitted, unless it was crucial.
Warnings would be posted telling computer users not to open e-mail
attachments from sources they don't recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The BPU plans to upgrade its virus alert software, and beyond
that has been planning security improvements at all pumping
stations and substations. BPU officials don't discuss specific
security measures, Yarnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done what we can, we've fixed everything, we're testing,
we're making our contingency plans,'' Yarnell said.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, 200 to 300 viruses are active somewhere in
the world, said Nachenberg at Symantec. About 45,000 viruses have
been cataloged by researchers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   To combat computer viruses, experts suggest that consumers use
anti-virus software and keep it up-to-date by visiting the software
manufacturer's Web site and downloading updates regularly.
</P>
<P>
   And because viruses most often come as attachments to e-mail,
they suggest that consumers never open an e-mail attachment unless
they know who it came from and why it was sent.
More disclosure
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate's top Y2K watchdog is calling on the Department
of Energy and the North American Electric Reliability Council to
disclose the names of power plants unprepared for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of all electric utilities do not routinely
share Y2K readiness reports directly with the public, said Sen.
Robert Bennett, chairman of the Senate's Y2K committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is no exception. For example, reports made by KCP&AMP;L
to the North American Electric Reliability Council on the utility's
Y2K readiness are not released to the public, but are shared with
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   The documents contain propriety information, utility spokeswoman
Pam Levetzow said, and could give competitors a business advantage.
The more important thing, she said, is that two independent audit
firms have given the utility a Y2K thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Through billing inserts and press statements, every Kansas City
electric utility has given assurances they are prepared for the
Year 2000. But with the country's 3,200 utilities connected to a
national grid, outages elsewhere could drain energy here. MORE

ROUGH RYDER: U.S. FALTERS, EUROPE ROLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ If you've got a life ring, throw it. The
Americans are taking on water and bailing like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup forecast that called for sunny skies and
dispositions has turned mostly cloudy with a threat of tears from
United States captain Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   After the heavily favored Americans fell behind, 6-2, to the
supposed featherweights from Europe Friday, long shadows and faces
dominated the rolling landscape of The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Europe expanded on its 2{-to-1{ morning lead in alternate-shot
competition with a 3{-{ thrashing of the U.S. in the afternoon
four-ball format.
</P>
<P>
   The European partnership of Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia
won two matches each while Tiger Woods, David Duval and Phil
Mickelson all went 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the best player in the world, is now 1-5-1 in Ryder Cup
play. He and Duval, the world's second-best player, lost to Lee
Westwood and Darren Clarke, 1-up, in the afternoon four-ball.
</P>
<P>
   With his Oakleys off in the waning light, Duval played the role
of hacker, hitting a wild drive and chunking a chip on 18. Everyone
was bewildered by his display and by the overall performance of the
U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert were the only American winners
Friday, prevailing over Westwood and Clarke in the morning
alternate-shot.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, while the passionate Crenshaw discussed what
happened, media members took their own shots, directing all
wisecracks toward the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they adjust the handicaps for tomorrow?'' wondered one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Boston. Do you think they'll boo these guys?''
wondered another.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-2 deficit was supposed to be Europe's predicament. Neither
team has been this far behind after the opening day since the U.S.
was down 6-2 in 1987 at Muirfield. Now Europe can retain the Ryder
Cup if it wins only eight of the next 20 matches.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a fight, the referee would be checking the
Americans' eyes, looking for a coherent response. But European
captain Mark James refused to give the opponents a standing eight
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're far too clever, far too solid,'' he said. ``I would
never underestimate their powers of recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other four-ball confrontations, Miguel Angel Jimenez and
Jose Maria Olazabal beat Sutton and Maggert, 2 and 1; Parnevik and
Garcia defeated Mickelson and Jim Furyk, 1-up; and Colin
Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie halved their match with Justin Leonard
and Davis Love III, who prevented a 4-0 European afternoon sweep by
drilling a 30-footer at the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of fight in the red and white, but blue was
more evident because it described the mood of the U.S. team,
suddenly down in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing well, but those guys (Europeans) played
tremendous,'' Crenshaw said. ``That's what happens in match play.
We need to see a few more putts go in.''
</P>
<P>
   All day long, there were shots of adrenaline, games of
one-upsmanship, tit for tat. These guys are better than good. At
the par-4 eighth, Parnevik knocked in an eagle-2 from 140 yards
away, the ball landing and spinning left, directly into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Then Olazabal made a 30-foot birdie putt only to see Sutton
match it with one from 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia pitched one in for eagle at No. 14, where the steady
breeze turned a 534-yard par-5 into an easily reachable hole in
two.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie eagled the hole with a 30-footer, only to watch Love sink
his eagle putt, another right-to-left bender. After it went in,
Love and Leonard went face to face, jawing at each other, caught up
in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, naturally, spliced his presence into the highlight reel.
He executed a flop shot from left of the 10th green that ran smack
into the flagstick, causing an eruption audible all over the
course.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans made too many mistakes and not enough putts.
Mickelson was the tragic figure of the day, losing both of his
matches, the first with Duval, the second with Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefty'' yanked it right on two birdie putts, both from 5 feet
or less, on the 16th and 18th holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to make those putts and just didn't,'' Mickelson
said. ``They started pretty much in the middle of the hole and just
tailed off. They weren't very aggressive strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Parnevik: ``I was really feeling for Phil on that last
hole. I actually hoped he would make it. No one deserved to lose
that match.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how bad it got for the fans: When Mickelson knocked it
close at 18, chants of ``USA, USA'' ensued, even though the
American team had a chance to win a half-point at most.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Love earned at the 18th, rescuing the Americans, who
for part of the day were just trying to save par and face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if we're playing terrible and can't find the
planet, but we're all playing pretty solid,'' Woods said after the
morning round.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Duval nearly drove the 15th green. The only
problem: he was playing the 18th hole, slicing his drive right of
right, out of Brookline and into Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans weren't Yankee doodle dandy in the morning,
either. The only American breakthrough was provided by the least
heralded twosome of Sutton and Maggert, who defeated Westwood and
Clarke, 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' No. 1 combination of Duval and Mickelson were
surprised by Montgomerie and Lawrie, 3 and 2. Montgomerie sank
several key putts and Lawrie did not bogey a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup brings out the best in me, and I'm glad it
does,'' Montgomerie said.
</P>
<P>
   In the premier morning match, Woods and Tom Lehman were upstaged
by Parnevik and Garcia, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery following this foursome was 10 people deep in
places. At the par-5 14th, the entire hole was lined from tee to
green. If you wanted to see one of the shots, you had to time your
jump, have long tiptoes or be equipped with one of the many black
periscopes available for purchase here.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, wandered
into the media dining room in time to watch Parnevik on the big
screen, closing out the match with a 10-foot birdie putt at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Fans came to watch the ballyhooed matchup between the two
youngest stars in golf, but Garcia had a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Europe against the USA, it's not Sergio against Tiger,''
he said. ``Everyone needs to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their intent, the fans were enthusiastic, waving flags,
attempting to rally the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're huge crowds and they all want American to win,''
Lawrie said. ``They're all shouting USA. Obviously it's difficult,
but you just have to play your game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans were water in a sink, they couldn't find the
drain. That's what their putting was like Friday. Lehman's
struggles were typical of the team's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I either misread them or read them correctly and had the wrong
speed. Frustrating,'' Lehman said. ``We let it get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Love felt the same way. He and Payne Stewart salvaged a
half-point in their match with Padraig Harrington and Jimenez when
Love's par-saver at 17 circled the hole and dropped.

CLIPPERS ARE GOING DOWN WITH OWNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>

By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You hereby are sentenced to hard time at the
happiest place on earth ... last place!
</P>
<P>
   That's the marketing battle cry from ``Prisonland,'' which is
what would exist if the Los Angeles Clippers were a theme park.
It's a small-payroll world, after all.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the darkest week in the blistered history of a
franchise that even Ziggy would feel qualified to heckle.
</P>
<P>
   So we have waded through years of refugee horror stories and
decided it's time to embrace the pervasive Clippers-incarceration
analogy. The philosopher who accepted the challenge of pushing this
comparison over the top is David Falk, the NBA's go-to agent.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who deals with more big stars than the late Carl Sagan,
recently was hired by lame-duck Clipper Maurice Taylor. Taylor
happens to be one of the most-promising power forwards in league
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Our inspiration for rolling the word ``captivity'' before you
was provided by Falk's observation of Taylor's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sentence,'' said Falk of Taylor and pausing between
phone-compromised bites of his Thursday lunch, ``will expire on
June 30. If the Clippers don't want to compound the felony, they'll
trade him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence in question represents the final year of Taylor's
initial three-year contract. By now, even the slightly curious fans
should be aware that Falk and Taylor have demanded the
league-maximum contract extension ($70.9 million for the six
seasons following the imminent campaign). Moderately savvy
observers also should know Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling
publicly backed by the teeth-grinding loyalty of his front-office
staff refuses to fork over the loot.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips in a press release attributed to basketball ops V.P.
Elgin Baylor made the obvious conclusion official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Falk issued his law-dog rebuttal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Falk said, ``it all boils down to one
separate thing: he (Sterling) owns the rights to a 70
million-dollar asset (Taylor), and he's going to get nothing for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Clippers can avoid ground zero by executing a trade
before Falk's undisclosed (to the media), pre-training camp
deadline, but they don't exactly have leverage. When asked if
Taylor will report to camp for the Oct.4 check-in, Falk said he's
still hoping his client will be traded by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get a player, someone who can probably start for them
at power forward, and a (draft) pick,'' said Falk, without naming
names. ``They're not going to get anyone great.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if confronted by a sweet deal their loose salary-cap
position would allow, Sterling figures to shoot it down if the
player in question will earn more this season than Taylor's
bargain-budgeted $1.367 million.
</P>
<P>
   What an ugly way to run a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   If measured against the Clipper drama, ``The Shawshank
Redemption'' would be reduced to the status of a buddy comedy.
Before seeking a solution, let's define the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 18 years,'' Falk said, ``what's been the one
constant in that organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sterling, this victory lap is yours. Please run backward.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, an attempt to solicit Sterling's side of this
issue was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Marching on, we are here to assure the casual Clipper doomsday
theorist that the trail for almost every franchise disaster leads
back to the owner's doorstep. If you think the L.A. Clippers have
represented the best personnel intentions of Baylor, you're as
unplugged as the Sports Illustrated writer who referred to Elgin's
brain as processed cheese food.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives with this Sterling character?
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to win, but it seems safe to reason that losing
doesn't bother him enough if at all.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't bothered him enough to re-sign seven former Clippers
who were top four picks in lotteries the franchise has had the
dubious thrill of visiting since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But the current mess smells worse than all of the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips now have Lamar Odom and Michael Olowokandi aligned
with Taylor in what could have been the best young frontcourt in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sterling has instructed his beleaguered employees to
question Taylor's true value. If he's worth 71 million scoots, why
did the team win just nine times in 50 games last season? Why did
he show up out of shape last season and average only five rebounds
per game?
</P>
<P>
   But if he's not worth the risk, why will a more historically
astute franchise pay him the max next year? And if Taylor is
allowed to leave, can they acquire a player of his caliber to
replace him? No. Who will be your first offensive option? Who will
be the recipient of Odom's superlative passing skill?
</P>
<P>
   If Sterling's hackneyed strategy is sound, why do the Clippers
ride the lottery pony almost every June? Employee morale rivals
that of the poor jokers who were paid to assemble the Ford Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's value is not determined by last season's stats and a
post-lockout 10 pounds around the midsection. Taylor's value is
determined by what the NBA market will bear.

   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ terms and treaties.

<P>
   At the partnership's labor-issues seminar Friday, United
Steelworkers of America political director Bill Klinefelter said
denial of fast-track support for Clinton is the high card in
organized labor's hand _ and members aren't hesitating to play it.
</P>
<P>
   The steel industry has been hit especially hard by foreign
trade, Klinefelter said. Some 300,000 production jobs have been
lost in recent years, leaving only 170,000 U.S. workers in the
steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA-inspired trade is having the same ripple effect now in
other industries, he said, and the long-term effect should frighten
every American.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we destroy and export these good-paying jobs, we are going
to have a divided society...that will destroy the roots of
democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley also carried a message that resonated beyond economics
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a breakfast presentation to a blue-ribbon audience of local
corporate leaders, a video was shown that promoted NAFTA and the
larger stage of international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Its closing thought: ``International trade may be the most
powerful catalyst for peace.''

UNION PROTESTERS AGAINST U.S. TRADE POLICY GREET COMMERCE
SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Labor union protesters welcomed U.S.
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley to the Kansas City area Friday
with signs declaring, ``US Trade Policy Stinks'' and ``Put People
Before Profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a chartered bus that rolled slowly past the small but
vocal crowd outside the Jack Reardon Civic Center in Kansas City,
Kan., Daley glanced at the protesters and sighed deeply. He
acknowledged that the nation's free trade stance causes some
dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be winners and losers,'' Daley said.
``There's no doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with unemployment at record lows, with the economy in the
greatest boom in history, I think we've had more winners,'' said
Daley. ``Some people just want to ignore that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, one of about 30 picketers on hand said she
could not ignore the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Frances Russell, of Our Lady of St. Rose Parish in Kansas
City, Kan., said the 5-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement
has triggered a parade of jobs moving from American to Mexican soil
in search of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   But those Mexican workers are often exploited, she said, while
Americans are left to find other work, often at lesser pay.
``(Under NAFTA) some people are making profits and some people are
losing. That's not the American way. It's tragic,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, the government's ranking business official, brought his
national bus tour to Kansas City this week to attend a three-day
Summit of the North American International Trade Corridor
Partnership, with Kansas City, Kan., serving as host.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership of government and business leaders from the
United States, Canada and Mexico was formed earlier this year after
four years of talks aimed at fostering greater trade from Winnipeg
to Mexico City across a broad swath of middle America that includes
Kansas City, Oklahoma City and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Other regions with international road and rail corridors have
similar pro-trade groups, said Rick Childers, northwest Missouri
manager for the Missouri Department of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this group is farther ahead of any other like it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 cities from the three nations are members; more were
expected to formally be added this week.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Kansas City, Kan., also drew Mexico's top trade
official in the United States, Javier Mancera.
</P>
<P>
   American controversy over NAFTA is not lost on officials south
of the border, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the wariness'' of American workers, Mancera
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico must deal with Mexico's economic problems. And, he
said, the positive effects of NAFTA south of the border have been
``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is telling, Mancera said, that ``all three countries have the
lowest jobless rates in our histories'' in the post-NAFTA years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the (organized) labor critics are wrong,'' he
said. ``Trade is not a zero-sum game. There is this goal of
increasing the size of the cake so there are more slices for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics won't listen, Mancera said. ``Numbers are not
going to convince them. It (NAFTA) is an ideological issue for
them. Some people want to have a protectionist economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their arguments are rational,'' Mancera said. ``But the
numbers have proven them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Partnership delegates were awash this week in economic
statistics that argue the pro-NAFTA case.
</P>
<P>
   In this region:
</P>
<P>
   - Total exports from Kansas and Missouri of merchandise alone
topped $10 billion last year, up from $6 billion before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   - Total exports from Kansas City area firms exceed $3.8 billion,
up from $2.2 billion before NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   - Post-NAFTA unemployment is down in Missouri and Kansas and is
well below national averages in both states, while real personal
income is up.
</P>
<P>
   But foes offer numbers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The most alarming, they say, is the NAFTA-fueled U.S. trade
deficit with foreign nations that is running at a record rate this
year of $247 billion _ far ahead of last year's record $164.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on is unprecedented,'' said protester Tom Bogdon
of the Greater Kansas City Fair Trade Coalition, which organized
Friday's demonstration. ``It's like a family living on a credit
card. Pretty soon it's going to mess up the economy pretty badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another anti-NAFTA rally speaker, Craig Volland of the Kansas
chapter of the Sierra Club, claimed Friday that NAFTA, among other
things, was a scheme to build new highways to Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Labor representatives and others are holding their own
fair-trade summit Saturday at Royall Hall on the University of
Missouri-Kansas City campus.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's main message Friday to the partnership's estimated 300
attendees was a plea to educate their workers and citizens that
free and open trade among nations will pay long-term dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening controversy _ such as that displayed on the sidewalk
outside the Reardon Center _ is poisoning the U.S. effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty percent of Americans believe that (international) trade
is bad for their jobs,'' said Daley, citing recent poll findings
that prompted his road tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to your friends and neighbors, your constituents. Tell
them how trade creates more jobs than it costs...Tell them they may
be `invisible' exporters, because they supply companies who export
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without public support, we'll have trouble in Seattle in
November when President Clinton launches a new round of global
talks,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Those World Trade Organization sessions in Seattle will attract
150 nations' trade ministers, and Daley pledged that workers'
rights, the environment and other issues stirring American emotions
are high on the president's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Without public and ultimately congressional support, Clinton
will not have the so-called ``fast track'' authority he desperately
wants in Seattle that will allow him to negotiate trade terms and
treaties. MORE

GWYNN KEEPS HITS COMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a few minutes before 4 p.m. at Dodger
Stadium. One group of Los Angeles Dodgers was playing pepper in
front of the dugout while another was playing a fierce game of
hacky sack. These are the things teams do in September in lieu of a
pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Several San Diego Padres players were just arriving at the park
for the 7 p.m. start. Only one Padre was in uniform, and he was
running lonely wind sprints in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it was Tony Gwynn, providing proof, not that anyone
needed it, that 3,000 hits hasn't changed him.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks removed from a single in Montreal that etched his
name in baseball history, Gwynn was back doing all of the things
that enabled him to make history working a little harder and
staying focused on his work.
</P>
<P>
   It likely won't surprise you, either, to learn that the Long
Beach product has hit .346 since getting his 3,000th hit, or that
he had a 16-game hitting streak this month, or that he's had eight
multiple hit games in September, or that he would rank sixth in the
National League batting race at .330 if he had enough plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, nothing's changed. ``I'm still a scrub,'' he
said with one of his roaring laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There's more truth there than you'd think. When Gwynn looks back
on the 1999 season and how it fits in his career, he realizes that
the two months he was occupied by the march to 3K were an anomaly.
For perhaps the only time in his hit parade, a moment got in the
way of his work.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was on target to reach 3,000 in May before a calf injury
started playing havoc with his playing time and success. Multiply
that by family concerns and snowballing media attention and you had
one frustrated future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot,'' said Gwynn before Friday's game. ``I put a
lot of pressure on myself. Because of the injury and fanfare, I
wanted to hurry up and get it done. But it was bigger that I
thought it was. The hardest thing to do in this game is play when
you're putting pressure on yourself. It's a tough enough game to
play when you're relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some success, but I just didn't do the things I normally
do. The whole experience is one I'll remember because of the lesson
I learned. People have a hard time believing it, but you can spend
18 years in this game and still learn some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Free and easy is the way Gwynn had always played. For the most
part, it's the way he's played since No.3,000. He had first-inning
and sixth-inning singles against the Dodgers Friday, giving him
3,057 hits in his career. He recently passed ex-Angel Rod Carew on
the all-time list and currently stands 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything else I could go through that
would be at that level,'' Gwynn said. ``If anything does, I'll know
better how to deal with those demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has thoroughly enjoyed the tributes he's received. Padres
management went over the top celebrating his achievement. The
pregame ceremony for his first game back home lasted more than an
hour and included video tributes from friends and baseball
colleagues and an original song written and sung by his daughter
Anisha.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Gwynn attended a postgame party thrown by the
club that turned out to be a surprise roast. Old photos were blown
up into life-size images, including a shot of Gwynn when he was at
San Diego State ``wearing a large Afro and a bad suit,'' said Gwynn
and another when he and one-time teammate Steve Garvey were dressed
in Shakespeare-era garb for a San Diego Globe promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has a blast,'' Tony said. ``But I almost killed Dave
Winfield for cracking wise with some Luther Vandross jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows it's now behind him. As fantastic as that
night in Montreal was, the hit doesn't rank as his most memorable
moment. His two World Series appearances (1984, 1998) meant more,
and so did a few of his batting titles.
</P>
<P>
   He'd love to see the Padres contend for a pennant again next
season, and they've had two streaks in '98 that were promising. The
Padres went 24-7 during a span in May and June, and came into
Friday's game 16-10 in their last 26.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to have another injury-free season. Gwynn, 39, was
hoping 1999 would give him insight into how much longer he could
and would want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season was supposed to be a measuring stick,'' said
Gwynn, who had 220 hits in 1997 at the age of 37. ``Now I don't
know. I can't judge things on 100 games. I'll have to go back to
work this off-season and get my legs sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year might be the last year, or the first of two or three
more. I truly don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows what he would like. He would like to catch Willie Mays,
who stands 10th on the all-time hit list at 3,282, Gwynn said. With
a few more hits on top of that, he could pass Paul Molitor (3,319)
and become the all-time leader of his generation ('80s-90s).
</P>
<P>
   And only five players in history had 3,500 hits Pete Rose
(4,256), Ty Cobb (4,189), Hank Aaron (3,771), Stan Musial (3,630)
and Tris Speaker (3,514). If Gwynn could play until he's 42 or 43,
he'd have a shot at making it a six-pack.
</P>
<P>
   There's precedence for hits after 40, too. Honus Wagner had 415
more hits and Carl Yastrzemski 410 after reaching 3,000 at the age
of 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting into the top ten would be quite a feat,'' Gwynn said.
``It's reachable.'' Especially for someone who still runs wind
sprints after his 3,000th hit.

CLIPPERS ARE GOING DOWN WITH OWNERSHIP

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You hereby are sentenced to hard time at the
happiest place on earth ... last place!
</P>
<P>
   That's the marketing battle cry from ``Prisonland,'' which is
what would exist if the Los Angeles Clippers were a theme park.
It's a small-payroll world, after all.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the darkest week in the blistered history of a
franchise that even Ziggy would feel qualified to heckle.
</P>
<P>
   So we have waded through years of refugee horror stories and
decided it's time to embrace the pervasive Clippers-incarceration
analogy. The philosopher who accepted the challenge of pushing this
comparison over the top is David Falk, the NBA's go-to agent.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who deals with more big stars than the late Carl Sagan,
recently was hired by lame-duck Clipper Maurice Taylor. Taylor
happens to be one of the most-promising power forwards in league
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Our inspiration for rolling the word ``captivity'' before you
was provided by Falk's observation of Taylor's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sentence,'' said Falk of Taylor and pausing between
phone-compromised bites of his Thursday lunch, ``will expire on
June 30. If the Clippers don't want to compound the felony, they'll
trade him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence in question represents the final year of Taylor's
initial three-year contract. By now, even the slightly curious fans
should be aware that Falk and Taylor have demanded the
league-maximum contract extension ($70.9 million for the six
seasons following the imminent campaign). Moderately savvy
observers also should know Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling
publicly backed by the teeth-grinding loyalty of his front-office
staff refuses to fork over the loot.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips in a press release attributed to basketball ops V.P.
Elgin Baylor made the obvious conclusion official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Falk issued his law-dog rebuttal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Falk said, ``it all boils down to one
separate thing: he (Sterling) owns the rights to a 70
million-dollar asset (Taylor), and he's going to get nothing for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Clippers can avoid ground zero by executing a trade
before Falk's undisclosed (to the media), pre-training camp
deadline, but they don't exactly have leverage. When asked if
Taylor will report to camp for the Oct.4 check-in, Falk said he's
still hoping his client will be traded by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get a player, someone who can probably start for them
at power forward, and a (draft) pick,'' said Falk, without naming
names. ``They're not going to get anyone great.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if confronted by a sweet deal their loose salary-cap
position would allow, Sterling figures to shoot it down if the
player in question will earn more this season than Taylor's
bargain-budgeted $1.367 million.
</P>
<P>
   What an ugly way to run a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   If measured against the Clipper drama, ``The Shawshank
Redemption'' would be reduced to the status of a buddy comedy.
Before seeking a solution, let's define the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 18 years,'' Falk said, ``what's been the one
constant in that organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sterling, this victory lap is yours. Please run backward.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, an attempt to solicit Sterling's side of this
issue was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Marching on, we are here to assure the casual Clipper doomsday
theorist that the trail for almost every franchise disaster leads
back to the owner's doorstep. If you think the L.A. Clippers have
represented the best personnel intentions of Baylor, you're as
unplugged as the Sports Illustrated writer who referred to Elgin's
brain as processed cheese food.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives with this Sterling character?
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to win, but it seems safe to reason that losing
doesn't bother him enough if at all.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't bothered him enough to re-sign seven former Clippers
who were top four picks in lotteries the franchise has had the
dubious thrill of visiting since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But the current mess smells worse than all of the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips now have Lamar Odom and Michael Olowokandi aligned
with Taylor in what could have been the best young frontcourt in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sterling has instructed his beleaguered employees to
question Taylor's true value. If he's worth 71 million scoots, why
did the team win just nine times in 50 games last season? Why did
he show up out of shape last season and average only five rebounds
per game?
</P>
<P>
   But if he's not worth the risk, why will a more historically
astute franchise pay him the max next year? And if Taylor is
allowed to leave, can they acquire a player of his caliber to
replace him? No. Who will be your first offensive option? Who will
be the recipient of Odom's superlative passing skill?
</P>
<P>
   If Sterling's hackneyed strategy is sound, why do the Clippers
ride the lottery pony almost every June? Employee morale rivals
that of the poor jokers who were paid to assemble the Ford Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's value is not determined by last season's stats and a
post-lockout 10 pounds around the midsection. Taylor's value is
determined by what the NBA market will bear.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ with the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Esrey's first obligation is to shareholders,'' said
Ferrugia of AG Edwards. ``From a strategic perspective, WorldCom is
a much better partner for Sprint than Deutsche Telekom.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think Sprint's primary shares of stock are worth $60 to
$65 a share to a buyer like MCI WorldCom. Sprint PCS may be valued
at more than $100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the past experiences of MCI WorldCom's chairman,
Bernard Ebbers, much of that value would be justified by projected
costs savings.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time farmer who still keeps his headquarters in the
relative backwater of Clinton, Miss., Ebbers has parlayed a string
of 60 acquisitions into one of the most impressive collections of
telephone businesses in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry observers were astounded when the relatively
unknown WorldCom Inc. made its $37 billion bid for MCI last year.
Wall Street, however, applauded the deal when Ebbers promised
collective savings of $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the MCI WorldCom merger savings are projected to come
from the integration of things like service provisioning and
billing, and lowered network costs.
</P>
<P>
   Staff cuts may actually form a smaller portion of the overall
picture. But observers say they have been significant, going well
beyond the combined 2,300 layoffs that the company announced last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs might be more pronounced with a Sprint acquisition,
analysts say. Projected savings would have to be enormous to
justify a combination of the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers acknowledge that there would be no need for two
accounting departments, two consumer and business marketing groups,
two network groups, two regulatory and public affairs staff, two
headquarters administrative staff...
</P>
<P>
   MCI did maintain a headquarters in Washington after its merger
with WorldCom. But in the event of a merger with Sprint, it's
unlikely the combined entity would need three.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marcusse, president and chief executive officer of the
Kansas City Area Development Council, said it was too early to
discuss the implications of a specific deal between Sprint and MCI
WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does show that we can never, ever take something for
granted,'' Marcusse said. ``We can't take Sprint for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unreasonable to think Kansas City could benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That means economic-development officials would have to convince
Sprint's merger partner that Overland Park is a better place to
base the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't hesitate to make that case,'' Marcusse said.

SPRINT REPORTED DISCUSSING MERGER POSSIBILITIES WITH RIVAL MCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Sprint Corp. executives are talking with
counterparts at rival MCI WorldCom about a possible merger of the
nation's .MDSD/.MDNM/No. 2 and .MDSD/.MDNM/No. 3 long-distance
carriers, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies refuse to comment on what they refer to as
speculation. Indeed, reports of Sprint's impending acquisition are
so common that one spokesman for the company says he often feels
like he's living in the movie ``Groundhog Day.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to one person close to the company, talks have
moved beyond a cursory dialogue between chief executives to staff
discussions about how the two companies would meld operations and
structure a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that MCI WorldCom might
acquire Sprint's core long-distance and local phone operations for
stock, and exchange a new MCI WorldCom tracking stock for the stock
that tracks Sprint's wireless company, Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Any such deal might take months to complete. There's also no
assurance that the companies could come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any agreement would be subject to intense scrutiny by
communications and antitrust regulators, who might not be inclined
to see the long-distance industry dominated by the two merged
companies and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But for Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey, who has built an
enviable collection of communication businesses, the time may be
right to consider a combination. Analysts say the company lacks the
girth of rivals as they grow through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the crop reaches an optimal stage for
harvest,'' said Tony Ferrugia, an analyst with AG Edwards who gives
the deal a better than 50//50 chance of happening. ``After that, it
starts diminishing in value...Sprint needs to look for a partner to
continue to create the kinds of returns for shareholders that it
has in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the two long-distance rivals would create a
behemoth rivaling AT&AMP;T. It would wield a 30 percent market share in
the $80 billion domestic long-distance industry, compared to AT&AMP;T's
48 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   The company would also control some local telephone operations
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly for MCI WorldCom, which lacks any wireless
assets, Sprint owns one of the fastest growing and best positioned
wireless companies in the country, Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would leave Kansas Citians holding their breath as
they waited for news of headquarters relocations and possible job
cuts as the new company sought cost savings to please Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is the area's largest private-sector employer, a
significant taxpayer, charitable contributor, and irreplaceable
client for many local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Next Friday, the company plans to cut the ribbon on its new $920
million corporate campus in Overland Park, Kan., a complex slated
to house 3,500 employees by the end of the year, and 16,000 by 2003
as the company consolidates staff now scattered around town.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of any acquirer completely removing Sprint's
Kansas City area presence is remote. But observers say the impact
of a company like MCI WorldCom buying Sprint would be felt far more
keenly than potential suitors like Germany's Deutsche Telekom,
which has virtually no assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a disaster for Kansas City compared to some of
the other operations that might be considering buying them,'' said
David Scott, president of Birch Telecom and a former employee of
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's impact on Kansas City's economy is so far-reaching that
it's hard to put a number on. But a recent study by the County
Economic Research Institute attempted to do just that for Johnson
County.
</P>
<P>
   The research institute calculated that the construction of
Sprint's new campus alone was expected to result in 34,877 new or
retained jobs and more than $2 billion in increased industry output
in the county during the duration of the project.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2003, Sprint's campus is expected to generate
a total annual payroll of about $1.12 billion, the study concluded.
Sprint puts that number at just below $1 billion, which is still
nearly 10 percent of the county's total personal earnings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't include an additional 35,000 jobs that the
campus would spin off.
</P>
<P>
   The County Economic Research Institute study calculated an
annual bottom line impact of Sprint's campus on Johnson County of
$6 billion. That number ignores Sprint's impact on the Missouri
side of the state line.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the intangible benefits of having a huge worldwide
corporate headquarters in town, such as the ability to attract new
companies and talent to the city, or Sprint's charitable
contributions, which totaled $5 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously have an enormous impact on our economy,'' said
Doug Davidson, vice president and director of applied research at
the County Economic Research Institute. ``The hope is that if they
do merge, they would retain their local employment, maybe even
expand here.''
</P>
<P>
   That scenario would be far more likely if Sprint were to merge
with a company like Deutsche Telekom, a move that has been the
focus of consistent speculation for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   The German company has no assets in the United States, would
need a U.S. headquarters, and would have little incentive to trim
staff in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom each own 10 percent of
Sprint and are partners with Sprint in the troubled international
alliance, Global One. Neither company could block a deal with MCI
WorldCom, according to Sprint spokesman Bill White.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just like any other shareholder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a Sprint shareholder's perspective, a deal with MCI
WorldCom may be more lucrative over the long run than one with the
Europeans. MORE

CLIPPERS GOING DOWN WITH OWNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You hereby are sentenced to hard time at the
happiest place on earth ... last place!
</P>
<P>
   That's the marketing battle cry from ``Prisonland,'' which is
what would exist if the Los Angeles Clippers were a theme park.
It's a small-payroll world, after all.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the darkest week in the blistered history of a
franchise that even Ziggy would feel qualified to heckle.
</P>
<P>
   So we have waded through years of refugee horror stories and
decided it's time to embrace the pervasive Clippers-incarceration
analogy. The philosopher who accepted the challenge of pushing this
comparison over the top is David Falk, the NBA's go-to agent.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, who deals with more big stars than the late Carl Sagan,
recently was hired by lame-duck Clipper Maurice Taylor. Taylor
happens to be one of the most-promising power forwards in league
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Our inspiration for rolling the word ``captivity'' before you
was provided by Falk's observation of Taylor's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sentence,'' said Falk of Taylor and pausing between
phone-compromised bites of his Thursday lunch, ``will expire on
June 30. If the Clippers don't want to compound the felony, they'll
trade him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence in question represents the final year of Taylor's
initial three-year contract. By now, even the slightly curious fans
should be aware that Falk and Taylor have demanded the
league-maximum contract extension ($70.9 million for the six
seasons following the imminent campaign). Moderately savvy
observers also should know Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling
publicly backed by the teeth-grinding loyalty of his front-office
staff refuses to fork over the loot.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips in a press release attributed to basketball ops V.P.
Elgin Baylor made the obvious conclusion official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Falk issued his law-dog rebuttal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Falk said, ``it all boils down to one
separate thing: he (Sterling) owns the rights to a 70
million-dollar asset (Taylor), and he's going to get nothing for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Clippers can avoid ground zero by executing a trade
before Falk's undisclosed (to the media), pre-training camp
deadline, but they don't exactly have leverage. When asked if
Taylor will report to camp for the Oct.4 check-in, Falk said he's
still hoping his client will be traded by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get a player, someone who can probably start for them
at power forward, and a (draft) pick,'' said Falk, without naming
names. ``They're not going to get anyone great.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if confronted by a sweet deal their loose salary-cap
position would allow, Sterling figures to shoot it down if the
player in question will earn more this season than Taylor's
bargain-budgeted $1.367 million.
</P>
<P>
   What an ugly way to run a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   If measured against the Clipper drama, ``The Shawshank
Redemption'' would be reduced to the status of a buddy comedy.
Before seeking a solution, let's define the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 18 years,'' Falk said, ``what's been the one
constant in that organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sterling, this victory lap is yours. Please run backward.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, an attempt to solicit Sterling's side of this
issue was unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Marching on, we are here to assure the casual Clipper doomsday
theorist that the trail for almost every franchise disaster leads
back to the owner's doorstep. If you think the L.A. Clippers have
represented the best personnel intentions of Baylor, you're as
unplugged as the Sports Illustrated writer who referred to Elgin's
brain as processed cheese food.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives with this Sterling character?
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to win, but it seems safe to reason that losing
doesn't bother him enough if at all.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't bothered him enough to re-sign seven former Clippers
who were top four picks in lotteries the franchise has had the
dubious thrill of visiting since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But the current mess smells worse than all of the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips now have Lamar Odom and Michael Olowokandi aligned
with Taylor in what could have been the best young frontcourt in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sterling has instructed his beleaguered employees to
question Taylor's true value. If he's worth 71 million scoots, why
did the team win just nine times in 50 games last season? Why did
he show up out of shape last season and average only five rebounds
per game?
</P>
<P>
   But if he's not worth the risk, why will a more historically
astute franchise pay him the max next year? And if Taylor is
allowed to leave, can they acquire a player of his caliber to
replace him? No. Who will be your first offensive option? Who will
be the recipient of Odom's superlative passing skill?
</P>
<P>
   If Sterling's hackneyed strategy is sound, why do the Clippers
ride the lottery pony almost every June? Employee morale rivals
that of the poor jokers who were paid to assemble the Ford Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's value is not determined by last season's stats and a
post-lockout 10 pounds around the midsection. Taylor's value is
determined by what the NBA market will bear.

SEPARATED BY TIME AND DISTANCE, A FAMILY REUNITES IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After 53 years, it was a small, handwritten
airport sign bearing a Russian surname _ Turkin _ that reunited a
family separated by the economy, geography and the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   There were hugs, tears, kisses and questions _ lots of questions
_ when Rhetta Goldstein of Prairie Village, Kan., and her cousin,
Tsilya Makhtyuk, met Friday afternoon at Kansas City International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   To onlookers, it was a typical airport family meeting. To the
Turkin family, it was a reunion half a century in the waiting.
Makhtyuk, formerly of Belarus, made the trek from Milwaukee, where
she had moved in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The women thought they had relatives, but knew nothing of one
another before this year. Makhtyuk had searched for her American
cousins upon arriving in the United States, but the Turkin name
never surfaced. Goldstein knew family members had been left behind
when her father, Morris Turkin, joined siblings in Kansas City
about 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 78, dreamed of meeting her relatives but never
expected it to happen. The only clues to start a search from were a
few photos and letters. The addresses predated World War II, the
last time family members corresponded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was before the Iron Curtain fell in Russia,'' Goldstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   An aunt in Russia had asked Turkin to send eyeglasses. Her son
was to marry soon, and he also would need a prayer shawl for the
ceremony. A niece wanted Turkin to help her move to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Turkin sent the items, just as he had sent money to his family
for many years. But it was the last letter he would send to Russia,
and he received no more letters from his homeland. The Cold War
began, and Turkin was told he could cause political problems for
his family if a letter with a U.S. address arrived. Helping his
niece move was virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid we would make trouble for them. I don't know if
he even tried to write anymore,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He made the right decision, Makhtyuk, 71, confirmed through an
interpreter Friday. She remembers receiving the letters, and even
wrote one herself. She remembers how dangerous it became for her
family to communicate with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always invited (the family) to come to the United
States,'' Makhtyuk said through her niece. ``But it was
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   There wouldn't be another invitation until 1996, when
Goldstein's brother, Marshall Turkin of Boca Raton, Fla., went to
central Russia and wrote letters to anyone who might know of a
Turkin.
</P>
<P>
   Two letters arrived from Belarus, but there was no definite
connection until a letter postmarked from Milwaukee reached Turkin.
Makhtyuk had moved there to flee Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The cousins will spend the weekend catching up with one another
and several other relatives who live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many questions we have to ask these cousins of
ours. We have to start back 50 years,'' Goldstein said. ``I want to
find out what happened to the others in Russia. It's all very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are any regrets this weekend, it will be only that the
older generation cannot be here to hear the stories, Goldstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in life, we all decide to find out about our roots,'' she
said. ``We let it go by and let it go by until it's too late.''

REPORTS OF MISSOURI RIVER COMPROMISE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN
PREMATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There are signs that a Missouri River
compromise _ hailed last month as a historic achievement _ may be
starting to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Missouri officials refused to sign the agreement
until they obtained more information. As a result, the Missouri
River Basin Association has decided to delay submitting the plan to
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little discouraging that we didn't ink the deal, so to
speak,'' Richard Opper, executive director of the basin
association, said Friday. ``But we're still hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Opper announced the association was near a
``historic consensus.'' The eight states in the basin association
had agreed on how the river's flows should be managed at times of
drought, the most difficult period in which to get agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting Monday in Glasgow, Mont., the association's
directors _ which represent eight states, including Missouri and
Kansas, and a group of American Indian tribes _ decided to delay
until November submission of their plan for operating the Missouri
River.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Missouri hopes the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, charged with operating the river's flows, will run new
computer models and answer questions about the proposed compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just waiting on the data,'' said Mimi Garstang, chief of
water resources for the state Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Garstang said the corps provided some data but used an old
computer model and state officials weren't able to determine how
the proposed plan might affect river users in Missouri, primarily
farmers and the barge industry.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the delay shouldn't be taken as an indication that
Missouri opposes the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``(DNR Director) Steve Mahfood would like to try and stay with
the plan,'' Garstang said. ``He feels there are great benefits from
a consensus plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to wait until we have the facts to make a
decision,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The states have argued for more than a decade over how the river
should be managed. Differences hardened in the drought of the late
1980s and early 1990s. The corps, using an old Master Manual guide
for controlling flows, continued to release water from upstream
reservoirs to keep downstream barges floating. That left marinas
miles from shore, and it angered upstream politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, not so long after the 1993 flood, the corps proposed
changing the river's operation. It would allow a bigger spring
rise, as the river might naturally do, and benefit fish and
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism from many quarters quickly flowed. Lower river
states protested, worrying about barges and farmers. Federal
wildlife officials said it wasn't enough. A year later, the corps
pulled the plan.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the corps had hoped that the basin association would
help it come to a compromise, getting the eight member states to
agree on what to do during the next drought. Last month, corps
officials were elated by the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the corps, as well as others in the Missouri basin hoping
for a compromise among the states, will have to wait about a month
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sure hoping this can be overcome,'' Paul Johnston, a
corps spokesman in Omaha, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, Johnston said the corps plans to release to the public
its proposed plan to control flows before Christmas. A series of
public hearings and comment sessions will follow.

MINIMED GETS GOOD NEWS FOR INSULIN PUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The federal government ruled Friday that Medicare
recipients may receive coverage for external insulin pumps, a
product whose market is dominated by MiniMed Inc.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed, based in Sylmar, controls 80 percent of the U.S. market
for external insulin pumps, a device that delivers a programmed
dose of insulin to patients with Type I diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the approval means private insurers
likely will follow the government's lead and pay for the pumps for
their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its basic core, it reflects the growing acceptance of
insulin pump therapy,'' said Eric S. Kentor, MiniMed's senior vice
president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Following the announcement, the company's stock jumped $2.8125
on heavy trading volume Friday, closing at $98.25. Investors
believe the approval will result in additional sales for MiniMed,
analyst Kurt Kruger of Banc of America Securities said earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Kentor said the increase in business is likely but predicting
how much it will be is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of sales, we would understandably expect to get some
incremental sales. We don't have a real good handle on specifically
how many Medicare beneficiaries have Type I diabetes,'' Kentor
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company hopes to marry its insulin pump technology
with another of its products, a sensor that monitors insulin
levels. The idea would be to create a machine that monitors insulin
and blood sugar levels and distributes insulin accordingly,
mimicking the activity of the pancreas.

MANY FIND LIFE AFTER CONGRESS AS LOBBYISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The door never really closes on members of Congress
when they leave office. In fact it's thrown open so wide that many
of them can hardly resist returning to Capitol Hill as lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   With unmatched access to old colleagues and Capitol backrooms,
138 former members of Congress have become lobbyists, according to
a recent report by the Center for Responsive Politics covering the
year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has six lawmakers-turned-lobbyists, all former House
members. Only three bigger states _ Texas, New York and Illinois _
have more ex-congressmen registered as lobbyists. Kansas has two,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former members have advantages outsiders never have,'' said
Paul Hendrie, who worked on the study as communications director of
the Center for Responsive Politics. ``They know the process inside
out and they've built relationships with colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't necessarily bad, Hendrie said, unless a lawmaker
anticipates a future as a lobbyist and so votes in ways that
benefit potential future employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to assume their representatives and senators are
working for them and no one else,'' Hendrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, ex-members of Congress cannot lobby former
colleagues for at least one year after leaving office, although
they can have indirect influence as lobbying consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, proposed
extending the one-year lobbying ban to two years. He got the
proposal onto an appropriation bill, but it was removed by a
Senate-House conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   One former member of Congress from St. Louis who is now a
lobbyist said he knew of no colleagues who harbored lobbying
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, most of them figured they weren't going to leave
unless they were carried out,'' said Jack Buechner, a Republican
who served from 1987 to 1990. ``The second thing is, they had a
greater ambition in life than to become a lobbyist.''
</P>
<P>
   But lobbying is a path more and more former members of Congress
seem to be taking. Reports indicated more than 100 former members
lobbying in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying has grown as an industry at a time when corporations
and associations need a stronger voice in Washington, said Tom
Coleman, a Republican who represented northwest Missouri, including
Kansas City, North, for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the growing role of government and regulatory control,
business has to be represented to make sure fairness and equity are
involved in the process,'' said Coleman, who represents a chemical
firm, BASF Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Slattery, a former House member from Kansas who left in 1994
to make an unsuccessful bid for governor, said it is understandable
that companies would look to former members of Congress to lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who needs help in Washington is going to want someone
who knows Washington,'' Slattery said.
</P>
<P>
   Former members of Congress are granted lifetime access to the
House and Senate floors, cloakrooms and members-only dining rooms
and other Capitol niches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between a congressman and a former congressman is
pretty thin,'' said Wendell Bailey, a Republican who represented
southwest Missouri in the House in the early 1980s and now lobbies
part-time. ``You can pretty much do anything a congressman can do
except vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Under House rules, former lawmakers may go on the House floor
but are not supposed to talk about bills they have pending. The
Senate has no such rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, including myself, consider it bad form to go
lobby members of Congress on the floor,'' said former Democratic
Rep. Alan Wheat of Missouri. Wheat said if he wanted to lobby, ``I
do what other people do: make an appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Those appointments can be much easier to get if you used to be
in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to buy my way into the office by being a campaign
contributor or taking their staffs out for endless lunches,''
Buechner said. ``You may not win, but you get your time in office.
That's the critical part.''
</P>
<P>
   That type of access, coupled with knowing how to get bills
passed, makes ex-members of Congress extremely marketable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big firms wave obscene amounts of money at them,'' said Bill
Hogan of the Center for Public Integrity. ``For all those who say
what a sacrifice it is to serve in Congress, the truth emerges when
they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Although lobbyists don't have to report their salaries if they
work for a lobbying company, it is not difficult for someone to
easily exceed their $136,000 congressional salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics reported recently that $1.42
billion was spent on lobbying in 1998, and that clients of the top
50 firms paid between $580,000 and $3.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Former members of Congress who pursue lobbying do not always do
it as soon as they can. Wheat, for instance, Ieft office in 1994 to
run for Senate; lost; worked for CARE, the international relief
agency; helped manage President Clinton's re-election campaign in
1996; then established Wheat &AMP; Associates, which lists nine
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman practiced law privately for 1 1/2 years before being
asked by BASF to join the company as a lobbyist and adviser.
Coleman said the firm wooed him for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Volkmer, a Democrat from Missouri, began lobbying for the
National Rifle Association a little more than a year after being
defeated for re-election in 1996. Volkmer fought gun-control
measures in the House, unusual for a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They contacted me right after I got out,'' Volkmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA paid Volkmer $80,000 to lobby last year, records show,
but he said he does mostly consulting work and only goes to Capitol
Hill occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   For some former members of Congress, lobbying is attractive as a
means of staying in a city they have come to like for its history
and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Wolfe was right: it's hard to go home again,'' Buechner
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wheat and Slattery said they'd rather be back in Missouri
and Kansas, if not for the professional opportunities in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One former congressman from Missouri said he had no interest in
staying in Washington as a lobbyist or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Washington in December of 1996, I never went
back,'' said Mel Hancock, a Missouri Republican. ``I had enough of
it. I saw all the deals cut that I wanted to see.''

MARINERS STROLL PAST ANGELS IN 10 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mariners second baseman David Bell said he's never
understood the meaning of ``unsung hero,'' the term engraved on the
award he won before Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Allow Lou Piniella to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy that really doesn't get the publicity that other players
get, but that's steady, reliable and can be ready to do a good job
every day,'' said the Mariners manager. ``And basically, that's
what David is.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsung as he is, Bell has had moments of glory. Last Friday
night, he homered in the ninth to beat Minnesota. Friday night, his
10th-inning sacrifice fly gave the M's a 4-3 victory over the
Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners nearly were beaten by Anaheim first baseman Darin
Erstad, who singled off Paul Abbott to tie the game in the eighth,
then gave the Angels a 3-2 lead with a solo homer off Jose Mesa in
the tenth.
</P>
<P>
   But Angels closer Troy Percival, pitching with an inflamed right
shoulder, walked Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez in the bottom
of the inning. Shane Monahan pinch-ran for Martinez. Percival threw
a wild pitch, putting runners on second and third. Tom Lampkin's
sacrifice scored Griffey with the tying run. Bell's line out to
center off Mark Petkovsek, who relieved Percival, scored Monahan
with the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is hit the ball hard and you'll probably
get the job done, because the outfield's in and the infield's in,''
Bell said. ``The key was getting up 2-0 (in the count). He had to
give me a pretty decent pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bell, such humility is typical, and helps explains the
``unsung'' tag. It also belies the quiet confidence he called on
when he was forced to step in for the injured Carlos Guillen the
first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had spent parts of four seasons in the majors but failed to
stick as an everyday player until Guillen's injury gave him the
chance. At first, Bell thought it was about time _ but the feeling
didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about that at first, and then it's not that
important, because you realize all the guys out there that deserve
it and never get the opportunity,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was going to accept it, to myself, to not play every
day. For the good of the team and trying to win games, you know
you're going to have to accept it to a certain extent. But yeah, I
knew the time was going to come. It came a little unexpectedly this
year, but I'm glad I've gotten the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, who is batting more than 60 points above his prior
career average, also could have been an Unsung Hero candidate. In
the fourth inning, the catcher hit his ninth homer, a two-run shot
that erased an Angels lead built on a solo homer by Mo Vaughn in
the top of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's homer was the first to reach the right-field upper deck
at Safeco Field, climbing 444 feet over the Hit It Here Cafe and a
level of luxury suites. Only one other player, Toronto's Shawn
Green, has even reached the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it hard, and he hit it hard,'' said Mariner starter
Gil Meche, who otherwise was brilliant over seven-plus innings.
``It was a big-time homer and he's a big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   PANIAGUA OUT: Reliever Jose Paniagua will miss the rest of the
season with a severe groin pull. Paniagua finished the year with a
6-11 record and 4.09 earned-run average that rose 53 points over
his last three outings as he struggled with the condition.
</P>
<P>
   WINNERS: The local chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association
of America voted Ken Griffey Jr. the Mariners' Player of the Year
and Jamie Moyer Pitcher of the Year before Friday night's game. The
award was Griffey's sixth and Moyer's second. Bell's Unsung Hero
honor was selected by Mariners coaches.
</P>
<P>
   RAIN KEEPS FALLIN': The game began with the roof open, and it
stayed that way despite showers in the top of the first. But by
7:20, the rain had gotten so persistent that president Chuck
Armstrong decided to extend the roof for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last weather report we had said this was going to miss
us,'' Armstrong said. ``But we err on the side of fan comfort. We
took the roof off because this was (supposed to be) a passing
shower.''

<P>
   Russia, it seems, is not the only part of the former communist
world where large injections of western money have fostered
corruption rather than promoting reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, four years of intensive care by well-wishers, and
over $5 billion-worth of aid, have failed to create either a
self-sustaining economy or the sort of interdependence among its
feuding ethnic groups that would make a return to war unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the American House of Representatives
recently found evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars given
for reconstruction had been misappropriated. Soft loans and corrupt
procurement practices had been used to enrich Bosnia's ruling party
and its cronies, under the noses of western envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Even the money earmarked to provide gravestones for the
thousands of people massacred at Srebrenica in July 1995 had been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   With criminal revenues like this, there is little wonder that
Bosnia's politicians have shown scant interest in creating an
economy that might one day stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Balkan countries do not have to go on like this. NATO's
victory in Kosovo, and the outside world's well-intentioned, if
sometimes clumsy, efforts to help the province back on to its feet
have opened up some historic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, new economic and geopolitical facts are
being created. Within the next few months, it will become clear
whether the western world is learning from the Bosnian experience
and aiming for something more ambitious than the mere avoidance of
renewed war.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the West has two choices. It can rely solely on
compacts with the region's existing power brokers, which often
means conniving at, or even reinforcing, the corrupt practices by
which they shore up their own authority and squash the emergence of
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Or it can work to undermine the current power structure, with
huge potential benefits for the region's people.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of that structure _ especially in Bosnia, Serbia
and Albania _ lie venal customs services whose inspectors owe more
loyalty to mobsters and warlords than to governments. These
services quite literally create ``barriers to entry'' for
legitimate manufacturers and traders who lack the necessary
connections in the world of politics and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever possible, western governments should be urging Balkan
ones to dismantle all barriers to legal trade, and concentrate
their efforts on forms of commerce that do need be reined in: the
trade in drugs, guns and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   If that means temporarily compensating governments for the loss
of customs revenue, so be it. But instead of throwing more money at
the region than its economies can honestly absorb, the European
Union, in particular, should think harder about opening up markets:
its own, as well as the region's.
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy could create a virtuous circle. It might be
easier, for example, to stop Macedonia levying huge sums on the
vehicles ferrying reconstruction materials to the Kosovars if its
own industrial products were flowing more freely to European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It could be easier to stop the farmers of southern Albania
producing drugs if there were some other crop they were allowed to
supply to European consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians and smugglers of Montenegro, a notorious haven
for contraband, may at last be willing to ``go straight'' _ but
only if they have some legitimate outlet for their talents.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing West European governments should worry about is
the ``threat'' posed by cheap Balkan food or industrial
manufactures to their own producers.
</P>
<P>
   In one form or another, the desperation and poverty of the
Balkans will affect the lives of many people in more prosperous
places. They are already doing so in the shape of prostitution
rackets and the proliferation of small arms on the streets of Milan
and London; in southern Italy, convoys of Balkan smugglers brazenly
travel about in armor-plated vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   It is naive to imagine that either NATO's bombs, or huge sums of
poorly supervised aid money, will be sufficient to keep at bay the
potentially malign consequences of Balkan misery for Europe as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   How much better that the ``Balkan effect'' should be felt in the
form of legitimate exports which flow through the region, and
beyond it, without impediment. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When The Economist described America's economy as a bubble in
April 1998 and advised Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's
chairman, to raise interest rates to pop it, many people dismissed
our warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dow is even higher than it was, the economy is
enjoying robust growth and the core rate of consumer-price
inflation has fallen to a 33-year low.
</P>
<P>
   So were we wrong? Sorry to be party poopers, but America's
economy still looks horribly bubble-like.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in share prices this week, as central bankers and finance
ministers gathered for the annual meetings of the IMF and the World
Bank, was a timely reminder that a collapse on Wall Street remains
the biggest threat to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced? Consider the three most common criticisms of the
idea that there is a financial bubble.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is argued, higher share prices are justified by
improved fundamentals. In a month that has seen the publication of
three books with progressively ambitious titles _ ``Dow 36,000,''
``Dow 40,000'' and ``Dow 100,000'' _ it seems churlish to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   But the climb in share prices over the past year proves neither
that the market is correctly valued nor that the bubble is a
figment of our imagination.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that markets do overshoot and that bubbles can
persist for some time _ indeed, that is their nature. It also shows
that the bigger a bubble gets, the greater the excesses it creates
in the economy _ and the bigger the bang when it eventually pops.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in truth, impossible to know whether share prices are
overvalued right now. But over the past year or so, evidence of a
bubble has mounted with every sign of excess elsewhere in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Households and firms are on a borrowing spree. The private
sector's financial deficit has risen to an unprecedented 5 percent
of GDP (in the previous 50 years it has never exceeded 1 percent).
Money-supply growth is rapid. And America's current-account deficit
is heading for a record 4 percent of GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
   These are all classic symptoms of a bubble. What about the
second objection: that even if shares are overvalued, why should
the Fed worry?
</P>
<P>
   America's inflation rate is low, so there seems no case for
higher interest rates. But inflation has been held down by many
one-off factors _ such as a strong dollar and, thanks to weak
demand in the rest of the world, low commodity and import prices _
which may already be going into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, central banks should not ignore another sort
of inflation: in the prices of assets, such as shares and
property. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Economist argues that many central banks have focused too
narrowly on consumer-price inflation. Excessive rises in asset
prices can be as dangerous as conventional inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden surges in wealth can, for example, encourage excessive
borrowing, which, when borrowers are forced to readjust their
finances, can cause a painful hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest World Economic Outlook, published this week, the
IMF argues that conventional inflation can sometimes be a poor
gauge of whether an economy is overheating, and urges central banks
to pay more attention to other signs of imbalance, such as rising
asset prices, rapid credit growth, private-sector financial
deficits and current-account deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF suggests that overheating in asset markets may call for
monetary tightening not only when it threatens an increase in
product-price inflation, but also when asset prices increase to
unsustainable levels that threaten to destabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the Fed should adopt a target for the
Dow. But it should take more account of the impact of asset prices
on the economy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. UNCUT STORY IS 1,225 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has worried long and hard about share prices since his
``irrational exuberance'' speech in December 1996, but he seems to
have concluded that there was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Partly, perhaps, because of the third popular criticism of
our bubble thesis: that it is too risky, both economically and
politically, for a central bank to prick a bubble by raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell when and by how much rates should be raised.
And the Fed, like other central banks, has a mandate only to
deliver stability in consumer prices. If the Fed deliberately tried
to push down share prices, it would quickly come under fierce
attack.
</P>

   Deciding when to prick a bubble is indeed devilishly hard. But
that is no reason for inaction. Instead, it argues for acting

the Bank of England recently tried to do by raising interest rates

</P>
<P>
   The Bank sensibly wants to prevent a repeat of the late-1980s
housing bubble. And its action also belies the claim that it is

   In recent years, Greenspan has been taking a big risk by not
having tightened policy when he first thought a bubble might be

   There were plenty of signs of overheating, such as rampant
consumer borrowing, that he could have used to justify higher

<P>
   The Fed has thereby fostered the impression that it will slash

rates when they shoot up. This apparent asymmetry has created a
form of moral hazard that encourages investors to take bigger
risks.
</P>
<P>
   What should the Fed do now? Trapped by the bubble, Greenspan's
room for maneuver is limited. Perhaps Wall Street will slide slowly
downwards, letting air gently out of the bubble. But history
suggests that this is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   America's economy shows no sign of slowing; July's record trade
deficit confirms that strong consumer spending is sucking in
imports. Unless share prices collapse, the Fed should raise
interest rates again to cool things down and to signal that it is
not underwriting the market's value.
</P>
<P>
   If it does nothing, the Fed runs the risk that, when Wall Street
does eventually fall, inflation will be rising and the dollar
falling, making it harder to ease monetary policy to offset the
effects of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   One bonus is that the rest of the world economy is in a much
healthier state now than it was a year ago. By the same token, a
sharp fall on Wall Street may be less of a worry.

   Even so, if America's stock market and its economy dive, it is
vital that policymakers in Europe and Japan ensure that their
economies pick up the extra slack.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bank of Japan, for instance, were to persist with its
refusal to ease monetary policy even as America's economy stalled,
the world economy would take a nasty tumble.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When The Economist described America's economy as a bubble in
April 1998 and advised Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's
chairman, to raise interest rates to pop it, many people dismissed
our warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dow is even higher than it was, the economy is
enjoying robust growth and the core rate of consumer-price
inflation has fallen to a 33-year low.
</P>
<P>
   So were we wrong? Sorry to be party poopers, but America's
economy still looks horribly bubble-like.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in share prices this week, as central bankers and finance
ministers gathered for the annual meetings of the IMF and the World
Bank, was a timely reminder that a collapse on Wall Street remains
the biggest threat to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced? Consider the three most common criticisms of the
idea that there is a financial bubble.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is argued, higher share prices are justified by
improved fundamentals. In a month that has seen the publication of
three books with progressively ambitious titles _ ``Dow 36,000,''
``Dow 40,000'' and ``Dow 100,000'' _ it seems churlish to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   But the climb in share prices over the past year proves neither
that the market is correctly valued nor that the bubble is a
figment of our imagination.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that markets do overshoot and that bubbles can
persist for some time _ indeed, that is their nature. It also shows
that the bigger a bubble gets, the greater the excesses it creates
in the economy _ and the bigger the bang when it eventually pops.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in truth, impossible to know whether share prices are
overvalued right now. But over the past year or so, evidence of a
bubble has mounted with every sign of excess elsewhere in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Households and firms are on a borrowing spree. The private
sector's financial deficit has risen to an unprecedented 5 percent
of GDP (in the previous 50 years it has never exceeded 1 percent).
Money-supply growth is rapid. And America's current-account deficit
is heading for a record 4 percent of GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
   These are all classic symptoms of a bubble. What about the
second objection: that even if shares are overvalued, why should
the Fed worry?
</P>
<P>
   America's inflation rate is low, so there seems no case for
higher interest rates. But inflation has been held down by many
one-off factors _ such as a strong dollar and, thanks to weak
demand in the rest of the world, low commodity and import prices _
which may already be going into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, central banks should not ignore another sort
of inflation: in the prices of assets, such as shares and
property. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Economist argues that many central banks have focused too
narrowly on consumer-price inflation. Excessive rises in asset
prices can be as dangerous as conventional inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden surges in wealth can, for example, encourage excessive
borrowing, which, when borrowers are forced to readjust their
finances, can cause a painful hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest World Economic Outlook, published this week, the
IMF argues that conventional inflation can sometimes be a poor
gauge of whether an economy is overheating, and urges central banks
to pay more attention to other signs of imbalance, such as rising
asset prices, rapid credit growth, private-sector financial
deficits and current-account deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF suggests that overheating in asset markets may call for
monetary tightening not only when it threatens an increase in
product-price inflation, but also when asset prices increase to
unsustainable levels that threaten to destabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the Fed should adopt a target for the
Dow. But it should take more account of the impact of asset prices
on the economy. &QL;

<P>
   Greenspan has worried long and hard about share prices since his
``irrational exuberance'' speech in December 1996, but he seems to
have concluded that there was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Partly, perhaps, because of the third popular criticism of
our bubble thesis: that it is too risky, both economically and
politically, for a central bank to prick a bubble by raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell when and by how much rates should be raised.
And the Fed, like other central banks, has a mandate only to
deliver stability in consumer prices. If the Fed deliberately tried
to push down share prices, it would quickly come under fierce
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding when to prick a bubble is indeed devilishly hard. But
that is no reason for inaction. Instead, it argues for acting
preemptively to prevent a bubble inflating in the first place _ as

<TEXT>
<P>
   Babies should be a reason for joy. Instead, the arrival of the 6
billionth member of humanity some time around now is being greeted
with gloom.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) worries that the
fastest growth is in the poorest countries. A new study financed by
Cornell University frets that 12 billion people will suffer
miserably by 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the days of Malthus, demography seems to have
inspired despondency. At a local level, in overcrowded places, such
gloom can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 or 100 years' time, however, most countries are more
likely to worry about the lack of babies than the excess. For there
is now a serious possibility, encapsulated in the lowest of three
projections made by the U.N., that world population growth will
stabilize by around 2040 at about 7.5 billion _ and then start to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable? Economists have predicted a birth dearth before, on
the eve of the Second World War, and been wrong. But fertility
decline is now universal and rapid. Repeatedly, the U.N.'s
demographers have revised down their population projections.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, the fall in fertility has had much attention:
in 61 countries, it is at or below replacement rate, implying an
eventual fall in population. But the change has occurred even
faster in poor countries. Since 1969, developing countries have
seen fertility fall from six children per woman to three.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the effect of this astonishing trend has been
disguised by the fact that the number of women of childbearing age
has almost doubled, and that child survival and the average life
span have both risen.
</P>
<P>
   It will be clearer around 2010 when, if the U.N.'s ``low
fertility'' projection turns out to be the right one, the number of
babies born into the world will fall below the number needed for
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Making long-term projections, even demographic ones, for such
things is notoriously hazardous. And many of the immediate
problems, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, will continue to be
those of growth, not decline.

   If the low-fertility projection were to come about, the median
age of the world's population, close to 20 at the start of this

</P>

fertility rates in rapid decline, the debate about the global birth
rate is now over when, not whether, it will fall below replacement
level.

   Some countries will remain preoccupied with birth control. But
in many others, attention will have to switch to finding ways to
provide for old folk when families can no longer do the job. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Babies should be a reason for joy. Instead, the arrival of the 6
billionth member of humanity some time around now is being greeted
with gloom.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) worries that the
fastest growth is in the poorest countries. A new study financed by
Cornell University frets that 12 billion people will suffer
miserably by 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the days of Malthus, demography seems to have
inspired despondency. At a local level, in overcrowded places, such
gloom can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 or 100 years' time, however, most countries are more
likely to worry about the lack of babies than the excess. For there
is now a serious possibility, encapsulated in the lowest of three
projections made by the U.N., that world population growth will
stabilize by around 2040 at about 7.5 billion _ and then start to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable? Economists have predicted a birth dearth before, on
the eve of the Second World War, and been wrong. But fertility
decline is now universal and rapid. Repeatedly, the U.N.'s
demographers have revised down their population projections.
</P>
<P>
   In the rich world, the fall in fertility has had much attention:
in 61 countries, it is at or below replacement rate, implying an
eventual fall in population. But the change has occurred even
faster in poor countries. Since 1969, developing countries have
seen fertility fall from six children per woman to three.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the effect of this astonishing trend has been
disguised by the fact that the number of women of childbearing age
has almost doubled, and that child survival and the average life
span have both risen.
</P>
<P>
   It will be clearer around 2010 when, if the U.N.'s ``low
fertility'' projection turns out to be the right one, the number of
babies born into the world will fall below the number needed for
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Making long-term projections, even demographic ones, for such
things is notoriously hazardous. And many of the immediate
problems, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, will continue to be
those of growth, not decline.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much emphasis on the notion of an explosion, it is
well worth contemplating the opposite, and now at least as likely,
development: what Nicholas Eberstadt, an American demographer,
calls a ``population implosion.''

THE SIBLING RIVALRY OF AL GORE AND BILL BRADLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The contest between Al Gore and Bill Bradley has some of the
bitterness of sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have certain policy differences, at root theirs is
a clash of personalities, not of backgrounds or beliefs. They are
like members of a family who exhibit the same characteristics in
different and hostile guises.
</P>
<P>
   Consider their styles. Both are self-confident and wooden. Their
stump speeches are models of dullness. Neither has faltered in his
desire to be president. They trundle towards one other
relentlessly, like tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore's determination has a controlled, disciplined character
about it. Perhaps because he has spent so long in a White House
under perpetual attack, or perhaps because as the front-runner he
has so much to lose even from a single gaffe, he has become
habitually defensive and restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners respect, but do not warm to, his slick and competent
speeches. He seems to be sticking to a script someone else has
written.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's uncharismatic relentlessness has a different quality.
He too is sticking to a script _ but one he has written himself,
obscurities and all. His low-key nonchalance, the opposite of
slick, comes across as unvarnished sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   His introspective manner, his maddening refusal not to speak
about the big issues yet, even his decision to run for the
presidency now, when he claims he ``is ready,'' rather than
earlier, when it might have been politically more convenient _ all
these suggest an unflashy but deep self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is even beginning to display, on the evidence of last
weekend, an unexpected talent for good humor on television.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also display different forms of a more admirable
quality: integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has avoided most of the sleaze of the Clinton White House
(though not a certain part of the blame for it). He was a dutiful
son of a senator and is now a stalwart of the moderate wing of the
Democratic Party. His is the integrity of the loyal vice-captain.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's is that of the high-minded independent. He is a man
who, first as senator and now as candidate, likes to carve out a
position on matters that appeal to him and pursue it with dour
scrupulousness.
</P>
<P>
   He is not necessarily loyal. He resigned from the Senate in
1996, abandoning to others the task of defending the Democrats from
the then-rampant Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He even flirted, a year earlier, with leaving the party, saying
that ``politics is broken'' and complaining that ``neither
political party speaks to people where they live their lives.'' It
is impossible to imagine such words coming from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two men has a bearing on how voters
think they would do one of the most important jobs of a president:
that of commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other world leader, the American president must
show good judgment in matters of war and peace. Bradley scores
better (on an admittedly tiny sample) in this dragon-slaying test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll make an exceptional commander-in-chief,'' says
Bob Kerrey, the only senator to have backed Bradley so far.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has 14 senators in his camp but not one has used this form
of praise in their endorsements. This does not mean that Gore would
be a bad commander-in-chief, but it does suggest that his
supporters do not associate him with the qualities that are needed
when American soldiers have to go into the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the policies of the two men. Both are pushing for a
more energetic and intrusive role for government than anything
Clinton has offered since the Republican landslide of 1994. But
Gore's activism comes in the shape of a swarm of small reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Putting limits on urban sprawl, employing more teachers to cut
class sizes, expanding health insurance for children _ all these
are one cautious step beyond Clintonian micro-initiatives, such as
encouraging school uniforms or boosting parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bradley's governmental activism is that of the
broad brush. He wants much tougher gun controls, universal health
care and an overhaul of the campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   These last two would require nothing less than defeating the
special-interest groups that cling to the status quo and changing
the way the government works.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is an incrementalist, though his many small policies would
add up to a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to transform politics through a few bold strokes.
He is the John McCain of the left _ an outsider with inside
knowledge, determined to clean up a corrupt political system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bill Bradley seems more gawkily sympathetic as a man,
higher-minded as a leader and bolder as a policymaker. These
qualities explain why he is now running neck-and-neck with Al Gore
in all sorts of recent opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But can he win the nomination? That is a different matter. To be
nominated (and to be an effective president) requires
wheeler-dealer skills as well _ the ability to maintain a network
of allies and a knowledge of political trench warfare. In this
respect, Gore has the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley was in the Senate, he gained a reputation as the
sort who sees the big picture but overlooks his constituents'
parochial concerns. This has helped him widen his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Over one-third of Republicans say they would consider voting for
him, a much higher share than would dream of choosing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice-president has cemented support within his own party
so successfully that he has almost shut Bradley out. Most
Democratic officials support him, and they alone have a fifth of
the vote at the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Among black voters, two prefer Gore for every one who prefers
Bradley. And in the South, a recent Gallup poll suggested that 72
percent of Democrats support Gore and only 19 percent Bradley. The
vice-president has a big advantage in states that control about a
third of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore nomination is not yet a foregone conclusion. Bradley's
success is creating uncertainty among Democratic voters, and is
nourishing the view that he would be better than Gore at winning
Republican and independent votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegate arithmetic is powerful. The Democratic race is
evolving into a contest between the man better placed to win the
presidency and the one who is far more likely to win the
nomination. &QL;

   SYDNEY _ Officials have long described East Timor as the one
``thorn'' in Australia's relations with Indonesia, its closest
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   If East Timor's independence referendum on Aug. 30 went
smoothly, it was argued, the thorn would be plucked out: Australia
and Indonesia would be headed for a bright future as regional
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter carried out in East Timor since the ballot by
pro-Indonesia militias, with the blessing of the army, has left
Australia's policymakers shocked and its relations with its
northern neighbor in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of embarking on a new partnership with Indonesia,
Australian soldiers are leading an international force to bring
peace to East Timor. They are facing a possibly hostile Indonesian
army, and Australia is being abused in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, accused
Australia of being ``excessive and unhelpful,'' and said his
government ``deplores the stance of Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   John Howard, the Australian prime minister, told a special
sitting of Parliament that the country's relations with Indonesia
were under ``great strain.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an understatement. The chaos in East Timor has
presented Australia with its biggest foreign-policy and defense
crisis since the Vietnam War 30 years ago _ some would say since
the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dibb, the head of strategic and defense studies at the
Australian National University, and formerly one of the architects
of Australian foreign policy, says, ``We're now in an era of
discontinuity. All the givens are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The givens for Australia have rested on two blocks: the American
alliance, born of the Cold War, and an engagement with Asia,
stemming from a need to tame old Australian fears about invasion
from the north.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Indonesia has been central to Australia's Asian
attentions, sometimes obsessively so. The overcrowded archipelago _
whose population, the world's fourth-biggest, is 11 times
Australia's _ lies close to the underpopulated expanses of ``the
lucky country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has never shown any inclination to expand into
Australia, but many Australians remain nervous of the idea, never
more so than now.
</P>
<P>
   Australia turned a blind eye when Indonesia invaded East Timor
in 1975, after Portugal, the colonial power, had bolted. Australia
then became the only western country to recognize Indonesia's claim
of sovereignty over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Appeasing Indonesia rather than making a fuss about its
brutality in East Timor was the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A review in 1986 of Australia's defense capabilities by Dibb
served to reinforce the policy. It argued that any military threat
to Australia was most likely to come from or through the Indonesian
archipelago, which lies across vital air and sea lanes, but that
such a threat was likely to be remote as long as Indonesia was
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's former Labor government put much effort into keeping
Indonesia stable. Paul Keating, prime minister from 1991 to 1996,
counted ex-President Suharto, Indonesia's dictatorial leader at the
time, as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Keating's government signed a security treaty with Indonesia in
1995. It involved a degree of cooperation between the two
countries' armed forces that many Australians found uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   All that now counts for nothing. The fall of the Suharto regime
last year, and the violence that swept through East Timor before
the ballot, caught Australia's conservative coalition government by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It was Howard who had written to Habibie in December suggesting
a process of self-determination for East Timor. This was seen as a
bid by Australia to expedite the removal of the East Timorese
thorn. It has not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's critics, mainly among the pro-Indonesia lobby, say the
referendum should never have been held, certainly not until
democracy was more strongly established in Indonesia itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the government had been prepared to wait, argues Rawdon
Dalrymple, a former Australian ambassador to Indonesia and the
United States, ``we would not now have found ourselves truly and
definitively the odd man out in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize how far out, Indonesia on Sept. 16 cancelled
the security treaty that Australia thought would bring the two
countries together in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's adviser on foreign affairs, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a
young woman educated at an Australian university, said Australian
troops would be ``singled out'' as targets by militias and
Indonesian soldiers in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle has also exposed Australia to a new reality over its
other foreign-policy block, the American alliance. Howard asked
President Bill Clinton to commit ``boots on the ground'' to the
United Nations force, meaning troops.
</P>
<P>
   It was a request more appropriate to the Cold War, when
Australia supported the United States with troops in Korea and
Vietnam, than to an era when the Americans expect allies to pull
their own weight in their own regions.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is stretching itself to the limit by committing 4,500
troops to East Timor; America has offered 200 logistical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's relations with Indonesia will take years to recover.
Already, Howard has proposed spending more on defense, and he is
cautious about making Australia an Asian power, as Keating seemed
to be ready to do. ``Foreign policy needs to be based on national
interest and on our values,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dibb suggests East Timor will be a turning-point for
Australia's assessment of its place in the world: ``We are now more
alone than we have been probably at any time since the 1930s.'' &QL;

   JOHANNESBURG _ Sun, surf, seafood and sauvignon blanc are not,
it seems, enough. To entice visitors to Cape Town, the local
tourist office has decided to emphasize the city's thriving sex
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that foreign tourists may have been deterred by bombs on
the waterfront and gloomy crime reports, the Cape's official
boosters are letting it be known that those who seek illicit
thrills will find them in Cape Town. This follows an earlier
promotion of the city as a gay-friendly city, which indeed it is.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cape Town has long prided itself on a relatively free,
almost Californian image, none of this could have happened under
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's old state was not only racist, but also prudish.
Commercial sex, interracial sex, homosexuality and even Playboy
were all suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new South African constitution, by contrast, is perhaps the
most protective of gay rights in the world. In fact, the country
has become more permissive than most of its rather conservative
citizens, black or white, find comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Massage parlors and gay bars appeared towards the end of
apartheid, but they have grown more numerous and blatant since
1994, when the African National Congress came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ANC members probably disapprove of prostitution; some frown
on homosexuality. But few think it worthwhile to police what
happens between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   The new permissiveness affects city-dwellers more than country
people, the rich more than the poor. But it is still a change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old regime, policemen cruised parks and beaches
looking for homosexuals to entrap; 300 people a year were jailed
for sodomy. Now, same-sex couples openly hold hands in
Johannesburg's mall cafes, and the police are more likely to
protect gay pickup spots from muggers than to persecute those
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the censors banned an Iris Murdoch novel with a
Picasso nude on the cover. Now, plays such as ``Shopping and
F------'' (EDITORS: EXPLETIVE REMOVED) enjoy full houses.
</P>
<P>
   The laws against interracial sex were particularly cruel and
stupid, though they had been repealed by the time the ANC took
over. On stage, performances of ``Othello'' were allowed, but only
with an all-white cast and audience, so the Moor left smudges on
Desdemona's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of change has left many South Africans confused.
Liberals applaud the new tolerance for homosexuals, which contrasts
starkly with the situation in many other African countries, where
they face long jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that tolerance for commercial sex may be unwise
when AIDS threatens to kill a third of the population. The Cape
Town tourist office counters that it will direct punters only to
brothels that treat their employees well and encourage condom use.
</P>
<P>
   Not all attempts to cash in on South Africa's new permissiveness
succeed. Not long ago a farmer tried to organize a ``hooker hunt,''
in which punters were to pay to stalk naked prostitutes in the
bushveld, and shoot them with paint balls. This proved unappealing
to all but a tiny handful of oafs. So the ladies kept their shirts
on, while the farmer lost his. &QL;

   JOHANNESBURG _ Sun, surf, seafood and sauvignon blanc are not,
it seems, enough. To entice visitors to Cape Town, the local
tourist office has decided to emphasize the city's thriving sex
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that foreign tourists may have been deterred by bombs on
the waterfront and gloomy crime reports, the Cape's official
boosters are letting it be known that those who seek illicit
thrills will find them in Cape Town. This follows an earlier
promotion of the city as a gay-friendly city, which indeed it is.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cape Town has long prided itself on a relatively free,
almost Californian image, none of this could have happened under
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's old state was not only racist, but also prudish.
Commercial sex, interracial sex, homosexuality and even Playboy
were all suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The new South African constitution, by contrast, is perhaps the
most protective of gay rights in the world. In fact, the country
has become more permissive than most of its rather conservative
citizens, black or white, find comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Massage parlors and gay bars appeared towards the end of
apartheid, but they have grown more numerous and blatant since
1994, when the African National Congress came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ANC members probably disapprove of prostitution; some frown
on homosexuality. But few think it worthwhile to police what
happens between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   The new permissiveness affects city-dwellers more than country
people, the rich more than the poor. But it is still a change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old regime, policemen cruised parks and beaches
looking for homosexuals to entrap; 300 people a year were jailed
for sodomy. Now, same-sex couples openly hold hands in
Johannesburg's mall cafes, and the police are more likely to
protect gay pickup spots from muggers than to persecute those
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the censors banned an Iris Murdoch novel with a
Picasso nude on the cover. Now, plays such as ``Shopping and
F------'' (EDITORS: EXPLETIVE REMOVED) enjoy full houses.
</P>
<P>
   The laws against interracial sex were particularly cruel and
stupid, though they had been repealed by the time the ANC took
over. On stage, performances of ``Othello'' were allowed, but only
with an all-white cast and audience, so the Moor left smudges on
Desdemona's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of change has left many South Africans confused.
Liberals applaud the new tolerance for homosexuals, which contrasts
starkly with the situation in many other African countries, where
they face long jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that tolerance for commercial sex may be unwise
when AIDS threatens to kill a third of the population. The Cape
Town tourist office counters that it will direct punters only to
brothels that treat their employees well and encourage condom use.
</P>
<P>
   Not all attempts to cash in on South Africa's new permissiveness
succeed. Not long ago a farmer tried to organize a ``hooker hunt,''
in which punters were to pay to stalk naked prostitutes in the
bushveld, and shoot them with paint balls. This proved unappealing
to all but a tiny handful of oafs. So the ladies kept their shirts
on, while the farmer lost his. &QL;

   BALTIMORE, MD. _ Two months ago, it would have seemed nonsense.
A 36-year-old white lawyer who plays electric guitar in an Irish
band, and is almost unknown to most local people, will become the
next mayor of 65 percent-black Baltimore?
</P>
<P>
   Farfetched though it sounds, it is likely to happen. Having
handily won the Democratic nomination in the primary election on
Sept. 14, and with nine in ten Baltimore voters registered as
Democrats, Martin O'Malley will almost certainly be elected mayor
on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   He has the endorsement of some key black leaders. His proposals
for cutting down crime in a city riddled with it are clearly
popular. And he has so far been unspattered by the mud thrown up in
the politics of a city that embodies the worst of urban America.
</P>
<P>
   Can O'Malley save Baltimore?
</P>
<P>
   ``Charm City,'' 35 miles north of Washington, sometimes seems
like one huge crack-cocaine and heroin market; city officials think
that as many as an eighth of its people are addicts.
</P>
<P>
   It has the country's highest venereal-disease rate and its
fourth-highest murder rate, three times that of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   It is also desperately short of money. Each month about 1,000 of
the city's population of 630,000 understandably depart to live in
the suburbs, draining its tax base and causing a projected $153
million budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 30 years ago Baltimore had a strong blue-collar
economy based on a busy port, bustling factories and the fruits of
the vast Chesapeake Bay. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, a political analyst in nearby Washington, thinks
no right-minded person would want to be mayor of such a city.
``Shouldn't we have them take sanity tests?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unmistakable smile of relief on the face of the
outgoing mayor, Kurt Schmoke, when he announced that he did not
propose to run for another term in office.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, no fewer than 27 people, 17 of them Democrats,
said they wanted the job. But then it turned out that several had
criminal records, three had filed for bankruptcy, and one had
barely a primary-school education.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt was made to draw in some more impressive candidates,
including the president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Kweisi Mfume, who used to represent
central Baltimore in Congress; but none took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually three front-runners emerged, two black and one white.
One of the blacks, Lawrence A. Bell III, was the youngish president
of the city council and seemed a good prospect. But his campaign
was bumbling, and local journalists accused him of being sloppy
with money; he soon faded.
</P>
<P>
   The other main black contender, Carl Stokes, was a former member
of the school board and offered himself as ``the education
candidate.'' However, it emerged that he had not in fact graduated
from the local university he claimed as his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized, and won some useful support, but by then it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Enter O'Malley, a fresh-faced lawyer who sauntered into the race
barely three weeks before the filing deadline. O'Malley had been a
vigorous member of the city council, yet few people knew him
outside his constituency in northeast Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was dismissed as a white yuppie imported from the
Washington suburbs. But he gained momentum as his opponents
stumbled and as his promise to reform Baltimore caught the voters'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would immediately clean up the busiest drug markets,
and come down hard on petty criminals. He pointed to his work on
the council, where he had attacked police and housing officials for
corruption and pushed for stiffer punishment of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that the city's middle-class northern neighborhoods
got better police protection than its poorer parts, but vowed to
change all that. It was music to the ears of people long accustomed
to hearing gun shots close to their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a racially divided city like Baltimore, even that
might not have been enough. But then O'Malley won the unprecedented
public support of some of the city's top black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They were called ``race-traitors'' by an angry minority, but the
quiet majority were more interested in sorting out the city than in
voting for someone who looked like them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stokes and Bell won 25 percent and 17 percent of the
primary vote, no match for O'Malley's 53 percent. It was one of the
biggest political surprises in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now O'Malley, assuming he wins election in November, faces an
even longer shot: cleaning up Baltimore. &QL;

BIFFLE SETS RECORD WITH NINTH TRUCK VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Greg Biffle cashed in a trifecta worthy of this
gambling mecca during the Orleans 250 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
race last night.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle set a single-season record with his ninth victory,
increased his lead in the driver's championship by five points, and
locked up Ford Division's first manufacturer's title at the
1.5-mile Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle pitted for four tires _ his last set of Goodyear rubber _
117 laps into the 167-lapper. He then survived a door-banging
battle against Jack Sprague with nine laps remaining to finish
0.299-seconds ahead of Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great strategy to do a four-tire stop and not come in
on the last caution,'' said Biffle, driver of the No. 50 Grainger
Ford owned by Jack Roush. ``We didn't have the best truck, but we
had the best pit strategy. I don't think we could have passed the
16 \Rof Ron Hornaday\S or the 24 \Rof Sprague\S on the track. We
passed them in the pits tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle, who has won eight of the past 12 races, broke the record
of eight single-season victories set by former series champion Mike
Skinner in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle came into the 22nd of 25 races with a 125-point lead over
Sprague, and increased the advantage to 130. The tour will compete
at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to stay focused for the rest of the year and let
things take care of themselves,'' said Biffle, who led twice for 29
laps _ including the final 28.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle, 29, helped Ford end Chevrolet's four-year run as
manufacturer's champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Jack Roush promised me a new \RFord\S Excursion
for my ninth win,'' Biffle said. ``So maybe I'll call him on
Monday.''  &LR; subheds:Brack eyes CART ride Reigning Indy Racing League
and Indianapolis 500 champion Kenny Brack denied that he has signed
a contract to drive for car-owner Bobby Rahal in the rival
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series beginning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brack's contract with Pep Boys IRL car-owner A.J. Foyt of
Houston expires at the end of this season. The IRL finale is
scheduled for Texas Motor Speedway on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not signed with anybody for the future, as for now,''
Brack said after a day of practice leading to today's
qualifications for the Vegas.com 500. ``I've been talking to him
\RRahal\S. And I've been talking to A.J., too. So nothing's
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But IRL regular Jeff Ward, currently employed by Pagan Racing,
met with Foyt late yesterday to talk contract for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal, a former three-time CART champion and Indy 500 winner, is
looking to replace Bryan Herta in the No. 8 Shell Reynard/Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what comes out of it,'' said Brack, driver of Foyt's
new No. 14 Power Team G Force/Aurora. ``For now, I'm trying to
concentrate on doing the best I can in the remaining two races in
the IRL.''  &LR; subheds:Ribbs plans IRL debut Willy T. Ribbs will make
IRL history today as the first black driver to attempt a qualifying
run in the four-year-old series.
</P>
<P>
   Ribbs, who became the first black to qualify for the
Indianapolis 500 in 1991, has signed with team-owner Dennis
McCormack for the Las Vegas.com 500, the season-finale at Texas
Motor Speedway next month and into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to start 2000 now,'' said Ribbs, 43, who has been
without a full-time Indy-car ride since October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ribbs logged a combined 70 laps during yesterday's two practice
sessions, his first in the car. His top speed in the No. 30 Cole
Brothers Water-Team Losi G Force/Aurora was 201.305 mph, which will
get him into a field that has only 26 entries.

rehearsal for the regular season last night. When it was over, they
could only be glad there's still a week before the curtain goes up
on the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 3-0, last night in a
preseason game at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a preseason game isn't that big of a deal. Coaches use
them to look at young players fighting for jobs, to work on
different aspects of the game.
</P>
<P>
   This game, though, wasn't for auditions. The regular cast was in
place, and ready to show they know their lines.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour started in goal and played all three periods. Mike
Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen, who didn't make the trip to
Colorado for a 3-1 victory against the Avalanche on Thursday,
skated regular shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The only youngsters to play significant minutes were defensemen
Brad Lukovich and Richard Jackman, and forwards Blake Sloan and
Warren Luhning, and it appears as though they have spots on the
team all but wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the defending Stanley Cup champion Stars were hammered by
one of their chief rivals in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet, and there's less than a week to go,''
Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lost because their power play was awful, and Red Wings
backup goalie Ken Wregget was outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings were whistled for 19:49 of penalties, giving the
Stars almost a full period's worth of power-play time. The Stars,
though, were 0-12 with the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They had several good scoring chances, but Wregget was equal to
the task. He stopped all 30 shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some great saves, and some shots we just hit right at
him,'' Modano said. ``But we got a lot of shots, and that's
important. If you keep shooting, some are going to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the optimistic view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its purpose is to get you prepared for the regular season,''
Modano said. ``There's bright spots and there's not so bright
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, though, doesn't seem inclined to take
the optimistic view.
</P>
<P>
   He huddled with general manager Bob Gainey and assistant coaches
Rick Wilson and Doug Jarvis late after the game, declining to meet
with the media. He scheduled a practice for this morning, even
though the team is in the midst of playing three games in three
nights.
</P>
<P>
   If Hitchcock was indeed upset with the effort last night, he had
company. Even though the Stars are 4-2-2 in exhibition games,
Nieuwendyk said there's a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's been very solid for us,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``The bottom line is you can work all you want, but unless you're
committed to doing the little things we were committed to last year
we're not going to be very good. I think we have to have some solid
workouts this week and get prepared to play. We need to get
mentally prepared to play. It's time we got our heads on straight
and began playing hard in both practice and games.''
</P>
<P>
   The power-play failures were especially glaring considering the
Stars scored twice with the man-advantage against the Avalance on
Thursday, even though most of their big guns didn't make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, with the ``A'' team on the ice, they couldn't dent
Wregget.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a dress rehearsal, but the reviews were awful. The
Stars only have a week to get it right.

EVEN WITH TITLE IN GRASP, RANGERS SHOULD HOLD THE CELEBRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Here's a tip, free of charge and likely to be
ignored, to the soon-to-be-crowned champions of the American League
West: Put a cork in the champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' impressive 12-4 victory last night at The Ballpark
in Arlington officially put the A's into sunfish mode _ flopping
like a wall-eyed, gasping bluegill on the dock _ and virtually
locked up Texas' third division title in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Their magic number is down to three and the Rangers can
mathematically put the gritty A's out of their misery by finishing
off the sweep this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow another shower in the bubbly, whether it comes
tomorrow or sometime shortly afterward, seems out of place this
time.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion: Borrow a page from the Indians, who clinched
their fourth straight division crown while on a plane a couple of
weeks ago and celebrated with handshakes all around.
</P>
<P>
   Act like you've been here before and still have places to go
before you're finished.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Rangers' champagne party plans already have been
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zack \RMinasian, the Rangers' clubhouse supervisor\S asked me
the other day if we wanted to forget about it this year or do it
again,'' manager Johnny Oates said after watching the Rangers
explode in the A's faces like a trick cigar. ``I told him I've
learned to accept losses, but I'm still learning how to celebrate
wins. It hasn't become so commonplace around here that we take them
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a veteran club that knows we haven't finished our job
if we win the division. Even winning a World Series doesn't mean
you're finished. You celebrate the moment and come back tomorrow
prepared to go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be an excellent philosophy to apply tonight. The
Rangers quietly savored last night's victory while understanding
that there's still work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   But last night ... that was special.
</P>
<P>
   For three innings the Rangers played like a team trapped under a
frozen river. Try as they might, they couldn't find a way to break
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning Tom Goodwin lined into a double play at
first with runners at first and second. Leading off the third, Mark
McLemore tried to stretch a double into a triple and was thrown out
on a perfect relay by A's second baseman Randy Velarde. In the
fourth, with nobody out and runners at first and second, Todd Zeile
whacked a one-hopper back to pitcher Gil Heredia, who started
another double play.
</P>
<P>
   But the fifth, when this year is in the record books, may be
remembered as the Rangers' biggest inning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When McLemore lined a single through a drawn-in infield to score
Royce Clayton from third, tying the score at 1-1, it was as if the
entire Rangers' team let out a collective sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we were a caged animal and somebody opened the
door,'' Rafael Palmeiro said. ``We couldn't do anything right and
then we get the right hit at the right time and we go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy included three home runs and five RBI from Juan Gonzalez;
three hits each for McLemore and Clayton, including a home run; and
seven strong innings from starter Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jumbotron during the Rangers' six-run sixth: ``The Fat
Lady is Humming.''
</P>
<P>
   And the champagne soon will be flowing again.
</P>
<P>
   It was long overdue when the Rangers won their first division
crown in 25 years in '96. Every long-suffering Rangers' fan
deserved their own champagne bath.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, clinching in Seattle, it was only fitting that
the Rangers would spray champagne all over that dungeon known as
the Kingdome. I hope the visiting clubhouse still reeks of it when
they tear the place down next March.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, there's unfinished business still on the table.
Winning a division is not, the Rangers hopefully have discovered by
now, what this is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's their party and they intend to have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a division championship, you've accomplished
something,'' Palmeiro pointed out. ``This is a different year and
you deserve to celebrate. You owe it to yourself. You've worked
seven months to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said McLemore, this isn't a team that has become as
blase about winning as the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shake hands?'' McLemore said. ``I don't think so. When you win
the division by 25 games, you can do that, I guess. We haven't done
that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Go ahead and party. I think I've still got that
smelly, champagne-drenched T-shirt I wore last year in Seattle in
the back of the closet somewhere.

GREER, GONZALEZ PROVIDE HEALTHIER PICTURE FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers received two pieces of
encouraging news last night.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer was back in the lineup and Juan Gonzalez was driving
the ball again. Both were missing pieces vital to the success of
the Rangers' offensive machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez admitted before the game he continues to be bothered by
the bruised left wrist that has been a problem for him most of the
second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent,'' Gonzalez said. ``Sometimes I feel it,
sometimes I don't. It's like 90 percent, but I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the wrist keeps him from driving the ball like he
wants. He entered last night's against Oakland with just one home
run and three runs batted in during his last 13 games. But he ended
that by hitting three home runs in a game for the third time in his
career, and the Rangers won, 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who was hit in the eye with a baseball thrown by pitcher
Rick Helling during batting practice on Sept. 13, called manager
Johnny Oates at 1 p.m. yesterday and said he was ready to go back
into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some improvement the last three days,'' Greer said.
``Hopefully I can go back and play nine innings. The only way to
find out is to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer was hitless in five at-bats with two strikeouts, but he
did make a terrific diving catch on Matt Stairs' short fly ball in
the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the 0-for-5 was more not hitting in nine days,'' Greer
said. ``I was pretty close to normal out there. I felt a lot more
confident and comfortable in the outfield and at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who suffered a broken nose and a bruised retina when he
was hit, had played just four innings since the injury occurred in
Kansas City. He tried to play Tuesday against the Baltimore Orioles
but left the game in the fourth when he had trouble seeing the ball
in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had lost four of five games going into their
American League West showdown with the Oakland Athletics, but Greer
said he wasn't coming back out of a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the fact we only have 10 games left in the
season,'' Greer said. ``I want to be in there and help us win it.
We have a good ballclub with or without me. I just want to get in
there and complement what we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said, ``It's his call. It's totally up to him. The doctors
said he couldn't hurt it any more. It's just a matter of him being
able to see. I said, `I'll start you, if you can't see, I'll take
you out.'''

HOW THE GOVERNMENT'S INQUIRY INTO TOBACCO LOST ITS STEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.D., Ind.)  (mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER, DAVID JOHNSTON and LOWELL BERGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After five years and tens of millions of dollars, the Justice
Department's criminal investigation of the tobacco industry boiled
down to this: one misdemeanor charge against an obscure
biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had scrutinized whether industry executives lied and
perjured themselves in 1994, when they testified before Congress
that cigarettes were not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had plowed through corporate documents for
evidence that cigarette makers manipulated the level of nicotine in
their product. Whistle-blowers and scientists had testified before
grand juries as star witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, when Attorney General Janet Reno announced a
broad civil lawsuit accusing cigarette makers of racketeering and
fraud and seeking to recover billions in health-care costs related
to smoking, Justice officials also announced that their criminal
inquiry was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case that the criminal division decided they were not
likely to win,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   How the government's investigation of an entire industry came to
an end without producing indictments is the story of an ambitious
effort made more difficult by the complex science of cigarette
making, disagreements between federal officials, disappointing
witnesses and an unfavorable court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, prosecutors faced the problem of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that cigarette makers had knowingly misled the
public and regulators about the health risks of smoking and the
addictive nature of nicotine. Faced this spring with expiring
deadlines for filing a criminal action, the government chose an
easier course, a civil lawsuit in which its burden of proof would
be lower.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the criminal inquiry began, cigarette companies have
denied that they misled the government about their knowledge of the
health hazards of smoking or that they manipulated nicotine levels
to keep smokers smoking. In the last two years, the nation's
biggest tobacco companies have agreed to pay $246 billion over 25
years to settle lawsuits filed by states to recover health care
costs related to smoking and signed consent agreements not to
misrepresent the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the government's lawsuit last week, tobacco
companies asked why the Justice Department had chosen to charge
them with crimes in a civil suit, when it had dropped its criminal
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot help but question the department's motives in
making those same allegations under the guise of a quasi-criminal''
case, said Kenneth Handal, associate general counsel for Philip
Morris Cos., ``after it found no basis for bringing those same
charges in its criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   With Philip Morris, the other defendants in the civil suit are
Brown &AMP; Williamson, a division of BAT Industries PLC; R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co.; Lorillard Tobacco Co., a division of Loews Corp.;
Liggett Group, a division of the Brooke Group, and two now-defunct
trade groups, the Council for Tobacco Research USA Inc. and the
Tobacco Institute Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's criminal inquiry goes back to April 14,
1994, when seven top executives of cigarette companies stood before
Congress during the hearing about the risks of their products and
swore that nicotine was not addictive and that no one had proved
that smoking caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., sent a memorandum to
Reno urging her to investigate the executives for possible perjury
because of the mass of scientific evidence on the addictiveness of
nicotine and the link between smoking and cancer. The assignment
was passed on to Jimmye Warren, a senior trial lawyer in the
Justice Department's fraud section, who decided to look into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Proving perjury, however, is extremely difficult, and the
tobacco industry wasted little time mounting a counteroffensive.
Three lawyers hired by cigarette makers, including Robert Fiske,
the original Whitewater prosecutor, soon went to the Justice
Department to argue that lawmakers had asked broad questions and
that the executives had expressed their beliefs, for which they
could not be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than ending, the investigation mushroomed. By 1995,
thousands of secret Brown &AMP; Williamson documents stolen from a law
firm by a paralegal, Merrell Williams, suggested that the company
had long known about the risks of smoking. States including
Mississippi, Minnesota and Florida had sued cigarette makers, and
the discovery process would produce millions more documents. And
whistle-blowers like Jeffrey Wigand, a former top executive at
Brown &AMP; Williamson, had also appeared to accuse industry officials
of lying about their products' addictive nature.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, federal prosecutors had convened grand jury inquiries
in Alexandria, Va.; Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York; the
District of Columbia and New Orleans, to investigate the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   One Justice task force was investigating whether Philip Morris
had illegally manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to
keep smokers addicted. A second group was investigating whether
R.J. Reynolds, despite its denials, was aiming its advertising at
underage smokers. A third was looking into whether Brown &AMP;
Williamson had made false statements to federal officials about
efforts to genetically engineer seeds to produce plants with higher
nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   After infighting among the different jurisdictions, top
officials at the Justice Department in Washington took control of
the grand jury investigations in mid-1996 and consolidated them. It
became the government's most significant prosecutorial effort aimed
at a single consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   The potential criminal violations under investigation were
broad, including accusations of fraud, conspiracy, racketeering and
perjury against tobacco executives, plus an accusation that the
executives had obstructed a Congressional investigation into how
much the companies knew about nicotine and the hazards of smoking,
lawyers following the inquiries said.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials said that the criminal inquiry led
into a succession of dead ends. Several prosecution theories were
tried, including sweeping charges of a pattern of deceitful
conduct. Senior officials concluded that they were not likely to
prevail in a criminal trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At one point, prosecutors weighed whether they could file a
criminal racketeering complaint, using a federal law usually
applied against organized crime and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   That approach would have permitted authorities to reach far back
in time to show a pattern of wrongdoing. But a senior FBI official
involved in the tobacco inquiry said the Justice Department's fraud
division had resisted suggestions to bring criminal charges under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors considered bringing a simpler fraud case,
showing a pattern of more recent misconduct. Eventually that
approach was also abandoned because of the difficulties in showing
that executives had intentionally and fraudulently misled the
government about the dangers of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators unearthed evidence showing that the executives had
maneuvered carefully in their communications with regulators around
issues like nicotine addiction, often guided by lawyers who advised
them on nearly every major action. At one point, government
prosecutors considered bringing charges against those lawyers but
then dropped that possibility because it would have been a
difficult legal hurdle, said one plaintiffs' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Osdene, the head of research at Philip Morris for nearly
two decades, was viewed by many plaintiffs' lawyers as a witness
whose testimony in the criminal inquiry might spell doom for the
industry. Documents indicated that Osdene had shifted the company's
sensitive nicotine research abroad, apparently to avoid scrutiny by
regulators, and possibly destroyed important records. Two FBI
agents arrived at Osdene's home in Richmond, Va., in 1996 with a
subpoena for any Philip Morris documents he had retained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Osdene tried to strike an immunity deal with the
Justice Department, but his offer was rejected. Several lawyers
knowledgeable about the case said that he later reached such an
agreement with prosecutors, but added that any testimony he might
have given did not affect events. Osdene did not return telephone
calls. His lawyer, John Nields, declined to comment on whether
Osdene had been granted immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The company that faced the greatest danger was Brown &AMP;
Williamson, because it was the only producer notified by the
government that it was a target of its investigation. Prosecutors
were looking at whether company officials had, among other things,
lied to the Food and Drug Administration in 1994 when they said
they had not developed genetically engineered tobacco seeds with
enhanced nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators discovered that such a seed, code-named Y-1, had been
developed for Brown &AMP; Williamson by a small biotechnology company,
DNA Plant Technology Corp. of Oakland, Calif. And in the first and
only charge brought in the criminal case, Justice Department
officials accused the firm of conspiring with a cigarette maker to
produce nicotine-enriched tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, DNA Plant Technology pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor count of conspiring to illegally export the Y-1 seeds
and agreed to cooperate in the government's continuing inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson officials were soon brought to testify before
a grand jury in Washington. But that inquiry also died. Raymond
Marshall, a lawyer in San Francisco who represented DNA Plant
Technology, said he never heard from Justice Department officials
again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government's inquiry suffered a setback when a
federal appeals court ruled that the FDA did not have authority to
regulate tobacco, raising doubts about the ability of prosecutors
to bring charges that companies had made false statements to the
agency. In a separate ruling, another judge declined to give
prosecutors access to certain Brown &AMP; Williamson records, saying
that they were confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Both enthusiasm and time were running out. By early this year,
prosecutors were assigned to different jobs, and it was clear, said
industry lawyers, that indictments were highly unlikely because
statutes of limitations were expiring.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Clinton abruptly announced during his
State of the Union address that the Justice Department planned to
file a civil lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers like Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Kent Conrad of North Dakota had met with Reno to urge such
action last year, after the collapse of tobacco legislation in the
Senate. And for a time, officials in the Justice Department's civil
division had debated whether to bring such a suit.

   But G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame University law professor who
consulted with Kennedy and Conrad, said the president's speech had
sounded the starting bell that resulted in last week's filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president hadn't told them to do it, they would still
be debating,'' Blakey said. ``It was basically a thunderclap.''

<P>
   SAFRICA-ARMY-INTEGRATION (Bloemfontein, South Africa) _ Last
week, as weeping families buried their dead and government
officials promised a thorough inquiry, the nation embarked on a
soul-wrenching debate over the the racial transformation of the
National Defense Force. Since 1994, more than 22,700 former
liberation fighters and black homeland soldiers have been
integrated into the military, Government statistics show. The
Defense Force, which was then 45 percent white and 38 percent
black, is now less than 31 percent white and more than 55 percent
black. By Rachel L. Swarns. (With a map.)

<P>
   FRANCE-CHAMPAGNE (Ay, France) _ Sales of French Champagne have
been setting records for months. But here in the heart of the
Champagne-making region of France, talk of a shortage is laughed
off as nonsense. Why would any smart winemaker mismanage the
millennium? By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   G7-MEETING (Washington) _ With financial markets around the
world rattled by the surprising climb of the Japanese yen against
the dollar, the top economic officials of the world's wealthiest
nations began meeting here Saturday to decide whether to intervene
or to let Japan solve the problem itself. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SCANDAL-ASSESS (Washington) _ Despite the acrimony
between congressional Republicans and the White House, the Clinton
administration emerged relatively unscathed in the past week after
several days of hearings into allegations of Russian corruption and
money laundering at the Bank of New York. By Eric SChmitt.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-PROTEST (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ While calm returned to
Indonesia's capital Saturday after anti-military riots here left at
least six people dead, students took to the streets of another
large Indonesian city and hurled rocks and burning tires at
soldiers and police in a protest over a proposed law that would
grant sweeping new powers to the army. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-RDP (Dili, East Timor) _ When Marcos Napoleao Soares
returned Saturday to his burned-out house he walked on a carpet of
soft grey ash. The place he called his ``sweet home'' was gone:
blackened, empty, partly roofless, filled with the rustling of the
cool bamboo trees outside. But for the moment, none of that seemed
to matter. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-WOMEN (New York) _ It was a dinner for 10 foreign
ministers, held without fanfare on Thursday evening in a quiet,
still unopened sculpture gallery at the Museum of Modern Art. By
dinner's end, the foreign ministers _ all women _ and their host,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ had taken one more step
toward creating a lobby for moving women's issues closer to the
center of foreign affairs. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-VOTE (New Delhi, India) _ As India lumbers into the fourth
and final week of marathon national elections, elephants bearing
ballot boxes tramp into dense forests and ponies carrying election
officials clop their way to dizzying heights in the Himalayas, all
to make sure that every citizen _ no matter how remote _ gets a
chance to vote. By Celia Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLO-OAKLEY (Washington) _ In a profession that prides
itself on obliqueness, Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley
has always been plain-spoken. She was no more so than on the
occasion last week marking her 42 years as an American diplomat, a
career that has spanned most continents and forged a trail for
women in a man's world. In short, Mrs. Oakley delivered a broadside
on American diplomacy. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-CANDIDATE (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ ``They call me
boring,'' says Fernando de la Rua, the mayor of Buenos Aires, in
the opening of his presidential campaign's signature television
commercial. But the blandness appears to be a winning message at a
time of mounting government scandals, street crime and
unemployment. By Clifford Krauss. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-YOUNG-PIONEERS (Beijing) _ Combining elements of the
Scouts, the Safety Patrol and the Hall Monitor, larded with thick,
simple doses of patriotism and Communism, the Young Pioneers
remains a shared experience of China's children. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN-REBIRTH (Berlin) _ Germany's inhibitions being what they
are, the re-creation of Berlin as the home of the government in
recent weeks has been a muted affair: no big rallies, no public
festivities, no showy speeches from the chancellor. And yet,
something is in the air. By Roger Cohen. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-U.S. (Istanbul, Turkey) _ With Greece and Turkey suddenly
seeming ready to end generations of hostility, Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit of Turkey is due in Washington on Sunday for talks
with President Clinton and congressional leaders. By Stephen
Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HYDRO-DAM-DEBATE (Little Goose Dam, Wash.) _ Of all the ways in
which Americans have reshaped the land to suit their priorities,
none is more audacious than the vast network of hydroelectric dams
that stretches across the Pacific Northwest, taming wild rivers,
opening shipping passages and bringing the region the cheapest
electricity rates in the nation. But whatever their benefits to
man, the great dams have proved lethal on a gigantic scale to the
environment of the region's wild salmon. Here on the lower Snake
River, two federal agencies are exploring a proposal that is
proving to be far more contentious than building the dams was in
the first place, and could have just as enormous consequences:
taking four dams out of service. By Sam Howe Verhovek. (With photo,
map and graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-RDP _ After five years and tens of millions of dollars,
the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the tobacco
industry boiled down to this: one misdemeanor charge against an
obscure biotechnology company. So on Wednesday, when Attorney
General Janet Reno announced a broad civil lawsuit accusing
cigarette makers of racketeering and fraud and seeking to recover
billions in health-care costs related to smoking, Justice officials
also announced that their criminal inquiry was closed. (This
article was reported by Barry Meier, David Johnston and Lowell
Bergman and was written by Meier.)
</P>
<P>
   NC-FLOODS (Rocky Mount, N.C.) _ Like so much of eastern North
Carolina, the Riverside neighborhood has been soaked beyond
salvation in the floods that followed Hurricane Floyd, which have
now killed 47 people in North Carolina alone. At the most, a
handful of homes out of 200 solid brick-and-frame structures here
will be spared from the bulldozer. And by the weekend, as a few
hundred residents in the state began returning to their homes, the
mental geography of a neighborhood and an entire region _ a
people's relationship to its land and its water _ had been
permanently altered. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-CONDORS (Pine Mountain Club, Calif.) _ More than half the
free-flying condors released in California seem to have taken a
shine to this retreat in the San Emigdio Mountains about 50 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. By Barbara Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   LAKE-ERIE-SHIPWRECKS (Lorain, Ohio) _ A decade ago, only a few,
intrepid scuba divers plunged into the murk of Lake Erie. Now, the
lake is clearer than it has been in decades and hundreds of divers
are coming from as far as Florida to explore its best kept secret:
a vast underwater paradise of well-preserved shipwrecks. (With a
photo. No byline.)
</P>
<P>
   LA-POLICE-CORRUPT (Los Angeles) _ A former police officer's
account of abuses of power in a Los Angeles Police Department
station house has shaken the city's political establishment,
renewed calls for increased civilian oversight of the agency and
halted the enforcement of a law promoted as a strong antidote to
gang crime. (No byline.)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-JONBENET-CASE (Denver) _ The grand jury investigating the
killing of JonBenet Ramsey reconvened in Boulder on Thursday after
a four-month hiatus. But with prosecutors having made no request to
finance the panel after its term expires in less than a month, its
future and that of the investigation are unclear. (No byline.)

REPUBLICANS LIKELY TO RAID SOCIAL SECURITY, DESPITE PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the new fiscal year approaches, a financial and
political crisis confronts Republicans in Congress. They may have
to break their repeated promises and raid Social Security to run
the government, their own staff and independent analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Republican leaders swore they would pass their
spending bills on time, hew to self-imposed spending limits and
leave Social Security alone. Now they may break each of those
pledges in a year when they have achieved little else.
</P>
<P>
   All week, nearly every day, they renewed their vows not to spend
surplus Social Security funds to run the government in the coming
fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to take money out of Social Security,'' House
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said on Thursday, as President
Clinton vetoed the Republicans' legislative centerpiece of 1999, a
$792 billion tax cut. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi said, ``We should not spend one nickel of Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, who has been his
party's chief spending strategist in the House, said, ``The bottom
line is this: We're not going to spend a dime of the Social
Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as they repeat that mantra, their own spending
strategies are undermining them. The spending bills written by the
Republicans will drain billions of dollars from the Social Security
surplus, according to the latest figures from the Congressional
Budget Office and the calculations of independent experts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government's budget is better balanced than it has
been for many years, and the amount likely to be siphoned from
Social Security is only a tiny fraction of total federal spending,
the partisan fight over the issue may have political repercussions
far larger than the amount of money involved.
</P>
<P>
   How the battle is resolved could affect whether the Republicans
retain their thin majority in Congress or Democrats manage to
recapture at least the House; and both Republican and Democratic
candidates for president are almost sure to focus on taxes,
spending and Social Security in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, when the government ran deficits, Congress
routinely spent extra receipts from Social Security taxes to run
federal programs. But now, with the expected surpluses, Congress
cannot agree with the president whether to cut taxes, expand
government programs or pay down the federal debt. How to account
for the Social Security funds is at the heart of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   To their acute discomfort, the impasse may force the Republicans
to play into the White House's hands by spending some of the Social
Security surplus they have pledged to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending levels will eat into the Social Security trust fund _
that will be the key thing,'' said Peter Sperry, a budget analyst
with the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office's latest figures show Congress
spending $4 billion to $16 billion out of the supposedly sacrosanct
Social Security trust fund. But those figures are two weeks old,
and the calculation has changed for the worse in recent days as
Republicans and Democrats alike clamor for more money for their
favorite programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one were to take all the demands that have developed here
in the last two weeks, we would definitely be dipping into the
Social Security surplus,'' said G. William Hoagland, the Republican
staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said
last week, ``We're probably going to edge closer to $30 billion of
actual Social Security money spent.''
</P>
<P>
   That sum may be no more than a rounding error in an $8 trillion
economy, but it is still a lot of nickels and dimes _ every one
potentially politically damaging to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to frustrate and infuriate their conservative
base,'' said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at
the libertarian Cato Institute. ``It's an indication of a breakdown
in discipline in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Collender, who advises corporate executives on government
spending as head of the federal Budget Consulting Group at
Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm, said: ``There's almost
no way the Republicans can come up with a plan for the coming
fiscal year without tapping into the Social Security surplus. They
clearly have opened themselves up to a whole new level of
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many spending bills still unapproved, tapping Social
Security is not yet inevitable. But it will take extraordinary
discipline, Hoagland said, for the Republicans to restrain their
own ranks. Recent history _ notably last October, when faced with a
similar situation, the Republicans allowed a $21 billion bonanza of
spending _ suggests this will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This situation has White House officials in a state of barely
restrained glee.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly believe that the Republicans will do themselves
political damage if they fail again to carry out the only major
legislative task required of Congress by the Constitution: passing
the spending bills. Some said they see it as a key to winning back
control of the House, and perhaps even the Senate, next year _
assuming Americans pay much attention to how Congress spends their
money.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the Republicans
had created ``a magnificent strategy to box themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way out of this trap for the Republican leadership is
to hide billions of dollars in spending with budgetary devices.
Their spending plans for next fiscal year call for draining most of
the projected $38 billion general fund surplus for the year after
next, fiscal 2001, and spending it in 2000. Even some fellow
conservatives are calling these tactics risky at best and ludicrous
at worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders have also declared that $4.5 billion in
funds for the 2000 census, $1.1 billion for a home-heating
assistance program and up to $8 billion in agricultural aid, mostly
unconnected to this summer's droughts, are unforseeable
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming up with gimmicks,'' said the former Republican
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Livingston, who
left Congress last year after 21 years in office. ``For crying out
loud, the census has been with us since the conception of the
Constitution of the United States. This is not an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Republicans in Congress ``can't make their budget
work or stand on its own without resorting to cheap budget
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Declaring spending an ``emergency'' means it technically does
not count against the spending limits, or caps, imposed by Congress
in 1997. But those caps already have been broken, Lott concedes.
</P>
<P>
   And the emergency money has to come from somewhere _ namely, the
$14 billion budget surplus projected for fiscal 2000, which would
have been the first in 30 years. Those three emergency items for
the census, home heating and agriculture would all but wipe out
that surplus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were going to be two kinds of surpluses in the fiscal 2000
spending scheme. One was that $14 billion surplus in the operating
budget of the government, the so-called ``on-budget'' surplus,
which is like a checking account.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office says that money is gone, with or
without the emergency spending.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the other projected surplus for fiscal 2000 _ $147
billion in the Social Security trust fund, which is like a
retirement account. Though Congress has tapped into that fund for
decades, the Republicans vowed repeatedly that this year would be
different, and now fear they will pay a political price if they
cannot keep that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that's the one thing that seems to have sunk in
with the American people,'' Hoagland said. ``They don't want us to
spend Social Security. That's the one issue that does seem to bear
fruit. ``
</P>
<P>
   There is only one escape from this conundrum for the
Republicans, but it is a tightrope walk across a political chasm.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal year begins at 12:01 a.m. Friday. As Congress
left town for the weekend, nine of the 13 spending bills were not
ready to be sent to the president for his signature _ or his veto,
if Clinton keeps his promise to reject seven of the bills for their
deep cuts in favorite White House programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, most of the spending bills will not be signed into law
by Oct. 1. In the next five days, Congress must pass stop-gap
measures called continuing resolutions to run government agencies
lacking legal spending measures. In the meantime, the incomplete or
unsigned measures will be rolled into one big package, called an
omnibus spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   But continuing resolutions lasting two or three weeks are a
fragile architecture. They must be shored up with good-faith
negotiations between the White House and the Republican Congress on
reshaping the spending bills. But the Republican leaders have said
many times that Clinton cannot be trusted, and some in the White
House feel the same way about the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If that process collapses, a repeat of the 1995 government
shutdown is possible. That would be a political disaster,
Republicans fear. They believe the public blamed them for the 1995
shutdown, which closed everything from national parks to passport
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely result is a huge omnibus spending bill that adds
tens of billions of dollars in new spending _ which is precisely
what happened last year, also to the embarrassment of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be only two ways to avoid a deep dip into the
Social Security funds. One is for Congress to pass a tobacco tax
proposed by the White House, which is unlikely at best.
</P>
<P>
   The other is for the Republican leaders to order their members
to stop demanding more spending, to pass as many bills as possible
before Oct. 1 _ and to hope that they can outfox Clinton at the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a way out,'' Hoagland said. ``The key is discipline.
The key is leadership.''

<P>
   AY, France _ Sir Winston Churchill, who knew a thing or two
about fine living, used to say of his favorite champagne, ``In
victory I deserve it, and in defeat, I need it.'' This New Year's
Eve, partygoers apparently have decided that when it comes to
French champagne they, too, have to have it.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of French champagne have been setting records for months.
The fact that the American economy is booming, along with a taste
for luxury goods, is one reason. So is the notion of ringing in the
millennium with a flute full of the real stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Wine merchants in the United States say French champagne is
being rationed to them month by month. Advertisements from
champagne makers are warning people to prepare for their parties by
laying in a supply early. Food and wine writers have been debating
the possibility of a shortage for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the heart of the champagne-making region of France,
talk of a shortage is laughed off as nonsense. Why would any smart
winemaker mismanage the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few makers who don't have any champagne left,''
said Rene Goutorbe, who took a moment off from directing tractors
to his wine presses as the 1999 harvest arrives here. ``But they're
the same ones who didn't have any left last year at this time, and
they won't have any next year, either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably have the same problem with money,'' he said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the champagne houses and the growers of the
three grapes essential for the genuine bubbly _ pinot noir, pinot
chardonnay and pinot meunier _ agreed to produce enough grapes to
make an average of 270 million bottles of champagne a year for the
rest of the 1990s, about 50 million bottles more than they had been
selling in the recession years early in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The producers also agreed to draw down the equivalent of 132
million bottles of reserve wine, normally saved for years with a
poor harvest, and use it to put more champagne on the market in
1999 than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there will be plenty of nonvintage wine to go
around. Champagne sales this year will most likely far surpass 300
million bottles and set a record, up to 15 percent more than last
year's figures, according to executives at Champagne
Laurent-Perrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our expectations have been surpassed,'' said Christian
Pol-Roger, whose Champagne Pol Roger company in Epernay is one of
the few French houses in private hands. ``There'll be enough for
everybody. All that saying `Buy now or there won't be anymore' does
is stimulate even more sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Champagne, like so much in France, is a subtle and delicate
business, with as many layers of complexity as the sparkling wines
that take their name from the eastern French region. ``What we sell
is tears of happiness,'' Pol-Roger said down in his cool
brick-walled caves, some lined with bottles of his Sir Winston
Churchill vintage wine that will stay here for years. ``They have
to go to university, study at Oxford and get a good education
before they go out into the world,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other champagne makers do not like to talk about the
number of bottles they produce, any more than people of refined
manners like to talk about how much money they make. Any suggestion
of a glut on the market might cheapen the luxury image, and
besides, makers and growers are eager to keep prices stable. They
suffered a sharp decline in sales when high prices in the early
1990s collided with an economic recession in Europe and the United
States after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   As 2000 approaches, champagne companies seem to be trying to
encourage people to celebrate with serenity _ preferably with
champagne, which is made only here, not the sparkling wines made in
Italy, Spain, Germany and the United States, where real champagne
still accounts for only 10 percent of the sparkling wine market.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Veuve Clicquot invited more than 600 customers
and celebrities, including descendants of Louis XIV, to his Chateau
de Versailles, rented by the company for the evening. Ladies in
evening gowns and gentlemen in tuxedos sipped Veuve Clicquot La
Grande Dame 1990 in the garden before going into the Orangerie to
eat their way through lobster ravioli, veal and roast figs, to
champagne accompaniment highlighted by a 1979 La Grande Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The great lady's 19th century namesake, the widow Clicquot,
invented the ``riddling tables'' that are still used to tilt
champagne bottles upside down as they approach the end of the aging
process, so that the yeast sediment can collect around the cork to
be popped out before the bottles are recorked and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Mireille Guiliano, president of the American subsidiary Clicquot
Inc., said the company would not have thought of putting on such a
show if there were any prospect of running out of product to sell
before New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But Veuve Clicquot, like other makers, rationed some big
wholesale distributors this year, doling out consignments month by
month a little at a time rather than all at once in January and
February.
</P>
<P>
   For American retail liquor store owners like Michael Correra in
Brooklyn, this meant that his distributor, Paramount, told him in
early September that it could not supply him with any more Veuve
Clicquot yellow-label nonvintage champagne until October, Correra
said.
</P>
<P>
   He still had plenty on the shelves, at $31.99 a bottle, early
this month, but he said: ``With champagne, you can buy it one week,
and then the distributor is out another week. I don't know if
people are squirreling it away or what, but there's 60 percent more
demand this year and only 20 percent more supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Guiliano said: ``You can't just turn the faucet on, of
course. There are customers who would like to have three times as
much as they will get, but I'm persuaded that if you go to the
stores on Dec. 30 you'll still find a wide choice available.''

</P>
<P>
   In advertising campaigns earlier this year, Moet &AMP; Chandon,
which is the biggest champagne seller in America and, like Veuve
Clicquot and many other houses, is owned by the LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton conglomerate, was urging customers to ``prepare.''
But, as Philippe Pascal, president of Champagne Veuve Clicquot
Ponsardin in Reims, said, ``We foresaw the increased demand, and we
said let's get ready, because we wanted to avoid too much tension
with prices.''
</P>
<P>
   French government regulations and longstanding cooperative
arrangements in the champagne trade provide ways of controlling
both quantity and quality that came into play to insure adequate
supplies for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Nonvintage champagne is produced by blending wines made from
pinot noir, pinot chardonnay and pinot meunier grapes that come
from many different vineyards. In good years, around 20 percent of
this still wine is held in reserve, ``blocked'' in bottles or vats
to be mixed with wine from poor harvest years, to even out the
hills and valleys of the production cycle.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years leading up to 1996, according to Jacques
Peters, Veuve Clicquot's cellar master, growers agreed with the
champagne houses to produce enough grapes to increase production to
an average of 270 million bottles each year until 2000. At the same
time, they agreed to draw down the equivalent of up to 132 million
bottles of wine previously built up in reserve stores. This would
add to the mix in the ``assemblage,'' as the process is called in
French, that would make the nonvintage champagne that went on sale
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, after all the millennium parties, they expect demand
to fall again and plan to build up their reserve supplies over a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's 1999 vintage champagne should be a great one,
unless we get hail or something before the harvest is over,''
Peters said, ``but it won't be ready to drink until 2006 or 2007.''
Vintage champagnes are made only from grapes from the harvest of
the vintage year, which is on the label, and usually also have a
special name, like La Grande Dame or Sir Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Distributors in the United States still have special bottles of
the acclaimed 1988 and 1990 vintages of many houses, and most
makers keep a few hundred or even a thousand bottles of other great
years like 1978 and 1983 around for special occasions. These wines
go for premium prices; a magnum of 1988 Dom Perignon goes for about
$250 this year in New York City, for example.
</P>
<P>
   As for such wines, Frederic Panaiotis, another vintner with
Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, advised: ``If you must have a specific
vintage from a particular year, don't wait until November to buy
it. I personally wouldn't wait until Dec. 24, either.''

   RUSSIA-TERRORISM-REVIEW (Moscow) _ It would be easy to say that
it is Russia's turn for an Islamic extremist problem. This month's
bloody invasion of Dagestan by Islamic guerrillas and the
subsequent bombings of Russian apartment houses, now widely
ascribed to them, seems most of all the harvest of a Russian-sown

   CLINTON-FATIGUE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Clinton fatigue is
essentially a catch-all to describe a general sense that people
have had enough of Bill Clinton. It was bound to happen. With the
explosion of 24-hour news on television and the Internet, Clinton
has been more in the face of Americans than any of his
predecessors. The Clintons, still craving the spotlight, do not

By Marc Lacey.

<P>
   SCHOOL-BUSING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The traditional enemies of
busing to achieve school integration were once easy to spot: angry
white parents glaring at little black boys and girls stepping off
the bus at a new school. But as desegregation plans have fallen by
the wayside in so many schools districts it is not whites alone who
have favored its demise. By Dirk Johnson.

it's not entirely pleasant. By Nicholas Wade. &QL;

<P>
   ORWELL-COMMUNISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Animal Farm,'' the famous
1945 fable is, of course, George Orwell's take on what he called
``the Soviet myth'' of the Bolshevik Revolution and its corruption
of the ideal of Communism, but his other writings as a whole are
less tough on Napoleon/Stalin than on left-wing Western apologists
for the dictator and his regime. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS-CAMPAIGN-REVIEW (Washington) _ The way Republicans
were acting last week it was almost as if some of them could not
decide which was more uncomfortable: having Pat Buchanan leave the
party or John McCain stay in it. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   BILLIONAIRE-CHILDSUPPORT-REVIEW (New York) _ To the delight of
New Yorkers disgusted by the spectacle and to the dismay of New
Yorkers dazzled by tales of fairy-tale opulence, the child support
battle between Patricia Duff, a multi-millionaire Democratic
fund-raiser, and her ex-husband, the billionaire Revlon chairman
Ronald O. Perelman, concluded last week. Now a judge who brings bag
lunches to court will decide whether to grant Ms. Duff's request
for $1.6 million a year in child support. By David Rohde. (With

Asia. Now, in East Timor, it has found out how unnerving that
concept can be when put to the test. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Istanbul, Turkey) _ When Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit of Turkey meets with President Clinton and
congressional leaders in Washington this week, there will be much
talk about earthquake relief, geopolitics, and obscure though
important matters like trade arbitration and oil pipeline routes.
But on Capitol Hill and elsewhere in the United States, those
matters pale into insignificance. There the great question is at
once simpler and more complex: How democratic is Turkey? By Stephen
Kinzer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE GOOSE DAM, Wash. _ Of all the ways in which Americans
have reshaped the land to suit their priorities, none is more
audacious than the vast network of hydroelectric dams that
stretches across the Pacific Northwest, taming wild rivers, opening
shipping passages and bringing the region the cheapest electricity
rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of these huge dams, dating back to the Great
Depression, was an epic engineering achievement, amply glorified by
Woody Guthrie in the 1940s. ``Your power is turning our darkness to
dawn,'' ran his folk song, ``so roll on, Columbia, roll on.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever their benefits to man, the great dams have proved
lethal on a gigantic scale to the region's wild salmon, striving to
complete their own remarkable journey from the rivers out to the
Pacific Ocean and back again to spawn, right where they were born.
And here on the lower Snake River, two federal agencies are
exploring a proposal that is proving to be far more contentious
than building the dams was in the first place, and could have just
as enormous consequences: taking four dams out of service,
including the Little Goose, and restoring a 140-mile portion of the
Snake to its wild, free-flowing condition.
</P>
<P>
   As required by the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers and the National Marine Fisheries Service are now
studying the most radical step of all to save the salmon. It is an
idea passionately favored by environmental groups, many American
Indians and commercial fishermen, including those in Canada and
Alaska, who could someday catch a healthy run of Idaho-born fish in
their waters, and bitterly opposed by farmers and many others in
this region who now rely on the river for shipping and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress, where most
lawmakers from the area are vowing a tooth-and-nail fight against
breaching the dams, which would involve removing the earthen
portions, and rendering the dams inoperative.
</P>
<P>
   But the once unthinkable idea is clearly on the table because
for 25 years, the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams,
has been struggling to find ways for the dams and the salmon to
coexist on the Snake.
</P>
<P>
   Despite federal spending of more than $3 billion on programs
that include fish ladders, hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging
system ``custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as
possible'' for the salmon, according to a Corps brochure, the fish
remain in a terrible decline.
</P>
<P>
   The river's coho salmon have already been declared extinct, and
every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is
now listed under the Endangered Species Act. Two centuries ago,
when the explorer William Clark wrote that the Snake was ``crouded
with salmon,'' about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the
trip back to their spawning grounds, biologists estimate. Last
year's official count, according to the Idaho Department of Fish
and Game, was as follows: 8,426 spring and summer chinook, 306 fall
chinook and two sockeye.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have already scored some major victories in
their bid to take down dams in various parts of the country. This
summer, for instance, an aging hydroelectric dam on Maine's
Kennebec River was demolished, under federal order, to open the
river so that several species of Atlantic fish, including salmon
and sturgeon, could regain access to their traditional spawning
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   And a Northwest electric utility, Pacificcorp, said recently
that it would take down the Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon
River by 2006 rather than pay the $30 million federal regulators
would have required to make it less harmful to fish. The dam, which
is 125 feet high, is the tallest dam ever slated for demolition in
the United States, environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the plan was ``yet another
example that river restoration is on the national agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But the breaching of the Little Goose and three other Snake
River dams would dwarf either of those actions, and would signal a
remarkable shift in national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the breaching plan seem flabbergasted that the idea
is even up for discussion. The dams provide about 4 percent of the
Northwest's electricity and were also built to turn Lewiston,
Idaho, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles
from the Pacific, into the West Coast's most inland seaport. None
of the dams are used for flood control.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents trust that even if federal agencies do recommend
the action, it can be blocked in Congress. A draft report by the
fisheries service earlier this year called breaching the dams
``more likely than any other hydrosystem action to meet survival
and recovery criteria for the listed species,'' bureaucratic
language nonetheless greeted as a bombshell around here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opponents have staunch defenders, like Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., who says that breaching the dams would be ``an
unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare'' for the region.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 107 members of Congress, in a letter to
President Clinton, called the salmon and steelhead ``an economic
and environmental asset whose preservation is a national
responsibility,'' and urged the administration to consider
breaching the dams as an option. Most of the letter-signers are
Democrats outside the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the question broadly comes down to whether saving
the salmon outweighs the dam's economic benefits to eastern
Washington and parts of Idaho, a state that has found itself deeply
split over the issue because restoring the salmon could be hugely
beneficial for the state's recreational industry but would also
effectively wipe out Lewiston's position as a seaport.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the issue in terms only of the salmon, which Idaho
Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, a former Interior Secretary, once called
``the ultimate symbol of the Pacific Northwest,'' there is
something very close to a consensus among biologists that breaching
the dams would be the single most effective step toward restoring
their wild runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biological leg of this stool is very clear,'' said Ed
Bowles, Idaho's manager of anadromous fish, those that hatch in
freshwater and migrate to the sea. ``If you want to have recovery
back to fishable levels and to de-list the fish from the Endangered
Species Act, if you want to do this with a reasonable or high
likelihood of success, you need to restore a natural river in the
Snake. Other options do not provide you with even lukewarm security
of getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Bowles acknowledges that there are other legs to the
stool _ the economic and social questions surrounding the decision.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the breaching would save
the salmon from extinction, since their downward spiral seems to be
linked to other factors as well, including warming waters in the
north Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the fish be better off without these dams?'' said Danny
Consenstein, the Columbia Basin coordinator for the fisheries
service. ``Yes, but that's sort of an incomplete analysis. Will it
lead to recovery? That's a much tougher question.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And many opponents of breaching, even as they say they would
like to find a way to help both the Snake River dams and the Snake
River salmon survive, leave no doubt as to which they believe to be
the higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see the salmon disappear,'' said Roger W.
Koller, a wheat farmer in Pomeroy, Wash. ``They are a part of
Northwest culture and history. But I don't want to see my farm
disappear, either.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the sea, and to come back to spawn, the fish must also
navigate four dams on the Columbia River, but for a variety of
reasons, more fish make it past those dams, which are not being
studied for breaching.
</P>
<P>
   And even as many people who live here fondly recall the wild
river before the dams were built, in the 1960s and early 1970s,
they are skeptical that breaching them would restore a lost world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refer to it as a kind of environmental religion,'' said Bob
Jenson, a Republican state representative in northeastern Oregon.
``I think some people look at these dams as concrete obstructions
in the environment and they'd like to return to a pristine natural
environment, but that seems to me, personally, ridiculous. We live
in a different world than Lewis and Clark experienced when they
first came down the river. We can't restore that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buzz Ramsey, president of the Northwest Sportsfishing
Industry Association, said: ``If we don't do something and we don't
do it soon, these fish are going go extinct. That's very clear. And
what does it say about us as a society if we are willing to simply
let these magnificent fish become extinct?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The whole issue is enormously complex, and it is not even
possible to calculate with certainty, from an economic perspective,
whether it would cost more to keep the dams or remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching them would cost about $1 billion and unquestionably
add, in the short term, costs for farmers and anyone else who ships
products out of the area. And by removing some of the region's
electric power capacity, it would probably add as much as $4 to the
average monthly electrical bill in the areas around the dams and
about $1 to the bill of customers as far away as Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, breaching could bring in hundreds of millions
of dollars annually from fishermen, rafters and kayakers who would
most likely flock to the river if it was restored to a free-flowing
condition. And keeping the dams has potentially enormous costs,
too. One is that of continued and expanded programs to keep the
salmon alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent billions of dollars trying to tweak a system that
cannot be tweaked enough to meet the goal,'' said Rob Masonis,
regional director of hydropower programs for American Rivers, an
environmental group. ``It's failed miserably. And it's crazy to
keep throwing in that money when we know we have an option that can
work.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another potential cost of keeping the dams, possibly a colossal
one, could come in lawsuits from American Indian groups whose
guarantees of perpetual fishing rights in the Snake and other
rivers have been rendered all but useless by the dams and other
actions that have harmed the fish. Similarly, the United States
recently concluded a dispute with Canada over salmon fishing by
signing a treaty that commits the federal government to steps that
could restore healthy salmon runs from American rivers, like the
Snake, to Canadian coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is already exacerbating tensions between urban areas
like Seattle, where there are car bumper stickers proclaiming ``I'm
pro-salmon, and I vote,'' and rural areas east of the Cascades, in
which ``Save the dams'' stickers are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some massive wealth generation going on on the western
side of Washington, but there aren't a lot of dot-coms in this
region,'' said John W. Mitchell, an economist with U.S. Bank in
Portland, Ore., adding that the farming areas have also been
severely hurt by falling wheat prices worldwide. ``They're getting
hit, and they're going to feel very defensive about the dams.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The timing of a final decision about the Snake River dams _ the
others are Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental and Lower Granite _ is
unclear. Both the Corps of Engineers and the fisheries service are
scheduled to release major analyses of the costs and benefits of
breaching by the end of the year, although there are already
indications that they may put off full recommendations until late
next year, not at all coincidentally after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Lewiston, the port manager, David Doeringsfeld, said
breaching could be ruinous to the local economy. ``It's 3,000,
maybe 4,000 jobs in a region of 50,000 people,'' he said. ``It
would be like Seattle losing Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in an editorial in June, even the local newspaper, The
Lewiston Morning Tribune, conceded that breaching the dams was
probably the ``biggest and best means'' of saving the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it becomes a political decision as to which uses of the
river the people and their political leaders value more _ the fish
saved at any cost, or doom the fish and keep the benefits of the
dams,'' said the newspaper. ``That, of course, is a rock and a hard
place.''

<P>
   It would be easy, and to some tempting, to say that it is
Russia's turn _ that after years of Soviet gloating over Islam's
attacks on the West, that after the KGB's goading of proxies like
the East Germans to arm Middle Eastern terrorists, that after the
brutal destruction of Chechnya in the civil war three years ago, it
is well past time that Russia had her own Islamic extremist
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It also might be true. This month's bloody invasion of Dagestan
by Islamic guerrillas and the subsequent bombings of Russian
apartment houses, now widely ascribed to them, seem most of all the
harvest of a Russian-sown whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, is that the latest uprising in Russia's
Caucasus is not merely the Kremlin's problem _ not any more than
the collapse of Lebanon was just an Israeli migraine. Lebanon was a
geopolitical running sore, an imploded state that threatened for
years to destabilize even prosperous and militarily robust nations
like Israel, whose problems would then ripple out to the wider
world as well.
</P>
<P>
   Envision Dagestan's bad neighbor Chechnya, from whence the
guerrillas sprang, as the Lebanon of the Caucasus: another imploded
state, its government a husk, its real rulers Islamic militias
intent on expanding their political and religious influence. Then
substitute Russia for Israel, and the potential for trouble is
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the goal of the operation was the occupation of
Dagestan,'' Alexander Iskandaryan, director of Moscow's Center for
Caucasian Studies, said in an interview. ``It seems to me that the
goal is the destabilization of Dagestan _ and, perhaps, of Russia
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Chechnya and Lebanon, Russia and Israel
are, of course, anything but exact. The Chechen militias that
invaded Dagestan almost certainly are backed by radical
fundamentalists in places like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan _ the
Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Laden, Russia charges, or wealthy
troublemakers like him. But unlike the situation in Lebanon, where
the militias often acted as proxies for various Middle East allies,
including Iran and Syria and Israel itself, the evidence that
foreign governments are feeding the Chechen-led insurrection is so
far slight.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Russia Israel. Russia is not encircled by enemies devoted
to its destruction, and the notion that a few thousand rebels could
overwhelm an 11-time-zone colossus is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they might not need to. Russia today, like
Israel 20 years ago, is divided and deeply uncertain about the
future, if for different reasons. Israel's biggest worries then
were external, while Russia's today are of its own making: domestic
havoc has stripped people of the sense that their economy, their
politicians, their law and order _ even their territory _ are under
control.
</P>
<P>
   So impotence in the Caucasus can be just as unnerving to
Russians, or even more so, as was frustration in Beirut to
Israelis. And Russia clearly has been unnerved.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have responded to the Chechen insurrection in
outsized fashion, by pouring thousands of troops into Dagestan and
ordering that a deep trench be dug along the Chechen border _ a
Berlin Wall, of sorts, but intended to keep people out rather than
in. On Thursday and again on Friday, Russian jets bombed the
Chechen capital of Grozny, destroying petroleum terminals and radar
installations that Russian strategists said aided rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the week, a deputy chief of the general staff assured
citizens that the Kremlin had learned the bitter lessons of its
defeat in the Chechen civil war and had no plans to repeat it. But
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, in Kazakhstan, swore to ``pursue the
terrorists everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will forgive me,'' Putin said, invoking an old military
saying, ``but if we catch them in the toilet, we will rub them out
in the outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as they go, analysts here say, such threats are not
entirely unjustified: The rebel invasion seems mostly unprovoked.
The trouble is that military action alone is a prescription for
further instability, and Moscow so far has no other notion of how
to cope with an internal insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost Chechnya _ permanently, it seems _ by dint of force.
Russians subjugated the region in the 19th century, and Stalin
ensured lasting hatred by forcibly marching virtually the entire
population of Chechnya to Kazakhstan in a failed attempt to forever
Russify the area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shared border, Dagestan is not another Chechnya _
not yet. Its residents mostly practice a more traditional form of
Islam and see themselves as part of the Russian Federation. Indeed,
Moscow responded to the Chechen incursion by handing out rifles to
Dagestan's young men.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, Dagestan is ripe for infection with the
Chechen virus.
</P>
<P>
   Its economy has been ravaged by Russia's depression and
Chechnya's civil war, and the majority of people are unemployed and
uneducated. The birth rate is high and the youth, idle and
rootless, are prime targets for the strict anti-establishment
tenets of the Chechen fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dagestan government, a rickety alliance of nearly 40 ethnic
leaders, is rotted by corruption. And economic dislocation has
pushed ethnic groups into each others' territories.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Moscow's politicians have shown neither the inclination
nor the financial means to bring about the economic and educational
improvements that might prevent radicalism from taking root. Air
strikes and troops have kept the rebels out, but only at the cost
of destroying towns along the Chechen border and creating still
more poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a dangerous prescription, because for Moscow, the
stakes are much higher than mere control of chunks of territory in
regions much of the rest of the world has never heard of. The
Caucasus is Russia's geographic buffer against Iranian
fundamentalism and its principal window on the Black and Caspian
Seas, with their oil and access to the Mediterranean. But it is
also more.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Caucasus through which Russia has sought to project
power for the last 150 years. Its loss would sap the steadily
draining reservoir of national will, with unpredictable political
consequences.

   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Guy Bunn thought he knew his neighborhood of
40 years, the familiar slope downward from his picture window, and
then one day last week everything that was solid in his life became
liquid. A friend pulled up to his front door in a bass boat, and
Bunn, rescued, pulled an apple off his tree and knew he would never
live there again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had been living on high ground,'' he said
Saturday, as he returned for the first time to view his ruined
house and useless possessions. ``But there wasn't any high ground.
The whole neighborhood was water.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so much of eastern North Carolina, the Riverside
neighborhood that was home to Bunn and hundreds of others has been
soaked beyond salvation in the floods that followed Hurricane
Floyd, which have now killed 47 people in North Carolina alone.
</P>
<P>
   At most, a handful of homes out of 200 solid brick-and-frame
structures here will be spared the bulldozer. And by the weekend,
as a few hundred residents in the state began returning to their
homes, the mental geography of a neighborhood and an entire region
_ a people's relationship to its land and its water _ had been
permanently altered.

   Beyond the week's simple exhaustion and sorrow, the prevailing
emotion in this part of North Carolina has been sheer astonishment.
No one could believe that water could rise so high, and stray so
far from its natural courses. People can accept the random winds of
a hurricane or a tornado, but a torrent raging out of a backyard
creek half a mile away makes no sense to a homeowner or a farmer
who has never seen a drop of high water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on earth would we ever have thought of flood insurance?''
asked Robert Mullett, a manager at Bill's Barbecue and Chicken
Restaurant, an enormously popular institution in the town of Wilson
that was wiped out under 7 feet of water from a creek he had not
known existed. ``Nothing has ever flooded here. It would have been
like asking for avalanche insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But these waters defied history and everything that generations
had passed down about where it was safe to live and farm. Most of
the 30,000 homes damaged or destroyed in the state were not on the
coast, where residents knew the risks of storms; the houses were
occupied by people whose lives had very little to do with water,
until suddenly it was upon them, in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, what appeared to be a very large and attractive
lake had installed itself across a main bridge between the north
and south halves of town, cutting off all passage. It looked like
an ideal recreational lake, except that the water was teeming with
bacteria and chemicals, and happened to be on top of the airport,
the water treatment plant and several adjacent neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a week before the flood subsides, along with those in
cities like Kinston and Goldsboro. But in cities further inland
that are now drying out, including Rocky Mount and Wilson, the
extent of the damage is becoming clear in neighborhoods like
Riverside, where residents stood warily outside their properties
Saturday as if they no longer quite trusted anything they had once
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Allie Winstead, 81, who lives alone a few blocks from Bunn on
East Duke Circle, paced around her front yard, too depressed to go
in her house, but not quite willing to leave. Everything she owned
in the world had been dragged outside by cleanup crews and left
moldering in a large pile at the curb: broken Corningware, a green
glass lamp, all her clothing, the furniture her parents had handed
down.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Winstead was sleeping a week ago Thursday morning when her
neighbor phoned and told her to get out. By the time she got to the
front door, water from the overflowing Tar River was up to her
knees and she could not open the door above the swollen carpet. For
an hour, she frantically waved a flashlight through her window
until someone saw it and rescued her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what God took instead of taking me,'' she said,
gesturing at her possessions and the muddy water line above her
head on her house. ``None of us have anything left, but we took
care of each other, and not one person died here. And that's what
I'll remember about this neighborhood after it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Winstead has been living with friends since she was forced
out, and like most people here, she has no notion of her long-term
plans. Some of the residents here are among the nearly 2,800 people
around North Carolina still living in shelters, while a few others
have moved into trailers provided by the federal government.
Because the water has ruined the foundations and supporting walls
of most houses here, almost no one will be able to move back in,
and there was little interest among most residents in rebuilding
near a river that had betrayed them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Tar River's natural basin is about five blocks from Mrs.
Winstead's house. Over the years, it would rise now and then, never
inflicting any significant damage. But Saturday, on block after
block, stretching a full half-mile from the river, there was a dull
muddy crust on every car and sidewalk, on every dining room window
and tree. Carefully tended flower beds were now painted brown, and
people in brown pants and brown shoes ruefully compared the
high-water marks on their brown homes.
</P>
<P>
   There were piles of once carefully collected possessions, now
junk, in front of every house, and the neighborhood stank
powerfully of mildew and mold. A large garbage bin had been lofted
by the waters onto a telephone pole spike, seven feet above the
ground. Some people wore gloves and filtering masks over their
mouths as they entered their houses in search of a stray piece of
jewelry or maybe a picture album on a top shelf that might have
been spared.

   George Ramey Jr. walked through his mother's house next door to
Bunn's, but found little to salvage. He had brought his mother out
of the house a few days before the flood, so that she could stay
with his family when the hurricane passed over, only to find his
own neighborhood a few miles away filling up with water two days
later. He and his son became two of the town's many impromptu
saviors, jumping in their canoe and paddling several neighbors to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call that being a hero,'' Ramey said. ``It's a good
thing I actually like to hunt and fish.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in his mother's house, and found it painful to look
at the warped floorboards, the spongy walls and the gooey piles of
dye that were once treasured photographs. It should all be torn
down, he said, returned to the wetlands it must have been long ago,
before it was real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The houses here were like a chapter in this neighborhood's
life, and now it's over,'' he said. ``You know, a bunch of us grew
up here, and this morning a friend of mine got us all together for
a picture. It was like one last time before we all go in different
directions and start a new life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa _ In the beginning, they were just
two little boys who shared the same dream.
</P>
<P>
   In his ramshackle township, the black boy strung sticks into
pretend pistols and shouted, ``Boom, boom, boom!'' The white boy
pictured himself in spit-shined shoes and crisp green uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But under South Africa's white government, only one of these two
strangers could rise through army ranks. And so while the white boy
studied military history, the black boy learned to build bombs,
joining an exiled guerrilla army intent on destroying the regime
that stifled his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of apartheid in 1994, the two enemies finally
became allies. The guerrilla, Lt. Sibusiso Madubela, rejoiced as he
donned his army fatigues and tested his military rifle. ``We will
all be equal now,'' he told his family proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, Sgt. Eric ``Dougie'' Douglas, told his relatives he
would call his black troops ``gentlemen.'' And together, at the
Tempe military base here, they vowed to fight under one flag, for
one country.
</P>
<P>
   What they found, however, was that, at the base, some whites and
blacks still fought each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a white officer here locked three former freedom
fighters in a room and sprayed them with tear gas. In 1998, another
white soldier here robbed and killed two black soldiers who were
transporting a truckload of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Madubela told his family he had been stabbed by a white
subordinate, and disrespected by others who refused to recognize
his rank. And when his pay was docked for overstaying a five-day
leave he was granted to attend his father's funeral, he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, he cocked his rifle and sprayed the base with
bullets. He spared more than 20 black soldiers who crossed his path
that morning, witnesses say. But when he was done, six white
soldiers and a white civilian were dead, including Douglas, 29. A
seventh soldier, injured in the shooting, died last week.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know precisely what touched off the violence _
the trauma of the integration process, fury over the loss of a
desperately needed paycheck, psychological instability or some
combination of factors.
</P>
<P>
   Madubela, 28, who had a clean military record, died in the gun
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as weeping families buried their dead and government
officials promised a thorough inquiry, the nation embarked on a
soul-wrenching debate over the racial transformation of the
National Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, more than 22,700 former liberation fighters and
black homeland soldiers have been integrated into the military,
government statistics show. The defense force, which was then 45
percent white and 38 percent black, is now less than 31 percent
white and more than 55 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts say the integration process has gone
remarkably smoothly, given the inevitable challenges of merging the
white, Afrikaans-speaking conventional army troops with their
former rivals, the black, underground insurgents. Government
officials emphasize, and experts agree, that most of the 80,000 men
and women in the military serve peacefully and cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
   But pockets of tension and resentment clearly remain,
particularly among soldiers in the lower ranks who, reflecting
their enforced lowly status under apartheid, are overwhelmingly
black, and their supervising officers, who are overwhelmingly
white. In a confidential report that became public last year,
military officials documented troubling disparities in the
disciplining of black and white soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials described ``a marked change in attitude toward
integration'' and ``a hardening of attitudes'' among top white
officials toward former liberation fighters, who are sometimes
viewed as less disciplined than white soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   These raw issues inevitably resound differently among the
friends and mourners who buried their dead, separately, in their
black and white worlds last week.
</P>
<P>
   White soldiers carried the coffin of Douglas, a rugby player, a
carp fisherman and a father of two, into the brown-brick Afrikaner
church here. Inside, the minister preached, the organ wailed and
hundreds of white mourners wept and sang hymns in Afrikaans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something isn't done now about these grudges and tensions,
it will happen again,'' said the dead soldier's widow, Annelize,
24, referring to the black soldiers at Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, in a township near the east coast town of
Umtata, black mourners filed into the single-room, tin-roofed shack
where Madubela grew up. They sang a capella, their voices rising
and falling in their Khosa language, their only accompaniment the
murmuring wind and drizzling rain. Madubela was to be buried in the
red, rocky soil just footsteps from the hut where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to love them,'' said his mother, Tiny Madubela, 59,
of the white soldiers at Tempe. ``But they would never accept
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jan Steenkamp, an officer at Tempe, feels for the families
of the dead. Some of his friends were among the slain. He says the
debate over integration weighs heavier still on the shoulders of
soldiers, who must now ask themselves: Can blacks and whites rely
on each other to survive on the battlefield?
</P>
<P>
   Steenkamp's aching left arm rested in a sling, with slivers of
metal embedded in the shoulder, where Madubela's bullet hit him. He
oversees black soldiers, and since the shooting he has been haunted
by a gnawing anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of guys working for me, a lot of good guys,''
he said. ``But they all see how easy it is now. I can't stop
wondering, if they develop a problem, will they resort to
violence?''
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
   Tempe is a dusty, windblown military base, the second-largest in
the country. Its motto, emblazoned on a sign above the checkpoint
entry, reads, ``Together we accomplish more.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks make up about 85 percent of the soldiers. They stand
guard over the gate in green camouflage fatigues, rifles slung over
their shoulders. They address visitors in cheerful Afrikaans, but
laugh nervously when asked about race relations. All military
personnel, black and white, have been barred from discussing racial
aspects of the shooting and tensions on the base, soldiers say.
</P>
<P>
   But military officials have made no secret of the challenges
they confront as they try to transform the military.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, for instance, the government has
embarked on an ambitious program of cultural diversity and civic
education. Black and white soldiers watch videos that vividly
depict the apartheid regime: the pass laws that restricted blacks
from moving freely, the signs that barred nonwhites from bathing on
public beaches and the racist pronouncements of previous government
officials. And they study the new constitution and aspects of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   The government also offers military training, literacy classes
and other courses for black soldiers, who were denied those
opportunities under white rule. They offer classes in English,
instead of only in Afrikaans, which is viewed by many blacks as the
language of oppression. And they have begun translating training
manuals into English as well, although, some complain, at a slower
pace.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have pledged that within the next few years
the defense force _ all ranks _ will more closely mirror the
population, which is about 76 percent black, 10 percent white, 9
percent mixed race and 3 percent Asian. Even the changes to date
are quite impressive, some analysts say, given the painful budget
cuts and structural reorganization that the military has undergone
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe there is sufficient appreciation for the
extent of the transformation challenge,'' said Jakkie Cilliers,
head of the Institute for Security Studies, a Pretoria-based
research institution. ``It is massive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thandi Modise, chairwoman of the Parliament's Committee on
Defense, said the government was working very hard to propel the
pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole culture of the military is changing,'' she said in
a radio interview last week. ``It has not fully changed, because
otherwise we would not be having Tempe. But there has been change
in the National Defense Force. It is not adequate. It is still
slow, but definitely it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the killer and his victim had been living out the
transformation. Both were members of the same unit, the 1st South
African Infantry Battalion; both loved the military, both loved
their families. They knew each other by sight, but the similarities
seem to end there.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas earned $440 a month, a salary supplemented with income
from his wife's job, and spent his free time with his wife, son and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Madubela, who with less service time earned about $333 a month,
could not afford to live in town and rented a room in the nearby
black township. Relatives said he sent half of his monthly paycheck
to support the unemployed adults in his family, his parents, his
sister, his fiancee and 3-year-old daughter in Umtata, which is an
11-hour bus ride from Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
   Madubela's white colleagues never dreamed he would become
violent, but they said he could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   While in exile in Tanzania in the early 1990s, he served as a
ground-to-air missile specialist for the military wing of the Pan
Africanist National Congress, which was banned in South Africa at
the time. The Congress was known then for its slogan, ``One
settler, one bullet,'' meaning that white settlers should be shot.
And it sharply criticized the African National Congress for
embracing whites, Indians and mixed-race voters and diluting what
they insisted was a black nationalist struggle.
</P>
<P>
   White soldiers said Madubela never expressed racist views to
them, but demanded respect and precise explanations whenever an
order was given. He refused, for instance, to stand when a superior
office walked into his office. (``He's coming into my office,''
Madubela said, according to his colleagues. ``Why should I
stand?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little bit of a difficult bloke most of the time,''
said Lt. Col. Jan Wessels, who commands the unit and said he
personally liked the lieutenant. ``He would like to challenge
authority. He loved doing that. You had to explain every order.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Madubela's family said he complained that white soldiers treated
him with disrespect, that they tried to diminish his authority and
often insisted on checking on his work. But Wessels said soldiers
in the unit were friendly, like family. He said he never heard
racial complaints from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, it was not strained at all,'' he said. ``The black
people are a friendly nation, with a great sense of humor. The
moment you start joking, they respond to that. That is the way I
perceive most of them. We are busy in the process of
transformation. Everybody knows there will be changes,
mind-switches we have to make. But this unit was far on the way to
making those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Madubela was about to explode. On Sept. 15, the day
before the shooting, he learned that he would not receive his
salary for a month. He had been classified as absent without leave
for overstaying his visit to Umtata.
</P>
<P>
   He was furious, his family said, because he said he had received
verbal authorization to extend his leave until his father was
buried. Military officials say they have no record of such
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Madubela was angry, the white soldiers said, but rules were
rules. No one was surprised to see him storm off. Who would be
thrilled to struggle for a month without pay?
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, how would we get by without the money?'' recalled
his 25-year-old sister, Grace Nondumiso, describing her last
conversation with him. He told her not to worry. And the next
morning, he loaded his rifle.

   Washington _ President Clinton made an extraordinary confession
at an intimate dinner with a handful of his biggest fund-raisers at
the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House last week: The
American people are tired of him and of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like an outsider seeking the White House than a
fixture there for seven years, Clinton asked rhetorically: ``Do we
need a change? The answer is, yes we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was making a case for the elevation of his vice
president, Al Gore. But in doing so, he broached a notion
articulated mostly by Republicans, but also by Democrats, that a
``Clinton fatigue'' has infected U.S. politics. And while Clinton
did not use the phrase itself, he might as well have when he
explained the ``great challenge'' for Gore: ``People think at
election time they're supposed to vote for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fatigue is essentially a catch-all to describe a general
sense that people have had enough of Bill Clinton. It was bound to
happen. He has pulled the public through an excruciating journey of
scandals. The most distasteful was the Monica Lewinsky matter, of
course, but new ones seem to keep cropping up all the time: The
fracas over Puerto Rican terrorists one day, the Russian
money-laundering imbroglio the next.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of 24-hour news on television and the
Internet, Clinton has been more in the face of Americans than any
of his predecessors. The Clintons, still craving the spotlight, do
not seem to have learned the oldest trick in show business: Always
leave them wanting more. Hillary Rodham Clinton's expected run for
Senate from New York will keep the Clinton act on stage even
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of this century shows this is really a unique
phenomenon,'' said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian.
``You have both the disquietude of the president in office plus the
added element of him having been there all those years.'' He
contended that while people would be uneasy about a third Clinton
term, if he were allowed to run again, they would not have had such
qualms with other two-term presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Eisenhower fatigue in 1960,'' Beschloss said.
``He would have been elected to a third term by a huge landslide.''
Ronald Reagan might have been elected to a third term as well; many
Republicans said they viewed President George Bush's tenure as the
third term of the Reagan administration. Other modern presidents
were not as popular, perhaps not so much because of general fatigue
but because of catastrophic events that undermined their
presidencies. President Lyndon B. Johnson, unable to climb out of
the Vietnam War, did not dare seek re-election. President Richard
M. Nixon did, but was soon forced from office by Watergate. Jimmy
Carter was the beneficiary of Watergate fatigue, but could not
survive the malaise of a foul economy and the Iranian hostage
crisis when the sunnier Reagan came along.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are delighting in their diagnosis of Clinton
fatigue. Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas said former Sen. Bill Bradley
has crept up on Gore in polls in some states because ``he doesn't
have the baggage of the Clinton presidency around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ferment about fatigue may be overblown, stirred up by a
restless press and pundits longing to begin the millennium with a
fresh presidential story line instead of what has seemed the
inevitable faceoff between Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
In addition, critics of Clinton and Gore may find it easy to lump
the administration's troubles under the ``fatigue'' umbrella _ and
try to drag Gore down with them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Fred Steeper, the pollster for Bush, the
Republican front-runner, said: ``Fatigue is too weak a concept to
fit the public attitudes about the White House. I call it Clinton
disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every voter may be so disgusted. Polls show evidence of a
Clinton fatigue, but one that is not particularly potent. Clinton's
robust job approval ratings have barely budged.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not entirely clear that Clinton fatigue is ailing
Gore. In a Washington Post/ABC News Poll this month, 53 percent of
respondents said they were ``plain tired'' of Clinton, but 45
percent disagreed with that statement. Respondents were evenly
split over whether Gore was too close to the president ``to provide
the fresh start the country needs.''

survive the malaise of a foul economy and the Iranian hostage
crisis when the sunnier Reagan came along.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are delighting in their diagnosis of Clinton
fatigue. Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas said former Sen. Bill Bradley
has crept up on Gore in polls in some states because ``he doesn't
have the baggage of the Clinton presidency around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ferment about fatigue may be overblown, stirred up by a
restless press and pundits longing to begin the millennium with a
fresh presidential story line instead of what has seemed the
inevitable faceoff between Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
In addition, critics of Clinton and Gore may find it easy to lump
the administration's troubles under the ``fatigue'' umbrella _ and
try to drag Gore down with them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Fred Steeper, the pollster for Bush, the
Republican front-runner, said: ``Fatigue is too weak a concept to
fit the public attitudes about the White House. I call it Clinton
disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every voter may be so disgusted. Polls show evidence of a
Clinton fatigue, but one that is not particularly potent. Clinton's
robust job approval ratings have barely budged.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not entirely clear that Clinton fatigue is ailing
Gore. In a Washington Post/ABC News Poll this month, 53 percent of
respondents said they were ``plain tired'' of Clinton, but 45
percent disagreed with that statement. Respondents were evenly
split over whether Gore was too close to the president ``to provide
the fresh start the country needs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Gore may not be electrifying Democrats for reasons
that have nothing to do with Clinton. It has always been a struggle
for anyone in a president's shadow to develop a distinct persona
early in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said in his
endorsement of Bradley last week, ``We'd have to go back to Van
Buren to find a vice president who succeeded to the presidency.''
He corrected himself after audience members reminded him that
George Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan. Still, that is two vice
presidents elected to succeed a president since 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton fatigue, Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of
the Gallup Organization, said: ``I scratch my head. It's an easy
phrase to use. But I'm inclined to look more at the candidate, that
Gore is doing poorly because of Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. McCurry, Clinton's former press secretary, rejects
the concept of Clinton fatigue because, he argued, the public is
too disengaged to be fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how, suddenly, people have turned a switch
in their head and said, `I'm tired of Bill Clinton,' '' he said.
``They've spent seven years with this president. He's not in their
face because most people are checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the characteristics that people say trouble them about
Clinton _ notably his morals _ do not trouble them about Gore. Just
the same, voters do not give Gore much credit for what people see
as Clinton's accomplishments, like prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue factor is so tough to gauge that Clinton and Gore
seem uncertain how to grapple with it. Gore is constantly recasting
his relationship with Clinton. First he played loyal lieutenant,
boasting about Clinton-Gore accomplishments. Then he stopped even
mentioning Clinton by name. Then he bluntly condemned the president
for personal transgressions. (Cynics suspects that that was a ploy
hatched with a White House wink to allow Gore to break out on his
own.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of one day last week, Gore seemed to shift his
pitch several times. At one point, he criticized his
administration's performance, saying, ``I'm not satisfied.'' Later
in the evening, at an event with the president, he softened,
saying, ``We've been doing a lot of things right, but it is time to
start a wave of change in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore should not necessarily take personally the
cries of fatigue. ``You can only imagine what the Roosevelt fatigue
was like!'' said James Carville, an architect of Clinton's campaign
in 1992, recalling the 12-year tenure of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of F.D.R., Gore can take comfort, for voters, far
from fickle, chose continuity over a fresh face: Taking on
Roosevelt in 1944, Thomas E. Dewey assailed the three-term
incumbent for surrounding himself with ``tired old men in
Washington.'' But a tired old man won re-election.

AS YEN RISES, FISCAL POWERS DEBATE MERITS OF INTERVENING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With financial markets around the world rattled by
the surprising climb of the Japanese yen against the dollar, the
top economic officials of the world's wealthiest nations began
meeting here Saturday to decide whether to intervene or to let
Japan solve the problem itself.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of
the Group of Seven nations does not carry the high drama of their
session a year ago, when Russia's currency had collapsed and
markets around the world appeared on the precipice of disaster.
Asia has since begun a slow recovery, and even Japan has showed
signs of pulling out of a recession that began more than seven
years ago. In fact, the renewed interest of investors in putting
their money back into Japan is one of the reasons that the yen has
risen by more than 15 percent against the dollar since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   But big currency moves can also cause big problems: It was the
steady rise of the dollar from 1995 to 1997 that indirectly helped
start the Asian financial crisis. And in this case Japanese
officials fear that a rising yen, which makes their cars,
electronics and other products more expensive in the United States,
could kill their economic recovery. Conversely, a weaker dollar
makes American goods more competitive abroad, but it also threatens
to revive inflation.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, led by the new treasury secretary, Lawrence
Summers, share Japan's worries. But so far the United States has
been unwilling to join Japan in meddling with the currency markets
by pouring in yen, and trying to reduce the currency's value
against the dollar. Instead, the United States has been pushing
Japan to lower its interest rates further _ no easy trick in a
country where interest rates are hovering just above zero _ and to
force Tokyo to keep spending heavily on new roads and other
projects to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly independent Bank of Japan declined to lower
interest rates earlier in the week, outraging Japanese politicians.
And the Japanese government is now running up such huge deficits
that it threatens to get itself into the same kind of fiscal
problem the United States fell into in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff on how to respond to the problem has become the
first big test for Summers, a former Harvard economist who became
treasury secretary in July. Working through the psychology of the
currency markets was a specialty of his former boss, Robert Rubin.
``This will be an interesting moment to see how much Larry learned
about timing, about how to keep the markets guessing, and about how
to keep the Japanese guessing,'' a senior administration official
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Planning _ or feigning _ currency interventions is a bit like
threatening military strikes: Governments want to keep the markets
guessing about the timing and size of the attack, in hopes that
just the fear of intervention will be enough to change the market's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the yen will dominate the discussions, but it is not
the only problem on the agenda. Russian officials will be invited
to sit in on the end of the G-7 meeting, chiefly to receive a
warning that the wealthy nations will not be willing to extend
further aid unless Russia agrees to regular, far more intrusive
audits into how it makes use of loans from the International
Monetary Fund. Congressional hearings last week focused political
attention on the widespread corruption in Russia, though so far
there has been no evidence that the fund's money was diverted.
</P>
<P>
   The financial leaders are also expected to approve a financial
sleight-of-hand by the fund to pay for billions of dollars in debt
relief for poor countries. An initial plan to sell off a portion of
the fund's gold supply on the open markets met enormous resistance,
both in Congress and from gold-producing nations like South Africa,
for fear that it would further depress gold prices. Now the fund
has come up with a bookkeeping scheme that would allow it to lend
part of its gold supply, which is kept on its books at World War II
prices, to the poor nations and allow them to give it back to the
IMF _ at current prices _ to pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the big problem is the yen. Summers kept the pressure on
Japan last week, deflecting all questions about whether he would
join Japan in intervening in the markets. Instead, he would repeat
the mantra that Rubin used so often _ ``A strong dollar is in the
national interest of the United States'' _ because it keeps down
inflation, restrains interest rates and allows American consumers
to purchase more imported goods. But in the next breath he would
make clear that the United States thought Japan should address its
fundamental problems ``until a solid, self-sustaining recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has tried on its own to slow the yen's climb in recent
times, but it has repeatedly failed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are people who believe in little green men. A
flat earth. Looming Armageddon. There are others who believe, or at
least say they believe, that cigarettes cause neither addiction nor
disease.
</P>
<P>
   After the executives of the nation's largest cigarette companies
testified about their unconventional beliefs at a congressional
hearing five years ago, Democrats in Congress cried foul and asked
the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation into
whether they had perjured themselves. After all, the claims ran
counter not only to common sense and mainstream scientific
research, but the industry's own internal documentation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the law, ``truthful'' testimony does not
necessarily gibe with what most people know to be true. Even though
little green men do not exist, the earth is not flat, life goes on
and cigarettes are addictive and deadly, those who make such false
assertions under oath or otherwise tap dance around the truth do
not necessarily run afoul of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they weren't telling the truth,'' said William
Farone, a former research director at Philip Morris who has since
testified against the tobacco industry. ``That's obvious. Whether
that's against the law or not, you'd have to ask a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Justice Department, at the same time they were
trumpeting a sweeping civil lawsuit last week against the tobacco
industry, mentioned almost as an afterthought that their criminal
inquiry was dead. Officials never provided the precise reasons for
dropping the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to many at the time of the executives' April 1994 testimony,
it seemed pretty obvious that they were lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said Andrew H.
Tisch, then chief executive of Lorillard Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said Thomas
Sandefur Jr., then head of Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I, too, believe that nicotine is not addictive,'' said
Donald S. Johnston, then head of American Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   The department's criminal investigation, begun soon afterward,
was no cursory review. The department assembled a team of
prosecutors, convened a grand jury and interviewed scores of
witnesses. After years of work, the Special Task Force on Tobacco
even went so far as to notify some executives of possible
indictments, an indication of the seriousness of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into documents unearthed in other lawsuits, the Justice
Department used the industry's internal documents to show that
executives did not really believe what they were saying. For
instance, a 1963 memo from a lawyer at Brown &AMP; Williamson had said,
``We are then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But just listen to Mark Smith, a Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman
speaking in 1999, to get an idea of how slippery the truth can be:
``In the '90s, some people are addicted to chocolate. Some people
are addicted to sex. Some people think cigarettes are addicting.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that witnesses before Congress can believe
whatever they want. ``What those executives said before Congress
was basically an opinion,'' said Joseph DiGenova, a former federal
prosecutor in Washington. ``They can believe whatever they want to
believe, even in the face of scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the executives probably did tell whoppers. Four years
after their testimony, another generation of industry heads
appeared before the same panel to say that nicotine was addictive.
</P>
<P>
   But proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the first batch of
executives had committed perjury was as complicated as any cancer
study. A further complication: a 5-year statute of limitations that
lapsed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury cases are about more than just the truth _ which became
abundantly clear during the tortured legal discussions during
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Prosecutors must show an
intent to mislead, a difficult-to-prove standard. Falsehoods pop up
regularly at congressional hearings. Perjury convictions do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal division devoted a great deal of effort to this
investigation,'' said a Justice official. ``They decided it was not
a case they were likely to win, which is obviously a factor they
have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government is not finished using the tobacco industry's
words against them. As part of the civil lawsuit filed on
Wednesday, the Justice Department is alleging that the industry has
engaged in fraud and racketeering over the past four decades in
deceiving the public about smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which has a lower burden of proof than a criminal
matter, lists what the government contends is one lie after another
by the tobacco industry _ like the newspaper ad from 1970, in which
several companies claimed that ``the question about smoking and
health is still a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil case may pry loose huge sums of money from company
coffers and force the industry to come clean once and for all on
the dangers of cigarettes. Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., who first
urged the criminal investigation back in 1994, said his goal may
well be achieved even if no executive is ever charged with a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never personal with me,'' Meehan said. ``I didn't
want to put anybody behind bars. I want to save lives and get these
executives to finally acknowledge what we all know to be the
truth.''

SHOCK AND SORROW IN THE AFTERMATH OF TIMOR'S VIOLENCE

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ When Marcos Napoleao Soares returned Saturday
to his burned-out house he walked on a carpet of soft grey ash. The
place he called his ``sweet home'' was gone: blackened, empty,
partly roofless, filled with the rustling of the cool bamboo trees
outside.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, none of that seemed to matter. ``Right
now,'' said Soares, 27, ``the most valuable thing we have lost is
my mother, my sisters, and my two small brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Every person's life is unique, but Soares' story is typical.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless people here in Dili, and in towns around East
Timor, he is the victim of a rampage by violent men who have burned
thousands of homes and kidnapped tens of thousands of people in a
mass deportation of one-fourth of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and children are not here,'' Soares' father, Jose
Salvador Soares, 53, said by way of introduction when his son
arrived with a visitor. ``I don't know where they are at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after international peacekeeping forces began to
deploy here, the mood in Dili has shifted from one of terror to one
of anxiety and the pain of personal traumas.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, files of refugees are walking back to their
neighborhoods to see whether their homes are still standing and
whether it is safe to return to live in them.
</P>
<P>
   Through burned-out alleys and rural lanes in this tiny capital,
where sea breezes still mingle with the tart scent of smoke, people
walk with bags of belongings balanced on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Two women carried a table on their heads. A man pushed three
small children in a barrow. One refugee carried a broken mirror. An
old man walked with nothing but a rainbow-colored umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Soares family, it appeared that few felt secure
enough to stay in their homes at night, returning to the safety of
the seafront or the soccer stadium or the steep hills that rise
above the city.
</P>
<P>
   In a daylong stream, refugees like Soares and his family walk
the six miles down from the forests that shelter more than 30,000
people. They visit their homes, ask among the refugees for news of
their relatives, buy handfuls of fruit or cabbage, then walk back
into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence began here on August 4, after the people of
East Timor voted to become independent of Indonesia, the Soares
family, like many others, first fled to the shelter of a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in East Timor, we are mostly Catholic,'' said the younger
Soares, who works for an oil company. ``We know that the only safe
place is the church. But the Indonesian army does not respect the
church. They force out the refugees and kill the priests.''
</P>
<P>
   After two days of refuge there, he said, the priest warned all
the men to flee to the safety of the hills, which are controlled by
pro-independence fighters. ``The militia is coming to attack and
kill you,'' Soares said the priest told them.
</P>
<P>
   These irregular militias, organized and often led by members of
the Indonesian military who opposed the independence vote, have
laid waste to much of East Timor in the past three weeks. They have
left most of the population of 800,000 people homeless, hungry,
traumatized and, in many cases, trapped in camps that the fighters
control in West Timor, which is part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   When the militia did attack the church the next day, Soares
said, they did something nobody expected. ``They took all the women
and children from the church, and we don't know where they took
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days after that, he later learned, ``They burned our sweet
home, where I lived since I was a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning for a look Saturday, Soares picked his way carefully
through the house, making small discoveries as he went: a pile of
charred but unbroken cups and saucers, the sooty shell of a
refrigerator, a white plastic motorcycle helmut, a small bottle of
cough syrup, a plastic trophy won by his father in 1993 as employee
of the year at the electric company.
</P>
<P>
   In his parents' room a bit of bedframe survived the fire, as
well as a crucifix that had melted into the wall where it hung. In
the room of his brothers, aged 6 and 8, there was nothing but a
black twisted sheet of plastic on the wall _ once a picture of the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Then Soares came to the room of his sisters, Dulce Fatima, 26,
and Sonia Magdalena, 14. It was as if his sisters had chosen a
macabre black decor: Their walls and ceiling were shiny from fire
and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the room held a spark of life; it was still the
home of two young women.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner lay a pair of silver high-heeled shoes. In another
was a red compact with a tiny mirror.
</P>
<P>
   A pile of books remained untouched by fire on a shelf, along
with a blistered photograph of Dulce. Beside it was her diary,
decorated with the words, ``I love Jesus. My name is Dulce
Soares.''

STUDENTS RIOT IN PROTEST AGAINST INDONESIAN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ While calm returned to Indonesia's capital
on Saturday after riots against the military left at least six
people dead, students took to the streets of another large
Indonesian city, hurling burning tires and rocks at soldiers and
the police to protest a proposed law that would grant the army
sweeping new powers.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injuries as a result of the
riots Saturday in Medan, a city of 1.2 million people on the
northern Indonesian island of Sumatra. But Indonesian news agencies
reported fierce street clashes between nearly 2,000 student
demonstrators and a joint force of soldiers and the police.
</P>
<P>
   The new riots suggested that President B.J. Habibie had not
satisfied many of his critics when he announced Friday that he
would delay signing the unpopular security law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, hurriedly adopted by Parliament earlier last week,
would give new authority to this nation's increasingly unpopular
military commanders to declare martial law and suspend civil rights
during so-called national emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The students in Medan were quoted Saturday as saying that
Habibie's announcement did not go far enough, and that Parliament
should revoke the law.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which is widely seen by Indonesians as brutal and
corrupt, has blackened its image most recently in East Timor,
backing widespread violence by anti-independence militias. The
small territory is now being patrolled by an Australian-led
international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta on Saturday, the military apologized for an episode
on Friday in which at least two people were killed in street riots.
The violence was some of the worst in Indonesia since last year,
when demonstrations led to the ouster of President Suharto after he
had been in power for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the violence, witnesses said, a convoy of 10 troop carriers
escorted by motorcycles approached the gate of a hospital and fired
randomly into a crowd gathered outside, killing a 9-year-old boy
and a teen-ager and wounding dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Indonesian armed forces, Maj. Gen.
Sudrajat, issued the apology through the official Antara news
agency. ``On behalf of the armed forces and the police,'' he said,
``we regret the event and ask for forgiveness. There will be a
thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager killed at the hospital was a student at the
prestigious University of Indonesia, and fellow students wearing
their yellow university jackets carried his coffin in a peaceful
procession from his family home in Jakarta to a funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the others killed in the violence in Jakarta were
civilians. In addition a police officer was killed when he was hit,
apparently intentionally, by a car driven by one of the protesters.
Smaller anti-military protests were also reported Friday in
Surabaya and Bandung, the nation's second- and third-largest
cities, and on the island of Bali.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The riots have compounded the problems faced by Habibie. One of
these is a major vote-buying scandal involving several of his
closest advisers; the other is the crisis in East Timor, which
appears to have pitted him against the military. He is seeking
re-election by the National Assembly in November.
</P>
<P>
   The street demonstrations in the capital's financial district _
and the scene on Saturday of city workers sweeping streets littered
with tear-gas canisters, burnt-out cars and plastic bullets _ have
recreated the image of a fragmenting nation. The nation's currency,
the rupiah, lost nearly 5 percent of its value during the two days
of riots.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only good news for the Indonesian government on
Saturday was the failure of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in
Geneva to decide whether to open an international investigation
into atrocities committed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which had been called into special session as a
result of the violence in East Timor, has adjourned until Monday
after two days of heated debate, in which Indonesia and a group of
Asian and Latin American countries opposed the idea of a U.N.
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has backed a European Union resolution calling
for an investigation by the United Nations. Indonesia, backed by
China and several other Asian nations, says that the inquiry would
be a violation of its sovereignty, and that it should be left to
conduct its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the rights commission, which could come on Monday,
is expected to be close. Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of East
Timor and the Timorese resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta, the
co-winners of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, joined last week in
urging the commission to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sentiments to the republic of Indonesia are the same as the
Jews toward Nazi Germany and the Kuwaitis toward Iraq,''
Ramos-Horta said, arguing that the human rights commission would be
``an accomplice to impunity, an accomplice to genocide and war
crimes'' if it failed to conduct an international investigation.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court ruling striking down bans
of a particular late-term abortion procedure represents the first
significant legal step that may compel the Supreme Court to
determine the constitutionality of laws barring the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
struck down such laws in Arkansas, Iowa and Nebraska, declaring on
Friday that the statutes were so broadly written that they also
banned common abortion procedures that are used in the second
trimester of pregnancy. As a result, the appellate panel said, the
laws placed an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right to terminate a
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first circuit after trial to issue a final
decision on the partial-birth abortion law,'' said Janet Benshoof,
president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New
York, which sued to overturn the Arkansas, Iowa and Nebraska laws.
</P>
<P>
   Laws banning the procedure, in which a fetus is partially
extracted from the womb and then killed by the insertion of a tube
into the skull and the extraction of the brain, have passed in 28
states and in Congress. President Clinton has vetoed the federal
legislation and federal courts have either struck down or stayed
implementation of 20 of the state laws.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision striking down the Nebraska law, the appeals
court noted that while many lower courts have heard constitutional
challenges to state laws intended to block this abortion method,
only one lower court so far has upheld any of the laws. That case
involved Wisconsin's law.
</P>
<P>
   The three decisions, issued on the same day because the cases
were so similar, were unanimously agreed to by a three-judge panel
comprising Richard S. Arnold, Roger L. Wollman (the court's chief
judge) and Paul A. Magnuson of the Minnesota district court.
</P>
<P>
   Congress still is considering a bill that closely mirrors the
language that the appeals court struck down last week, and as a
result the ruling signals that even if such a federal statute were
passed and signed into law it might be found unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed one
state ban _ that of Virginia _ to remain in force while the appeals
process runs its course. Abortion rights advocates believe that the
4th Circuit may uphold Virginia's ban.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen a split in the circuits would probably occur,
all but insuring that the Supreme Court would hear a case on the
constitutionality of the abortion ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what these other circuits do and ultimately this
issue will reach the Supreme Court which has not spoken on the
issue of partial-birth abortion,'' said Douglas Johnson,
legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even before such bans are ruled on by other circuits, abortion
rights advocates say the decision may have an impact on the
political process, perhaps changing the minds of legislators who
normally support abortion rights but voted to bar the procedure.
President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation that would ban such
late-term abortions, and in both cases he narrowly escaped having
his veto overridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will give a lot of strength to the Democrats who
have had a lot of pressure from states and from the right wing,''
Ms. Benshoof said. She added that it would also provide political
cover for moderate Republicans like Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia
J. Snowe, of Maine, who favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote next month on new legislation
sponsored by Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., that would ban the abortion
method. House Republican leaders say the House will take up the ban
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House bills are virtually identical in language
to those in the three states that were struck down on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, anti-abortion leaders dismiss the idea that the
court ruling will influence the votes of lawmakers when the bills
are considered again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I doubt that this ruling yesterday will change a
single vote,'' Johnson said. ``The senators take an oath to uphold
the Constitution, not the ruling of a three-judge panel.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the three states' laws, the appeals court panel
relied heavily on the wording of the statues that made it a crime
to perform an abortion in which the physician ``partially vaginally
delivers a fetus before taking the life of the fetus and completing
the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges noted that several other types of commonly used
abortion procedures, including suction-curettage and dilation and
evacuation, may also be banned. In both cases the fetus is in
essence dismembered in the womb and removed. In both cases, the
court noted, that in some stages of the procedure, parts of the
fetus may still be alive in the womb while other parts have already
been extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the wording of the laws like that of Arkansas, such common
procedures would become crimes. ``The central difficulty with the
Arkansas statute is that it covers too much,'' Arnold wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nebraska case, he wrote that the law ``would prohibit in
many circumstances the most common method of second-trimester
abortion. Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of
women to choose whether to have an abortion.''

AFTER 50 YEARS, CHINA YOUTH REMAIN MAO'S PIONEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   BEIJING _ Each year, nearly every second-grader in China goes
through a solemn rite of initiation.
</P>
<P>
   Lined up before an audience of classmates, teachers and perhaps
some beaming parents, the school band playing at the side, they
stand at attention as sixth-graders march up and place red
kerchiefs around their necks. An older student leads them in the
pledge:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Young Pioneer. I pledge under the Young Pioneer flag
that I am determined to follow the guidance of the Chinese
Communist Party, to study hard, work hard and be ready to devote
all my strength to the Communist cause.''
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, through the sixth grade, the students wear
their kerchiefs to school every day _ except in hot weather, when
they wear a red pin instead.
</P>
<P>
   As Young Pioneers, along with their normal studies they learn
about the Communist Party's glorious creation of a strong China,
the importance of respecting authority and the merits of doing good
deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Supervised by a schoolwide Young Pioneer instructor, students
organize themselves into teams, elect their most upright classmates
as leaders, raise the national flag and inspect one another's dress
and discipline. They read about model Pioneers who gave their lives
while saving sheep from the cold or foiling robbers. They
participate in after-school activities like music, dancing or
chess.
</P>
<P>
   Combining elements of the Scouts, the safety patrol and the hall
monitor, larded with thick, simple doses of patriotism and
communism, the Young Pioneers remains a shared experience of
China's children.
</P>
<P>
   For a beleaguered Communist Party preparing to celebrate, and
whitewash, 50 years of rule on Oct. 1, this schoolhouse club is
about the only place now where communism can be offered and
received as a pure, idealistic force for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child is a blank paper,'' said Wang Chunxin, the
22-year-old Young Pioneer organizer at the Yonganli Primary School
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to teach them that China is a socialist country and
the Communist Party is our leader,'' she said on the school grounds
the other day, with evident sincerity. ``We help children grow up
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When students first put on the red scarf they feel very
proud,'' said Ms. Wang. ``Because in this society, everyone should
be in some kind of organization, and the Young Pioneers is the best
one for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's buoyant, fast-developing China, the Communist Party's
reach into daily life has drastically shrunk. For children, though,
grade school and the party's Young Pioneers club are practically
indivisible. Asked where one begins and the other leaves off, Ms.
Wang and the school principal had trouble comprehending the
question. Since all the students become Young Pioneers, they said,
how can you make a distinction?
</P>
<P>
   After grade school, the next step up the Communist ladder is the
Communist Youth League, which a majority of students join by the
end of high school for social if not political reasons. Then in
college or workplaces, a select minority _ including active leaders
from the Youth League _ are accepted as members of the party, which
now has 61 million members, or one in 20 Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Most Chinese today are cynical about communist ideology, and
many younger people are simply indifferent, suggesting that the
fervent message propounded by the Young Pioneers does not entirely
stick. But in more subtle ways, many Chinese say, those years of
hearing about the party's all-embracing and benign role may have
lasting effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little kids don't really understand the talk about `loving the
party,' and later you may think some of the Young Pioneer stuff was
funny,'' said a professional woman in her 30s. ``But that kind of
talk gets into your blood.'' The woman said the patriotic and
nationalistic elements of that constant childhood message had the
deepest impact _ so that nearly everyone, for example, gets
emotional about China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan or Tibet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this respect, the role of the Young Pioneers may resemble
that of schools, youth groups and founding myths in any country,
all working to imbue youngsters with patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference: In the Young Pioneers, patriotism is
equated with devotion to the party and the nation. And this
message, delivered to generations of youngsters in the same
cheerful spirit as lessons on how to add and subtract, may help
make it seem natural to many Chinese that a single organization
should maintain such unrivaled power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Mao founded China, Deng Xiaoping made us rich and now
Jiang Zemin is leading us into the future'' was the capsule view of
the last half-century given by 12-year-old Li Jia. Ms. Li, an
earnest sixth-grader, is one of 15 top Young Pioneer leaders among
more than 700 students at the Yonganli school. She was selected by
authorities to meet a visiting journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Li was not prepared to discuss the ins and outs of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, but she easily rattled off the weekly schedule of
Young Pioneer activities, from ceremonies to raise the flag, salute
young martyrs and inspect students' kerchiefs to more relaxed
after-school hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a leader, I have to be a good student, get good grades and
be willing to serve the other students,'' she said. ``I feel that
we are the future masters of our country, so we have to study hard
to build our country stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that before the founding of the People's
Republic, China was a very poor country,'' Ms. Li said when asked
what the anniversary meant to her. If nothing else, it was clear
she was a good student of the party's take on history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party
and with the efforts of our people, China's economy and defense and
people's lives have greatly improved,'' she continued. ``Now China
is a strong country.''

<P>
   The traditional enemies of busing to achieve school integration
were once easy to spot: angry white parents glaring at little black
boys and girls stepping off the bus at a new school.
</P>
<P>
   But as desegregation plans have fallen by the wayside in so many
schools districts _ most recently in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this
month _ it is not whites alone who have favored its demise.
</P>
<P>
   To hear a black parent like Clint Perkins tell it, busing
students to achieve racial integration is ``nothing but a waste of
money'' and, worse, it robs children of the familiar comfort of a
neighborhood school. It was an experiment full of hope, he said,
but short on promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of civil rights, the bus has been a symbol of
power and hope since Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a
white man in 1955, sparking a protest that forever changed the
nation. And beginning in the early 1960s the school bus, the
universal symbol of mass transportation, was seen as a way to bring
together a divided nation and forge equality by letting black
children sit next to white children.
</P>
<P>
   But while busing promoted diversity, at least between school
bells, and brought poorer children to more affluent schools, the
enduring racial segregation of city neighborhoods and the
middle-class flight to suburbs have posed a challenge that busing
alone could scarcely solve.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, an Army recruiter whose daughter attends a public
school in Denver, where busing was ended four years ago, believes
that integration is worthy. But it is the color of money, he said,
that matters most in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black or white, you need money to attract top-quality
educators,'' he said. ``I don't care about the racial ratio in the
school. What matters most is the quality of education.''
</P>
<P>
   A conservative judiciary has hastened the demise of many
desegregation plans. But in some cases, black parents and
politicians have called for desegregation orders to be lifted, as
in St. Louis, where such an order was vacated earlier this year
after a vow by the state legislature to increase spending on public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation plans have been scrapped, either voluntarily or by
court order, in a long list of cities, including Boston, Cleveland,
Detroit, Norfolk, Va., and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights organizations like the NAACP remain steadfast in
their support of integrating schools, including the use of busing
if necessary. But even the NAACP has seen internal discord over the
issue. In the last several years, the group dismissed two chapter
leaders, Robert H. Robinson in Bergen County. N.J., and Kenneth W.
Jenkins in Yonkers, N.Y., for taking the position that good schools
for black students is a higher priority than racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   For many black parents and educators, turning away from support
of busing is simply a matter of political reality, said Glenn
Loury, director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at
Boston University. ``The courts are making it very clear that
busing, as a tool of integration, is going to be very restricted,''
said Loury. ``That's not just the writing on the wall. That's the
writing in the rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Loury said it has become quite clear that black parents have
lost much of the hope that busing would transform schools for poor
children. ``Black parents have become much more skeptical that this
is the way of attacking the problem,'' he said. ``They're weary.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he noted that black parents in Boston are on a long
waiting list to participate in a voluntary busing program, one that
sends children from urban centers to mostly white schools in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the issue of racial integration, Americans have
always been ambivalent about buses. The epitome of poor and
working-class transportation, the bus can be a crowded, noisy place
where deep-rooted distinctions are forfeited during a journey that
is often too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Many schoolchildren have never enjoyed taking the bus for any
reason. The ever-expanding parking lots of suburban high schools
underscore the fading lure of the trusty old yellow school bus.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise then, that many black (and white)
parents and children sometimes cringe at stepping aboard buses,
especially if it means rolling away from the home neighborhood
toward somebody else's turf.
</P>
<P>
   As desegregation plans have wilted, poor black and Hispanic
students are increasingly isolated in schools that are
predominantly minority, according to Gary Orfield, a Harvard
professor and an expert on segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, Orfield found that schools that are more than
90 percent black and Hispanic are 11 times more likely to have
concentrated poverty than mostly white schools.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty in these schools has grown worse, he said, as much of
the black middleclass has moved to the suburbs. He cited studies
that showed only one-tenth of blacks wanted to live in all-black
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Orfield, money alone cannot remedy the problems
of racial segregation in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to understand what schools are,'' he said. ``It's
not just about test scores. Schools are a place where people
network, where they make the connections to have a better chance at
being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that white students benefit profoundly in
integrated settings, learning social skills that will become
required ``as they live in a society that is less and less white.''
</P>
<P>
   But among whites, there has never been much support for busing
or other desegregation plans in schools. And as many blacks also
become skeptical of such efforts, busing seems destined to take a
place among nobly intended but ultimately disappointing ventures to
close the racial chasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a reason that most of these plans were
court-ordered,'' said Loury of Boston University. ``If it was put
to a vote, it would never pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Black parents like Perkins, meanwhile, have increasingly looked
for other measures of a school's success than its racial
composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as all the teachers and parents are singing off the
same page,'' he said, ``I don't care what color they are.''

<P>
   The traditional enemies of busing to achieve school integration
were once easy to spot: angry white parents glaring at little black
boys and girls stepping off the bus at a new school.
</P>
<P>
   But as desegregation plans have fallen by the wayside in so many
schools districts _ most recently in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this
month _ it is not whites alone who have favored its demise.
</P>
<P>
   To hear a black parent like Clint Perkins tell it, busing
students to achieve racial integration is ``nothing but a waste of
money'' and, worse, it robs children of the familiar comfort of a
neighborhood school. It was an experiment full of hope, he said,
but short on promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of civil rights, the bus has been a symbol of
power and hope since Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a
white man in 1955, sparking a protest that forever changed the
nation. And beginning in the early 1960s the school bus, the
universal symbol of mass transportation, was seen as a way to bring
together a divided nation and forge equality by letting black
children sit next to white children.
</P>
<P>
   But while busing promoted diversity, at least between school
bells, and brought poorer children to more affluent schools, the
enduring racial segregation of city neighborhoods and the
middle-class flight to suburbs have posed a challenge that busing
alone could scarcely solve.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, an Army recruiter whose daughter attends a public
school in Denver, where busing was ended four years ago, believes
that integration is worthy. But it is the color of money, he said,
that matters most in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black or white, you need money to attract top-quality
educators,'' he said. ``I don't care about the racial ratio in the
school. What matters most is the quality of education.''
</P>
<P>
   A conservative judiciary has hastened the demise of many
desegregation plans. But in some cases, black parents and
politicians have called for desegregation orders to be lifted, as
in St. Louis, where such an order was vacated earlier this year
after a vow by the state legislature to increase spending on public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Desegregation plans have been scrapped, either voluntarily or by
court order, in a long list of cities, including Boston, Cleveland,
Detroit, Norfolk, Va., and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights organizations like the NAACP remain steadfast in
their support of integrating schools, including the use of busing
if necessary. But even the NAACP has seen internal discord over the
issue. In the last several years, the group dismissed two chapter
leaders, Robert H. Robinson in Bergen County. N.J., and Kenneth W.
Jenkins in Yonkers, N.Y., for taking the position that good schools
for black students is a higher priority than racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   For many black parents and educators, turning away from support
of busing is simply a matter of political reality, said Glenn
Loury, director of the Institute on Race and Social Division at
Boston University. ``The courts are making it very clear that
busing, as a tool of integration, is going to be very restricted,''
said Loury. ``That's not just the writing on the wall. That's the
writing in the rulings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Loury said it has become quite clear that black parents have
lost much of the hope that busing would transform schools for poor
children. ``Black parents have become much more skeptical that this
is the way of attacking the problem,'' he said. ``They're weary.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he noted that black parents in Boston are on a long
waiting list to participate in a voluntary busing program, one that
sends children from urban centers to mostly white schools in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the issue of racial integration, Americans have
always been ambivalent about buses. The epitome of poor and
working-class transportation, the bus can be a crowded, noisy place
where deep-rooted distinctions are forfeited during a journey that
is often too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Many schoolchildren have never enjoyed taking the bus for any
reason. The ever-expanding parking lots of suburban high schools
underscore the fading lure of the trusty old yellow school bus.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise then, that many black (and white)
parents and children sometimes cringe at stepping aboard buses,
especially if it means rolling away from the home neighborhood
toward somebody else's turf.
</P>

</P>

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bay Buchanan sighed a bit in admitting that her
brother Patrick, the quixotic Presidential candidate, was
essentially a man without a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in no man's land,'' said Ms. Buchanan, who sounded,
however, far from forlorn at the risks and opportunities as her
brother considered casting aside a lifetime of Republican labors to
switch his presidential candidacy to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in political limbo,'' said Ms. Buchanan, a lean and
avid political operative clearly relishing the long odds as she
plays chief strategist, fiery alter ego and grass-roots shepherd
for her brother in his threatened party switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ask people to give him money,'' she said in an
interview at her brother's campaign headquarters last week. ``I
can't build a staff until we know where he's running. It's a very
delicate time.''
</P>
<P>
   In this time, with no formal hustings to welcome him, Buchanan
has been publicizing a new book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire''
(Regnery Publishing), and teasing out the party-switching question
in a dozen broadcast interviews a day. He is well into one of his
signature ``America First'' controversies over his views in the
book of Hitler and World War II _ just the sort of verbal
fisticuffs that assure both Buchanans that the rebel fire is
returning to their quest.
</P>
<P>
   But the harder work in the political trenches has fallen to Ms.
Buchanan as she telephones Reform Party officials to make the
necessary overtures and to master the arcane procedures for getting
on dozens of state ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In their parallel efforts, the Buchanans are far from sibling
rivals. They are respected even by their critics as a classic
inside-outside political team practiced in the art of insurgent
mischief. And Ms. Buchanan, while a familiar sight on the
cable-television political circuit, has returned to her strong suit
behind the scenes as campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now feeling knowledgeable about the Reform Party
system,'' she said, hardly discouraging the likelihood of the
Buchanans' defection from the Republican Party, about which they
have promised a decision by mid-October. ``Technically, I will be
able to tell Pat that it can be done and I would be able to raise
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle-hardened from running the fractious Buchanan presidential
campaigns in 1992 and 1996 against the Republican Establishment,
Ms. Buchanan sounds almost enchanted that, after months of her
brother's barely registering in this year's Republican pre-primary
polls, she is scouting a fresh political Rubicon for him to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buchanan is the daughter of a successful Washington
accountant who offers a backwoods sort-of twang and sharp-edged
glance _ much the way her brother, one of the capital's
longstanding conservative elite, savors riffs of blue-collar
rhetoric. The two seem united by an appetite for contrariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '92 people would ask, `You're his daughter, right?'''
recalled Ms. Buchanan, a veteran political consultant who is 10
years younger than her 60-year-old brother. ``By '96 they were
asking, `Who's older?'''
</P>
<P>
   For all that wear and tear, Ms. Buchanan _ christened Angela
Marie and called Bay in a family of nine children steeped in
dinner-table conservatism _ seems addicted to cutting fresh swaths
in the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Buchanan, a fierce political warrior with a master's
degree in mathematics from McGill University, who first explored
the Reform gamble for her brother. Buchanan critics suspect that
she mainly had her eye on the $12.6 million in federal matching
funds that await whoever may be the Reform Party nominee next year.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, the conservative Republican commentator, has
sarcastically denounced Buchanan as ``Pat the Bunny,''
opportunistically ``hopping around on the fringes of American
politics'' and sniffing out ``whatever carrots our political system
offers up.''
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal, Ms. Buchanan scoffs at ``Billy'' Kristol for ``not
understanding the movement Pat represents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an anguishing decision,'' she said, speaking as a
Republican who, through her brother's patronage, served in the
Nixon and Reagan White Houses. ``This is not a decision you make
for money, for goodness' sakes. It takes enormous courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Heeding the different drummer may be more second nature to her
than to her brother. Seventeen years ago, Ms. Buchanan stood up to
her staunchly Roman Catholic family, including Pat, in converting
to Mormonism and marrying in that faith. Now she survives as the
divorced working mother of three teen-aged sons, heading home to
them in the Virginia suburbs after long days in the Buchanan war
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's terrific with the boys,'' said Pat Choate, a longtime
friend and Reform Party leader who was Ross Perot's running mate on
the party's ticket in 1996. Choate is in daily contact with Ms.
Buchanan now as the two strategize about how to nail down the
Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bay goes home, takes care of her sons and turns off the
politics,'' Choate said. ``People don't know she also took care of
her mother in her home until she died in '96. Talk about a manager
_ Bay's the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others describe her as less an ideologue than her brother and
more his devoted agent, as scrappy in the back room as he is on
television. In a 30-minute interview, she was interrupted four
times by cellular phone calls from her brother with urgent
importunings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's panicking because of where he is,'' she calmly explained,
referring not to any position her brother has taken but to the
logistics of his rushing to the next television interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the campaign headquarters, Ms. Buchanan offered a no-nonsense
sketch of the Reform Party terrain she felt she could master. She
emphasized that her brother would be pushing for the reforms in the
economy, foreign trade and government that the Reform Party is most
concerned about, without abandoning his anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a real good shot for the Reform nomination if
Pat chooses to go. But we'll have to fight for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take $6 million in 30 states,'' she said, summarizing
the effort in having the required petition drives under way by the
end of this year in the 30 states where they are needed to get him
on the ballot. The Reform Party is already established in 20
states. ``For the first $4 million,'' she said, ``I can get $2
million in matching funds. But my goal is to raise more than the $4
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buchanan said she had been in touch with a dozen state
Reform organization leaders so far, with another dozen on her list.
``Lenora Fulani asked to speak to us,'' she noted. Ms. Buchanan
hardly sounded flustered by the strange-bedfellow aspect of
politics in her brother's having to deal with Ms. Fulani, a New
York Reform Party figure who was once an ally of Louis Farrakhan,
the firebrand leader of the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectually, there's no question Pat's moved very
dramatically in the direction of the third party,'' Ms. Buchanan
said, clearly warming to a fresh field of political combat that
would begin with the Buchanans' defection from the party that first
inspired their fealty and lent them celebrity. ``If your heart is
in it, if you really feel the decision is made for the right
reason, then you can get through the fire.''

 &HT;    Experts suggest children have say in setting TV limits
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ How can Ponce de Leon, Carl Sandburg and John
Quincy Adams ever compete with Dawson Leary, Tommy Pickles and Bill
Nye the Science Guy?
</P>
<P>
   That's the dilemma parents face as the new television season
gets under way, and the kids clamor to check out the new shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recommending that kids watch a couple of hours a day
maximum during the week,'' suggests Joan Bergstrom, author of
``School's Out!: Resources for Your Child's Time: Afternoons,
Weekends, Vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids watch for a block of time on Saturday or Sunday, they
should get out and do other things the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Finley, 11, thinks TV rules are OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone watches 24 hours a day, they're not going to have
time for homework,'' says the Harrison Twp. sixth-grader, who is
permitted one to two hours of television on weekdays, more on
weekends. ``I can't watch TV or do electronics till I have my
homework done.''
</P>
<P>
   Because TV viewing is passive, nonstop watchers can fall behind
in language and social skills, Bergstrom says. ``They aren't out
trying and doing new things. Compare a kid that's watching TV all
day to one who is swimming, reading, playing board and strategy
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The best limits may be those that come from the kids themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmine Ng of the Texas Agricultural Extension Services says the
appropriate TV amount varies with each child, and that parents who
veto a particular show should have done their homework.
</P>
<P>
   But don't outlaw TV altogether, Bergstrom says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid feels left out,'' she says. ``I knew about five kids who
would go to other people's houses to play ... and the only thing
they wanted to do was watch television.''
</P>
<P>
   And parents should mind their own TV habits, says Anne-Marie
Welsh, who writes a parenting column for the Erie Daily News in
Pennsylvania. ``They need to make the commitment and to set a good
example,'' she says. ``If children have already formed poor viewing
habits, ease them out of it. During the times when they would
normally gravitate to the television, beat them to the punch by
suggesting an outdoor activity you can enjoy together.''

 &HT;    Director debuts with quirky 'American Beauty'
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When ``American Beauty,'' the new biting
satire of suburban America, eventually gets released on video, it
will present a dilemma. As a dark morality tale with underlying
comedy and a murder mystery conclusion, store owners will have no
idea where to shelve it. But that's exactly what director Sam
Mendes likes about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so much of Hollywood is defined by what shelf in the
video store you're going to put something on, to the point where if
you see a script that you can't define, you don't make it,'' says
the 34-year-old Brit of his acclaimed feature film debut, which
opened in Palm Beach County on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is about a middle-aged magazine writer named
Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). He's stuck in a meaningless job,
trapped in a loveless marriage to a manic real estate agent (played
by Annette Bening) and hated by his teen-age daughter. Yet, these
downbeat details are handled with a sly comic edge. And when Lester
develops a sexual obsession for his daughter's Lolitalike
cheerleader friend, it sets events in motion which lead to his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Murky territory has become Mendes' hallmark. He is best known
for such theater productions as the raw revival of ``Cabaret'' and
``The Blue Room,'' a sensationalist series of sexual encounters
which brought a nude Nicole Kidman to Broadway earlier this year.
No wonder DreamWorks thought of him for ``American Beauty,'' the
unconventional script by Florida State University graduate Alan
Ball, who breaks into features after writing for ``Cybill,''
``Grace Under Fire'' and the new television sitcom, ``Oh Grow Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes was a bit taken aback that he was offered the assignment.
``I thought, 'My gosh, more nudity and dark territory. Why me?' On
the other hand, it's a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the studio was looking for a first-time director.
``I think they wanted somebody who was not going to obey the rules,
because effectively the script doesn't obey the rules,'' Mendes
says. He also thinks the movies have done well by turning to
directors with theater experience, citing Nicholas Hytner (``The
Madness of King George'') and Danny Boyle (``Trainspotting'').
``It's nice to have people who are used to telling stories and
holding audiences' attention for two hours in some form, rather
than directing commercials or videos,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mendes describes his first few days on the movie set as
terrible. ``It took me a while to translate what was in my head to
what was on the screen,'' he says. ``I did three terrible days of
shooting the first three days. I reshot one day and the other stuff
I cut. Not because it was badly shot, ironically, but because I
felt I didn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, DreamWorks executives could afford to be patient
with him. ``One of the great things about this is they've made it
for a very small amount of money (a reported $15 million), relative
to normal studio movies. That allowed us a certain amount of
freedom. Not only did they leave the script alone, they also left
me alone, which, given the fact that I was a first-time director,
is kind of astonishing in retrospect,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes likens a movie set to being in the midst of a
construction site, ``with all these people banging and crashing
around. It's so unromantic,'' he sighs. ``The theater is a very
romantic process, well, at least rehearsals are a very romantic
process. In the theater, if you say 'I don't know' in the rehearsal
room, it can be the most releasing moment. You can say, 'Let's
rehearse and try this, try that.' If you say 'I don't know' on a
film set, that's the end of the movie. They'd look at you as if you
were insane.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mendes learned to deal with the volleys of questions the same
way most film directors do _ he guessed at the answers. ``A lot of
the time, the most crucial moments are when you see something and
know in your gut that it's wrong, and you have to stand up and say,
'This is going to take us another half-day, which is $100,000 or
whatever it is, but I have to have it another way. I've made a
mistake.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes credits his growing up as an only child for the fantasy
life that led him to become a director. ``If you're an only child,
you constantly are living in your head,'' he says. ``You become
very good at being self-contained and alone. The flip side of that
is it's a very solitary existence. And directing is very solitary.
You're surrounded by people all day, but in the end, it's just
you.''
</P>
<P>
   As an only child, he was particularly drawn to the emotional
plights of the teens in ``American Beauty'' _ Lester's daughter
Jane and her next-door admirer, a drug-selling, technological
Peeping Tom named Ricky. But Mendes stops short of labeling his own
family as dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This name 'dysfunctional,' I don't kind of like it,'' he says.
``I've never met a functional family, put it that way. Functional
families only exist in clothes catalogues, do you know what I
mean?'' His parents divorced when he was young, but he quickly
adds, ``I certainly would not classify my childhood as filled with
hardship and devastation. It was a middle-class childhood in
suburbia,'' not far psychically from life in ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes also brings an outsider's eye to this distinctly American
story, but he feels that much of it would translate to an English
setting. ``What I can't imagine being set in England is anything
having to do with guns, because we don't have guns in England,'' he
notes. ``What I find incredible as a foreigner is the gun situation
in this country. But everything else, the contemporary debate about
older men and younger women, the sense of what goes on behind
closed doors in suburbia, I feel would transcend where it was
set.''
</P>

   Mendes sees ``American Beauty'' as an antidote to the way young
people are usually portrayed in movies these days. ``It treats
children seriously,'' he says. ``They're not idiots, they're not
people who go around having sex with fruit pies, frankly,'' he
says, referring to the summer hit ``American Pie.'' ``They are
adults. In fact, in many ways they're much wiser than their
parents. And that was one of the things that appealed to me most
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``American Beauty'' is opening around the nation to
fawning praise, scripts for future films have started arriving at
Mendes' doorstep. ``The difficulty after having made a script that
I loved so much as this is finding something else that I love
deeply,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he heads back to the theater, to stage the new,
long-awaited Stephen Sondheim musical, ``Wise Guys.'' No, it's not
about the Mafia, but brothers Addison and Wilson Mizner, the
architect and promoter team that left its mark on South Florida at
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As Mendes puts it, ``It's Palm Beach rogues out on a prowl. It's
about what America offers you, how it can make you and how it can
kill you.'' Sounds like more Mendes territory.

 &HT;    It's Garth Brooks, bad boy
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like Michael Jordan or Mickey Mouse, Garth Brooks is
one of those rare American icons whose image is so distinct he can
be recognized simply by silhouette. Sweeping platter of a cowboy
hat. Cheeky round face. Pudgy belly strapped behind a western belt
buckle that holds up Wranglers two sizes too small. It's a look so
etched into the collective consciousness that a mere glance makes
most people say, ``Ah, Garth.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Brooks' latest career move is so puzzling. On
Tuesday, the singing superstar is going to blow up the look he has
so meticulously crafted for 10 years when his new CD, ``Garth
Brooks in ... The Life of Chris Gaines,'' arrives in stores. Then,
as if to reintroduce himself to the public, he starts making the
rounds: Leno, Letterman, Conan and Rosie, culminating in a one-hour
NBC special at 8 p.m. Wednesday in which he sings pop/rock and
doesn't even wear a cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most everyone who follows entertainment news is aware
that Chris Gaines is a fictional pop artist Brooks has created to
explore territory beyond country music. The CD not only has the
37-year-old star singing 13 pop tunes, but it morphs Brooks into an
Australian-born, angst-ridden rock idol who looks like he spent a
lot of time smoking British cigarettes and listening to the Clash.
The country singer even lost weight, donned a black wig and applied
inky mascara for the album cover and video for the first single,
``Lost in You,'' which was released to Top 40 radio stations in
late July. The whole project was created for a yet-to-be-written
movie, ``The Lamb,'' which centers around the character Chris
Gaines, who dies tragically.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks himself seems to realize he's got a lot of explaining to
do to the four-wheel-drive, boot-scootin' crowd that made him
commercially bigger than the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, it's a character,'' he says in a surprisingly soft, FM
radio voice. ``It's the same as Tom Hanks. He can play a lost,
wonderful guy in `Sleepless in Seattle,' then he's a character
dying of HIV in `Philadelphia.' I guess the thing I don't get here
is people didn't sit down and write him and tell him, `You're gay!'
Chris Gaines is simply a character.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Garth Brooks isn't an actor, or at least we
didn't think he was. Part of his appeal has always been a
perception of ``aw shucks'' sincerity, so it's not surprising that
the public is scratching its head at the somewhat bizarre arrival
of Chris Gaines. The whole project is kind of like having your
cuddly teen-ager show up from college at Christmas with a shaved
head or a nose ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why he didn't just make the kind of new
music he wanted to make as Garth Brooks,'' says country singer
Vince Gill. ``But I've known Garth for a long time, and I can tell
you this. When he decides to do something, he's determined.''
</P>
<P>
   New York writer Bruce Feiler, who parlayed an Esquire profile of
Brooks into a critically acclaimed book (1998's ``Dreaming Out
Loud''), thinks Brooks has created Gaines to protect his well-known
image like a specimen in a bell jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth is both incapable and unwilling to transform himself
slightly into a pop star as Shania (Twain) did _ change his dress,
change his instrumentation or songwriters and basically slowly
morph himself into a pop artist,'' Feiler says. ``What he has done
is cut himself down the middle, trying to preserve like jelly the
old Garth, which has changed almost none in 10 years. He's creating
the pop persona because what Garth wants ultimately is not money or
fame or groupies. It's power. He wants to be this icon. He's got
two-thirds of the country with him, but there is this other third.
Garth thinks he is protecting the franchise of Garth Brooks by
making Chris Gaines. In fact, he's making Garth much more
vulnerable by opening up the recesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks concedes it's a leap that may be hard for the public to
make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might be a fear thing that people don't like their
Garth doing this, and that's cool,'' he says. ``But they need to
realize there's a lot of instances like this that have happened
before. Hank Williams was also Luke the Drifter. The Statler
Brothers did the Road Hog (a fictional character named Lester
``Roadhog'' Moran). I stopped defending it so much after I played
the stuff live out in California (for the television special). When
the taping was through, I strapped on a guitar and played `The
Dance' as a way to say thank you. The reaction I got to Chris was
the same reaction I got to Garth. It hit me that whether it's `Low
Places' or Chris, it's all Garth music.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months Feiler spent observing Brooks for his book, he
noted that the singer always refers to himself in third person. He
believes Gaines is indeed the singer's alter ego, a darker yin to
Brooks' bubbly yang.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's showing his controlled schizophrenia to the world. It's
exactly what I was talking about in the book, that there are two
Garths,'' Feiler says. ``In the early '90s, when I first started
writing that he had a dark side and was fascinated by early death,
it was considered so out there. Look at the lyrics to `The Dance,'
to `If Tomorrow Never Comes' or `The Beaches of Cheyenne.' Now it's
basically coming true. Here's Chris Gaines, a guy who gets killed
off and is resurrected by Garth. This is the inner recesses of
Garth's imagination, and a lot of fans are scared about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the first Chris Gaines single created a flurry of
curious attention when it was released, it hasn't become a hit.
However, J.R. Ammons, music director at Atlanta Top 40 station Star
94, says it's premature to say Garth-as-Gaines is a flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's way too early to predict whether or not it's
going to be a success. Quite often record companies will send out
an introductory single and save the good stuff for later. They
don't want a Ricky Martin kind of thing, `Livin' La Vida Loca' and
nothing after that. The next single (``Right Now,'' a kind of
rap/protest/folk song) comes out Sept. 27, and I think it's going
to fly. But if this second single doesn't do well, this project is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Feiler isn't sure that's a status Brooks will take very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say one of the first things Garth ever said to me was,
`You only get a certain time. Elvis had seven good years. The
Beatles had seven years before the breakup.' I think one of the
chief motivations here is to try to rewrite the rules of fame. To
try to give himself another shot at it. It's fair to point out that
he hasn't put out a lot of new music, and certainly not successful
good music, in the last five years. This (Chris Gaines) is an
admission of creative waning.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there anything you can eat that might make you live a lot
longer? The answer is yes, but it's not entirely pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Tufts University reported last week that elderly
rats fed servings of blueberries performed much better in everyday
lab rat tasks like walking along a narrow rod. One of the
scientists was so impressed with his rodents' regained skills that
he has started eating berries every day.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists, an often fractious crowd, agree that fruit and
vegetables are good for you. But there's a difference between
eating for good health _ which may improve the chances of attaining
one's maximum life span _ and eating to extend that natural
maximum.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the odds that no disease gets you before old age
does, the green grocer is your friend. Even blueberries may help,
if you don't mind flashing blue smiles and scrubbing crimson stains
from your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely that any one food is the true ambrosia. The
real hope lies in genetics, where scientists are beginning to make
real progress. Until they hit the fountain of youth, there's only
one diet that has been proved to extend life. If it works as well
in people as it does in rodents, it will lengthen your life by 25
years. Guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't it touted in all those $30 health books that
promise longevity if one bets on the author's prescribed diet?
Doubtless because it can be described in eight words, not a book:
reduce your intake of calories by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rats and mice fed on this diet _ which means 40 percent less
than they will eat when allowed as much food as they want _ live a
third longer. Note that this isnot a malnutrition diet: the animals
are given all the vitamins and minerals they need. It's just that
their calories are cut way down.
</P>
<P>
   The upside: you can eat whatever you like. It doesn't seem to
matter whether the calories are in the form of fat or protein or
carbohydrate.
</P>
<P>
   Would a calorically restricted diet work in people as well as it
does in laboratory rodents, which live only a couple of years?
Because people are generally more like monkeys than mice, two
monkey-feeding trials are underway. But since rhesus monkeys can
live 40 years and the trials started only in the late 1980s, no
simian Methuselahs have had time to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   A possible shortcut to finding if caloric restriction helps
people was reported last month by Richard Weindruch, a leader in
animal aging studies, and his colleague, Tomas A. Prolla, both of
the University of Wisconsin. They used a new biological tool called
an Affymetrix chip to measure aging at the cellular level. The chip
can tell what cells are doing by monitoring which genes are
switched on or off.
</P>
<P>
   The chip supported a longstanding theory of aging: that cells
get damaged by oxygen-derived chemicals known as free radicals,
which are created as a by-product of energy production. Cells from
old mice had switched on the genes that deal with free radical
damage, the chip found, whereas in calorically restricted mice of
the same age the damage control genes were quiescent.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer calories, less energy production, less damage to the
cell's mitochondria, as its miniature batteries are called. If the
chip provides a true measure of cellular aging, then it may be
possible to tell whether the monkeys are aging more slowly on their
calorically restricted diet as soon as an appropriate chip can be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch says that until he conducted the chip experiment he
had not tried to restrict the calories in his own diet. But he
changed his mind after seeing the effects of dietary intervention.
``Although I have studied caloric restriction for 25 years, the
power of the intervention was such that it changed my behavior and
I'm eating less food,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The study of why organisms age has long been a hopeless
backwater of science. The secrets were locked deep in the cell
beyond researchers' reach. In the past few years, much has changed.
Last year researchers supported by the Geron Corp. made two
spectacular advances _ they learned how to ``immortalize'' ordinary
cells of the human body and how to isolate a naturally immortal
class of cells known as human embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Immortal, in biologists' parlance, refers to the ability of
cells grown in glassware to grow and divide indefinitely without
becoming cancerous _ an ability in marked contrast to that of
normal body cells, which can divide only 50 or so times before
hitting senescence.
</P>
<P>
   Immortality of the cell is not the same as immortality of the
entire organism, but the two are not necessarily unrelated. The
very existence of a perpetually enduring cell is proof that
biological systems don't have to rust and decay. They can renew
themselves indefinitely, suggesting that there is no biological
limit on longevity.
</P>
<P>
   That evolution does not design mice or people to live so long is
not because it could not, many biologists believe, but because
there would be no advantage in terms of natural selection. In a
world full of predators, it's better to design organisms that breed
prolifically and die young than ones that can live forever but are
bound to get zapped by saber-toothed tigers at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically contrived life extension for people may come one
day, but it's not around the corner. For those who wish to do
something now, caloric restriction seems to be the best _ in fact
the only _ bet, even though not yet proved in primates. And
Weindruch, working with mice, has already worked out the answers to
many obvious questions: Don't begin young _ undernutrition stunts
growth. You can start later in life and still get a substantial
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not necessary to cut calories the full 40 percent:
mice live longer even with a 10 percent calorie reduction, though
the effect is not as pronounced. In a recent article in Scientific
American, Weindruch figured that people would do best ``by
consuming an amount that enabled them to weigh 10 to 25 percent
less than their personal set point,'' which (though often hard for
a person to define) is the weight the body naturally tries to keep
itself at.
</P>
<P>
   So eat what you like _ blueberries, chocolate liqueurs, ice
cream. But mal appetit!

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   _ Involve your child in setting television limits by using a
family meeting or weekly calendar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Television should come after other priorities: homework,
meals, sports and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to watch television with your children. Discuss programs
with them, follow up with books and tapes if the topic interests
them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn more about the shows your child wants to watch. If you
don't have time to watch them, check out reviews, the Internet,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Television shows for kids don't need to be academic. Shows can
be fun, uplifting and entertaining as well as educational.
</P>
<P>
   _ When a particular television show is over, turn off the set.
Discourage children from flipping from one show to another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a log of how much television your child is watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to help children understand the way television shows and
commercials are produced. Help them become more critical viewers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be flexible. For example, allow extra time for specials that
are worthwhile.
</P>

 &HT;    The spirit of modern art
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's as plain as the nose pushed to the side of your
face. The labyrinthine history of visual art in the 20th century is
embodied in the career of Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-born virtuoso, who often represented himself as the
mythological Minotaur, charged through that art maze for almost
three-quarters of the century. In the early years, he added
important turns himself, such as cubism, or worked with innovators
like the surrealists, who forged new directions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Picasso contributed in more subtle ways, sometimes as a
symbol to react against. Whether he contributed as isolated genius
or comrade, whether he's viewed as adored mentor or Oedipal enemy,
he wielded vast influence on modern and contemporary art and on the
public's conception of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the High Museum of Art's 1997 Picasso exhibit,
director Ned Rifkin called him ``the Michael Jordan of 20th-century
art.''
</P>
<P>
   As in all aspects of cultural life, art has undergone a series
of dizzying changes during the past 100 years. Disparate
expressions, philosophies and aesthetic strategies have emerged,
held sway, submerged and popped up again, coexisting with their
polar opposites. Figuration and abstraction, for instance, have
played dueling banjos.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, it seemed that the art object was evolving out
of existence, with the rise of ephemeral or more word-oriented
genres like performance and body art, earth art and conceptualism.
Yet we close out the century with artists like Martin Puryear
making beautiful, lovingly crafted sculptures and kitchen-sink
installations that are almost as academic as Guillaume-Adolphe
Bouguereau's 19th-century nudes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from diversity, the overarching theme for this century is
the expansion of art's parameters. Artists have continued to find
new materials for art, be it someone's trash or videotape.
</P>
<P>
   They have also continued to break down boundaries between
traditional art mediums as well as between art and life itself.
Robert Rauschenberg famously asserted that he was acting in the gap
between art and life. But it's a good bet that even he didn't
imagine that a French woman named Orlan would make gallery fodder,
including live footage, out of her cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso (1881-1973) never altered his famous face, though he
manipulated bodies aplenty in his art. His output was so rich and
varied that it has served as a bottomless well of inspiration to
artists throughout the century. You can go to galleries in Atlanta
today and find painters who still depend on his cubist fragments,
surrealist amoebic forms or galumphing classical figures.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the slavish followers: Many important artists of the
first half of the century _ from Piet Mondrian to Marcel Duchamp _
went through a ``Picasso period'' before finding their own
directions.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy is no less important in the second half of the
century. At that point, his philosophy and example mattered more
than his vocabulary. Jackson Pollock, always in awe of Picasso's
innovations, invented a language for himself, which we call
abstract expressionism. Obviously, Pollock's achievement was not a
simple cause and effect. Still, Picasso scholar Pepe Karmel made a
point about Picasso's towering presence when, in a recent
interview, he recalled a story in which Lee Krasner, Pollock's
wife, ran into his studio upon hearing a loud crash to discover
that Pollock had thrown a Picasso book across the room.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to have exclaimed, swearing, ``that Picasso
thought of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most current art has roots in Picasso. The modern
master is the oldest of the 37 mostly contemporary artists included
in ``Regarding Beauty: A View of the Late 20th Century,'' opening
next month at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are exploring the relationship of ugliness and beauty, and
Picasso went against the Greek canon of beauty so early,'' said
associate curator Olga Viso.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Joseph) Beuys and Duchamp are more immediate role models to
contemporary artists, but Picasso is crucial to this time _ the way
he went against tradition and was constantly reinventing himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Michael Pittari, curator of the summer exhibition
``Double Vision'' at Nexus Contemporary Art Center, traced a
different theme back to the eminence grise as well. As he wrote in
the catalog, ``So much 20th-century art, from Pablo Picasso to
Barnett Newman to Cindy Sherman, has been consumed with the
examination or consideration of the self.''
</P>
<P>
   This focus on self bespeaks Picasso's monumental ego, but it
also relates to his involvement with surrealism and its basis in
Freud's theories of the unconscious. As Picasso said, ``Art gives
form to our terrors as well as our desires.''
</P>
<P>
   Picasso's surrealism and autobiographical symbolism were
influential, but his greatest impact came through his most
revolutionary contribution to art: cubism. Heralded in the 1907
painting ``Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and developed in
collaboration with Georges Braque over the next few years, cubism
was a new visual language that exploded time and space by depicting
objects as fragments assembled from multiple perspectives. A number
of artists' groups, including the Italian futurists and Russian
constructivists, recognized its importance and implications
immediately and adapted its vocabulary to suit their ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   A host of individuals also riffed off cubism to create their own
expression, among them Frenchman Fernand Leger's celebration of the
machine, Russian expatriate Marc Chagall's fantasies and American
Stuart Davis' jazzy American scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Not all who fell under his spell were painters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photographers such as Paul Strand took formal components of
cubism, while others, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn, were more
concerned with its conceptual aspects,'' explained Tom Southall,
High Museum of Art photography curator. ``David Hockney made the
most inspired homage in his montages of multiple images.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockney, who began his ``joiners'' in 1972, did a suite of
memorial prints after Picasso's death.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff of real life
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Picasso created the collage by pasting a piece of
oilcloth that looked like chair caning onto an oval canvas
depicting a cubist still life and framing it in rope. In so doing,
he brought the materials of the daily world into the realm of fine
art.
</P>
<P>
   Collage became ground zero for much of the art of the 1950s
onward. Jasper Johns' ``Flag.'' Rau-
</P>
<P>
   schenberg's seriographs using newsprint and fabric. Andy
Warhol's Campbell Soup cans. They're all unthinkable without the
collage and its implications. Similarly, the idea that any material
is fair game for art links Dan Flavin's fluorescent light
sculptures, Robert Smithson's mud and stone ``Spiral Jetty'' and
Ann Hamilton's installations, which involve anything from work
shirts to live canaries.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso's sculpture was equally resonant. Would Henry Moore have
poked holes in his figures if Picasso hadn't abandoned the
traditional solidity of Western sculpture?
</P>
<P>
   Would David Smith have made his abstractions but for the
openwork welded pieces of Julio Gonzalez and Picasso?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the real spoon in Picasso's painted ``Glass of
Absinthe,'' one of 125 works in the High Museum's 1997-98 exhibit
``Picasso: Master Works From the Museum of Modern Art,'' paved the
way for all manner of assemblages _ from John Chamberlain's
compositions of smashed car parts to David Hammons' ``Higher
Goals,'' composed of basketball hoops, poles painted with patterns
and bottle caps.
</P>
<P>
   The collage-into-sculpture issue suggests another aspect of
Picasso's legacy. He routinely collapsed boundaries between art
mediums. We think nothing of Frank Stella's high reliefs, which
straddle the line between painting and sculpture. But at the time
Picasso was drawing in space with his wire sculpture of the '20s,
mediums were primly cordoned off into their own territories.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso didn't stop with conflating two and three dimensions. A
man with a voracious and expansive aesthetic curiosity, he worked
in any and every medium, from ceramics to set design. If the
camcorder had been invented when he was younger, he would have
tried that, too. In addition, he often made a contribution to the
field. No less an experimental photographer than Man Ray praised
Picasso's work in that medium in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   In his survey of contemporary ceramics, author Garth Clark cites
the clay work of Miro and Picasso as ``crucial'' to the development
of the craft movement of the mid-'50s, in which the boundary
between craft and fine art melted away.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Picasso's contribution was to see himself as an
artist rather than, say, a printmaker or painter.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, historians like to divide the spoils of influence
between Picasso and Duchamp, who is credited with the conceptual
direction of the 20th-century art labyrinth. Yet there is not a
great leap from Picasso's found-object sculptures, like the
sculpture of a bull made out of a bicycle seat and handlebars, to
Duchamp's ``ready-mades,'' such as ``Fountain,'' for which he did
nothing but turn a urinal upside down and sign it R. Mutt.
</P>
<P>
   If you try, you can even give Picasso some credit for
abstraction. Think about Mondrian, who played with cubism and took
it to what he considered its logical end. Then there's Ellsworth
Kelly. According to Yve-Alain Bois, the Harvard University
professor who wrote the catalog for the recent Kelly show of
drawings at the High Museum, Kelly turned to abstraction as a way
of erasing his self because he felt there was no way to out-Picasso
Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   The artist and celebrity
</P>
<P>
   If his art has been endlessly dissected, so has Picasso's
``self.'' The first modern art celebrity, Picasso has defined the
public's conception of the artist, even while contradicting it at
most every turn. We expect an artist to create out of passion and
be happy to starve in a garret. If one tries to make a living as
well, he is a careerist. Picasso's fecundity demonstrates that need
to create, but the one-time communist displayed a capitalist
canniness in manipulating dealers and working with them to further
his career.
</P>
<P>
   We think of artists as outsiders. Picasso considered himself so,
yet the Minotaur enjoyed a bull market for his art and groveling
adoration for most of his life. Stereotypically, artists ignore
social strictures. In this case, Picasso complied with the public
vision. His love life is legendary: The man in the sailor shirts
acted like one on perennial leave.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist artists, from Judy Chicago to the Guerrilla Girls, who
have made themselves heard since the late '70s, probably used the
visage of male chauvinist pig incarnate as target practice. Yet
other women _ from Cindy Sherman, who stars in her own photographic
tableaux, to Elizabeth Murray, who makes oddly shaped
autobiographical abstract paintings _ have reaped the benefits of
his aesthetic adventures as much as their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   More contradictions: Picasso earned kudos for his originality,
yet we know that he felt free to borrow or learn from _ some would
say plunder _ anything or anybody. He had a dialogue, or
competition, going with the old and modern masters Velazquez and
Matisse, the only peer he felt occupied the same stratosphere.
(Matisse looked over his shoulder as well, and both were influenced
by the other.) In the formation of cubism, the influence of tribal
arts, particularly African masks (and, as new information suggests,
postcard photos of West African peoples), is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Many African-American artists and contemporary critics have
accused Picasso and his peers of engaging in aesthetic colonialism.
Certainly, when members of the Harlem Renaissance and contemporary
artists such as Rene Stout and Atlantan Radcliffe Bailey have
looked to Africa for inspiration, they have done so with a
different emotional attachment and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bit anachronistic, however, to expect Picasso to
stand outside his times in this respect. One could take the other
side and thank him and his colleagues for seeing the magic and
aesthetic sophistication in artifacts otherwise consigned to
ethnology museums.
</P>
<P>
   For all his accomplishments, he was as capable of drivel as the
next artist. Unfortunately, the same cult of celebrity that sends
people scavenging in Bob Dylan's garbage can is evident in the way
Picasso's every scrap of paper is treated like a piece of the true
cross.
</P>
<P>
   That blinkered veneration has caused its own backlash. New
Yorker critic Adam Gopnik asserted that Picasso was only important
during early years of cubism, after which he basically wallowed in
``vulgar imagination.'' It has been said that he was the world's
greatest artist for the first half of the century and, for the
second, merely the most famous.
</P>
<P>
   True, he didn't lead the pack for all of his 92 years, but he
contributed mightily by example. When all complaints are aired and
hyperbole taken down a peg or two, however, it's difficult to deny
that Picasso, with his border crossings, his anything-goes attitude
and his definition of the artist as a creative being that
transcends any medium, casts a long shadow across the century.

HEARINGS ON RUSSIA ARE PARTISAN, BUT MORE RESTRAINED THAN
EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.C., Iowa, Texas, Ala., Del.)  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the acrimony between congressional
Republicans and the White House, the Clinton administration emerged
relatively unscathed after several days of hearings last week into
allegations of Russian corruption and money laundering at the Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not surface with ammunition that some had
hoped could be used in the campaign season. ``I don't think there
was anything that was startling, unexpected or particularly
dramatic,'' Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is on the House Banking
Committee, acknowledged in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, casualties from two days of testimony
before the House Banking Committee and one afternoon's worth before
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of The Bank of New York, Thomas A. Renyi, admitted
that Bank supervisors committed embarrassing lapses in oversight
over nine accounts at the core of the investigation. Federal
investigators say at least $4.2 billion, and perhaps $10 billion,
in Russian money flowed through accounts controlled by the husband
of a highly regarded Bank officer who has now been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   And the inquiry's probe into Bank of New York accounts in the
Cayman Islands held by the son-in-law of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin raised new questions about the Kremlin's possible
involvement in illicit activity.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption in Russia is an old story to many lawmakers and
administration officials, but when the federal inquiry into the
Bank of New York became public last month, it ignited
long-simmering Republican criticisms of President Clinton's Russia
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Top House Republicans like Dick Armey of Texas, the majority
leader, Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, revved up a new
barrage of ``Who Lost Russia?'' accusations.
</P>
<P>
   But two things hampered Republicans who were hoping to reap
political hay from the scandal and from criticisms that the
administration turned a blind eye to Kremlin corruption.
</P>
<P>
   First, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, is a thoughtful moderate who immediately rejected
the premise of Armey and DeLay. His tone throughout the hearings
was probing, but not confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the toughest questions for Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers at the banking committee came from Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.,
who is not on the committee but was invited because of his Russia
expertise. Faced with Weldon's heated accusations that the
administration had all but ignored the Russian parliament in favor
of Yeltsin, Summers did not deny the charge and promised closer
attention would now be paid to the parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and even more surprising, was the demeanor of the
administration's sharpest foreign policy critic in the Senate,
Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Instead of peppering Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott with tough questions, Helms
quickly gave up, apparently in disgust, when Talbott sidestepped
inquiries about American intelligence reports on Russian corruption
and allegations of corruption against specific Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Helms briefly took aim at Vice President Al Gore, and his
relationship with former Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. ``I confess deep concern that the policies pursued by
President Clinton and Vice President Gore may have abetted
corruption in Russia,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   With round one of hearings behind them, Congress and the
administration are now backing rival legislation to combat money
laundering and are offering tough rhetoric on restricting
international aid to Russia. In fact, the current requirements
governing the release of $4.5 billion in aid from the International
Monetary Fund allow installments to be disbursed only after several
financial safeguards are met. Even then the money moves from one
fund account to another and never actually enters the Russian
banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate now is over how to engage Russia more rationally,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But is Congress engaged? Barely one-third of the members of the
banking and international relations committees showed up for
hearings that featured Summers, Talbott and Renyi, as well as
former CIA and KGB spies, members of the Russian parliament and a
top U.S. law-enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   One noted Russian expert told the Senate panel that official
Washington has seized on the money-laundering investigation, but
has largely ignored the larger issue of guiding Russia through its
perilous transformation from Communist dictatorship to a free
market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is not that we've misengaged Russia, but that we are
disengaging from Russia,'' said Prof. Robert Legvold, a Russian
specialist at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   If this trend continues unchecked, Legvold warned, Russia could
devolve into a ``failed state'' and ``a vortex of volatility and
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, lawmakers say they will be keenly watching
the ongoing investigations by American, British, Swiss and Russian
authorities. Some lawmakers expect dramatic developments.
</P>
<P>
   Other legislators reminded their colleagues that Russians are
ultimately responsible for their own fate, and the United States
and the West can only do so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Russia needs is a Moses,'' said Rep. Spencer Bachus,
R-Ala., who is on the banking panel. ``If there's not strong
leadership in Russia, our options are limited.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a profession that prides itself on obliqueness,
Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley has always been
plain-spoken. She was no more so than on the occasion last week
marking her 42 years as an American diplomat, a career that has
spanned most continents and forged a trail for women in a man's
world.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Mrs. Oakley delivered a broadside on U.S. diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, she said, is stuck in a rut, financially
ill equipped and without enough people having the skills to deal
with the post-Cold War era. The lofty ideal of the United States'
leadership and spreading the message of democracy and free markets
cannot be accomplished, she said, when ``we cannot staff our
embassies, let alone the department.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, she has watched as money for the CIA and
the Pentagon increased but the budget at the State Department
stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   She despaired, she said, as smart foreign service officers were
passed over for a galaxy of outsider, big-name special envoys who
were sent as troubleshooters to the Balkans, Cyprus, Korea, Africa
and other hot spots around the world. Morale is as much of a
problem now, she added, as it was when she joined in 1957 _ when
there were too many foreign officers. Now there are too few.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was news to the crowd assembled for Mrs. Oakley's
farewell party in the top-drawer reception area of the State
Department, the Benjamin Franklin Room. But usually these
sentiments are aired more discreetly.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later at the home that she and her husband,
former Ambassador Robert Oakley, have slipped in and out of as they
went to Khartoum, Kinshasa, Paris, Beirut and Islamabad, and then
returned to the department, Mrs. Oakley had more to say. She
described U.S. diplomacy as ``threadbare.'' The State Department,
she contended, needs to be ``strengthened'' in relation to the
Pentagon and the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we have left is the military, so we use it in
Iraq and Kosovo,'' she lamented. ``The raids into Afghanistan and
Sudan _ that's using military means for diplomatic purposes,'' she
said, referring to the cruise-missile attacks last year against
sites in Afghanistan and Sudan allegedly linked to the man wanted
for blowing up U.S. embassies in Africa, Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In her last job, as assistant secretary for intelligence and
research, which she leaves Thursday, Mrs. Oakley said she felt the
impact of the slim financial resources most keenly. In the last
five years, the intelligence and research bureau, which compiles
intelligence for the secretary of state but which is also
supervised by the director of intelligence, has been a special
target for cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be secretary of state without my own intelligence
unit,'' said Mrs. Oakley. `It's too important when you're dealing
with terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.'' It is a basic
rule that good intelligence is produced by ``competitive
analysis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitive analysis is essential,'' she said. ``Nobody gets
it absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Oakley passed the foreign service exam at age 21, joined
the State Department at 22 and a year later married Robert Oakley.
He was assigned on his first overseas post _ newly independent
Sudan _ as third officer, and according to the regulations of the
time, Mrs. Oakley had to give up her job.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Khartoum was a small city on the banks of the
Nile where foreigners could live as much like the locals as they
wanted. Because of the heat and lack of air conditioning, sleeping
on the roof is common in Khartoum. Mrs. Oakley recalls going to the
market and having a bed custom made: a pillow-soft mattress stuffed
with locally grown cotton resting on a rope mattress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night we went up there and there was not a cloud,
just the moon and stars. I said to Bob: `It's too bright, I can't
sleep.'''
</P>
<P>
   After several overseas assignments serving as a diplomat's wife
_ and taking a college teaching job in the United States when her
husband was sent to Vietnam and dependents of U.S. diplomats were
not allowed to go _ Mrs. Oakley landed her first real job at the
State Department. By 1974 the department had lifted its ban on
working spouses.
</P>
<P>
   She jumped ahead when Philip Habib, the undersecretary for
political affairs at the time, asked her to work as his staff
assistant. Though the ban on spouses had been lifted, some
attitudes had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would walk into Phil Habib's office in the morning with
stacks of memos and papers,'' Mrs. Oakley recalled. ``He would
shout at me, `Why aren't you home cooking breakfast for your
husband?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Lebanese from Brooklyn, rough and gruff. He was a
chauvinist. He loved Bob. He thought I wasn't doing my job by not
looking after one of Phil's boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Oakley's career took off in its own right when Secretary of
State George Shultz noticed her performance on the McNeil-Lehrer
television show on the subject of Afghanistan. As the desk officer
for Afghanistan, Mrs. Oakley outshone the other guests and Schultz
called to tell her so. He chose her as deputy spokesperson to
Bernard Kalb and then Charles Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Because Redmond had a more retiring personality and traveled
frequently with Shultz, Mrs. Oakley took over the State Department
podium, fielding questions as serious as Iran-Contra and as
frivolous as on what part of Shultz's anatomy his tattoo was
placed. (``I'm not in a position to comment,'' Mrs. Oakley
demurred).
</P>
<P>
   Walking the fine line of policy at the end of the Reagan
administration was not easy, she said. ``I found the toughest
problem the arms-control policy,'' she said. ``It was a political
hot potato. There were those of us who wanted us to be tougher on
the Soviets. The guidance was so carefully worked out you couldn't
deviate a word.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Mrs. Oakley was offered an ambassadorship
but she declined. ``The thrill of being an ambassador doesn't hold
luster for me, because I've been an ambassador's wife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who was known as one of the strongest ambassadors
for tough spots, said he would go along. But in fact, she said with
some self-effacement, the notion of Ambassador Phyllis Oakley with
Bob Oakley serving in the same embassy ``does not pass the giggle
test.''

   Readers of a certain age should have no trouble alerting young
viewers to the identities of the main characters in the new version
of ``Animal Farm'' to be telecast on TNT on Sunday, Oct. 3: That
show pig, Old Major, is a stand-in for Lenin; that vicious-looking
porker, Napoleon, can be nobody but Stalin, and that sometime
comrade, Snowball, soon to be on the trot from Stalin, is Trotsky.
</P>
<P>
   The famous 1945 fable is, of course, George Orwell's take on
what he called ``the Soviet myth'' of the Bolshevik Revolution and
its corruption of the ideal of communism, but his other writings as
a whole are less tough on Napoleon/Stalin than on left-wing Western
apologists for the dictator and his regime. They, more than Russian
propagandists, drew his fire.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the 1947 Ukrainian translation of ``Animal
Farm'' (for Soviet exiles) Orwell, a lifelong socialist, explained
that he got the idea from seeing a 10-year-old boy in an English
village whipping a huge cart horse (the model for the strong but
stupid Boxer): ``It struck me that if only such animals became
aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that
men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the
proletariat.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell attributed his book's rejection by several major British
publishers to editors with a soft spot for communist claims to a
nonexploitive society and a disinclination to criticize a wartime
ally. In 1944, he wrote to T.S. Eliot of the ``imbecile suggestion
that some other animal than pigs might be made to represent
Bolsheviks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his parable conveys, Orwell did not credit the
contention among admirers of Lenin and Trotsky that perverse
developments in the Soviet Union dated from the ascendance of
Stalin. He wrote in a 1946 magazine article that ``all the seeds of
evil were there from the start'' and that things would not have
been substantially different if Lenin or Trotsky had remained in
control.
</P>
<P>
   He even found a conciliatory word in the introduction to the
Ukrainian translation of ``Animal Farm'' for the Stalin gang's
``barbaric and undemocratic methods,'' on the grounds that with the
best of intentions they might have had difficulty acting otherwise
under the pressing conditions after the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Orwell saw it, that excuse was not available to Western
writers, whose job was not to concoct apologies for a murderous
regime but to expose it. And that, he charged repeatedly, was what
many on the British Labor Party's left wing failed to do from the
1930s through the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   He found them succumbing to a theory he described as
``catastrophic gradualism.'' Propagated by defenders of the Soviet
Union in all its ugliest manifestations, this theory held that
purges, deportations and the secret police were the price of
progress. If the advance toward the communist millennium
nevertheless turned out to be slow or imperceptible, that was laid
to ``human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular (and Popular Front) formula, he noted, was ``You
can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.'' However, he added, if
someone replied, ``Yes, but where's the omelet?'' the answer was
likely to be ``Oh well, you can't expect everything to happen in a
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year after the publication of ``Animal Farm,'' Orwell
attended a meeting of Britain's Pen Club, where his opinion of the
sorry condition of much of British socialism was confirmed.
Moscow's purges of old comrades were cheered, and there was no
breath of criticism for the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he came down hard on writers who had betrayed
their vocation. Not long after the Pen Club meeting, in an essay
called ``The Prevention of Literature,'' he wrote, ``The fog of
lies and misinformation that surrounds such subjects as the Ukraine
famine, the Spanish civil war, Russian policy in Poland and so
forth is not due entirely to conscious dishonesty, but any writer
or journalist who is fully sympathetic to the USSR _ sympathetic,
that is, in the way the Russians themselves would want him to be _
does have to acquiesce in deliberate falsification on important
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It exasperated him that even when it came to strictly literary
judgments, left-wing philistines hewed to the Soviet line. They
attacked ``highbrows'' and relied on a version of political
correctness as a cultural guide: ``X is a political enemy:
Therefore he is a bad writer.'' So much for the likes of Eliot and
other modernists whose work he admired.
</P>
<P>
   In his indictment of the writer who succumbed to pressure or
incentives to adjust his opinions and ``switch his allegiance at
exactly the right moment'' in accord with the political winds from
the East, as many did in concocting rationalizations for Soviet
flip-flops regarding Hitler's Germany, Orwell observed, ``He must
either tell lies about his subjective feelings or else suppress
them altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that such is the road to a writer's destruction: ``Not
only will ideas refuse to come to him, but the very words he uses
will seem to stiffen under his touch.''
</P>
<P>
   That, taught Orwell, a staunch supporter of the democratic left
and of the sanctity of the word, was the inevitable price of
totalitarianism. The certain punishment for those on the fellow
travelers' farm: ``Good writing stops.''

ALBRIGHT INVITES WOMEN LEADERS TO WORK WITH HER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a dinner for 10 foreign ministers, held
without fanfare on Thursday evening in a quiet, still unopened
sculpture gallery at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   While a chamber ensemble played classical music, the ministers
worked their way slowly through a dinner of poached quail eggs with
artichoke and caviar, mahi-mahi in tarragon butter and a cake of
chocolate souffle with sorbet and ice cream on spun sugar.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours, they emerged with hugs and kisses and a
letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan asking him to put on the
agenda of the U.N. General Assembly their concern about ``the
repulsive trafficking in human beings, predominantly women and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers _ all women _ and their host, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright _ had taken one more step toward creating
a lobby for moving women's issues closer to the center of foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent three-quarters of the dinner basically talking about
the trafficking-in-women letter that we signed,'' the secretary of
state said as her car sped back to the Waldorf Astoria to the wail
of police sirens.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was blunt: ``On the edge of the 21st century,'' it
said, ``it is unacceptable that human beings around the world are
sold into situations such as sexual exploitation, domestic
servitude and debt bondage that are little different from
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers asked that governments start taking seriously the
negotiations now in progress on adding a prohibition on human
trafficking to a convention on international organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had the feeling that while it was very important to
press women's issues, unless you make them central to your foreign
policy, then they get kind of shunted aside,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has been working to build strong relations among women
in foreign affairs since her days as chief representative at the
United Nations during the first Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 14 women worldwide holding the portfolio of foreign
minister, she has continued the tradition at a higher level. One of
her guests at the dinner on Thursday evening has been with her from
the beginning. Foreign Minister Rosario Green of Mexico was an
assistant secretary-general in the U.N. political department when
she met Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The others at the dinner were Maria Eugenia Brizuela de Avila of
El Salvador, Tarja Halonen of Finland, Andrea Willi of Luxembourg,
Lydie Polfer of Liechtenstein, Lila Ratsifandrihamanana of
Madagascar, Aichatou Mindaoudou of Niger, Nkosazana Zuma of South
Africa and Anna Lindh of Sweden.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way Republicans were acting last week it was
almost as if some of them could not decide which was more
uncomfortable: having Pat Buchanan leave the party or John McCain
stay in it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Buchanan, McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, has

making a third party bid for the presidency. Yet as he wages his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination he has a way of
casting a searing light on his party.
</P>
<P>
   Take McCain's call for Republicans to stand ``on principle'' and
bid Buchanan goodbye because of his isolationist views on World War
II and questions about whether Hitler was a threat to the United
States after his air force was defeated in the Battle of Britain.
The senator was met with either disagreement or cautious silence by
the other Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a bye on this,'' a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole said
initially. It took another day for Mrs. Dole to say Buchanan's
comments ``are grossly insensitive to those Americans who gave
their lives and those veterans who fought and suffered greatly to
preserve freedom in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, an aide to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said
America's soldiers ``were fighting for freedom.'' Then, on Friday,
Bush himself urged Buchanan not to bolt the Republican Party,
saying ``I'm going to need every vote I can get among Republicans
to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The hesitation baffled other Republicans. ``It seems a moment in
which the Republican Party can rid of itself of the unfair
characterization of being extremist,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a
political analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``Yet
there's a bewildering reluctance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fracas that ensued last week when an array of
conservative groups including Americans for Tax Reform, the
Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Association and the
National Right to Life Committee journeyed to two key primary
states to denounce McCain for his campaign finance bill, which
would ban unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties.
Usually these are groups that are treated with reverence by
Republicans because they can mobilize conservative voters. But the
McCain campaign fired right back at the critics, noting that some
of them are lobbyists paid by companies and business interests that
make so-called soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform, was
philosophical, saying that while Buchanan and McCain ``both have
assets for the party they are each running for president in an odd
way.'' He said McCain ``has been seeking editorial approval from
The New York Times and The Washington Post at the expense of the
Republican base.'' And Buchanan ``thinks you can run for president
without the business community,'' Norquist said. ``That's odd,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who is the national co-chairman of
the McCain campaign, said: ``John McCain is just being John
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those less happy with the kinds of waves McCain causes
in conservative ranks it could be the beginning of a long few
months. After all, McCain does not even make his candidacy official
until Monday.

   WASHINGTON _ The way Republicans were acting last week it was
almost as if some of them could not decide which was more
uncomfortable: having Pat Buchanan leave the party or John McCain
stay in it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Buchanan, McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, has
said he is a Republican through and through with no interest in
making a third party bid for the presidency. Yet as he wages his
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination he has a way of

INDIA'S ELECTION MARATHON LUMBERS INTO FINAL WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ As India lumbers into the fourth and final
week of marathon national elections, elephants bearing ballot boxes
tramp into dense forests and ponies carrying election officials
clop their way to dizzying heights in the Himalayas, all to make
sure that every citizen _ no matter how remote _ gets a chance to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth stage of voting was Saturday. By the time the last
vote is cast in the fifth and final round next Sunday and the last
indelible ink stain has been swabbed on the last voter's finger, as
many as six out of every 10 adult Indians _ more than 350 million
people _ will have exercised their franchise, election officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   If exit polls and political analysts are to be believed, the
kaleidoscope of Indian politics will then settle into a pattern
similar to the last coalition government, though different in
certain crucial respects.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist-led alliance will most likely still be in
power, but probably backed this time by a more powerful collection
of 23 parties and probably commanding a stronger majority than it
did in April, before it lost the confidence of Parliament by a
single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, 73, seems certain to head
the new government, as he has the old one for the past year and a
half, and will hope to have consolidated his position as the
undisputed centrist leader of the coalition, the only man who can
hold its disparate parts together.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls differ over the size of the coalition's margin of
victory _ a margin crucial to determining how forcefully the
alliance can govern. In its last incarnation, the coalition's
majority was so thin that even the smallest parties had the power
to threaten its demise by withdrawing. Much of Vajpayee's energy
was consumed by the dispiriting job of placating mercurial,
petulant allies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and Western diplomats believe that a resounding
victory this time would give the government more room to take
politically risky steps. On the domestic front, it could move more
aggressively, for example, to shut down money-losing state
enterprises and encourage foreign investment. In foreign policy, it
would have more leeway to reopen talks with Pakistan, sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and improve relations with the United
States on trade and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But most agree that even gaining a big majority would not free
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, the largest
partner in the coalition, to pursue its religiously divisive
agenda, which includes building a Hindu temple on the site of a
destroyed mosque and subordinating Muslim personal law to India's
civil code.
</P>
<P>
   The party will still be dependent on regional allies _ for
example, the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh _ that
count on the votes of Muslims, are committed to secularism and
would almost certainly quit the coalition if the more vociferous
Hindu nationalists were given free rein.
</P>
<P>
   The factors underlying the coalition's apparent electoral gains
are various. The soaring price of vegetables that had led to such
disastrous results for the Hindu nationalists in state elections
last November have come down. In fact, inflation, a potent
political issue here, is low.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial growth is on the upswing and this season's normal
monsoon will help insure that agricultural production in this
predominantly rural nation is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has been lavished on Vajpayee's deft diplomatic
handling of a small war in Kashmir that ended with India's
repelling Pakistani-backed forces from its territory, and that
victory does seem to have burnished his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews in villages and cities in southern, western
and northern India, voters almost never raised the Kashmir conflict
as a decisive issue. Usually, they were motivated by local,
bread-and-butter issues or the interests of their own caste or
religious group. They often said that they would support regional
or caste-based political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The days of one-party rule under the Congress Party are long
gone. It is the Bharatiya Janata Party that has wholeheartedly
embraced the necessity of building a coalition and sharing power
with its partners in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BJP has tied up with more heavyweight regional allies in
state after state,'' said E. Sridharan, a political analyst at the
University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of
India, based here. ``That is a huge strategic advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, the widowed,
Italian-born heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, has continued to
organize its campaign around the notion that it is the natural
party of governance and the only force that can provide political
stability, while minimizing the need for allies. But that position
is increasingly implausible.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party itself has been weakened internally by
disputes over the foreign origins of Mrs. Gandhi, 52. Sharad Pawar,
the party's chief power broker in the large state of Maharashtra,
left the party earlier this year over that issue and set up a new
party that has significantly weakened Congress in a state where it
would otherwise have made substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The regional and caste-based parties that have proliferated in
India over the past decade or two _ some of which had joined with
leftists to form a third political force _ are now increasingly
allying themselves with either the Bharatiya Janata Party or the
Congress Party as the best hope of winning a share of power at the
national level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regional parties have realized that they can share in
power only through alliance with one of the two major party
blocs,'' said D.L. Sheth, a political sociologist at the Center for
the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi. ``This is a
multiethnic, diverse society and it expresses itself through
coalitions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Guy Bunn thought he knew his neighborhood of
40 years, the familiar slope downward from his picture window, and
then one day last week everything that was solid in his life became
liquid. A friend pulled up to his front door in a bass boat, and
Bunn, rescued, pulled an apple off his tree and knew he would never
live there again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had been living on high ground,'' he said
Saturday, as he returned for the first time to view his ruined
house and useless possessions. ``But there wasn't any high ground.
The whole neighborhood was water.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so much of eastern North Carolina, the Riverside
neighborhood that was home to Bunn and hundreds of others has been
soaked beyond salvation in the floods that followed Hurricane
Floyd, which have now killed 47 people in North Carolina alone.
</P>
<P>
   At most, a handful of homes out of 200 solid brick-and-frame
structures here will be spared the bulldozer. And by the weekend,
as a few hundred residents in the state began returning to their
homes, the mental geography of a neighborhood and an entire region
_ a people's relationship to its land and its water _ had been
permanently altered.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the week's simple exhaustion and sorrow, the prevailing
emotion in this part of North Carolina has been sheer astonishment.
No one could believe that water could rise so high, and stray so
far from its natural courses. People can accept the random winds of
a hurricane or a tornado, but a torrent raging out of a backyard
creek half a mile away makes no sense to a homeowner or a farmer
who has never seen a drop of high water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on earth would we ever have thought of flood insurance?''
asked Robert Mullett, a manager at Bill's Barbecue and Chicken
Restaurant, an enormously popular institution in the town of Wilson
that was wiped out under 7 feet of water from a creek he had not
known existed. ``Nothing has ever flooded here. It would have been
like asking for avalanche insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   But these waters defied history and everything that generations
had passed down about where it was safe to live and farm. Most of
the 30,000 homes damaged or destroyed in the state were not on the
coast, where residents knew the risks of storms; the houses were
occupied by people whose lives had very little to do with water,
until suddenly it was upon them, in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, what appeared to be a very large and attractive
lake had installed itself across a main bridge between the north
and south halves of town, cutting off all passage. It looked like
an ideal recreational lake, except that the water was teeming with
bacteria and chemicals, and happened to be on top of the airport,
the water treatment plant and several adjacent neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a week before the flood subsides, along with those in
cities like Kinston and Goldsboro. But in cities further inland
that are now drying out, including Rocky Mount and Wilson, the
extent of the damage is becoming clear in neighborhoods like
Riverside, where residents stood warily outside their properties
Saturday as if they no longer quite trusted anything they had once
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Allie Winstead, 81, who lives alone a few blocks from Bunn on
East Duke Circle, paced around her front yard, too depressed to go
in her house, but not quite willing to leave. Everything she owned
in the world had been dragged outside by cleanup crews and left
moldering in a large pile at the curb: broken Corningware, a green
glass lamp, all her clothing, the furniture her parents had handed
down.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Winstead was sleeping a week ago Thursday morning when her
neighbor phoned and told her to get out. By the time she got to the
front door, water from the overflowing Tar River was up to her
knees and she could not open the door above the swollen carpet. For
an hour, she frantically waved a flashlight through her window
until someone saw it and rescued her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what God took instead of taking me,'' she said,
gesturing at her possessions and the muddy water line above her
head on her house. ``None of us have anything left, but we took
care of each other, and not one person died here. And that's what
I'll remember about this neighborhood after it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Winstead has been living with friends since she was forced
out, and like most people here, she has no notion of her long-term
plans. Some of the residents here are among the nearly 2,800 people
around North Carolina still living in shelters, while a few others
have moved into trailers provided by the federal government.
Because the water has ruined the foundations and supporting walls
of most houses here, almost no one will be able to move back in,
and there was little interest among most residents in rebuilding
near a river that had betrayed them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Tar River's natural basin is about five blocks from Mrs.
Winstead's house. Over the years, it would rise now and then, never
inflicting any significant damage. But Saturday, on block after
block, stretching a full half-mile from the river, there was a dull
muddy crust on every car and sidewalk, on every dining room window
and tree. Carefully tended flower beds were now painted brown, and
people in brown pants and brown shoes ruefully compared the
high-water marks on their brown homes.
</P>
<P>
   There were piles of once carefully collected possessions, now
junk, in front of every house, and the neighborhood stank
powerfully of mildew and mold. A large garbage bin had been lofted
by the waters onto a telephone pole spike, seven feet above the
ground. Some people wore gloves and filtering masks over their
mouths as they entered their houses in search of a stray piece of
jewelry or maybe a picture album on a top shelf that might have
been spared.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   George Ramey Jr. walked through his mother's house next door to
Bunn's, but found little to salvage. He had brought his mother out
of the house a few days before the flood, so that she could stay
with his family when the hurricane passed over, only to find his
own neighborhood a few miles away filling up with water two days
later. He and his son became two of the town's many impromptu
saviors, jumping in their canoe and paddling several neighbors to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call that being a hero,'' Ramey said. ``It's a good
thing I actually like to hunt and fish.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in his mother's house, and found it painful to look
at the warped floorboards, the spongy walls and the gooey piles of
dye that were once treasured photographs. It should all be torn
down, he said, returned to the wetlands it must have been long ago,
before it was real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The houses here were like a chapter in this neighborhood's
life, and now it's over,'' he said. ``You know, a bunch of us grew
up here, and this morning a friend of mine got us all together for
a picture. It was like one last time before we all go in different
directions and start a new life.''

 &HT;    Foster-care agency president stays in charge despite conviction
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper, Elliot Jaspin and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Bruce Maag, the founder and president of a
private foster-care agency responsible for 1,300 children in seven
states, surrendered his license to take kids into his own home just
before he pleaded guilty in1987 to contributing to the delinquency
of a minor. Maag, president of Specialized Alternatives for Family
and Youth (SAFY), was charged in 1986 with two misdemeanor counts
of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly giving
alcohol to his foster daughter and her friend and with one
misdemeanor count of abuse alleging he had improper contact with
his foster daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse charge and one of the delinquency counts were later
dropped, according to interviews and documents from the state of
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   SAFY is licensed to place high-risk children in foster homes in
seven states _ Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma,
Texas and Alabama _ and is trying to expand into three others _
Mississippi, Kentucky and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Maag has been able to continue as president of his agency
because Ohio law at the time did not specifically bar anyone
convicted of crimes against children from working in a foster-care
agency. Although the law was changed in 1993, by then Maag's
conviction had been expunged.
</P>
<P>
   Maag was also shielded from public scrutiny by the blanket of
confidentiality that is supposed to protect children. Because his
case involved a minor, it was heard in juvenile court, where the
details were kept secret. Even the Ohio department that licenses
his agency had no record of the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is disturbing,'' said Cheri Walter, deputy
director of the Ohio Department of Human Services. ``The system is
designed so nobody has to own it. A number of times we seem to have
passed the buck onto someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with a history of abuse or neglect is not a person we
want running a foster-care agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Maag declined to talk about his case, saying his attorney told
him, ``Anything I say can be used against me.'' Maag's attorney
said his client couldn't comment because SAFY is currently in
litigation: a sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by one of its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although a SAFY caseworker in 1986 told officials in Logan
County that Maag admitted kissing his foster daughter, who was 16,
the charges involving her were dismissed after she refused to take
the stand. Maag pleaded guilty to the remaining count of giving
alcohol to her friend.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Maag's 1987 conviction, Allen County Judge David
Kinworthy ordered the records expunged. The judge's order sealed
the records forever.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Maag giving alcohol to a minor are still secret,
but the Dayton Daily News has pieced together from state and county
documents and numerous interviews the following series of events
that led to Maag's plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The girl Maag took in as his foster daughter was put into SAFY's
care by Logan County officials because she had been repeatedly
sexually abused, starting when she was a young child.
</P>
<P>
   Anna (she asked that her real name not be used) said the first
time Maag saw her she was living in a SAFY home with a foster
parent who was an alcoholic. A short time later, Maag, then a
licensed foster parent, moved her into his home.
</P>
<P>
   Anna, now 30, said Maag showered her with attention, gave her
credit cards and took her shopping. He encouraged her to be a
model. The two talked for hours. ``He gave me everything I
wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a girl who had grown up in poverty, starved for attention,
it was heady stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the attention also came with a price.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give details about the year she spent in Maag's
home. But she did say that when she arrived there she felt
vulnerable. She felt intimidated by Maag, she said, and her
caseworker had just given her some devastating news: Her mother
never wanted to see her again.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually abused since the age of 4, moved from one foster home
to another, Anna said she got ``to a place that you just didn't
fight anymore. If you wanted to live peacefully, you would just
yield.''
</P>
<P>
   After roughly a year in Maag's home, Anna said she told a SAFY
caseworker, Dru Whitaker, that she had to get out of Maag's house.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was removed and placed in a group home, then a juvenile
detention center. When Anna ran away from the center, she called a
musician she knew in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The musician said he first met Maag and Anna at a bar near
Maag's vacation home in Michigan. He said Anna was very upset when
she called him, so he drove to Ohio and picked her up. Shortly
after Anna's 17th birthday, the two got married.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a letter from Whitaker about the alleged contact
between Maag and Anna moved county officials to investigate Maag.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker wrote Logan County Children Services on Sept. 22, 1986,
saying that her boss, Maag, admitted to her that he became involved
with Anna. Whitaker interviewed Maag and Anna together in Maag's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce began to tell me there were now complicating factors
that would make it impossible for (Anna) to remain living in his
home,'' the letter says. ``Bruce indicated he and (Anna) made a
mistake. One evening when everyone was gone, Bruce came in after
having a few beers and went to his room. (Anna) gave him a back rub
and he gave her a back rub. She rolled over and they kissed
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Maag then admitted that he felt uncomfortable about what
happened and said the incident was ``not appropriate,'' the letter
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gillespie, a Logan County Children Services worker, later
told state officials the county's case files show, ``Maag admitted
to drinking beer and (Anna) rubbed his back, he rubbed her back and
they kissed.'' Gillespie also said the county records contain
``information that would lead one to conclude that more than back
rubbing was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Caron Vernon, executive director of the Logan County Children
Services agency, confirmed Gillespie's account and said she
immediately removed Anna from SAFY's care. She still refuses to
place children there today. ``When I get their stuff (SAFY's) it
goes right in the trash can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon said a caseworker in Allen County, where the alleged
abuse occurred, investigated the complaint and reported his
findings to the sheriff's department. A sheriff's detective did his
own investigation and charges were filed Jan. 13, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, SAFY board chairwoman Rose Watts wrote a letter
to the state human services department's Toledo office, saying Maag
was being investigated and was ``directed to have no further
contact with the youth in the program.'' Maag offered to take a
leave of absence, but Watts wrote that the board refused because
the ``program could not be without his services.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed, as one prosecutor acknowledged, is ``Megan's
Law'' in reverse _ a series of official decisions that shielded the
charges against Maag from the public and eventually caused the
allegations, his conviction, the sentence and any reference to the
incident to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   While the purpose of closed hearings in juvenile court is to
protect children, Allen County Prosecutor David Bowers said there
was an unintended result in this case: For the public, it ``never
did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he couldn't talk about a case that had been expunged
but recalled Maag's hearing because the agency president has a
``high-profile name'' in Allen County.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon said a Logan County caseworker found the girl's report of
abuse to be credible and was prepared to testify on her behalf. But
the day of the hearing, she received a phone call saying the
caseworker's testimony wasn't needed because Maag had pleaded
guilty to one charge.
</P>
<P>
   Maag's sentence remains a secret, but when he stepped out of the
courtroom in May 1987 following his conviction, he was still firmly
in charge of SAFY.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mansfield, SAFY attorney and the agency's executive vice
president of operations, said as president and CEO Maag has no
day-to-day contact with children. ``He is layers away from
children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said he didn't know about the case, but it is legally
a non-event because the records have been sealed. ``It's been
expunged. I can't tell you a thing about it.''

COMMENTARY: ISN'T THAT INTERESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan calls Ross Perot to tell him he is bolting from the
Republican Party and going for the Reform Party nomination:
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN: Ross, my friend, the Buchanan brigades are going to
charge up your hill. Mount up, everybody! Grab your pitchforks! I
am not going to let that little girl, Katie Couric, and all those
simpering liberals and the Israeli lobby and blood-sucking
Manhattan Money People like Rubin and Goldman and Sachs intimidate
me. Pat Buchanan is not an anti-Semite. For heaven's sake, some of
my best co-hosts are Jewish folks. I've done 2,000 ``Crossfires''
with Michael Kinsley!
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan is not a hater or a bigot. But, Ross, as of 1939,
World War II WAS avoidable. Hitler was a man of great intuition and
courage, a soldier's soldier. If we had just ignored Adolf, he was
going East, not West. Poland was a goner anyway. And do we really
care if all those godless Communists in Russia ended up eating
Wiener schnitzel and driving Volkswagens? Plus, we'd have been
spared those sappy Normandy and Auschwitz movies by Spielberg and
the Hollywood Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   PEROT: Well, isn't that interesting. Let's see if the dogs eat
the dog food. If I came to you today, my friend, and said I have a
brand new screwdriver I'd like you to invest in, how can you be
sure the plastic handle won't break off the shaft? Did you know
that the Vietnamese in 1969 sent a team of five Black Panthers to
kill me? My dog chased them off faster than a Domino's pizza.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not about me. This is about our country. It's time
to take out the trash and clean out the stable. I used to think you
were a belligerent loudmouth, Pat Buchanan, jawing about building a
wall between us and ``Jose.'' I said to myself, ``This is some
beltway TV sissy that probably has trouble buying cat food, he's so
inexperienced.''
</P>
<P>
   I mean, it was sad, you and that look-alike sister of yours
running around pretending you had a campaign when you were just
chewing on the other candidates' cat or rabbit. But then I did some
background and credit checks on you, and I learned we have a lot in
common. We both love acting militaristically, but we were too
delicate for the military. You got out of Vietnam with a bad knee
even though you jog, and I pulled strings to try for an early
discharge from the Navy because the promiscuity and drinking upset
me.
</P>
<P>
   We are both lovable populist demagogues who want to revive a
Norman Rockwell world. We live by paranoia, paternalism,
protectionism, taking votes away from Bush fellas, and outflanking
Jesse Ventura. People say the only thing I should run for is the
insane asylum. But Jesse's the nutcake, the crazy aunt in fringe
and boas you keep down in the basement. Does he think I'd let a
wrestler who has gone to bawdy houses steal my party that I paid
for with my own money? If I live to be as old as Noah _ and he was
400 when the flood came _ I'll never let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN: Ross, my friend, we must put America First. We must
honor our boys in the battlefields of Cold Harbor, Antietam and
Gettysburg, and save this once-Christian country that has been
force-fed the poisons of paganism. We must stop the Bush
conspiracy, the reign of Skull &AMP; Bones International, the One
World-New World Order-Wall Street-Trilateral Commission cabal of
Communists, financiers and plutocrats. W. is the bellhop of the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   PEROT: Isn't that interesting. Did you know that the Bushes
plotted with the Bilderbergers to disrupt my daughter's wedding?
Did you know a secret team of ex-military men and CIA officials is
seeking control of the government?
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN: That Lenora Fulani is a nice lady. I hope she doesn't
bellyache just because I love the Confederate flag and ``Dixie'' a
heck of a lot more than I care for bongo drums.
</P>
<P>
   PEROT: Now, isn't that interesting. Jesse's pushing Donald
Trump. Trump says he's the most popular guest on Larry King. But
Larry will tell you that there's only one world-class guest who
jams the CNN switchboards _ yours truly. Joe Friday, just the
facts, ma'am. Let me say flat out: Trump is in this for himself. An
eccentric, egotistical billionaire who wants to get more attention
by running for president. That is just sad. God help the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that 59 percent of the people with flying saucer
experiences voted for me for president?
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN: Isn't that interesting.

 &HT;    Carter `still climbing mountains'
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The famous face carries the weight of 75 years of
victory and defeat. The skin laps loose over his collar. The eyes
have a slightly milky cast.
</P>
<P>
   But his vigor speaks of a much younger man. He remains
remarkably fit and compulsively active, still a figure on the world
stage, his stamina, energy and intellect apparently undiminished by
the passing of the years. And when he smiles the famous grin, the
years fall way and he looks much as he did when he was president of
the United States 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, who was 52 when he was inaugurated in 1977, will
turn 75 on Friday. Friends and supporters will celebrate the
occasion in Americus with performances by entertainers as disparate
as Pat Boone and the Indigo Girls.
</P>
<P>
   He remains a vigorous man, rising every day at 5 a.m.,
exercising daily, overseeing the Carter Center, hand-crafting a
crib for his newest grandchild, fly fishing, writing two books,
climbing mountains, and monitoring elections around the world _
including, this year, those in Nigeria and Indonesia and one still
to come in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   He remains, said Rosalynn Carter, his wife of 53 years, what he
has always been _ a man constitutionally unable to sit still and do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there's a difference.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Carter was known for his sharp tongue and
occasional iciness. Now he seems downright amiable. He appears more
comfortable, less driven. He knows full well that the last few
grains of sand are sliding through the hourglass, and that his
robust health could desert him at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said in an interview, he does not grieve that his time
is running out. He has no fear of death. And this, he said, is the
happiest time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are free to choose what items on our menu we want to
adopt,'' he said. ``We are kind of the matriarch and patriarch of
our family. We hold our family together _ there are about 20 of us;
we have 10 grandchildren. We are secure in Plains, which is still a
tiny little town, 712 people. We have the land that belonged to our
ancestors since the Indians left, you might say. We are deeply
committed to our church there.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said his work, which remains the focus of his life, is
exciting, challenging, unpredictable and gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   There may be another reason for the change, as well. Carter's
achievements in the years since voters evicted him from the White
House have eased the pain of his 1980 loss to Ronald Reagan.
Historian Douglas Brinkley, who is writing a three-volume biography
of Carter, said the former president seems at last to be
comfortable with the Jimmy Carter life story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a complete and total reconciliation for Jimmy
Carter,'' Brinkley said. ``He is totally at peace with everything
he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's career as a former president has lasted almost 19
years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the Georgia
state Senate and his expulsion from the White House. He has
compiled a record that Brinkley considers the finest of any
ex-president, equaled perhaps only by that of John Quincy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has contributed to the near global eradication of Guinea
worm disease, a centuries-old affliction. His high-profile,
high-stakes diplomatic missions produced a cease-fire in Bosnia,
stopped a U.S. invasion of Haiti and may have averted a war in
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   His condemnation of fraudulent elections, and his support of
honest ones, has earned him adulation throughout Latin America and
Africa. Brinkley estimates that, by interceding privately with
world leaders, Carter had been directly responsible for the release
of about 50,000 political prisoners. And in August, Carter and his
wife were each awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere in the mad rush of his ex-presidency, he lost this
striver's impulse, which was a big part of him,'' Brinkley said.
``I think you are getting a more mellow, kind-hearted Jimmy Carter
as he gets older.''
</P>
<P>
   For Carter, however, mellow does not mean inactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're at home, if he's not writing a book or doing
something, he's miserable,'' Rosalynn said. ``He can't do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   His apparent vigor, say those who know him, is no illusion. A
lifetime of healthy foods, a rigorous determination to maintain his
ideal weight, and a disciplined devotion to daily exercise have
paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was up here fishing for three days, I had to collapse
for a day, 'cause I couldn't do it,'' said media mogul Ted Turner,
who invites the Carters to his ranch in Montana every year. ``And
I'm only 60.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Carters are on the road, they run virtually every
morning. They recently ran about four miles through the streets of
New York, for example, before settling down to watch the U.S. Open.
When they are home in Plains, they ride bicycles or play two full
sets of tennis _ often, Carter said, going to a tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're still climbing mountains, downhill skiing, fly
fishing, riding, tennis _ we just have a good time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he feels no different than he did when he was 50,
but he has made some concessions to age. He rarely runs more than 4
1/2 miles, compared with the six or seven miles a day he ran while
he was president.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``Now I run at Rosalynn's pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carters do everything together _ whether traveling overseas,
working at the Carter Center, taking vacations or exercising.
``Everything that I mentioned to you we do side by side,'' Carter
said. ``It gives us a chance to spend some nice moments with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is grounded not only in a marriage gone right, but in his
hometown, a place where people have known him all his life. He
lives in the same house he and Rosalynn moved into in 1961. He
teaches Sunday school every week he is in town _ 35 or 40 times a
year _ just as he always did. Every fifth Saturday, he mows the
church lawn and trims the shrubbery. Every sixth Saturday, Rosalynn
vacuums the church and cleans the toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do our share without any fanfare, just as part of the
community,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of things, but we always go home,'' Rosalynn
said. ``And that's one thing that's so good because .. when there
were things that went wrong, or things that you would like to have
had happen a different way, or we got a lot of criticisms, you knew
that everybody back home was pulling for you. It makes a big
difference, to have a base like that with a lot of family.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter goes home, but he doesn't sit still. He searches for
challenges and attacks them with gusto. Before he wrote a book of
poetry, he asked professors at Emory University to assign him
reading material as they would any student. He mastered the
material, and his book was a success.
</P>
<P>
   He studied books on winemaking, then began making his own wine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of the new books he is writing will be his first novel.
Again he has sought reading assignments from professors at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies it, intensely, and sometimes for months and
months,'' Rosalynn said, ``and then begins to write.''
</P>
<P>
   You never know what he will do, said Emily Dolvin, Carter's
aunt. ``I wouldn't be surprised if he would do things like taking
up the piano and doing a piano recital.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of the former president's work now appears aimed at
consolidating the accomplishments he cares about. The novel, set in
Georgia during the final years of the Revolutionary War, is based
on genealogical research into Carter's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to keep the family history alive,'' Brinkley said.
``He's trying to find what's in the attic. His interest in the
family genealogy is intense.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries to act as an example to his grandchildren. Carter's
mother and all three of his siblings have died since he left the
White House, so Carter, seeing himself as the patriarch, works to
hold the family together. Every year, he and his wife take their
children, grandchildren and any very significant others _ usually
about 20 or 21 people, all told _ on a New Year's trip. This year,
the destination is a ranch in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The work at the Carter Center still consumes its namesake. The
Carters try to limit their time in Atlanta to one week a month,
during which time they live in a small apartment inside the center
and cram every moment of their time with appointments. But often
they find themselves spending more time at the center than that.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is still clearly engaged in his work. Just as when he was
president, he seems able to discuss the intricacies of virtually
any conflict in the world. He was criticized as president for
focusing too much on minutiae, but he remains a font of names,
dates, facts and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably don't want me to quote statistics,'' he said in
an interview _ and then did. He leaned forward eagerly as he
described different facets of his work, sometimes apologizing for
answering questions at too great a length. ``As you can see, my
heart's in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his major projects is ensuring that the Carter Center
will continue to be a vital force after he and his wife are no
longer able to work. He is trying to increase the center's
endowment from $100 million to $250 million to keep the center
healthy after it loses his and his wife's fund-raising prowess. And
he is working to identify ``distinguished persons'' _ perhaps
former Cabinet officers, senators or university presidents _ who
might ensure that the center retains access to world leaders after
he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, Rosalynn said, her husband will say,
``Look at that beautiful sunset. It might not be long before I
won't see sunsets.''
</P>
<P>
   He's only joking, she said, never serious. It's true, though,
she said, that he approaches death without fear. ``He just believes
that there's life after death and it's going to be good, I guess,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter's son Jack, who works in financial services in
Bermuda, doubts that his father will be going anywhere soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad's got this irritating ability to undertake this enormous
amount of pain and effort as long as there's someone along who
enjoys it less,'' Jack Carter said. ``I think for that reason,
he'll probably live a long time.''

 &HT;    Carter: U.S. has become `the stingiest nation in the world'
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jimmy Carter, on the verge of his 75th birthday, has
been peering into the 21st century and he doesn't much like what he
sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem that the world faces in the next
millennium is already apparent to us here at the Carter Center,''
the former president said in an interview, ``and that is the
growing chasm between the rich people on Earth and the poor people
on Earth. And that chasm is increasing every year. And the trends
seem to be, so far, irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who will turn 75 on Friday, said the United States,
which he wishes were leading the fight against poverty and hunger
around the globe, is not doing its part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it has become ``the stingiest nation in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing gulf between the haves and have-nots carries
dangerous ramifications in a globalized world where people know
what's going on in other places, Carter said. It fosters civil
wars, which engender totalitarian reactions, which lead to even
greater disparities in wealth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the United States is dragged into those conflicts, as
it was in Somalia in 1993. Other times, the nation looks the other
way, as it did in 1994, when more than half a million people were
slaughtered in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, people living in the 10 richest countries in the world
made nine times as much money as those living in the 10 poorest
countries, Carter said. By 1960, they earned 30 times as much. Now,
he said, the ratio is 65 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, every time an American makes $65, someone in Ethiopia
makes $1,'' Carter said. ``And out of that, they have the need to
buy the same food and clothing and medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who became known during his administration
for his support of human rights, has spent much of the nearly 19
years since he left office founding and leading the Carter Center.
The nonprofit organization works to increase agricultural
production and eradicate diseases in the world's poorest countries,
and to monitor elections and strengthen newborn democracies.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of work he wishes the government he once headed
would support on a global scale. But he is dismayed that the U.S.
government's ``benevolent assistance for the world's suffering
people'' is decreasing every year. ``We've seen a great
embarrassment, for me, in the United States becoming the stingiest
nation in the world,'' Carter said. ``Compared to our gross
national product, we give less than any other (developed) nation in
the world. On a per capita basis, we're at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. spending on international affairs, when adjusted for
inflation, has been declining steadily since 1980, the last year of
Carter's administration, according to an article published this
month by Robert Borosage, director of the Campaign for America's
Future, a liberal think tank. From 1992 through 1998, Borosage
wrote, funding for international programs dropped an average of
about 6 percent annually. Under possible balanced budget
agreements, he reported, it is slated to be cut another 13 percent
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Carter noted that a large portion of U.S. foreign aid goes to
countries with which we have special relationships or strategic
interests _ such as Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, Greece and
Russia. Many countries, he said, direct the bulk of their foreign
aid to the most needy nations in the world, such as Liberia, Sierra
Leone and others.
</P>
<P>
   The political climate in the United States is such that the
phrase ``foreign aid'' has become an epithet, and anyone who ran
for Congress promising to increase foreign aid would be defeated,
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   And now that it is freed from the need to compete with the
Soviet Union for the affection of Third World countries, America
has become more ``arrogant,'' he said. U.S. aid is important
because many countries around the world need help making themselves
stable, he said. Often, decolonization has left them in the hands
of former revolutionaries with little experience in governing.
Those governments, Carter said, often do not have the internal
respect and legitimacy they might enjoy had their electoral
institutions been in place for 50 years or so. The Carter Center
has worked to nurture fragile democracies, but Carter said U.S.
government support for democracy around the world needs to be much
greater.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true with world hunger. The Carter Center works in
more than a dozen countries to fight hunger by teaching small
farmers to double or even quadruple their crop yields and to grow
more nutritious grain. Carter, who once hoped that hunger would be
eliminated in his lifetime, now acknowledges that it will not
happen. But he holds out hope that it can soon be dramatically
reduced. That prospect, he said, would be increased if a major
corporation would make a commitment to introduce high-yield seed
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains discouraged by America's lack of global
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like to see the United States, the only
remaining superpower, become known as the world's foremost champion
of peace, rather than as a country that is ``so ready to send
troops to bomb people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see our nation become the champion of human
rights and freedom and democracy,'' he said. ``Whenever a nation
has an opportunity to move toward an honest election, I would like
to see the United States providing the strongest possible support.
... I'd like to see us become the champion of all these things so
that the people in these poorest nations can say, `I not only
admire America because it's rich, and because the people live an
exotic life, but because the United States is interested in helping
us solve our own problems.' That hasn't happened.''

   NORTH CAROLINA FLOODING
</P>
<P>
   FLOODWOES _ North Carolina is the nation's largest producer of
turkeys, second-largest producer of hogs and third-largest producer
of chickens in the United States. That adds up to a recipe for
disaster with Hurricane Floyd's flooding overflowing animal waste
holding tanks throughout the eastern third of the state.
Environmentalists, of course, are saying ``I told you so,'' as
farmers and agribusiness officials try to contain the problem. And
state and federal health officials are monitoring the situation,
advising most people in that area of the state to boil their water
before using. Will this lead to any change in regulation of
livestock and poultry industries. (Seabrook, Atlanta

   RECYCLE _ WASHINGTON _ Complaints by environmentalists that the

raises questions about the economic validity of recycling. When
homeowners carefully separate their plastics, glass, paper and cans
to be recycled, are they helping establish what could eventually
become a truly self-supporting industry of frugality, or are they
merely going through a useless mandated exercise that costs
everybody time and money with little gain? (Nesmith, Cox News

pricey new sets needed to enjoy a digital picture. To surmount the
classic chicken-and-egg dilemma which has stalled adoption,
Mitsubishi is teaming up with CBS to underwrite the conversion of
most of the network's fall evening schedule to high definition
television. Still another set-maker, Panasonic, offers similar
subsidies for ABC's Monday Night Football. A deep look at the

of their own neighbors and fearful that their apartment building
could be the next target. Perhaps not since the dismantling of the
Soviet Union in 1991 have Russians felt so strongly, and vocally,
about anything. Reports of rampant corruption bring a shrug and a
yawn. Russians have become all too accustomed to expect the worst
of their officials, from the ubiquitous streetcorner cop who
demands bribes from passing motorists to the bandit capitalists who
have pumped billions of dollars out of Russia and into Western
banks. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 30

no'' GM ingredients. Now pubs and other restaurants must disclose
whether their fare contains ``Frankenstein'' food. All this even
though there is no genetically modified food grown in Britain, and
the only exposure Britons have is when they consume a few products
from the United States, where people have long been accustomed to
the presence of GM food. What gives here, and what are the

COMMENTARY: LITTLE BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer I visited Chicago and stayed at a large chain hotel.
In the morning I went down to swim in the pool, and I put my room
key in my bathing suit pocket. I then proceeded to lose the key in
the pool. So I went back to the front desk and asked for a new key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you show me a picture ID?'' asked the desk clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said. ``I'm in my bathing suit! I have no ID.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' said the clerk. She typed a few things into her
computer, and then looked up at me and asked, ``What are the ages
of your two daughters?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughters weren't with me. But I had stayed in this hotel a
year earlier with them. I correctly answered the clerk's question
about their ages and she handed me a new key. But I couldn't help
wondering: What else do they have on me and my family in that
little computer, and whom are they selling that info to?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I got a letter from an old friend, Richard Day, whom
I met in Beirut in 1982 but had lost contact with. Richard, a
consultant, now lives in Dubai and his letter said the following:
``I found your address on a People Search site on the Internet. I
was amazed that for a mere $59 I could order a complete background
search on you that included, among other things, a complete listing
of your assets. I kept my $59, but it made me wonder what all of
this is really coming to. Your daughters and my sons can check each
other out in ways that you and I never dreamed were possible.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's just the beginning. Rule No. 1 of the Internet is this:
We are all connected, but nobody's in charge. That is, the Internet
is Orwellian in its reach, but there's no Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Big Brother, there are a lot of Little Brothers.
Beware of the Little Brothers. They are going to be the problem.
The Internet super-empowers individuals, Web sites, corporations
and even hotels _ the Little Brothers _ so they can amass huge
amounts of information outside of any government supervision. Some
of these Little Brothers will use that personal data responsibly;
others won't.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Center for Democracy and Technology found that
less than 10 percent of all Web sites respected the OECD's privacy
guidelines, which stipulate that people have the right to expect
that any personal data they submit over the Internet will not be
used without their consent, that they have a right to correct any
errors and to assume the data will be protected from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   How we deal with the Little Brothers should be a campaign issue.
There are lots of ideas. One of the most thoughtful comes from
Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, in his upcoming book,
``Code, and Other Laws of Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig argues that people suffer from the illusion that however
cyberspace is right now is how it must always be. It can't be
changed. It's a place to be discovered, not shaped. But cyberspace
was not handed down by God.
</P>
<P>
   Its architecture is shaped by people with certain interests, who
are, as we speak, ``designing the hardware of cyberspace in ways
that are determining the freedom and privacy that you and I will
have there,'' says Lessig.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of cyberspace is highly influenced by commerce
and government, ``both of which have an interest in knowing as much
as they can about what people are doing and where,'' says Lessig.
``So it's not an accident that the emerging Internet architecture
makes it easier to track people and collect private data, because
tracking people is what governments like and collecting private
data is what commerce likes.''
</P>
<P>
   Government, argues Lessig, can't legislate privacy on the
Internet, but it can create incentives for people to build privacy
filters and other safeguards into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the government says that data about you is your
property and the only way that someone can take it away is by
negotiating with you,'' he said. ``That would create an incentive
for Web designers to make it easier for each of us to negotiate
about our personal data _ what we want to give up for free, what we
want to be paid for and what we don't want to give up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know that Lessig has the right answer, but I am certain
he's asking the right question: How do we get better governance in
cyberspace, when there is no government in control there?
</P>
<P>
   Issues such as the right to privacy are core values from our
Constitution and Founding Fathers. Are we moving into an age when
such values will only be respected on land, but not in cyberspace?
If the Constitution ends where the Web begins, well, beware of
Little Brother.

   Dry and warm conditions will cover the Middle Atlantic and
Northeastern states Sunday as a large high pressure system moves
over New England. After a cool start with patchy fog, abundant
sunshine will help boost temperatures to above seasonal levels
across the region. Indeed, readings will eclipse 80 degrees from
southern Michigan to Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of showers and thunderstorms will cover the Florida
peninsula and the Southeast coast as breezes from the east and
southeast direct copious Atlantic moisture into the region. A few
of the showers will be heavy, which may lead to flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, a slow-moving jet stream disturbance will spawn
numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms across the lower
Mississippi Valley and over far eastern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn very mild with sunshine over the western Great
Lakes. Clouds will increase during the afternoon, however, as a
cold front approaches from the west. Showers and thunderstorms will
accompany the front as it progresses eastward through the Middle
West and central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk breezes from the north and west will direct much cooler
air into the northern Plains and eastern Rockies on Sunday. Daytime
readings will be between 10 degrees and 20 degrees below seasonal
values. Meanwhile, abundant sun and offshore breezes will bring
unseasonable warmth to the California coast and the interior
Southwest. Cool conditions will persist over the Northwest, though
it will be a bit milder in southern Oregon.

<P>
   FOCUS: THE TYPHOON CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   Typhoon Bart, which lashed Japan on Friday, seemed distant, but
the storm is about to contribute to a change in the weather over
North America. Weather systems around the globe are connected by a
serpentine high-level wind pattern called the jet stream. The jet
stream is the conduit for the exchange of heat between north and
south. When a strong typhoon leaves the tropics of the western
Pacific it infuses the jet stream with energy. Typically, several
days after a typhoon reaches the middle latitudes of the west
Pacific, eastern North America turns much cooler.

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ ``They call me boring,'' says the
mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la Rua, in the opening of his
presidential campaign's signature television commercial. The spot
then cuts to some more exciting personalities: first, President
Carlos Saul Menem posing in a flashy Ferrari, and then an actor who
it implies is a political ally of Menem pocketing bribe money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to end this party,'' de la Rua promises. ``Those who
are bored with me are on their way out.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua takes every opportunity to contrast himself with Menem
and to tie his principal opponent, the Buenos Aires governor,
Eduardo Duhalde, to the departing president and his glitzy style of
politics. De la Rua's campaign offers few detailed proposals beyond
the promise of a more sober future, but the blandness appears to be
a winning message at a time of mounting government scandals, street
crime and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   With just a month until the Oct. 24 vote, de la Rua has a gaping
lead in the polls over Duhalde, and there is virtually no Argentine
political analyst who has not already declared him and his
center-left Alianza opposition coalition the winner over the
governing Justicialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already talk like a president,'' a radio talk-show host
told de la Rua during a recent interview in the city of Cordoba.
The 62-year-old mayor replied matter-of-factly, ``I'm convinced I
will win.'' Then he made the rather modest promise of selling Tango
01, Menem's Boeing 757 presidential jet, and flying on commercial
airliners whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to project austerity,'' de la Rua concluded. ``And the
first person who needs to tighten his belt is the president.''
</P>
<P>
   As de la Rua left the radio studio, Agostina Toranzo, a
74-year-old retired seamstress, lunged at him and threw her arms
around him. ``Finally an honest man!'' she cried. ``Finally an
honest man!''
</P>
<P>
   Austerity seems to come naturally to de la Rua, a dour man of
few words who appears uneasy kissing strangers or even exchanging
small talk on the campaign trail. His nickname, ``chupete,'' or
pacifier, originated from the teasing he got as a child for his
bulbous nose, but now it has come to be the proud moniker for his
bland personality. His campaign van, known as the chupete-mobile,
is undecorated save for a single photograph beside a couch of a
statue of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really a university professor more than a politician,''
said de la Rua during an interview in the chupete-mobile driving
across sprawling cattle ranches in central Cordoba province. ``I do
serious things and I do them seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as president he would work to bring down the
government deficit by cutting waste and graft, and increase tax
receipts by prosecuting evaders. Such policies, he said, would
increase the confidence of foreign investors and lower interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he added, ``my obsession is creating jobs,'' pledging
to bring down the 14.5 percent unemployment rate by subsidizing
debt interest payments of small and medium-sized businesses so they
can employ more people.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out the door of the chupete-mobile to speak to a throng
of ranchers in the town of Sacanta, de la Rua bellowed into a
microphone, ``We're here to create a distinct Argentina, one where
a worker feels secure at his job and feels secure walking the
streets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But while de la Rua promises change, he also promises
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   He promises not to devalue the peso, or otherwise touch an
8-year-old policy put in place by Menem of pegging the peso
one-to-one with the dollar. And with the Justicialists certain to
control the Senate, the Supreme Court and most of the gubernatorial
offices for years to come, it is doubtful whether de la Rua will
put many officials of the current government in prison or do
anything else very spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people want a change of government but not a fundamental
change in policies,'' said Manuel Mora y Araujo, an independent
political consultant who made public a poll recently showing de la
Rua leading Duhalde by 19 percentage points. ``De la Rua is saying
`Have confidence in me,' and that's what people want _
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's political career is one of unspectacular
accomplishment but steadiness. He has written five books on legal
procedures, and as a longtime member of Congress sponsored
legislation to increase Indian rights and fight discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of Buenos Aires, he extended the subway, provided
shelters and services for battered women and the handicapped, and
brought a gaping city fiscal deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
   As for outside interests, he said in the interview, ``I
recognize that I am not No. 1 in soccer, chess or golf, but I enjoy
them all.'' He is said to dance a decent tango, but his aides say
Argentines can be sure that, unlike Menem, he will not dance cheek
to cheek with starlets in low-cut dresses on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentines want to leave behind the Ferrari driver who drives
to Mar del Plata at 125 miles per hour, avoiding fines and not
paying tolls,'' said Sen. Carlos Alvarez, de la Rua's vice
presidential running mate, referring to a famous stunt by Menem a
few years ago. ``They now want a driver who drives a standard car
with his family, obeys the speed limits and pays the tolls just
like everyone else.''

   How can Australia intervene in East Timor, even with the
reluctant acquiescence of the Indonesian government, and still
maintain friendly relations with Indonesia, its closest Asian
neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   How much can Australia still depend on the United States, its
big brother ally of the last 50 years, having seen Washington send
only a token force to help out in East Timor?
</P>
<P>
   And now that Washington has deputized it to do the neighborhood
policing job, does Australia have the political and financial
wherewithal to follow through on its own?
</P>
<P>
   For Australia, which has an army of only 24,000 soldiers _ about
the same number the Indonesian army had in East Timor alone _ these
are milestone questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Australia sent soldiers to the battlefields of World War
II, to Korea and Vietnam and lately to the Persian Gulf War. But
those soldiers were dispatched with alacrity, with everyone
understanding that the post-1945 commitments were an investment in
an alliance that the United States was leading. This time,
Australia is carrying the big burden.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1970s, when Australia lifted a so-called White
Australia policy that had strictly limited Asian immigration,
successive governments have tried to position Australia to be with
Asia rather than against it, if always under the umbrella of U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Australia cozied up to Indonesia, the world's
fourth most populous nation and its closest neighbor. In 1975, it
ignored the East Timor independence movement and instead endorsed
the Indonesian takeover of the territory after the Portuguese
colonial government left. That made Australia the only country to
formally recognize the invasion, although the United States, which
also favored Indonesia's anti-communist government, did not object.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the idea of building its own strategic solidarity
with Indonesia, the Australian government went on to help train the
Indonesian army, including _ to its current embarrassment _ some of
its feared security forces. In 1995, Australia thought it was
cementing its ties by signing a defense treaty with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem with the East Timor policy all along,
and it became apparent as complaints of Indonesian brutality there
persisted. Australians, who tend to sympathize with underdogs
anyway, have long had a special sympathy for the East Timorese, who
in World War II helped Australian soldiers trapped in Timor's
mountains during the fight against the Japanese. Moreover, the East
Timorese, most of whom are Roman Catholic, have forged strong bonds
with the Catholic Church in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   So after Indonesia's longtime dictator, Suharto, was forced from
office by popular upheaval last year, Australia's conservative
prime minister, John Howard, wrote to the new Indonesian leader,
B.J. Habibie, and suggested that Indonesia sponsor a referendum for
East Timor's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard government was surprised when Habibie went a step
further and decided to hold a referendum for independence, which
many in the West, including the Australian Defense Ministry,
believed would lead to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Australians and the United States held their breaths and
hoped for the best, even when the Indonesians refused to accept a
peacekeeping force in East Timor during the preparations for the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the referendum produced a landslide for
independence, the Australian government was taken aback by the
killings of civilians and the scorched earth tactics of the
Indonesian army and militias.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Australians decided to get tough, they were also
taken aback by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Australia could not stand by as East Timor burned,
and he said U.S. troops should operate alongside Australians in
East Timor. What he heard in response was sobering. ``If you
thought the Pentagon was not keen to go to Kosovo, you should have
seen their reaction to going to East Timor,'' said one Australian
official.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. national security adviser, Sandy Berger, went so far as
to point out publicly that the United States had fought in Kosovo
because it was in Europe ``I think we have to recognize that
Indonesia is in Asia,'' he said. So Washington has committed just
200 troops for the operation, most of them for logistics, and only
100 for East Timor itself. It was hardly the commitment Australia
had in mind.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ For more than two decades, Australia has
been trying to promote itself as part of Asia. Now, in East Timor,
it has found out how unnerving that concept can be when put to the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Having led the charge to intervene and having taken command of
the international peace keeping force in East Timor, this
easy-going, underpopulated, high-living country is having to ponder
the cost. Three questions seem to be on everyone's mind:
</P>
<P>
   How can Australia intervene in East Timor, even with the
reluctant acquiescence of the Indonesian government, and still
maintain friendly relations with Indonesia, its closest Asian
neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   How much can Australia still depend on the United States, its
big brother ally of the last 50 years, having seen Washington send
only a token force to help out in East Timor?
</P>
<P>
   And now that Washington has deputized it to do the neighborhood
policing job, does Australia have the political and financial
wherewithal to follow through on its own?
</P>
<P>
   For Australia, which has an army of only 24,000 soldiers _ about
the same number the Indonesian army had in East Timor alone _ these
are milestone questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Australia sent soldiers to the battlefields of World War
II, to Korea and Vietnam and lately to the Persian Gulf War. But
those soldiers were dispatched with alacrity, with everyone
understanding that the post-1945 commitments were an investment in
an alliance that the United States was leading. This time,
Australia is carrying the big burden.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1970s, when Australia lifted a so-called White
Australia policy that had strictly limited Asian immigration,
successive governments have tried to position Australia to be with
Asia rather than against it, if always under the umbrella of U.S.
security.

100 for East Timor itself. It was hardly the commitment Australia

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   An optimist might find a good side to this. Australia won points
in Washington because it was setting a precedent that was
comfortable for the Americans: It was leading a regional
peacekeeping force, sent in harmony with U.S. policy, that did not
require the use of U.S. muscle itself. That contrasts with the
reluctance of Britain and France to commit troops to Balkan
peacekeeping operations unless Americans were alongside on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the Europeans, who were reluctant to go into Kosovo,
the Australians showed themselves to be adults and to take part in
adult supervision,'' said Douglas Paal, a member of the Bush
administration's National Security Council who now heads the Asia
Pacific Policy Center, a Washington research institute. ``The
Australians were not waiting for Uncle Sam. That's the kind of
alliance partners we want.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Australian point of view, such praise was small
consolation, and the slow and small response of the United States
felt more like a coming-of-age lesson. After World War II,
Australians turned away from Britain and toward the United States
as their new natural ally in the Pacific. Washington put defense
and intelligence installations in Australia and the two countries
exchanged sensitive information freely. The conventional wisdom
here was that similar values of democracy, free enterprise and a
sunny optimism bonded the Australians and the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they do. But now Australians have been told, in
effect, that the bond is not a free one. With defense spending at
the equivalent of less than $10 billion _ only 1.8 percent of the
gross domestic product _ the commitment to East Timor of 2,000
soldiers _ to rise to 4,500 in coming weeks _ is more than the
current military budget can bear, Australia's preeminent defense
analyst, Paul Dibbs, said. Last week, Australia started to call up
reservists.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest cost of the East Timor commitment for Australia
will likely be its long-fostered relationship with Indonesia. It is
now in tatters. During the recent crisis, Habibie refused to take a
telephone call from Howard, and last week the Indonesian government
scrapped the defense treaty. Australian businesses have become
targets for vandals in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   As for the relationship with Washington, the ties will no doubt
endure, but not with the same open-hearted enthusiasm from Down
Under. Max Walsh, the editor in chief of The Bulletin, a weekly
news magazine in Australia, wrote last week: ``Timor has changed
our world.''

<P>
   Patricia Duff knows what a 4-year-old girl needs to live a
``moderately luxurious'' life on a ``rough parity with an Upper
East Side family'' _ about $4,400 a day. That covers lodging in a
$5 million 10-room apartment on the Upper East side and a house in
the Hamptons, $2,500 worth of ``prints'' for her closet and $1,450
a month for dining out.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of New Yorkers disgusted by the spectacle and to
the dismay of New Yorkers dazzled by tales of fairy-tale opulence,
the child support battle between Ms. Duff, a multi-millionaire
Democratic fund-raiser, and her ex-husband, the billionaire Revlon
chairman Ronald O. Perelman, concluded last week in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Now Justice Franklin R. Weissberg, a man who brings bag lunches
to court, will decide whether to grant Ms. Duff's request for $1.6
million a year in child support. It is by far the largest request
ever made in New York, and probably the country. ``That is off the
Richter scale of any state I know of,'' said Michael McCurley, a
Dallas lawyer who is president of the American Academy of
Matrimonial Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 the New York Legislature established guidelines for
setting child support that used a formula and other criteria to
create uniformity and make sure that the children of divorced
parents don't suffer financially, particularly among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines have encouraged settlements and discouraged ugly
courtroom brawls like the Duff-Perelman scrum, which so far has
generated over $3 million in legal fees. After Weissberg decides
the child support issue, another state Supreme Court justice will
decide which parent gets full or partial custody of their daughter,
Caleigh.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, expected this fall, Weissberg must decide how
to apply guidelines for ordinary incomes to extraordinary amounts.
``Believe me, when the statute was put together it didn't
contemplate a billionaire,'' said Susan Bender, a Manhattan divorce
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, 17 percent of pretax parental income is to
be paid in support for one child. Twenty-five percent is paid for
two. Weissberg can also order Perelman to pay for additional items
like private school, tutors and art lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce lawyers say that no matter what the parents' wealth, New
York judges have generally awarded no more than $56,000 a year (17
percent of $300,000 in annual income) in support for a single
child.
</P>
<P>
   But Perelman, with an estimated worth of $3.8 billion and an
annual income of $40 million, is far from your run-of-the-mill ex.
The secretive corporate mogul is one of New York's richest men, and
his taste for the good life is said to be rivaled only by that of
Ms. Duff.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Emery, the 21st lawyer to represent Ms. Duff, cited
past rulings that held that a child should not have to pass between
two parental homes where one parent's lifestyle is far more
luxurious than the other's. He said for psychological and other
reasons Caleigh should also not have to live worse off than her
sister Samantha, Perelman's daughter from an earlier marriage.
(Samantha's mother, Claudia Cohen, received an $80 million
out-of-court settlement after her 1994 divorce.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about creating a psychologically sound world
for a child, then those disparities should be eliminated,'' Emery
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But divorce lawyers said those rulings surely didn't have Ms.
Duff and Perelman in mind. ``Like the kid is supposed to have five
houses around the world like her father,'' said William C. Herman,
a Manhattan divorce lawyer. ``Not going to happen. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the ultra-rich, Ms. Duff's divorce settlement
seems relatively modest. In a move that might be expected from a
corporate raider, Perelman had Ms. Duff sign a pre-nuptial
agreement before their two-year marriage began in 1996. Emery
insisted that the requested child support was intended for Caleigh
alone and not to supplement what Ms. Duff receives herself.
</P>
<P>
   Several divorce settlements in New York involved wives receiving
$50 million to $100 million, and McCurley said he once negotiated a
$1 billion settlement. In her divorce settlement, Ms. Duff received
$21 million and $1.2 million in annual alimony. ``You hate to sound
tacky about $20 million,'' McCurley said. ``But that's a drop in
the bucket compared to $4 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some divorce lawyers say Ms. Duff will be lucky to get the
$144,000 a year she currently receives in temporary child support.
With judges generally ruling that child support is not to be used
as way to redistribute wealth, Weissberg is unlikely to change
precedent by granting Ms. Duff her version of ``rough parity with
an Upper East Side family,'' the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child support is not meant to be anything more than child
support,'' McCurley said.

TURKISH LEADER PLANS CLINTON TALKS, WITH GREECE ON AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With Greece and Turkey suddenly seeming ready
to end generations of hostility, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of
Turkey is due in Washington on Sunday for talks this week with
President Clinton and congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to raise a series of issues with his guest,
ranging from trade to human rights. But the prospect of finally
bringing peace to the volatile eastern Mediterranean will be at the
top of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit was prime minister when Turkey sent troops to Cyprus in
1974, and since then he has been a hero to nationalists. Now back
in power at 74, he may be in a position to lead his country toward
friendship with Greece and possibly even resolution of the Cyprus
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton can encourage Ecevit in this direction, he may be
able to claim the outcome as a great foreign policy success.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who have never met, are to hold talks at the White
House on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Ecevit is to travel to New York for
meetings with Turkish-American groups and with foreign leaders
attending the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's industrial heartland was devastated by an earthquake
last month, and the administration is preparing a package of relief
aid intended to show American commitment to Turkey, which has for
decades been a NATO ally and key strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, American efforts to help Turkey have been hobbled
by the campaigns of anti-Turkish lobbies, including those sponsored
by Greeks and Greek-Americans. But for the first time in living
memory, that climate has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Greece sent generous relief aid to Turkey after the Aug. 17
earthquake, provoking an emotional wave of gratitude. Relations
between the countries warmed even further when Turkish relief teams
flew to Greece after an earthquake struck Athens three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   This new detente appears to be widely popular in both countries,
but there are skeptics. One of them, a former Turkish foreign
minister, Mumtaz Soysal, recently published a column in an Istanbul
newspaper warning against ``idiotic optimism'' and asking, ``Do you
want us unilaterally to surrender our vital interests in the Aegean
and Cyprus in the name of friendship?''
</P>
<P>
   That question is also being asked within Ecevit's coalition
government, which includes a rightist party that has traditionally
appealed to chauvinistic nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   It may prove difficult for Ecevit to consolidate the new
Greek-Turkish friendship, and especially to end the impasse over
Cyprus, which since 1974 has been divided between Greek and Turkish
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fairly strong view that there will never be a better
time to deal with this issue,'' said an administration authority on
Cyprus. ``Their position is that the time isn't ripe and that
there's no rush. But Ecevit has an interest in seeing that Cyprus
doesn't spoil the tone of this visit and become the only headline
that comes out of it. So far, though, he isn't signaling much
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Rights issues are also likely to figure in the talks.
Influential figures in Washington, including members of Congress
with whom Ecevit is expected to meet, have said that Turkey must
improve its human rights record if it wants to be considered a full
member of the club of Western democracies.
</P>
<P>
   European countries have also been vocal in pressing Turkey to
end rivalry with Greece, settle the Cyprus dispute, root out rights
abuses and resolve the 15-year Kurdish conflict. The European Union
may decide at its December summit meeting whether Turkey becomes a
candidate for membership _ which largely depends on Turkey's
success in confronting these problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has a tendency to look at Turkey without seeing the
nuances at all, and is constantly undermining the reform forces
here,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at
Bilgi University in Istanbul. ``The Americans aren't like that.
They see that Ecevit is making progress, even if it is slow. So
unless there's a crackup over Cyprus, the visit should go well.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey
meets with President Clinton and congressional leaders in
Washington this week, there will be much talk about earthquake
relief, geopolitics and obscure though important matters like trade
arbitration and oil pipeline routes. But on Capitol Hill and
elsewhere in the United States, those matters pale into
insignificance. There the great question is at once simpler and
more complex: How democratic is Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Americans think about Turkey, this is the
question they most want answered. They want Turkey to stop jailing
people for giving speeches or writing articles, and to grant its
citizens the level of freedom enjoyed by most Americans and
Europeans. Otherwise, no matter how much progress is made on
international issues, Americans will continue to group Turkey with
Peru, Malaysia, Belarus, Zimbabwe and other quasi-democracies where
human rights have been pushed aside in favor of what ruling
autocrats consider issues of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has built a vibrant economy, given equality to women and
created a remarkably open society. Yet precisely because the nation
is so Western-oriented, its people have become impatient for full
Western-style democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish military commanders still enjoy the right of veto over
important government decisions. A highly conservative political
elite enforces laws that restrict free expression and other civil
rights. Nonetheless, Ecevit and his aides come to Washington with a
relatively good human rights story to tell. ``They clearly have
more to show in terms of actions, laws, decrees and actual shifts
on the ground than any other recent government of Turkey,''` said
one Clinton administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored assassins who terrorized the mostly Kurdish
provinces of southeastern Turkey for years seem to have packed
their guns away. Radio stations there are now allowed to play
Kurdish music. The Parliament has approved a repentance law for
Kurdish rebels, albeit a highly limited one. In Turkish prisons,
according to Sir Nigel Rodley, a U. N. investigator, there has been
``a reduction in the incidence of the more brutal forms of
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement reflects Turkey's dilemma. Its human rights
record, not just regarding torture but in all important areas, is
better than it has been in years. But it still falls short of what
the West considers to be minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the greatest pressure for improvement in Turkey's
human rights climate comes not from Washington or European
capitals, but from within Turkey itself. Millions of Turks, many of
them outraged by the state's failure to react effectively to last
month's earthquake, have begun demanding sweeping reforms and the
repeal of laws that restrict democracy. Even some senior
politicians have joined the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey understands more clearly than ever how urgent it is for
us to create a civil society built on democracy and social
justice,'' said Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik, a cabinet minister
responsible for human rights and relations with Europe. ``We must
bring our country to the level of modern civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these views are widely shared, many powerful figures
still resist them. This week, President Clinton will probably
encourage Ecevit to embrace the reform movement and overrule those,
including military commanders and senior members of his own
coalition government, who fear its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn will be full of challenges for Turkey. In November
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
places human rights at the top of its agenda, will hold a summit in
Istanbul. A month later the European Union, which has also looked
skeptically at Turkey's human rights record, will decide whether to
make the nation an official candidate for membership.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit is acutely aware that the world is watching to see how he
deals with a handful of high-profile human rights cases.
Foreigners, along with millions of Turks, will be thrilled if final
decisions are made to punish police officers who tortured teen-age
prisoners in Manisa in 1995, others who beat the journalist Metin
Goktepe to death in 1996, and prison guards who killed 10 Kurdish
prisoners in Diyarbakir following a riot that same year.
</P>
<P>
   This month one of Turkey's best-known prisoners, the pro-Kurdish
sociologist Ismail Besikci, was released from prison. He was warned
that he would be sent back to prison if he again violates laws
against publishing subversive opinions, but his release was
nonetheless welcomed by human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Other prisoners whose cases have attracted worldwide attention
include Akin Birdal, head of the country's largest human rights
group; Leyla Zana, a Kurd who is a former member of Parliament and
whose supporters in Europe and the United States have made her
probably the most famous Turkish citizen in the world, and the
blind lawyer Esber Yagmurdereli, who has been convicted of
supporting terrorism on the basis of evidence that human rights
groups say was fabricated. Yagmurdereli has spent 16 of his 54
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that the human rights situation in Turkey is
improving,'' he said in a telephone interview from prison. ``It's
the result of several factors, including a lull in the Kurdish war,
improved relations with the European Union, and the better climate
that has followed the earthquake. But in truly democratic
countries, people are guaranteed basic freedoms. That still isn't
the case here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Imagine finding a vacant lot on the banks of the Seine,
opposite the Louvre, and using it periodically as a discotheque.
Unthinkable, of course. But not in Berlin, where the Kunst und
Technik club opens its doors from time to time and demonstrates
that right now, in this city, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   On the banks of the Spree, in the early hours, revelers dance,
gazing out at the magnificent dome of the Bode museum of
antiquities on the island opposite. Several young men urinate into
the dark water. The city's choicest real estate has been given over
to a makeshift techno club, and nobody can quite believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heidelberg was so boring,'' said Mathias Santelmann, a law
student who moved recently from the old university town to the new
German capital. ``This place is going to be to Germany as New York
is to the United States.'' He pointed to the mesmerizing river and
dome, and exclaimed, ``Look, we're here at the creation!''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's inhibitions being what they are, the re-creation of
Berlin as the home of the government in recent weeks has been a
muted affair: no big rallies, no public festivities, no showy
speeches from the chancellor. ``We're still fearful of the wrong
images, so we like to pretend that nothing is happening,'' said
Peter Schneider, a writer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. As diplomats and civil servants unpack, as embassies
hold ``Welcome to Berlin'' parties, as newspapers offer ``Berlin
supplements,'' as completed buildings emerge from a labyrinth of
cranes, as an immense show opens on German art in this century,
something is in the air. Perhaps it could best be called the spark
of the unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, it has long been said, is damned: The city is so busy
becoming, it never gets around to being. Cataclysm has intervened
too regularly for that. But everyone seems to sense that this fifth
attempt in this century at Berlin-as-capital _ after the Kaiser,
Weimar, Hitler and the East German communists _ is the last best
chance for the city to overcome its curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a great city of the next century, but it still
has to be created,'' Karl Kaiser, the director of the German
Institute for Foreign Affairs, said as he moved into his new Berlin
premises this month. ``And I think it is the open-endedness that
creates this strong sense of intrigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the intrigue lies in the almost physical sense today
of a German future being dragged from a still-cloying past. After
Bonn, an escape from history, Berlin offers a daily confrontation _
with imperial pomposity, with Nazi madness, with East-West
division. And in this encounter Germany's hope of an elusive
reconciliation may lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most young Germans now going to Berlin, our history starts
in 1945 or with the Holocaust,'' said Hans Mommsen, a historian.
``National pride, in so far as it exists, has nothing to do with
the Bismarckian Reich. It has to do with the constitution and the
democracy of the federal republic. We have developed a new national
consciousness, one forged from the terrible legacy of Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this reformed nation that will be tested in Berlin. For
the consciousness of old Germans and young Germans, of east Germans
and west Germans, is by no means at one, and this city is the
symbol of the traumas that have divided them.
</P>
<P>
   From his anonymous Bonn office, Kaiser has moved into a building
that was constructed as the Royal Yugoslav Legation in the 1930s.
After the war, the building housed a restitutions court for
property stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   That is Berlin: History is everywhere, inescapable as the
construction sites hoisting the new city into being, visible in
buildings or graves still bullet-scarred from Hitler's war, written
on the surviving pieces of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A pervasive history, menacing, grandiose or just plain hideous,
as in Honecker's Palace of the Republic _ a building strangely
close to the heart of many easterners _ or Ossis _ even as it is
loathed by Wessis who want to rebuild the castle of the old
emperors on that very site.
</P>
<P>
   Can any national pride emerge from such a history? ``Patriotism
is not a word you use easily in Germany,'' said Michael Naumann,
the country's top cultural official. ``But yes, I am a patriot. I
take pride in what we have become, in our language, in our legal
system. And I think Berlin offers a chance for this new German
patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Germans had a phrase for the situation at the end of World War
II: They called it Stunde Null, or zero hour. Then, when the Berlin
wall came down a decade ago, it was Stunde Null again, a new
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, quiet as they are, these balmy fall days amount to a
third zero hour, a moment when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has
declared unabashedly that his country is a ``great power'' again,
an hour of emancipation, as if this return to Berlin 54 years after
Hitler's Reich symbolized the end of an unseen but powerful
tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems, at least. But this city is scarcely ``great'' or
``normal'' yet; nor is it the booming place imagined when the
decision to bring the capital back here was made in 1991. Then,
predictions suggested that the population would swell to 4.5
million by the year 2000 and to between 5 million and 6 million by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the population _ now 3.4 million _ has stagnated, as
new arrivals have been offset by Berliners migrating to the lower
taxes of the surrounding state of Brandenburg. A predicted business
boom has also failed to happen, leaving the center of the city
littered with unoccupied office space. More than 250,000 Berliners
are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of the imagined meeting place of East and West here in
Berlin, the city is merely the largest used-car dealership for East
Europe,'' Thierry Chervel commented recently in the Sueddeutsche
Zeitung.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   He had a point. Berlin was hypnotic in the 1920s _ the charged,
menacing sensual city of Otto Dix's canvases. During many of the
Cold War years, West Berlin was hip, an edgy, energetic place of
refuge for those fleeing the oppressive conformity of many of the
cities of the old West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even then, Berlin was far from the metropole so often
dreamed-of. Today, the city often looks seedy and cheap. Stroll
east down the central Kurfuerstenstrasse and the classy prostitutes
at one end give way to ragged young women clearly just arrived from
countries farther east.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet gentrified like Paris or much of New York, Berlin
remains raw and continues to offer cheap enough housing close to
the center to retain its proletarian touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is definitely the world capital of bad taste,'' said
Michael Mussotter, an architect. ``I love the city for that bad
taste, for the mix of classes, for the cheap public housing amid
the grand new developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Those developments _ most visibly the new Potsdamer Platz with
its Walt Disney productions, its Tony Roma's, its immense mall _
have been overwhelmingly commercial, a sign that the hour is one of
marketing rather than social or political ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The city has already changed immensely. Much of west Berlin,
once so lively, now seems a dowdy and forgotten place. The
Kurfuerstendamm, that mecca of shopping conceived to show Cold War
escapees from the east what they had been missing, is simply
dismal. All the energy is in eastern districts like Mitte or
Prenzlauer Berg.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, these shifts have not produced a whole _ what Mark
Braun, an architect, called ``the urban grain you have in London or
in Paris, the grain that was lost in the demolition that Berlin has
known.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that grain is nothing other than civilization, its
slow and patient accumulation, in stone after stone.
</P>
<P>
   And when Berliners talk incessantly about their dreams of a
Weltstadt, or world city, the German thirst for a civilized,
cosmopolitan norm is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Such an achievement _ a great city, open to the world, to east
and to west, showing its history but unthreatened by it, powerful
but unthreatening to others _ would, it seems, represent the
ultimate healing of Germany's many wounds.
</P>
<P>
   For now, whatever Schroeder may say, that reconciliation remains
some way off. In its place is a jagged energy, an edginess, an
openness that leaves a piece of formerly eastern riverside property
in the hands of an association of artists who, for reasons best
known to themselves, open the premises as a club on every date
divisible by six.
</P>
<P>
   That place is Kunst und Technik, very in, very Berlin. Julia
Tanzer, 23, comes here regularly. ``This city is my future,'' she
said simply.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the city's painful past? ``You know, we see it for
the first time in schools, when we are 9 years old, we see
Auschwitz, and what do we feel? Horror, of course. It's terrible,
terrible _ but it's not my fault.''

   A POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE DEVASTATES TAIWAN
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake registering 7.6 on the standard seismic scale left
more than 2,000 people dead, thousands more hurt, and more than
100,000 homeless in Taiwan. Days later, amid strong aftershocks and
lingering power outages, rescuers continued to search for survivors
trapped in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Hit hardest were the central and northern regions of the island,
where high-rise buildings collapsed and roads and bridges crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   With many businesses shut and semiconductor production
disrupted, economists were predicting a slowdown in the island's
economic performance as well.

   A CALL TO ARMS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan broke with a tradition of merely
summing up a year's work of the United Nations when he opened the
General Assembly debate and called in unambiguous terms for the
right of the organization to intervene anywhere when civilians are
put in mortal danger by their own governments or by civil wars. His
message: Leaders can no longer hide behind borders, using national
sovereignty as a shield against the world. France's foreign
minister, Hubert Vedrine, spoke for many leaders gathered at the
United Nations when he said that Annan had opened a profound debate
that will go on for years, and one that creates a new philosophical
divide between the developed nations and the third world.

   AN EMOTIONAL VISIT TO BERLIN BY BARAK
</P>
<P>
   Germany may be ready to call itself a ``great power'' again, as
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder did recently, but it still worries
more than any other nation about its image. So the fact that the
first state visitor to Berlin since the German government moved
there last month was Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, had
great symbolic importance. The visit gave Schroeder the occasion to
say that there could be no end to the process of remembering Nazi
crimes, as he stood with Barak at the former Sachsenhausen
concentration camp near Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister warned of the danger of neo-Nazism
but said he had ``no reservations'' about the move to Berlin and
was confident about Germany's democratic institutions. That was
precisely the message Germany wanted as its government starts work
in Berlin 54 years after the collapse of Hitler's Reich.

   AN ART WAR IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph W. Giuliani drew a new line in New York's mayoral sand.
Fresh from his battles to tame New York's pedestrians, drivers who
cause gridlock and mosquitoes, he waded into the slippery waters of
artistic expression, vowing to cut city subsidies to the Brooklyn
Museum of Art if it doesn't cancel a ``sick'' exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The museum acknowledged that the show _ including a Virgin Mary
adorned with elephant dung _ is strong stuff, warning in promotions
that it ``may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and
anxiety.'' But mayoral intrusion, the lawyer Floyd Abrams warned,
``is at war with the First Amendment.''

   FOR ONCE IN WASHINGTON, HUMILITY TAKES A BOW
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a wonderful, swift decision on this,'' Werner
Gundersheimer, the president of the National Humanities Alliance,
said after the White House decided to turn down an invitation for
the president of the United States to pose as a scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation had come from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, asking President Clinton to deliver the annual
Jefferson Lecture. For 27 years, it had been given by one of the
nation's leading scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarly community reacted with dismay at the thought of
introducing politics into what has always been an intellectual
event. Objections were raised by both Clinton's supporters and his
antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   One antagonist, William J. Bennett, who headed the endowment
under the Republicans, said, ``Sense prevailed,'' and added: ``This
is about scholarship. The president, whatever he is, is not a
scholar. I don't think that even he thinks he is.''

   A STORM'S HARSH AFTERMATH
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, the monster hurricane that started rolling up the
Atlantic Coast two weeks ago, lived up to its billing in pummeling
shoreline homes, harbors and boats. Chickens and pigs too, posing
an unanticipated kind of health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's wake of rising, rain and tide-bloated rivers left
much of eastern North Carolina's vast farming country flooded,
along with parts of New Jersey, New York, Florida and Virginia. By
the weekend, it had been blamed for more than 60 deaths, more than
40 of them in hardest-hit North Carolina. Water, a greater evil in
this storm than wind, also posed an environmental and public health
disaster of leaking industrial chemicals and animal wastes.
Officials said the storm had drowned 1 million chickens and turkeys
and 110,000 hogs.

   SERBIAN OPPOSITION FALTERS

   As Serbs began a faltering new round of demonstrations to oust
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army
agreed, in extended negotiations that involved concessions by NATO,
to ``transform'' itself into a smaller, civilian Kosovo Protection
Corps. But the group, with new insignia, retains rights to bear
some sidearms, has access to helicopters and keeps the structure of
a paramilitary force. Serbian opposition leaders believe that
NATO's inability to protect Serbs in Kosovo has helped Milosevic
consolidate his political position in Serbia.

   FAMILIARITY STOPS THE PRESSES
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Jones famously declared ``I have not yet begun to
fight'' but last week Grove/Atlantic gave up the ship, killing a
disputed new biography of the American naval hero amid allegations
of copyright piracy. The book, which had taken the hero's most
famous line as its title, was by James Mackay, a prolific Scottish
author of some 160 titles. But it was termed ``a spectacular and
sustained act of plagiarism'' by a Columbia University history
professor, David Armitage, who found that it mirrored a 1959 Jones
biography by the late naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison. The
inquiry was undertaken after The New York Times raised questions
about close similarities. It was not a new issue for Mackay, who
has already been attacked for plagiarizing biographies of Alexander
Graham Bell, Mary Queen of Scots, Andrew Carnegie and Sir William
Wallace, the 13th century warrior celebrated as ``Braveheart.''
Before his phone line in Glasgow went dead last week, Mackay denied
any copying. ``There are only a certain number of words in the
English language,'' he said.

CALIFORNIA CONDORS LEARNING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE WILD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN CLUB, Calif. _ Perched on a roof in this small
wilderness community, California condor W0 is a sight to behold.
Weighing in at about 20 pounds, with a wingspan around 9 feet and
history going back to the time of the mastodon, his presence is
awe-inspiring. But Mike Barth, a wildlife biologist, would rather
he just went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to flush him,'' said Barth, a supervisory
biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, after examining
the bird with binoculars and watching it for about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got the chance, however, W0 obligingly lifted off and
sailed across the valley to his cohorts resting on dead trees
across the way. But chances are he will be back.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the free-flying condors released in California
seem to have taken a shine to this retreat in the San Emigdio
Mountains about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles. They have been
visiting regularly over the last month, confounding wildlife
officials, captivating residents and creating mischief by ripping
up deck furniture, doormats and, in one case, tearing through a
screen and into a bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Once threatened with extinction, the condors are part of a group
born in captivity after their dwindling numbers led officials to
capture the last of the California condors in 1987. At that time,
there were only 27 California condors in existence.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was the breeding program that officials began
reintroducing them to the wild in 1992. There are now 162
California condors, with 113 in captivity, 29 flying free in
California and 20 more in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   While the condors have shown up in communities before, never
have there been so many that have been so persistent in their
presence in one area. One day this month, 15 condors showed up on a
Pine Mountain Club roof, and they have continued to visit,
generally in lesser numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The new boldness has led to concerns and ultimately some debate
about how to address the situation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologists move the birds along by waving
their arms or lobbing pine cones in their direction, and community
meetings have been held in many areas to encourage residents to do
the same. But some residents object to running the birds off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my property off limits to fish and wildlife officials
because I don't like them harassing the birds,'' said Les Reid, a
former board member of the Sierra Club, who lives in Pine Mountain
Club. ``As far as I'm concerned they should leave the birds alone.
They're a great addition to our community.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a man who has had the most invasive visit to date.
This month Reid, who is 83, was working at his computer when he
heard a racket upstairs in his bedroom. He went to check, and found
that eight condors had torn through a screen door and were wreaking
havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mad, I was just astonished,'' Reid said. ``I looked
at them. They looked at me. It was as if we were having a meeting.
I said, you have to go the same way you came, and they filed out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reid and his wife, Sally Milhauser Reid, who has advanced
Alzheimer's disease and lives in a Bakersfield institution, had
opposed efforts to take the California condors out of the wild,
urging the authorities to focus more on securing their habitat.
Their fear at the time was that the birds bred in captivity would
become too tame.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the condors' behavior as proof that he and his wife
were right.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mesta, the condor-program coordinator for the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said it remained to be seen whether the
California condors bred in captivity would be different birds from
those that were captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the population is heavily manipulated to maintain
it in the wild, there is a certain amount of evolution that has to
occur,'' Mesta said. ``These guys are going to have learn to be
wild condors.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems being confronted now are not unlike those that
occurred when the birds were released, only to be killed or injured
when they came into contact with electrical lines. In response,
wildlife officials introduced an exercise in the pre-release flight
pens, in which the birds received mild shocks when they sat on
utility poles.
</P>
<P>
   Puppets have been used in raising the chicks to avoid human
contact, and now officials have also introduced a program to make
the first contact with humans unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Mesta said, ``It wasn't as successful as the
power-pole aversion.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent the birds' nature presents a problem. California
condors have existed in the wild with no predators and, as a
result, no real natural fears. In addition, the condors that fared
best in the wild were the best foragers; these were also the ones
with the most curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Mountain Club, a community of 1,900, is on a flight path
historically used by the condors, and many homes sit enticingly on
ridges where the condors can catch updrafts that allow them to
soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never had any parents out here as role models, so
they've kind of learned everything on their own,'' Barth said. ``So
when they land on a house I try to make it feel wrong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern is not so much that the birds will hurt humans, but
that they will hurt themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials are hoping that the birds' interest in humans
will disappear once they come of breeding age, which is 6 to 8
years old. Eleven in the group of 20 staying in the southern part
of the California habitat are 5{ and could possibly begin mating
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping they have to think more about having another
mouth to feed and they won't have time to go curiosity-seeking as
much, if at all,'' Barth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, wildlife officials and bird enthusiasts said
they would continue to try to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dilemma, it really is,'' said Clark Moore, a volunteer
condor monitor who conducts community education programs that
encourage residents to shoo the birds away. ``My philosophy is just
keep doing what we're doing until they get to be adults and have
some responsibility. I suppose it's not all that different than
raising a teen-ager.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS COME TO THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sun was just setting, the sky still bright, when
the kids began asking for the lights. ``Miss D.,'' a boy in a red
Kennedy High School football jersey called out, ``we've got to turn
them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary DeCesare, emerging from the football office inside the
hulking building set off Tibbett Avenue, waved him away. ``We've
got time,'' she said, but she understood what the rush was, what
the glow of lights on a balmy Bronx night meant, and not just for
the kids on the field, loosening up for the urban version of Friday
Night Lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights make them all feel part of a happening, an event,
and they need it and they deserve it,'' she said. ``Why shouldn't
they have the chance to feel good about where they go to school,
like those kids who have everything?''
</P>
<P>
   That was a relative comparison, something of an overstatement,
Susan Wagner High School, Kennedy's opponent Friday night, being as
public a New York City school as Kennedy. But there are
night-and-day differences within a city of haves and have-nots that
typically, sadly, have everything to do with race and class. After
two decades at Kennedy of teaching math and helping the veteran
football coach, Jerry Horowitz, count pennies, Mary DeCesare has
developed her own special formula to calculate the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to play Wagner out in Staten Island last year,'' she
said. ``They must have had 40 parents at the concessions. I
couldn't believe it _ they were selling nachos with melted
cheese!''
</P>
<P>
   In the Public Schools Athletic League, those kinds of toppings
add up to the amenities far beyond the bare chips. When Wagner came
to play Kennedy on Friday night, to win the latest meeting of
traditional city heavyweights by 20-8, it came not by school bus,
but by coach. It came with an elevated platform stand for its
assistant coaches. It brought its own bench, a commodity the home
team did not have.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, at least, had a home.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after its old turf field had been condemned, after
Horowitz and his phalanx of unpaid helpers dragged the program
along on black-top cement and his 1996 team to a city championship
without the benefit of one game at home, Kennedy this season moved
back into its own $2.5 million facility. On the scale of high
school athletic accommodations, Kennedy now ranks much closer to
Susan Wagner than it does to the unfortunate cases like Manhattan
Center, which begins every practice shoveling dog waste off the
hash marks.
</P>
<P>
   All over a city whose mayor can't wait to build grand sports
palaces for the rich and corporately connected, high school kids
tackle each other on wastelands of dirt and rocks. As it somehow
took three years to lay Kennedy's new field after Bronx Borough
President Fernando Ferrar organized a coalition of underwriters,
the needy should know not to hold their breath. And this being New
York, even the Kennedy story concludes with no Hollywood flourish,
only a functional home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' said Mary DeCesare, ``it feels like we gave birth
to an elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard and clock could have worked better Friday night.
One of the goal posts faded right, like an errant kick. The incline
from the football turf to the track that has already wrecked one
ankle could be smoother. One of the banks of lights was dark and
the others could have been brighter, and fate could have most
certainly been kinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field itself is a dream,'' said Horowitz, who added that
no one deserved to play on it more than Ariel Delosangele.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old senior put in two years of practice at fullback
and linebacker on the cement and gravel. ``Over there by the tennis
courts,'' he said, ``we couldn't tackle, couldn't hit. It killed
your ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was going to be Delosangele's year, until Aug. 28, the
day after his birthday. The Knights were playing their
red-and-white intrasquad scrimmage. Delosangele was carrying the
ball. ``I planted my foot and it got struck in the turf,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three tacklers converged. The ligaments in his right knee
ripped. His season was shattered, his dream was gone, the way of
Vinny Testaverde's. Delosangele limped along the sideline in his
red No. 21 jersey Friday. He wore some of his teammates' jewelry
around his neck and screamed encouragement at them when they fell
behind, 14-0, in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The bad comes with the good. You learn that fast in the New York
schools. Horowitz has put in 20 years coaching at Kennedy, watching
the financing dry up, the turf die, the kids disappear into the
streets. He could have left several times, but he is from the area
and his wife, Wendy, teaches there, too. An 83-year-old Kennedy fan
and neighborhood guy named Mac Faro said Horowitz worked every
spare minute to get the new field, to keep his baby alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys would have said to heck with it,'' Faro said near
the Kennedy bench, ``but he wouldn't let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the hill from Kennedy is fashionable Riverdale, where the
money is, and across the Metro-North Railroad tracks is Columbia
University's Wien Stadium, what the money buys. But the students
and the parents and the stragglers from the area filled up the
bleachers, and the kids from the school's environmental club sold
the hot dogs, and the game went on Friday night as night fell, and
the home of the Knights lighted up the Bronx.

 &HT;    Thrashers' first coach expecting intensity from team
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tap, tap, tap . . . . The locker room in Orlando,
Fla., was quiet, except for the sounds of a head coach doing a slow
burn. It was another bad period of hockey. The players knew it. The
coach knew it. The players knew the coach knew it. They tried not
to stare when he picked up a hockey stick and methodically began
tapping it on the floor, as if testing its weight. Tap, tap, tap .
. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he grabbed the stick, everybody tensed up,'' said
Hubie McDonough, the former minor-league player from Orlando.
``When he started tapping it, you knew it wasn't going to be long
before it started helicoptering around the room. Then he picked it
up and threw it against the wall. Then he picked up another one and
threw it in the other direction like a javelin.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the wall, Don Waddell, the Orlando Solar
Bears general manager, could hear the tirade. Waddell knew his
coach, Curt Fraser, was prone to explosions but this one sounded
worse than usual. Then again, Waddell could only guess, because he
was in an adjacent trainer's room at the time and didn't actually
see anything until ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this bang, crash, and all of a sudden the butt end of
a stick comes through the wall,'' Waddell said. ``It was legendary.
We kept that stick in the wall for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Fraser does leave his imprint on hockey teams. The walls at
the Orlando Arena have been patched since that memorable outburst a
few years ago. But even today, the IHL's Solar Bears hand out a
player-of-the-game award dubbed, ``The Winning Wand,'' a taped-up
stick remnant that survived the between-periods chucking.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Fraser gets an embarrassed look on his face
when asked about the incident. He is quiet for a while, then
finally says, ``I might've been a little rough around the edges
before. I wasn't as polished as I am now. But I was winning 50
games a year, so I couldn't have been too far off the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL season is on the verge of beginning, and Fraser is
facing as big a challenge as when he carried a stick as a 433-point
left winger, dropped it as one of the league's best brawlers or
threw it as one of the minor league's best but most combustible
coaches. He had never so much as interviewed for an NHL
head-coaching job before the Thrashers hired him as their first
bench boss just six weeks before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   After eliminating several candidates with NHL experience,
Waddell concluded that what worked on one level in Orlando could
work on the next level here. A check of references indicated that
Fraser had, if not mellowed, at least recognized that there were
other ways to achieve 50 wins _ ways that didn't have players
asking out at the end of the season. ``When I hired him in Orlando,
he was always on the edge of boiling over too quickly,'' Waddell
said. ``That's not a fault; that's just something you have to learn
from. Players need to be driven but can't be driven every night.
Curt knows that now. Two or three years ago, he would not have been
ready for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrants and expansion teams don't mix in the NHL. Coaches who
walk around with a perpetually lit fuse generally lack patience, an
important trait when you are trying to infuse confidence in an odd
collection of players. No NHL expansion team has made the playoffs
on merit. Four _ Philadelphia, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota _
made it in 1968, only because the league mandated that four of the
six teams in the all-expansion former West Division be granted
berths. Edmonton and Hartford reached the postseason in 1979, but
both were whole teams absorbed from the World Hockey Association.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser might not have been ready to make the transition if he
had not, as he put it, ``smooth out the rough spots.'' Hockey, he
knew about. Things like team dynamics and communication, he had to
learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``From his first year to his fourth year here was like night and
day,'' said McDonough, who played for Fraser and now is an Orlando
assistant coach. ``It used to be guys were afraid to go in and talk
to him. There was one incident between he and I when I thought he
was being unfair with the guys in the room. He left and I whacked
something, and then he came back and we had it out. But after that
game, we talked and our relationship changed.''
</P>
<P>
   John Weisbrod, the Orlando general manager who followed Waddell
two years ago, is credited with persuading Fraser to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curt had a difficult time understanding the modern athlete,''
Weisbrod said. ``He thought every player would approach the game
the same way he did. He wasn't a real touchy-feely kind of guy. I
spent a good part of that first year trying to convince him that he
could make an effort to relate to the player a little more and it
wouldn't compromise his intensity or his authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problems were inevitable. When a kid grows up in
rugged Western Canada with moderate skills and overachieves to
become one of the best players in the juniors, when he agrees to
accept a role as the team's enforcer because that's what the coach
felt was needed to win, that same person later in life naturally
expects his players will carry the same passion.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser never knew any other way. He was born in Cincinnati but
was raised in the northern provinces. His father, Barry Beatty, was
a pro hockey player just starting out in his career for the
minor-league Cincinnati Mohawks. But when he was only 22 years old,
he was tripped on a breakaway and slid head first into the
goalpost. Fraser's father, who was not wearing a helmet at the
time, required brain surgery that saved his life, but he was forced
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to Western Canada. Fraser grew up a rink rat.
His mother, Jean, was a figure skater and, according to Fraser,
``She would've been in the Ice Capades if she didn't have me.'' The
family moved to within two blocks of an ice rink in Vancouver.
Fraser, his two brothers and their mother were there daily, the
three boys playing hockey, the mother teaching figure skating.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's parents divorced when he was young, and both remarried.
Hockey remained a constant in his life. He played in the juniors
for the Victoria (British Columbia) Cougars at a time when the
Western Hockey League was notorious for physical play and brawls.
Often, there were fights not only during the games but before them,
during pre-game skates. Pre-game fights became so commonplace in
the WHL that a few years ago the league mandated that teams warm up
at separate times.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intensity probably comes from my days in junior hockey,''
Fraser said. ``I had a coach, Patty Ginnell, who was a very
intimidating man. He was known for being real tough and disciplined
with the players but also putting a lot of guys in the NHL. We were
all a bunch of prairie boys, big strong kids. You had to play with
an edge. You had to be rugged and durable, especially traveling on
those 32-hour bus rides. To Flin-Flon. Lots of snow, lots of miles
on the road. For a 16-year-old kid starting out, it was a great
learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser fought, yes, piling up as many as 256 penalty minutes in
his final season of juniors in 1977-78. But he wasn't devoid of a
scoring touch, collecting 125 goals and 149 assists for 274 points
in his final three years at Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver drafted him in the second round, and Fraser went on to
play 12 seasons with the Canucks, Chicago and Minnesota. He was not
quite the ``plumber'' some have made him out to be. Not everybody
scores 193 NHL goals and has five 20-goal seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But overshadowing the scoring was Fraser's blue-collar work _
the collisions in the corners, the brawls, the shot-blocking, the
leadership in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who ever saw him play knows there's nothing he can ask
a player to do that he didn't do himself,'' Vancouver general
manager Brian Burke said. ``Because he was a marginal player from a
skill perspective, he really worked hard on the intellectual side
of the game. He was a smart player, and historically the marginal
players in this league who could think the game have made some of
the best coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's fighting ability was not marginal. Asked if he ever
took a beating, he responds, ``No.'' He compiled 1,304 penalty
minutes in 704 games. He had plenty of opponents. Former
Atlanta/Calgary Flame Willi Plett remembers the two squaring off
``at least 10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I still have some lumps from him,'' Plett said. ``One
year in Calgary, I had 38 goals, and I swear his only
responsibility when we played was to try to neutralize me.''
</P>
<P>
   With body checks?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm talking fights,'' Plett said. ``There was one time I
might've hurt him, but there were definitely times he hurt me. One
time, I don't even know if the puck had dropped yet, and he dropped
his gloves and hammered me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said, ``When I was in the juniors I was a scorer. But in
Vancouver I was put into a role of a more physical player. I
focused on what I could bring to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser claims the most punishment he ever took in a fight came
in juniors from Dave Hoyda. ``I thought, `Holy mackerel, I've been
hit by a truck. My eye was closed shut and my head was spinning.
Afterward, I ran into Hoyda as I was leaving. He had 14 stitches
above his eye. So I gave him something to remember, but I could
barely see him.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Fraser's most lopsided brawls came in the playoffs one
year when his Blackhawks were facing Minnesota. As Burke recalls,
``Bobby Smith made a poor business decision to challenge Curt
Fraser to a fight. It wasn't a lucid moment for Bobby Smith. He
needed 30 facial stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's brief recollection: ``All I will say about that is Curt
Fraser was a better fighter than I was, and he proved it that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser never thought of himself as a coach until somebody
offered a job. He retired in 1990 because his shoulders and his
knees couldn't take any more pounding. Burke, then the Canucks'
assistant GM, offered him a job as assistant coach with the team's
IHL affiliate in Milwaukee. Fraser accepted and said, ``I loved it
from Day 1. I knew I wanted to be a head coach some day.''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually took over as head coach, going 89-47-27 in two
seasons. That was followed by a season as an assistant in Syracuse
(AHL), then four in Orlando, where Fraser's teams went 192-111-25
and advanced to the finals twice.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through last season, Waddell told Fraser that he was
looking to hire somebody with NHL coaching experience for the
Thrashers. Fraser's response: ``I told him, `That's fine. But if we
win the (IHL's) Turner Cup, I deserve a shot.''' Fraser was
half-joking. But within two days of the Solar Bears losing in seven
games in the finals, Waddell called to request an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Weisbrod, meanwhile, filled in Waddell on the new Fraser, the
one who communicated with players and shuffled nameplates around in
the locker room to create the right chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trademark of Curt's teams (was) resilience,'' Weisbrod
said. ``That made him a perfect fit for an expansion team, because
there's going to be some tough days, but his players will not lay
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is a long way from Victoria. But Fraser, while saying he
has changed for the better, is not going to stray too far from what
got him here. Discipline comes in all forms. It doesn't have to
arrive like a harpoon or a stick through a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to just expect things before,'' Fraser said. ``I just
thought the players would do what I did. I changed to more of a
commander, a captain. I'm still steering the ship. But I make sure
now everybody is on board and rowing in the same direction.''

 &HT;    `Ownership, arena will be without rival'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NHL commissioner Gary Bettman will attend the
Thrashers' opener Saturday in the new Philips Arena. Staff writer
Jeff Schultz interviewed Bettman about Atlanta and the league.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I assume you didn't grow up an Atlanta Flames fan. But what
are your feelings about the league returning to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm very excited about it, for a variety of reasons. First,
the Flames did quite well and had a great following. The reasons
the club moved were unrelated to the support it received in the
market. Second, as good a town as Atlanta was, it's an even better
town now, and it's grown. Finally, the ownership and the new arena,
we think, will be without rival.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To what extent does bringing in a multimedia conglomerate
like Time Warner and Ted Turner help the league.
</P>
<P>
   A: That tends to be overstated. But they'll do a great job
running the franchise, and a strong franchise makes the league
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Atlanta no longer is alone among NHL franchises in the
Southeast, but Tampa Bay and Carolina are having severe financial
problems. Does this signal any problems to you.
</P>
<P>
   A: You have to look at specific franchises. You can't generalize
and say, `The South.' Tampa Bay is not experiencing what I would
call problems. The franchise had an ownership situation (with
Japanese owners) from the outset that finally got resolved. You
can't have absentee ownership. Bill Davidson is at the helm now,
and I view that as a positive. Carolina again is a unique situation
because of the relocation (from Hartford) and having to play home
games (in Greensboro) 100 miles from their (base in Raleigh).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Carolina lost $55 million in its first two seasons. But even
with a new arena in Raleigh this season, tickets sales reportedly
are slow. Do you have any lingering concerns about the market.
</P>
<P>
   A: No. That franchise will be fine. They've had to operate under
difficult circumstances. That's a great market with good ownership
and a good building.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The league has seen unparalleled growth in recent years, but
there are several franchises struggling financially. What is your
viewpoint on the strength of the league.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think the league has ever been stronger. Ownership
has never been stronger. Our footprint has never been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any lingering feelings about the fact your
centerpiece event, the Stanley Cup Finals, ended on a disputed
goal.
</P>
<P>
   A: It didn't end on a disputed goal. It ended on a perfectly
fine goal. There are plenty of sports events that are decided on
the wrong call. The Dallas-Buffalo game ended on the right call.
The fact is some people at the time didn't understand that it was
the right call. It's a nonissue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To what extent does Wayne Gretzky's retirement affect the
league, from a visibility standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think anybody can overstate Wayne's importance to the
league as a whole. He's indicated his intentions to stay close to
the game, remain visible and bring attention to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The six Canadian franchises continue to struggle financially
because of Canadian tax laws and the country's devalued dollar.
What is the outlook for the franchises.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an important priority for us to keep the six Canadian
franchises in Canada and keep them not only viable but successful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some have projected that only the teams in the three major
markets, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, will survive, while
Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa will move. Do you agree.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't believe that. As I said, I'm committed to finding a
way to maintain six franchises in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How strong are your desires to place franchises in Portland
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A: At some point, they might represent an opportunity in the
right circumstances. But there are no further plans for expansion
on the horizon. I'm of interest in those cities, but there's
nothing we can do right now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have expressed concerns about the rate of increasing
salaries in the NHL. But the collective bargaining agreement with
the NHL Players Association runs through 2004. So, is there really
anything you can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   A: What I've said is that for the last couple of years, salaries
are increasing at a faster rate than revenues. If that continues,
it's a concern. But I also believe economics can be pendulumlike
and swing back in the other direction. Revenues can start to
increase faster than salaries. If salaries have to slow down,
that's something the individual teams have to address.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you had to do it over again, would you have negotiated the
collective bargaining agreement differently.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's not a question anybody can answer. When it gets to be
time to negotiate the next CBA, we'll take stock of the total
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The NHL's five-year, $600 million contract with ABC and ESPN
is a record deal for the league, but there are still a limited
number of games on network television. Is that satisfactory for the
league's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's only that way in the first year. ABC had some scheduling
issues in the first year. The number of broadcasts will grow over
time. When we made the deal, ABC already had some contractual
agreements in place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do things stand on the league's participation in the
2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A: We're waiting to hear from the Players Association in terms
of whether they're prepared to go. They've proposed a series of
things, a number of which are unrelated to the Olympics themselves,
and some might construe that as an attempt to renegotiate the CBA.
If they want things unrelated to the Olympics, then I have to
question their desire to go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the issues.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd rather not get into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a ``drop-dead'' date.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's something the International Ice Hockey Federation has
to establish. I can live with more time, but it's up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given the pre-medal eliminations of the United States and
Canada in Nagano and the dorm trashings by some U.S. players, would
you consider the experiment a failure from both a public-relations
and a marketing standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you believe that the only way we could be successful was
for the U.S. to play Canada in the gold-medal game, then your
question makes sense. But this was probably the most-viewed,
most-competitive hockey tournament in the world. It didn't hinge on
the success of the U.S. or Canadian teams.

 &HT;    Ferrall's amusing, irreverent style to cover Thrashers
play-by-play
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Thrashers broke with convention in picking their
radio voice and the station on which he will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ferrall, the outspoken former nationally syndicated
sports-talk-show host, had not done play-by-play work on an NHL
game until he was hired by the Thrashers. And if his two exhibition
broadcasts are any indication, Ferrall's irreverent,
push-the-envelope style will not be corralled by the demands of his
new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be entertaining. I want to make it exciting to
listen to,'' said Ferrall, who during his game calls has offered
references to sissies, enemas, urine, major-league baseball players
and the fictional character in Al Pacino's movie ``Scarface.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is lining up to listen to hockey broadcasters,'' he
said. ``No one's watching on television. It's time to try something
different to make it more popular to listen to. I can't worry about
what some guys who've called hockey for 20 years think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrall concedes, however, that his biggest challenge will be
identifying the players for listeners, many of whom are as
unfamiliar with the Thrashers as they are the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's what they're pounding into me,'' Ferrall said.
``I need to do a better job of saying who has the puck and whose
team he's on. And I'm going to work hard to get better at that,
because I don't want to let this franchise down.''
</P>
<P>
   After choosing Ferrall, the team then pulled another surprise by
selecting ``SportsTalk 790 The Zone,'' WQXI (790-AM,) as its
flagship station, and adding WLKQ (102.3) as the FM partner.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ferrall decision got the team a recognizable name, the
latter generated the most crucial question in local radio: Will
people be able to hear the games at night?
</P>
<P>
   To offset The Zone's weak signal after dark, Thrashers director
of radio operations Dan Kamal put together a network of affiliates
that he hopes will provide adequate coverage in the eight-county
metro Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good about it,'' said Kamal, who also plays the
straight man as Ferrall's partner on the game broadcasts. ``I think
we've saturated the metro area to the best of our ability. We did a
lot of driving around, and there may be small pockets where there's
a problem, and people might have to work to pick up the games by
either getting a better radio or re-positioning their radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in those few areas where there's not a clean signal, all
we can do is apologize and promise we'll keep working to get 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will be responsible for the game broadcast, but
the Zone chose John Kincade as the director of the station's hockey
operations, and Kincade will host the half-hour pre-game and
post-game shows.

 &HT;    Thrashers believe altercations will always be part of hockey
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Skates. Sticks. Gloves. Hockey. To many hockey
players, them's fightin' words. Hey, fights happen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fighting is an integral part of the game, as essential
as the brushback pitch in baseball, the crack-back block in
football, buying a vowel on ``Wheel of Fortune.'' Fighting always
has been, ever since the NHL's inaugural season of 1917-18. And it
always will be. At least if guys like Denny Lambert have any say
so. And they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got the right guy,'' Lambert said, his smile a 1,000-watt
spotlight warming to the topic: the role, and status, of fighting
in today's NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to eliminate fighting, I don't care what
you say,'' said Lambert, a Thrashers left winger. ``If you go out
there and play a 60-minute game, and somebody whacks you over the
elbow with their stick, you're going to walk away? No. You're going
to protect yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. ``Fights do happen. It'll always be part of the
game,'' said Thrashers forward Matt Johnson, nicknamed ``Moose''
not only for his size (6 feet 5, 235 pounds) but also his
propensity for _ hockey term here _ mucking it up in the corner.
``Toughness will never be out of the game. There will always be
tough guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fast game. There's sticks in your hands. Hockey's a
very emotional game, a lot of adrenaline flowing. Fights do break
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as often as they once did. Not in the early- or
mid-'70s, in the heyday mayhem of the Broad Street Bullies, the
Philadelphia Flyers who terrorized the NHL and won two Stanley
Cups. Not nearly as often as the 1987-88 season, when a NHL record
of 1.07 fights per game broke out on average.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1996-97 season, fighting in the NHL had declined 27
percent, another 20 percent last season. Those figures are partly
because of instigator rules implemented by the league in 1992 and
the emphasis on a more skilled, skating style of play. But fighting
is not going away. Not only because it's an intrinsic part of the
game _ indeed, hockey is the only sport, besides boxing, that
allows fighting _ but because of its fan appeal and, more
important, the role it actually plays as a deterrent to dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to need guys to protect people,'' said
Johnson. ``When you're with the Rangers, you never want Wayne
Gretzky to get hit. ... I think it makes a team feel more
comfortable going into a game knowing they're not going to be taken
advantage of. That somebody will let the skill guys play.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky played for the Edmonton Oilers, dave Semenko played
the role of Lord Protector of the Great One. He was Gretzky's
bodyguard, a vital role on any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Anaheim,'' said Lambert, ``they go out (before
last season) and sign two guys (Stu ``The Grim Reaper'' Grimson and
Jim McKenzie) to protect the 50-goal man, (Paul) Kariya.'' As well
as Teemu Selanne. And opposing teams know they'd best leave Kariya
and Selanne alone, or else answer to ``The Grim Reaper'' or a real,
live hockey McKenzie Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey, of course, has always been reluctant to outlaw fighting.
It's not only too imbedded in the game's psyche, but also very
popular with many fans while serving a practical, protective-shield
purpose. ``The fans seem to enjoy it,'' Johnson said, smiling.
``When you look at a fight, it's like a goal being scored.
Everybody's on their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when one guy's knocked off his skates. But the
widespread, bench-emptying, everybody-into-the-ring donnybrooks of
the past are largely gone. ``The days of the big brawl that all the
people could remember about hockey are gone,'' said Ray Ferraro, a
Thrashers veteran center. ``That stuff doesn't have any place
(anymore).
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be a sideshow,'' he said. ``We're not
wrestling. Not that wrestling's a sideshow, but it's
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey fights are, too, for many fans. And a means of employment
for guys like Patrick Cote of Nashville, Tenn., who led the NHL in
fighting last season _ a goal he set once he took the lead ``... as
long as my hands hold up.'' But then, fighting's been in Cote's
blood ever since his youth hockey days.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends back home (Lasalle, Quebec) fight on the street
and all they get is arrested,'' Cote told The Hockey News last
March. ``I fight on the ice and look at the money I make.'' His
salary last season: $375,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's players like Cote, though, who make the ``Greenpeace
pukes'' cringe. That's the euphemism hockey types use for those
opposed to fighting, who would clean up the game, and the rink, by
abolishing fighting. That's highly unlikely. NHL President Gary
Bettman has not publicly taken a pro or con stand on fighting; he
knows better. Indeed, when Brian Burke, a former NHL player and now
general manager of the Vancouver Canucks, was the league's senior
vice-president last season, he said he'd quit if fighting was ever
abolished, or warranted an automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, fighting is on the decline. Last season's average of
1.2 fighting penalties per game was the NHL's lowest in more than
20 years. While players still occasionally rearrange the facial
furniture, the game is played differently. Especially when two
referees are calling the action, like they will be for all games in
the 2000-2001 season. Each team will play 50 games with two
referees this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the games are anywhere near as physical as they
used to be,'' Ferraro said. ``The skill level is much better today.
It's deeper now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one-dimensional guys _ I guess you call it goon _
you're seeing less and less, where he plays one minute and gets in
a fight,'' Lambert said. ``You're getting bigger, stronger guys who
can play eight, 10 minutes a game and can also play. Any time you
get a half-decent player who's also tough, coaches are very happy.
That's a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bonus Curt Fraser can appreciate. The Thrashers coach
appreciates, and values, toughness. Not only in Lambert and
Johnson, but also guys like Chris Tamer, Steve Staios and Kelly
Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-year NHL playing career, Fraser scored 193 goals and had
1,306 penalty minutes. And had numerous fights, especially with
Willi Plett, the 1977 Rookie of the Year with the Atlanta Flames.
It was '82, though, when the Flames had moved to Calgary, that
Fraser set the tone for a Vancouver-Calgary playoff series by
one-punching, and flooring, Plett just eight seconds into the
series opener. That set the tone for the series; the Canucks swept
Calgary and reached the Stanley Cup finals.

 &HT;    Players from Atlanta's first NHL team are still popular
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They are, in every sense, old Flames. Most are in
their 40s now, some pushing 50. All once skated for the first NHL
franchise in the Deep South. And now, as hockey arrives for the
second time, as the Thrashers prepare to face off in Philips Arena,
it's the old Flames who have kept this town's hockey heartstrings
taut for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thrill of my life,'' Bernie ``Boom Boom''
Geoffrion says about the Thrashers and hockey's NHL rebirth in
Atlanta. Boom Boom should know. A Hockey Hall of Famer with the
Montreal Canadiens, Geoffrion was the Flames' first coach and one
of the Thrashers' most eloquent advocates in their pursuit of an
expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, they deserve to have another chance,'' said
Geoffrion, 68, who still lives in Marietta, 24 years after
resigning as the Flames' coach midway through their third season.
``We were drawing more than the Hawks, more than the Braves. Like I
told (NHL President) Gary Bettman last year, `Mr. president, if
there's a city that deserves a second chance, it's Atlanta. We can
prove we can play the game, and we can draw.' Especially now, with
the man, Ted Turner, and the new arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Play the game and draw _ two things the Flames did well, too,
from the first official faceoff in Atlanta on Saturday, Oct. 14,
1972. Opening night in the old Omni, then new and decked out like a
night at the opera house. ``It looked like you were going to a
ball,'' Geoffrion said. ``Every game was like that. Every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Men in suits. Women in long dresses, bejeweled if somewhat
bewildered by what unfolded on the ice below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange in the beginning but really fun growing with
the fans here,'' said Randy Manery, a defenseman that first season.
``I guess it was understanding their level of passion for their
understanding of the game. Not everybody in Atlanta was totally
naive, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Like that opening night audience, for the Flames-Sabres
inaugural. ``They took a couple of early long shots, basically
dumping (the puck) in, that happened to go on net,'' Manery
recalled. The reaction? Wild applause. ``The fans thought it was
great. That sort of thing was amusing, but energizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The players scratched their heads _ helmets weren't mandatory
back then _ but quickly warmed to a nascent hockey crowd. Even Tim
Ecclestone, who'd grown up near Toronto and played the first three
seasons with the spectacularly successful expansion St. Louis Blues
before going to his hometown Maple Leafs and then coming to Atlanta
in the Flames' third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto was like the history of the game,'' said Ecclestone, a
forward who still lives in Atlanta and owns TJ's Sports Bar and
Grill in Alpharetta. ``Like Montreal. Then I got traded down here
and ...''
</P>
<P>
   And it was different. In the old Maple Leaf Gardens, there was
no guy standing and waving a Rebel flag, as there was at the Omni.
And Canadian hockey fans not only appreciated hockey fights, they
knew authenticity when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had wrestling down here,'' Ecclestone said. ``But some
people would ask you, `Those hockey fights, they're fake, right?'
I'd say, `Listen, buddy, if they were fake, I'd have been in a lot
more of 'em.' But people here picked it up pretty quickly. They
were pretty knowledgeable by the mid-'70s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a social event the first few years,'' said Eric Vail, a
left wing who was nicknamed ``Big Train'' and won the Calder Trophy
as the NHL's Rookie of the Year in 1975. ``The people were all
dressed up. They would cheer icing. But what they did know to cheer
was whether the Flames won the fight or not.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'70s, the Flames had established themselves as one of
the better teams in the league and perhaps the best expansion team
in NHL history. After entering the league with the New York
Islanders, the Flames made the playoffs in their second season.
They would do so six times in their eight seasons in Atlanta,
although they never advanced beyond the first round. In all eight
seasons, they easily outdrew the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kinda scared at first,'' Geoffrion said, ``because you
were down South. Our (home) games were on Friday. You had to fight
high school football. But we con-quer dem. We outdrew high school
football. The Hawks and Braves were terrible. I told (general
manager) Cliff Fletcher, `If we keep winning our share of games,
we're gonna draw.'''
</P>
<P>
   They did, and they did. The Flames immediately had good
goaltending in Dan Bouchard and Phil Myre. Bouchard was the only
man to play all eight seasons in Atlanta, and now he coaches the
Life University hockey team, which he founded. Center Tom Lysiak
played 13 years with Atlanta and Chicago and now lives with his
family on a farm in Newton County, where he owns a landscaping
business. Forward Curt Bennett became the highest-scoring
American-born player in the NHL and still lives in Atlanta. Willi
Plett was the 1977 Rookie of the Year and a fan-favorite fighter
extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to compete, to help the team win,'' said Plett,
the right wing on a line with Vail and Lysiak that became one of
the league's most potent. ``If it meant getting in a few fights and
being physical, I did it. I took it personal. When my name gets
mentioned (now), people go, `Yeah, goon. Enforcer.' But I think I
averaged more goals a season than Train (Vail) did.''
</P>
<P>
   Plett scored 222 career goals. He could play and fight, much
like a contemporary _ and frequent opponent _ of that era: Curt
Fraser, the Thrashers' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lots of fights,'' said Plett, who regularly fought Behn
Wilson of the Flyers, the Islanders' Clark Gillies and Gary Howatt
and Philadelphia's Paul Holmgren. But Fraser had a special place on
Plett's fight card. One recent night at Willi's Sports Grill,
Plett's restaurant and golf complex in Woodstock, he showed a tape
of his 10 best hockey fights. Three were against Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   That rivalry escalated once the Flames moved to Calgary after
the 1979-80 season and especially after Plett was traded to
Minnesota. By then, Fraser was with the Chicago Blackhawks. ``He
was tough, really tough,'' Plett said. ``Toughness is all mental.
You've got to have strength but you've got to know when to stir it
up. And he did. I respected him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Plett never got to play for the popular Geoffrion, whose name
brought instant credibility to a foreign hockey land, even if he
sometimes spoke in tongues. ``We always said, `We've got a coach
who speaks two languages _ broken English and broken French,'''
said Vail, still in Atlanta and still close friends with Ecclestone
and Plett. ``We'd always ask the French Canadians, `What did he
say?' They'd say, `I don't know.' So we knew he was bilingual.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1979, Geoffrion was long gone, having quit out of frustration
in early '75. Fred Creighton succeeded him and the Flames were very
successful on the ice and fairly successful at the gate but, like
their jerseys, in the red financially. The late '70s was hardly a
boom time in real estate, where Flames owner Tom Cousins had made
his first fortune. When some of his partners sold out, Cousins was
forced to sell the team after the 1979-80 season to Canadian Nelson
Skalbania. He moved the Flames to hockey-hungry Calgary, where the
franchise won the Stanley Cup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Canadian dollar plummeting, Calgary could lose the
Flames. Atlanta, meanwhile, is basking in the return of NHL hockey.
The old Flames are carrying a torch for the Thrashers, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be their biggest fan,'' Vail said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Don Waddell,'' Ecclestone said. ``I think
he's done a wonderful job of putting a new team together, and
they'll be more competitive than people think. They've got finesse,
toughness and goaltending. If his goaltending is as good as I think
it is, well, goaltending is like pitching (in baseball).
Goaltending keeps you in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing couldn't be better,'' Plett said. ``If it had
happened 10 years ago, it might've been too soon. Atlanta has just
exploded after the Olympics. People have money. And they couldn't
have picked a better coach. The talent pool now in the NHL is low.
If you score 20 goals, you're a goal-scorer. The majority of Curt's
players are going to be grinders. And he can relate to that, and
appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll have a good team,'' Geoffrion said. ``I
honestly think they'll do as well as the Flame did the first year.
We won 25 games. They drafted young guys and veterans; I like that.
You just put them together and that's how you put together a team.
And I honestly believe, with Mr. Turner, they won't have any
problems whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   So drop the puck Saturday _ opening night at Philips Arena. The
New Jersey Devils and the Thrashers, Boom Boom's new favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider that my team'' Geoffrion said. ``I love the game so
much. All of a sudden, the NHL is coming back to Atlanta.''

 &HT;    Competitive outlook hangs on goaltending
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Parker MacDonald said it. Right after another lopsided
defeat in the Los Angeles Kings' inglorious history, the coach
pleaded to anybody in earshot, ``The guy between the pipes killed
us.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's hockeyspeak didn't specify which guy he was talking
about _ his goalie or the opposition's. But both seemed to have a
major impact. After 42 games in 1981-82, MacDonald's team had only
13 wins, and he lost his job. Some guy between the pipes killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   When the Thrashers make their regular-season debut against the
New Jersey Devils on Saturday at Philips Arena, the first-year team
will be no different from 27 others in at least one respect:
Goaltending will make or break them.
</P>
<P>
   Forechecking schemes and power plays and unidentified flying
elbows won't make a big difference if Damian Rhodes and Norm
Maracle are letting the puck fly over the glove hand, past the
blocker or through the five-hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion teams that have been successful right off the
bat were so because of their goaltending,'' said Florida Panthers
President Bill Torrey, architect of the New York Islanders in 1972
and the Panthers in 1993. ``We had problems in the beginning in New
York, but then we got Chico Resch. It takes a while to build four
good lines. But one goalie makes a difference right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrey knows the history all too well. His first-year Panthers
were 33-34-17 in 1993-94 and missed the playoffs by one point.
Florida even made the finals as third-year toddlers. The reason:
goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Islanders posted the third-worst record in
expansion history, 12-60-6. Gerry Desjardins had a miserable
goals-against average of 4.68. The worst expansion record was
Washington's 8-67-5 in 1974-75, when starting goalie Ron Low's GAA
was 5.45.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York'' Torrey said,``I knew we would sell tickets for a
while, so I could take time in developing the team through the
draft. But in Florida, we had to sell the team and be competitive
right away. That's why it was more important to get an established
goalie and get some older players to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed rules of the expansion draft allowed the Thrashers to
get Rhodes in a pre-draft trade with Ottawa, which rotated Rhodes
and Ron Tugnutt last season. His career goals-against average of
2.58, including 2.34 and 2.44 the past two seasons, bodes well for
the Thrashers. The team in front of him probably won't match the
talent level of the Senators. But when Rhodes joined them from
Toronto midway through their fourth season in 1996, the Senators
were a mess, having won only 20 percent of their games in 3 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about being the key to the success of a first-year team,
Rhodes said, ``When I was in Ottawa, it was a similar situation. I
really just stayed focused on my game and let the other things fall
into place. . . . It's the same as everything else in life. You try
to think about the good times more than the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The same day Rhodes arrived in a trade, coach Dave Allison was
fired and replaced by Jacques Martin, the team's third coach in two
months. Rhodes went only 10-22-4 the rest of the season, but his
goals-against average (2.77) was almost the same as it was in
Toronto (2.79).
</P>
<P>
   The goaltending of Rhodes and Maracle has been the Thrashers'
strength in training camp and the preseason. It will have to be the
strength during the regular season because this roster was not
built to win 8-7 games, even though general manager Don Waddell and
coach Curt Fraser have preached an aggressive, attacking style from
the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Maracle, an expansion-draft pick from Detroit and Rhodes'
24-year-old heir apparent, figures to play in about 30 of the 82
games. He probably had the strongest camp of anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing goalie when I was 7, and I didn't like it,''
Maracle said. ``My team had a scrimmage, and I was just in there
fooling around, and the next thing I know the coach sits me down
and says, `You're going to be our goalie.' I started crying. I
wanted to score goals like Wayne Gretzky. But after a while, I grew
to like it. I like the pressure of being the last guy on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense in front of Rhodes and Maracle should be fairly
solid, led by veterans Darryl Shannon and Gord Murphy. The offense?
``I'm excited about the direction we're headed,'' Waddell said. ``I
want to be careful because this is just the preseason, but our
skill level is better than I thought it would be in June. And our
goaltending has been outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell refuses to set the bar at 28 wins, Nashville, Tenn.'s
total last season, even though he knows others will draw the
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some will say that's our goal,'' he said. ``Or maybe
that's low.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's near-.500 mark?
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a phenomenal first year,'' Waddell said. ``When they
came in, goaltending was the strength of that (expansion) draft.
Vanbiesbrouck was the strength of that team. But that's one area
we're very pleased with right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy between the pipes can kill you. But good goaltending makes
an average team competitive.

 &HT;    New network scrambles to get cable connection
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the Thrashers prepare to take the ice for their
first regular-season NHL game, the heat is on local cable operators
to find room for Turner South.
</P>
<P>
   With 46 games on the new regional cable network, if Turner South
is unable to muscle its way onto such systems as MediaOne, the
Thrashers first season on television will be almost as spotty as
the NHL's four-game, regular-season package on ABC, its new network
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, with 15 games on WUPA in Atlanta, the Thrashers won't
be that invisible on ``free TV,'' but for a first-year team trying
to carve its niche in a marketplace with three other established
pro teams, 15 games won't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers and Turner South are confident that most of the
cable customers in the metro area will be able to see the first
telecast Saturday against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Fox Sports Net South) lawsuit did cloud the issue and
made conversations with cable operators more difficult,'' Turner
South President Bill Burke said about its rival's failed attempt to
prevent the network from having a sports component. ``But we're
coming along. Advertisers love the concept of the whole network,
and while the Thrashers are new and a bit more unproven than the
other teams, they've been very well received in the advertising
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt McConnell will be the television voice of the Thrashers,
with former NHL goalie Darren Eliot the analyst. McConnell, a
graduate of Michigan State, previously worked for the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks and the Penguins. Eliot, a graduate of Cornell, also
worked Mighty Ducks games. He played with the Kings, Red Wings and
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating producer Bill Kunz is taking the approach that the
game will be as new to the viewers as the uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get people to know the players,'' Kunz said.
``The second dimension is education. There's a fine line you can
walk between bringing people into the game and not alienating the
people who know the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Fox try everything from a glowing puck to
animated robots in a futile effort to expand hockey's relatively
small audience, ABC decided to all but write off the regular
season. The network made that decision even though its new
five-year, $600 million contract is 400 percent over the $31
million Fox averaged annually for NHL rights over the past five
seasons. After the All-Star Game on Feb. 6, ABC will only devote
four afternoons to the regular season _ March 18 and 26, and April
1 and 9.

<P>
   After years of mockery from colleagues, Dr. Ian Stevenson,
director of the Department of Personality Studies at the University
of Virginia, is finally getting respect. In ``Old Souls: The
Scientific Evidence For Past Lives,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999) Tom
Shroder, a Washington Post editor, reviews the 80-year-old clinical
psychiatrist's research on reincarnation and finds it hard to
refute.
</P>
<P>
   Shroder joined Stevenson on evidence-gathering trips to India
and Lebanon, where they questioned subjects like Suzanne, 25, a
Druse in Beirut who recalled her life as a woman who had died
months before she was born. By age 2, Suzanne knew the names of 13
of the woman's relatives and could recount parts of the eulogy
delivered at her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Shroder concludes: ``The only way to account normally for what
people were telling us was to hypothesize some massive multisided
conspiracy, either conscious fraud or some unconscious communal
coordination among people from different families and communities
with no obvious motive or clear means to cooperate in a
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Stevenson discussed his (present) life's
work, but wouldn't say whether he himself remembers a past life.
``Readers should make up their own minds,'' he argues, ``not on the
basis of what I believe or what anybody else believes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ David Wallis
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1938, Dr. Sigmund Freud wrote of psychoanalysis: ``I had
to pay heavily for this bit of good luck. People did not want to
believe my facts and thought my theories unsavory. Resistance was
unrelenting.'' As a psychiatrist who has faced scorn from
colleagues and the press, do you identify with Freud?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been through somewhat similar neglect. I'm not paranoid
about it though. There seems to be an inappropriate reluctance on
the part of some of my colleagues in medicine to even look at the
data.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What drew you to study reincarnation in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: Discontent with other explanations of human personality. I
wasn't satisfied with psychoanalysis or behaviorism or, for that
matter, neuroscience. Something seemed to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have repeated the saying: Science changes one funeral at
a time. What did you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Science develops ideas of what is so and it becomes very
difficult to force scientists to take a look at new data that may
challenge existing concepts. I'm not trying in any way to replace
what we know about genetics or environmental influences. All I'm
offering is that past lives may contribute a third factor that may
fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've investigated more than 3,000 cases of possible
reincarnation. Was there one case that struck you as particularly
difficult to explain in any other way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Twins in Sri Lanka. We did testing that showed they were
identical, yet they were markedly different in their behaviors and
physical appearance. One twin began to talk about a previous life
as a Sinhalese insurgent, said he was shot by police in April 1971.
Anyway, his family laughed at him, so he shut up and nothing could
be verified about what he said. The older twin talked copiously
about the previous life of a young schoolboy. He made several
specific statements that ultimately checked out. He said he lived
in a place called Balapitiya and traveled by train to a school in
another town called Ambalangoda. He made comparisons between the
families' property. He referred to an aunt, by name, who had cooked
chilies for him. Perhaps the most astonishing thing was that when
the two families met, the boy pointed to some (writing) in a wall
that turned out to be the name of the deceased boy he was
remembering. The subject said he had made that when the cement was
wet. No one in the deceased boy's family had noticed it before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Most of the subjects you've studied hail from cultures that
accept reincarnation, like Indian Hindus. Could people in a culture
more hostile to reincarnation repress past-life memories?
</P>
<P>
   A: That certainly happens. Still, there are cases in North
America. Parents sometimes write me and say, ``My child is now 12
years old. I wish I knew about you when he was 2 or 3. He said he
was an airline pilot, and we told him to stop telling lies and now
he doesn't remember anything.'' That's a fairly common opening. We
found that 40 percent of people even in India suppress their
children. It's not that they disbelieve them. It's that they have
various ideas, one that it's harmful to remember a previous life.
Sometimes, they object to the content of what the child is saying.
The child might show snobbishness. He'll say, ``I was, am, Brahmin
and won't eat your polluted food. I have to have food cooked by a
Brahmin.''

</P>
<P>
   Q: Were many of your subjects haunted by their memories?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some are tormented, struggling with torn loyalties between
two families. They often want to go back to the other family, and
reject their parents. Very often the child is placated by meeting
the previous personality's family. That's especially true in the
case of girls who remember having left behind very young children.
They often ask: Who's feeding my children?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which aspects of past-life memory are uniform across
cultures?
</P>
<P>
   A: A very young age of speaking. Forgetting at ages between 5
and 8. High incidence of violent death in the life remembered. And
the frequent mention of the mode of death in the previous life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ratio of cases don't pass muster compared to those that
you consider authentic?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are very few cases where one would favor an explanation
of fraud or self-deception, though there are some. Occasionally, a
parent becomes attached, even intoxicated, by the publicity, so
they inflate the case a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What troubles you most about your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I were coaching a skeptic I would emphasize the difficulty
in reaching the cases before the families concerned have met. They
can sometimes enthusiastically credit the child with more correct
statements than the child actually may have made. That's a
weakness. But we've done a comparison of a small number of cases,
maybe 25, in which someone had made a written record of what the
child had said before the families had met. We compared them to
cases where the written record had been made after the families had
met. Turned out there were no differences. There were the same
number of statements _ and correct statements _ in each group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you had a dinner party, and could invite anyone, alive or
dead, who would make the guest list?
</P>
<P>
   A: St. Francis of Assisi, William Harvey, who discovered the
circulation of the blood. Michael Faraday. Johannes Brahms. And
Abraham Lincoln. I'd like to meet Dr. Johnson but I think he'd be a
bore as a dinner companion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Humans are said to use just a small percentage of our brains.
Couldn't memories of past lives be attributed to ESP? Would ESP be
easier for Americans to accept than reincarnation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it would be. Trouble with ESP, it doesn't explain the
cases where relevant birthmarks and birth defects are present.
These birthmarks that we (find) are not like other birthmarks.
Ordinary birthmarks that everybody has are areas of increased
pigmentation. They are usually flat. The birthmarks that are of
particular interest to us in these cases may have some increased
pigmentation but they're usually scar-like, elevated or depressed,
and much larger than the average, ordinary birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: These birthmarks correspond to the wounds on the previous
personality?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've been able to find in more than 40 cases
verification of the location of the wounds from post-mortem
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If reincarnation were widely accepted, how would it change
the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would lessen guilt on the part of parents. They wouldn't
have as much of a burden that, whatever goes wrong with a child is
all their fault, either through genes or mishandling during the
child's infancy. People themselves would have to take more
responsibility for their own destinies. ... I don't expect any
great moral transformation. On my first trip to India I met a
respected Indian monk, a swami. I told him I had come out to see
what evidence there was in India for reincarnation. He remained
silent for a long, long time. Then he said, ``We here in India
regard it as a fact that people are reborn, but, you see, it
doesn't make a difference because we have just as many rogues and
villains in India as you have in the West.''

statements than the child actually may have made. That's a
weakness. But we've done a comparison of a small number of cases,
maybe 25, in which someone had made a written record of what the
child had said before the families had met. We compared them to
cases where the written record had been made after the families had
met. Turned out there were no differences. There were the same
number of statements _ and correct statements _ in each group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you had a dinner party, and could invite anyone, alive or
dead, who would make the guest list?
</P>
<P>
   A: St. Francis of Assisi, William Harvey, who discovered the
circulation of the blood. Michael Faraday. Johannes Brahms. And
Abraham Lincoln. I'd like to meet Dr. Johnson but I think he'd be a
bore as a dinner companion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Humans are said to use just a small percentage of our brains.
Couldn't memories of past lives be attributed to ESP? Would ESP be
easier for Americans to accept than reincarnation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it would be. Trouble with ESP, it doesn't explain the
cases where relevant birthmarks and birth defects are present.
These birthmarks that we (find) are not like other birthmarks.
Ordinary birthmarks that everybody has are areas of increased
pigmentation. They are usually flat. The birthmarks that are of
particular interest to us in these cases may have some increased
pigmentation but they're usually scar-like, elevated or depressed,
and much larger than the average, ordinary birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   Q: These birthmarks correspond to the wounds on the previous
personality?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've been able to find in more than 40 cases
verification of the location of the wounds from post-mortem
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If reincarnation were widely accepted, how would it change
the world?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would lessen guilt on the part of parents. They wouldn't
have as much of a burden that, whatever goes wrong with a child is
all their fault, either through genes or mishandling during the
child's infancy. People themselves would have to take more
responsibility for their own destinies. ... I don't expect any
great moral transformation. On my first trip to India I met a
respected Indian monk, a swami. I told him I had come out to see
what evidence there was in India for reincarnation. He remained
silent for a long, long time. Then he said, ``We here in India
regard it as a fact that people are reborn, but, you see, it
doesn't make a difference because we have just as many rogues and
villains in India as you have in the West.''

A NATIVE DETROITER'S FAREWELL TO TIGER STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif., Ill., Wis., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it became increasingly clear that Detroit's historic baseball
stadium might be abandoned, a grass-roots group called the Tiger
Stadium Fan Club resisted. In 1988 and again in 1990, fans
surrounded the ballpark and linked hands to hug the big, gray
structure at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull on the frayed
fringe of downtown. These embraces, lasting about 15 minutes,
generated sympathetic publicity and helped delay the inevitable.
Now, the days of warm hugs and lingering looks have grown short.
Autumn is here and, Monday afternoon, the Tigers will play their
final game on their home ground of more than a century. Next
spring, they open a new stadium, Comerica Park, about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Named for a bank, Comerica is one of many spiffy sports
facilities rising across the continent. Also to be replaced next
season are the former Candlestick Park in San Francisco and the
Astrodome in Houston. County Stadium in Milwaukee has one year
left. But Detroit's park is older and its closing generates the
most sentiment. On the site of a hay market, it opened as Bennett
Park in 1896, the year Henry Ford drove his first horseless
carriage on nearby streets. The current configuration of
grandstands and diamond was set in 1912 and renamed Navin Field.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Tiger Stadium feels like an ancestral homestead. My
oldest son, Marc, and I, born in Detroit 30 years apart, saw our
first major league games at Tiger Stadium. My dad and his brothers
took their sons there every Father's Day in the 1950s and 1960s and
reminisced then about coming there, young and single, in the 1940s.
Despite living on the East Coast for almost a decade, I have
visited Tiger Stadium at least once each year, along with other
baseball stadiums along the vacation trail. This summer, because my
son is seeking a college, we journeyed from coast to coast, from
campus to campus, and from ballpark to ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Such serendipity! The Bay Area of California gave us the green
lawns of Palo Alto and Berkeley and the playing fields of the
Giants and the Athletics. The Midwest meant the bricks and ivy of
both Wrigley Field and the University of Chicago, with visits to
Northwestern and Comiskey Park, plus a 100-mile side trip to
Milwaukee. Then came stops at the University of Michigan, Wayne
State University and, best of all, two nights at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There sat Ernie Harwell, 80 years old, a broadcaster there since
1960, when it was still called Briggs Stadium. Harwell began his
career in the 1940s, with the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field and
baseball's New York Giants at the Polo Grounds. He has perspective
on baseball and time and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of nostalgia floating around. Everybody is
bringing back their memories,'' Harwell said. ``We've had a lot of
people from all over the country come in. I've had people tell me,
`I'm from West Virginia' or `I'm from Arkansas' or `I'm from
Georgia' or `I'm from Oklahoma' and `I wanted to see the ballpark
for the last time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harwell will miss the closeness of Tiger Stadium's stands,
``that intimate feeling, like in Ebbets Field, where you could
reach down and touch the players.'' But he said Detroit's old park
lacks amenities for fans and revenue-generating luxury boxes for
ownership, both necessary for the 21st century baseball business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to move on,'' Harwell said. ``I don't want to look
back. We've got to keep the memories and treasure them in our
hearts and souls and minds and let it go at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The old place has dozens of steel posts that obstruct the views
from thousands of chairs. My son and I spent one game in the lower
deck, the other in the upper. From between the obstructions, the
posts and roofs frame a charming and intimate view, like a George
Bellows painting on a museum wall. Because the upper deck hangs
over the lower, the sounds from the field _ bats, balls, gloves and
voices _ reverberate through the aisles while the shouts of the
fans carry out across the grass. Throughout both games, cameras
flashed. Bill Dow, an organizer of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club, said
strangers have asked him to photograph them all summer, just
standing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this year of the long goodbye, it's just starting to sink
in,'' Dow said. ``I feel a mixed emotion of sadness and anger.'' He
said the old park could have been preserved and renovated, but ``it
was never appreciated as much as Wrigley Field or Fenway Park
because the Tigers didn't market it as much. The fans are paying
their last respects. People are making pilgrimages. People stand
outside the stadium and stare at it. It is a melancholy feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ballpark visits were not as sentimental but still great
fun. Dreading the legendary foul weather in San Francisco, we were
pleasantly surprised by the ambiance at Candlestick Point.
Alongside blue water and golden hillsides, fans arrived early for
tailgate picnics. When evening winds chilled the air, customers
added layers of clothing or blankets. A female voice announced the
batters and the speakers played ``Let's Spend the Night Together.''
Before a Sunday afternoon game, during an AIDS awareness event, the
Village People performed from the same site as the final concert of
the last Beatles tour in 1966. We drove by the new stadium, under
construction at China Basin, closer to downtown. No wind problems
there, they promise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, during a night game, we saw costumed characters in
the ``Sausage Race'' between innings: Bratwurst vs. Polish vs. Hot
Dog. During the seventh-inning stretch, the fans sang ``Take Me Out
to the Ball Game'' but voiced more gusto for ``Roll Out the
Barrel.'' Before the game, we photographed the new Miller Park,
directly behind the center-field fence, the work site decorated
with baseball paintings by children. A fatal crane accident has
delayed completion until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Like other new parks _ in Baltimore, Cleveland, Seattle, Texas,
Denver _ Miller has the retro effect that evokes the past. Harwell
said these designs beat the round ``cookie cutter'' stadiums in
Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Houston and Philadelphia, built
in the 1960s and 1970s, where ground balls skipped across
artificial turf for cheap doubles. ``Two-sport facilities that
didn't do well for either sport,'' Harwell said. ``I'm certainly
glad to get rid of that era and move into this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The emerging period, he said, ``will be compared with the era
that came around in 1910 or 1912, when Forbes Field and Shibe Park
and Comiskey Park and Navin Field were called palaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, we visited Wrigley in Chicago and Fenway in
Boston, the two surviving museum pieces. While too many sports
arenas bombard their guests with heavy-metal music and noisy sound
effects, Wrigley uses organ music and a strolling Dixieland band.
</P>
<P>
   The outfield scoreboard is hand-numbered each inning as it was
when games were monitored by telegraph ticker. Fans watching from
apartment roofs would look at home on the edges of a Norman
Rockwell painting. Unlike most parks, Wrigley is almost free of
advertising, easy on the eyes, even when the Cubs aren't. While
Fenway has a video screen in the outfield _ and did I mention that
my daughter Michelle worked at Fenway as a tour guide this summer?
_ there was no way in Wrigley to see a replay of three Cub fielders
barely avoiding a collision as a pop fly fell among them. But it
would have been nice to get a second look at Sammy Sosa's home run
on that crisp, sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Baseball's highlights replay best in the movie
memories of the mind. Late on our last night at Tiger Stadium, I
climbed to the last row of the upper deck along the first-base
line, where I worked as a teen-age usher in the 1960s. From that
high perch, I saw not the game in progress between the Tigers and
Texas but instead an old one in which Al Kaline threw out a cocky
rookie who tried to take an extra base on a single to right.
Instead of empty seats around me, I saw old pals, family members,
lovers and co-workers. Through the mist on this clear night, I
again saw Willie Horton throw out Lou Brock at home in the pivotal
play of the World Series victory over St. Louis in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the left-field roof, I saw again the thickening
clouds of black smoke from the 1967 riot, which grew in fury during
a Sunday afternoon game that July. Peering through the back vents
of the upper deck, I saw and smelled an overturned police car
burning in the celebration that followed the 1984 World Series. I
saw the revved-up Mark Fidrych, with long and curly hair, drawing
shrieks from a capacity crowd by pitching two-hour victories in
1976. Closing my eyes, I saw Ty Cobb steal home, spikes high, and
Hank Greenberg hitting a long home run to left.
</P>
<P>
   But my transistor radio jolted my ears and eyes back from the
past as Harwell's Georgia voice excitedly described Tony Clark's
two-run double off the right-field wall, the clinching hit of that
night's victory. Checking both the hour on my watch and the late
inning on the scoreboard, I left my high seat and walked back down
the steep, concrete steps and into the present, back to my son and
my friend and his son, to stroll down the long ramp from the upper
deck for the last time to the red bricks of the street and out
toward the future.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHEAST DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. FLORIDA PANTHERS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 30-34-18 (second place), missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: The biggest plus is the return of Pavel Bure from a
knee injury. ... General manager Bryan Murray has cleaned house of
some older high-priced veterans, including D Gord Murphy, F Johan
Garpenlov and F Kirk Muller, but he added G Trevor Kidd to replace
Kirk McLean and back up Sean Burke. D Lance Pitlick also was
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Panthers have missed the playoffs the past two
seasons and have only one postseason win since making the finals in
their third season. ... Bure returns to Vancouver on Nov. 5 for the
first time since being traded. ... Florida had a woeful 13.4
power-play percentage . ... Viktor Kozlov will be asked to be the
No. 1 center and needs to improve on his 16 goals.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 350 _ the Panthers league-high total of games
played by rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: The Murray brothers. Does Bryan fire coach Terry if
going with younger players fails _ or will he be canned himself?
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: A healthy Bure and the goalie tandem of Burke and Kidd
should lift the Panthers to the division title.
</P>
<P>
   2. WASHINGTON CAPITALS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 31-45-6 (third place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: There's a new owner, Ted Leonsis, and increasing
pressure on GM George McPhee and coach Ron Wilson for a turnaround.
No transactions of significance: Subtract Dale Hunter (retirement)
and add G Craig Billington (trade), F Ulf Dahlen (free agency) and
Joe Sacco (free agency).
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Capitals have been Team Band-Aid over the past
four seasons, losing 1,571 games to injuries. ... In the past three
seasons, the Caps pulled off this rarity: missed playoffs, made
finals, missed playoffs. ... Talent remains up front with Peter
Bondra (31 goals) and Adam Oates (42 assists), but younger forwards
must develop and stay healthy. ... The Caps gave up the first goal
in 49 games and won only nine.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Wilson has a better record in the playoffs
(12-9) than in the regular season (71-75-18).
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Oates, who has been chosen captain but scored 12
goals, his lowest total in 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: The odds have to be with the Capitals in the injury
department, and they should make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   3. CAROLINA HURRICANES
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 34-30-18 (first place), lost in first round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Hurricanes must recover from the death of D Steve
Chaisson in a car crash. They added a new arena, backup G Mark
Fitzpatrick and not much else. The team lost G Trevor Kidd in the
expansion draft, is missing holdout Keith Primeau and did not
re-sign Kevin Dineen or Ray Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Hurricanes will start with a nine-game trip,
while Raleigh Sports Arena is finished. The first home game is Oct.
29. ... Finn Sami Kapanen (24 goals) has emerged as a top scorer.
Ron Francis is coming off a 21-goal season but is 36. ... Primeau
led the team in goals (30) and points (62). ... Arturs Irbe is
coming off a career-best GAA of 2.22.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: $55 million _ Hurricanes' claimed losses in
their two seasons in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: GM Jim Rutherford, who is facing sluggish ticket
sales, mounting financial losses and had a suspect offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Look out below. Canes benefited from the problems of
others to win the division but should miss the playoffs this time.
</P>
<P>
   4. TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 19-54-9 (fourth place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Lightning might as well be an expansion team, with
new owner (Bill Davidson), GM (Rick Dudley), coach (Steve Ludzik),
goalie (Dan Cloutier from Rangers) and a number of other players.
Biggest losses: D Rob Zamuner, sent to Ottawa as compensation for
signing Dudley, and leading scorer Wendel Clark was traded late
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: All eyes will be on C Vincent Lecavalier to see
progress from his first season (13-15-28). ... Lightning will
attack more under Ludzik than it did under GM-coach Jacques Demers.
... Before selling, former owner Art Williams voided a trade for
Roman Turek, who would have been the starting goalie.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 36-109-19 _ the Lightning's record over the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Cloutier, who played behind Mike Richter, was the key
in a draft-day trade and must help maintain order on the ice while
Dudley tears apart and rebuilds team.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Lightning might be headed in the right direction, but
it won't translate into victories immediately. Tampa Bay could
repeat a last-place finish, which would be pleasing for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   5. ATLANTA THRASHERS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: First season.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: GM Don Waddell squeezed the most out of the
expansion draft process, getting two quality goalies (Damian Rhodes
and Norm Maracle) and a solid defense. He also swung a trade to get
the only prime draft pick he wanted _ Patrik Stefan. The one
debatable move was dealing highly touted minor-league forward Randy
Robitaille to Nashville for Denny Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Coach Curt Fraser, physical as a player, will have
his team play the same way. ... Goals could be hard to come by,
with Ray Ferraro and Nelson Emerson (13 each) as leaders from
1998-99. ... The team says it won't rush No. 1 pick Stefan, but
he'll get plenty of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 0 _ the number of non-WHA expansion teams that
have made the playoffs since 1970. Florida went 33-34-17 in
1993-94. More recently, Nashville went 28-47-7 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Rhodes, the clear No. 1 goalie and the team's best
shot at respectability in the first season.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Last place is most realistic. But the Thrashers could
pass Tampa Bay if Rhodes stands out, mistakes are kept to a minimum
and a couple of goal scorers are found.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHEAST DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 45-30-7 (second place), lost in Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: The biggest changes are in the front office, where
top personnel Mike Smith and Anders Hedberg are out. President Ken
Dryden increased the power of coach Pat Quinn, who now also is GM.
Leafs lost D Yannick Tremblay (expansion draft) but added backup G
Jimmy Waite (free agent).
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Leafs appeared to be on the way to the Cup finals
but managed 10 goals in four losses against Buffalo's Dominik Hasek
in the Eastern Conference finals. ... Leafs led the league in goals
(268) for first time in 52 years, led by Sergei Berezin (37) and
Mats Sundin (31). ... Defense (231 goals against) needs to improve
in front of G Curtis Joseph, who faced almost 30 shots per game and
was runner-up to Dominik Hasek in Vezina voting.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 256 _ Berezin's draft position in 1994. A lot of
scouts goofed.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Dryden, who made the decision to ship out Smith and
will take more blame than Quinn if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Deep at forward and strong in goal with Joseph and
Glenn Healy, Leafs will make another strong run at the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   2. OTTAWA SENATORS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 44-23-15 (first place), lost in first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Hard to imagine that one of the youngest, most
talented teams in the league could have had a worse offseason. The
Senators lost their general manager (Rick Dudley) for the second
season in a row, half of their goaltender rotation (Damian Rhodes)
and two players to free agency (Nelson Emerson and Lance Pitlick),
and they might be without their best player, Alexei Yashin, who
wants a contract extension. One plus: Defenseman Rob Zamuner
arrived from Tampa Bay as partial compensation for Dudley's exit.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: A franchise-best record didn't help in the
first-round series loss to Buffalo. Senators are extremely talented
but need to be more physical. ... Losing Rhodes to Thrashers
elevates Ron Tugnutt as the clear No. 1 goalie. Tugnutt is coming
off a career year (1.79 GAA, .925 svs.). ... If Yashin stays out,
Magnus Arvedson (21 goals), Andreas Dackell (15) and Radek Bonk
(16) must pick up the slack. ... Shawn McEachern's numbers
(31-25-56) could drop without Yashin on his line.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 22 _ Equals win totals by Rhodes and Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Tugnutt, with coach Jacques Martin scrapping his
goalie rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: The Senators won't approach 44 wins, but they could
match last year's first-round playoff elimination if things don't
settle down.
</P>
<P>
   3. BUFFALO SABRES
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 37-28-17 (fourth place), lost in Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Did not re-sign F Joe Juneau and lost D Darryl
Shannon in the expansion draft. Biggest transaction is yet to come:
Goalie Dominik Hasek announced his retirement, effective after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: There's no reason to believe Hasek will change his
mind, so the Sabres, after coming close, suddenly have one season
to win the Stanley Cup. ... Hasek has led the league in saves
percentage six seasons in a row and has won Vezina in five of the
past six. ... Miroslav Satan had a 40-goal season but disappeared
in the finals, partly because of an ankle injury. ... C Michael
Peca has emerged as one of the top all-around players in the game.
... The Sabres are one of the league's smartest positional teams
but lack scoring depth.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 11/3/99 _ the date of the only game this year
between Cup finalists Buffalo and Dallas, at Dallas. No word
whether Sabres coach Lindy Ruff will bring a video-replay machine
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Hasek. As always, team's chances hinge on his
acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Expect usual roller-coaster and another strong playoff
run, but Sabres will fall short of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   4. BOSTON BRUINS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 39-30-13 (third place), lost in second round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: A disastrous offseason: The team dropped top
goal-scorer Dmitri Khristich because GM Harry Sinden didn't like a
$2.8 million arbitration award. Also lost Tim Taylor to free agency
(Rangers) and top prospect Randy Robitaille (expansion draft).
Goalie Byron Dafoe also remains unsigned. Only significant
addition: Dave Andreychuk.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Expect coach Pat Burns, among the league's best, to
get fed up with the franchise's personnel decisions. ... Even
without Khristich, the team still has a terrific core of young
forwards: Jason Allison (23 goals), Joe Thornton (16), Sergei
Samsonov (25) and Anson Carter (24). ... Dafoe is coming off his
career season (32-23-11, 1.99, .926). ... Ray Bourque is in his
21st season with the Bruins. Only Gordie Howe (25) and Alex
Delvecchio (24) have been with one club longers. ... The Bruins
were the league's best penalty killers (89.2 percent) and were a
plus-26 on special-teams ratio.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 214 _ Bruins' goal total, their lowest since
1966-67.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Sinden, whose decisions are holding this team back.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Should be division's best but will struggle to get
into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   5. MONTREAL CANADIENS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 32-39-11 (fifth place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Big gain: Acquired Trevor Linden from Islanders for
a No. 1 pick. Big loss: Stephane Quintal signed with Rangers as a
free agent. Montreal also lost Brett Clark in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Linden has six 30-plus goal seasons in 11 years. ...
The Canadiens need improved seasons from Martin Rucinsky (17 goals,
minus-25), Brian Savage (16, minus-14) and Shayne Corson (12,
minus-10). ... Goalie Jeff Hackett played well after coming over
from Chicago late last season (.914 saves pct. with Canadiens, .871
with Blackhawks). ... The Habs were hurt by injuries: Six of the
top eight scorers missed at least 12 games. ... Canadiens were the
No. 1 road penalty-killing team but No. 27 on power play and gave
up 10 short-handed goals.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 184 _ The Canadiens' goals ranked next to last
in 1998-99. They didn't have a 20-goal scorer for the first time
since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Coach Alain Vigneault. It's not unusual for a
Montreal coach to be under fire, but in this case the problems are
more the result of management and finances.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Les last-place Habitants.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. PHILADELPHIA FLYERS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 37-26-19 (second place), lost in first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Biggest plus is return of Eric Lindros from a
collapsed lung. Biggest loss was death of D Dmitri Tertyshny,
killed in a boating acceident. Few other changes: F Mike Maneluk
signed, G Ron Hextall retired, F Jody Hull lost in the expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The lingering concerns: suspect defense, goaltending
and John LeClair's back problems. ... GM Bob Clarke made 12 deals
during last season, resulting in 14 new players. ... Coach Roger
Neilson is 10th on the career victory list (414) but still has his
detractors. ... The team is deep up front with Lindros, LeClair,
Mark Recchi, Mikael Renberg, Rod Brind'Amour, Keith Jones, et al.
... The Flyers hope for an impact from young C Simon Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 36 _ the age of goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, who
could be entering his last season with the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Clarke is a local hero, but how many coaches can one
man hire and fire before he gets his pink slip?
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Flyers might have taken a run at the Cup with Lindros
last season. If defense and goaltending hold up, Philly could be
looking at its first title in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   2. NEW JERSEY DEVILS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 47-24-11 (first place), lost in first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: A quiet offseason saw the retirement of Bobby
Carpenter and the loss of Dave Andreychuk (free agency) and Kevin
Dean (expansion draft). No significant acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Devils finished with the best record in the Eastern
Conference under first-year coach Robbie Ftorek but tumbled in the
first round of the playoffs. ... Jersey is short of stars but deep
in young, talented, two-way players. ... Devils had nine players
with at least 31 points past year. ... Goalie Martin Brodeur has
won 34 or more games each of the past four years. ... Petr Sykora
doubled his point total, 36 to 72.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 30 _ as in a 30-goal season. Devils haven't had
one since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Ftorek. Don't laugh. Another 47-win season won't go
far with fans if the Devils fail to advance past the second round
of the playoffs for the fifth season in a row. If Ftorek doesn't
last, look for reclaimed assistant Larry Robinson to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: GM Lou Lamoriello hardly was aggressive in the
offseason but the Devils still have enough to challenge for the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   3. NEW YORK RANGERS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 33-38-11 (fourth place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: If general manager Neil Smith goes down, he's going
to do it running up a heck of a bill on the Rangers' gold card. Six
free agents were signed _ Theo Fleury, Sylvain Lefebvre, Valeri
Kamensky, Stephane Quintal, Kirk McLean and Tim Taylor. But the
losses were big, as well. Wayne Gretzky and Jeff Beukeboom retired,
Dan Cloutier, Niklas Sundstrom and Marc Savard were traded, and
Chris Tamer was lost in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Deals might not mean much, especially if Fleury wilts
again in the playoffs as he did in Colorado. ... Coach John Muckler
must try to create chemistry on a team that was a strange mix of
too old and too young. ... Rising F Manny Malhotra could have a
breakthrough season. ... Rangers could be less physical this year
with the absence of Tamer, Beukeboom and Ulf Samuelsson, traded
late last season to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: $67 million _ total of guaranteed contracts of
six free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Smith and Muckler, whose Rangers have missed the
playoffs the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Spending spree won't pay off, and CEO David Checketts
will clean house.
</P>
<P>
   4. PITTSBURGH PENGUINS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 38-30-14 (third place), lost in second round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Mario Lemieux rescued the team from bankruptcy.
That's a plus. But the financial paralysis and uncertain future
prevented GM Craig Patrick from fixing roster holes.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: F Jaromir Jagr is coming off MVP season with
league-leading 127 points (44 goals). ... Patrick did good job
re-signing key free agents, including Martin Straka (35 goals),
Alexei Kovalev (23) and Robert Lang (21). ... Defenseman Kevin
Hatcher enters the last season of his contract and could be traded
before unrestricted free agency. ... Defense might not be great,
but not so bad that G Tom Barrasso's goals against ballooned from
2.07 to 2.55. ... Coach Kevin Constantine did a good job holding
team together but has a shaky relationship with Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 343 _ Jagr's shots on goal, double that of any
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Barrasso, who missed 31 games with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Lemieux can't help Penguins anymore, unless he comes
back to play.
</P>
<P>
   5. NEW YORK ISLANDERS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 24-48-10 (fifth place), missed playoffs
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Butch Goring enters a mess as coach he didn't
witness as a player on Long Island. Six-player, three-draft-pick
trade included Ziggy Palffy going to Los Angeles and top young F
Olli Jokinen heading to Isles. Also gone: Trevor Linden to Montreal
for a No. 1 pick, Joe Sacco (free agency) and David Harlock
(expansion draft). Incoming: free agents Tony Hrkac and Chris
Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: GM Mike Milbury did well in the Palffy trade. But
forget any chance of serious rebuilding program as long as three
(stooges) owners Howard and Eddie Milstein and Steve Gluckstern are
ordering Milbury to trim payroll. ... Kenny Jonsson is top
defenseman, but he had two concussions last season. ... Goalie
Felix Potvin was not brilliant after coming over in a trade from
Toronto. Potvin's save percentage (.893) wasn't significantly
better than backup's Wade Flaherty (.892).
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 6 _ number of Islanders coaches since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Potvin, who had injury problems and walked out on the
Leafs last year, has a full season to show whether he still has it.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Islanders have missed playoffs five consecutive
seasons. This season will be the sixth.

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. DETROIT RED WINGS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 43-32-7 (first place), lost in second round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: The Wings did not re-sign three of the four players
brought in at the trading deadline last season _ D Ulf Samuelsson,
F Wendel Clark and G Bill Ranford. They signed goalies Ken Wregget
and Manny Legace to replace Norm Maracle (expansion draft). Biggest
plus was re-signing D Nicklas Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: D Chris Chelios looked old in playoff series vs.
Colorado. ... Without Lidstrom, Wings' defense would have been a
major problem. Even with him, team wants to improve on last year's
10th place in goals-against (202). ... If coach Scotty Bowman
didn't think Lidstrom would return, he might have retired.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 15-2-1 _ Wings' record in 18 games (9-2-1
regular season, 6-0 playoffs) until losing four in a row to
Colorado in the Western semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Forwards Brendan Shanahan and Sergei Fedorov, both of
whom fizzled in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Wings still have talent to challenge for the Cup, but
age and slipping defense could ruin hopes.
</P>
<P>
   2. ST. LOUIS BLUES
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 37-32-13 (second place), lost in second round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: The Blues landed new No. 1 goalie Roman Turek from
Dallas for only a second-round pick after the Stars' pre-expansion
draft deal with Tampa fell through. Grant Fuhr was shipped to
Calgary to clear roster room. Blues also lost F Terry Yake in the
expansion draft and didn't re-sign enforcer Tony Twist, later
injured in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Without Brett Hull, F Pavel Demitra took over as the
top scorer (89 points). ... The offense is not overpowering but
will be deep enough if F Geoff Courtnall (concussions) and F Jim
Campbell can bounce back from off years. The two combined for 53
goals two years ago but only nine last season. ... Turek was 16-3-3
with a 2.08 GAA last year. ... Al MacInnis and Chris Pronger are
among the league's top defensemen, but MacInnis turned 36 in July.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 30.6 _ Pronger's minutes per game last season,
tops in the league. MacInnis was fourth at 29.1.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Turek. All scouts think he's ready. Now he has to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Terrific team that can skate and hit. If Turek
blossoms as the No. 1 goalie, this team is the dark horse to go to
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   3. CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 29-41-12 (third place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: The Blackhawks wanted F Nelson Emerson as a free
agent but were outbid by the Thrashers, so they settled on F Wendel
Clark. They also added D Bryan McCabe in a draft-day trade with
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Hawks were 13-6-4 after Lorne Molleken replaced Dirk
Graham as coach. ... Motivator Molleken gave each player an
arrowhead to ``point'' them in the right direction. ... What
Chicago really needs is goal-scoring: F Tony Amonte accounted for
44 of the team's 202. ... Hawks goalie coach Vladislav Tretiak
believes Jocelyn Thibault (2.71 GAA, .905 svs., after trade with
Montreal ) can become one of the league's top goalies ... The team
needs to improve the penalty-killing unit that gave up 80
power-play goals last season.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Minus-16 _ Free-agent bust Doug Gilmour's
team-worst plus-minus ratio last season.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: F Eric Daze, whose 42 points last year were not
commensurate with a $2 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Molleken stopped the leaking, but he would need to
work miracles to make this team a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   4. NASHVILLE PREDATORS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 28-47-7 (fourth place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: They made two trades with the Thrashers, dealing F
Andrew Brunette, after a disappointing 11 goals, for a draft pick
and F Denny Lambert for top minor-league prospect F Randy
Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Robitaille had 102 points in the AHL last season and
could added needed scoring punch. ... Goalie Mike Dunham is coming
off a solid first season but was missing from training camp as a
restricted free agent. ... Expansion draft pick F Cliff Ronning led
the Predators with 53 points. ... Last year's No. 1, F David
Legwand, played only one game and spent most of the year in the
juniors. Nashville expects some contributions. ... Dramatic
improvement is needed on special teams: The penalty-killing team
finished 27th (79 percent), and the power play was 25th (12.3).
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 4-12-1 _ Dunham's record after returning from a
groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: F Sergei Krivokrasov, who is coming off a career-best
25-goal season but faced charges of spousal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: The 28-win total was fifth-best for expansion teams in
the modern era, but topping that will be difficult unless more
scoring is found.
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. DALLAS STARS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 51-19-12 (first place), won Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Stars did not re-sign a number of older free agents
_ forwards Pat Verbeek, Tony Hrkac, David Reid, Craig Ludwig. They
also dealt coveted backup goalie Roman Turek to St. Louis before
losing him in the expansion draft and dealt F Jason Botterill to
the Thrashers for D Jamie Pushor.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: After 51 victories in the regular season and a
Stanley Cup, GM Bob Gainey and coach Ken Hitchcock both thought
significant changes necessary to stay on top. ... Jon Sim, Juha
Lind and Brad Lukowich are among younger players who might land
roster spots to replace unsigned veterans. ... The big news is that
Hitchcock, master of the 2-1 win, vows his team will open up the
offense. That change would thrill Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk,
Jamie Langenbrunner, et al. ... Words G Ed Belfour won't have to
hear anymore: can't win the big one.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: The Stars have averaged 109 points over the past
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Gainey. The only thing harder than winning is winning
through a transition in personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: If Hitchcock succeeds in opening up the offense
without leaving Belfour exposed, nobody can touch the Stars. Either
way, Dallas has the talent to challenge again.
</P>
<P>
   2. PHOENIX COYOTES
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 39-31-12 (second place), lost in first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Bobby Francis replaces Jim Schoenfeld as coach. More
minuses than pluses in the personnel area: Subtract F Mike
Stapleton (expansion draft), D Oleg Tverdovsky (traded to Anaheim
for Travis Green) and G Jimmy Waite (free agent). Only significant
addition was D Todd Gill (free agent).
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Phoenix was the story of early last season, starting
17-3-3, but it was under .500 thereafter (22-28-9). ... Francis
wants to beef up the offense, but it is limited after Keith Tkachuk
(36 goals), Jeremy Roenick (24) and Rick Tocchet (26). ... Warning:
Tocchet is 35. ... If Francis opens things up and Coyotes aren't as
protective in their end as they were with Schoenfeld, the pressure
will be on G Nikolai Khabibulin (2.13 GAA, .923 svs.) to equal his
success. But he remains unsigned. ... The Coyotes' 41 power-play
goals last season ranked as second-fewest in the league to
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 1987 _ the last season Winnipeg/Phoenix won a
playoff series. The Jets/Coyotes are 0-for-7 since and missed the
postseason five times.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: GM Bobby Smith. It wasn't an active offseason, and
the Green-Tverdovsky trade seems lopsided the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Strong goaltending and Tkachuk and Roenick should keep
Coyotes in second, but Francis will need to find more scoring for
the team to do damage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   3. SAN JOSE SHARKS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 31-33-18 (fourth place), lost in first round of
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Acquired F Niklas Sundstrom from Tampa Bay, which
acquired him from N.Y. Rangers on draft day, for four players,
including D Andrei Zyuzin. The Sharks also get back D Gary Suter,
who missed all but one game last season with a torn triceps. Free
agent Joe Murphy (25 goals) was not re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Sharks must improve on a power play that
converted on a franchise record-low 13.3 percent of chances. ...
The team kept F Vincent Damphousse, acquired late last season from
Montreal, from departing as a free agent. ... Coach Darryl Sutter
seems to have the respect of players and has an impressive streak
going: 18 consecutive seasons in the playoffs as a player or coach.
... Goaltending was divided between Mike Vernon and Steve Shields,
but Shields (2.22 GAA, .921 svs.) might be ready to take over as
starter. ... F Jeff Friesen led the Sharks in scoring with only 57
points.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 196 _ San Jose's goal total last season, the
fewest in league history for a playoff-qualifier since Minnesota's
191 in a 78-game season in 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Sundstrom and Damphousse, a former 30- and 40-goal
scorer with Toronto and Montreal, both of whom are being counted on
to strengthen the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Sharks could challenge for second and pose a threat in
the playoffs. They took Colorado to six games in the first round
last season.
</P>
<P>
   4. ANAHEIM MIGHTY DUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 35-34-13 (third place), lost in first round.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Most significant additions were D Oleg Tverdovsky
from Phoenix for F Travis Green and F Ted Donato from Ottawa for G
Patrick Lalime. Biggest losses were F Tomas Sandstrom (returned to
Sweden) and D Jamie Pushor (expansion draft).
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Ducks are coming off only their second winning
season and improved by nine wins (18 points) over the previous
year. ... The highly skilled Tverdovsky will help a power play that
already clicked at a league-best 22 percent last season. ... Craig
Hartsburg is among the new wave of coaches whose system stresses
aggressive forechecking. ... Biggest problem is finding balanced
scoring. After Teemu Selanne (107 points) and Paul Kariya (101),
the next closest Duck was Steve Rucchin (62). ... Goalie Guy Hebert
is coming off his career season (31 wins, 2.42 GAA, .922 svs.).
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: $30 million _ value of Kariya's three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Donato, a former 20-goal scorer who dropped to 16 and
11 the past two seasons and is being counted on to balance the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: The Ducks are ascending under general manager Pierre
Gauthier and could rise as high as second place. But they're not
quite ready to challenge for the Western Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   5. LOS ANGELES KINGS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 32-45-5 (fifth place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Larry Robinson is out as coach, replaced by Andy
Murray. Numerous changes in personnel include acquiring F Ziggy
Palffy and F Bryan Smolinski in a trade with the Islanders, for a
package including Olli Jokinen, and persuading D Aki Berg to return
from Sweden. Kings lost F Ray Ferraro and D Doug Bodger as free
agents, and F Matt Johnson in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: F Luc Robitaille's 39 goals last season nearly
matched his output the previous seasons combined (40). ...
Injury-prone D Rob Blake missed two games and has played only one
full season in the past four. ... Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr
are a great goalie tandem if they can stay healthy. ... F Jozef
Stumpel needs to bounce back from an off-season. ... Finnish import
Jere Karalahti should help the defense.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 9 for 103 (8.7 percent) _ Kings' power play in
one- and two-goal losses last season.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: General manager Dave Taylor, who is banking on a
relatively obscure coach to turn around an underachieving team and
also needs to fill seats in a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Palffy should improve offense, but its hard to imagine
L.A. moving up in a division in which everybody else is
significantly better over last season.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHWEST DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. COLORADO AVALANCHE
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 44-28-10 (first place), lost in Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: The Avalanche was the biggest victim of the Rangers'
offseason shopping spree, losing F Theo Fleury, F Valeri Kamensky
and D Sylvain Lefebvre. Also, F Dale Hunter retired, F Warren
Rychel was not re-signed, and backup G Craig Billington was traded
to Washington. And incoming? Goalie prospect Marc Denis is Patrick
Roy's new backup.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The worst news was not the defections of Fleury and
Co. but F Peter Forsberg's shoulder surgery, which will wipe out at
least the first month of his season. ... Roy had ``minor'' surgery
to remove debris from his right hip but is expected to be recovered
by the opener. ... Despite the losses, the team still is talented
and deep, just younger. Calder Trophy winner Chris Drury, Milan
Hejduk and rookie Alex Tanguay inherit bigger roles in the offense
with Fleury, Kamensky and Rychel gone.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 412 _ Roy's victories, fourth on the career list
behind Terry Sawchuk (447), Jacques Plante (434) and Tony Esposito
(423). Heat's on: Forsberg, whose offense and leadership will be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Colorado seemed to be spent after taking a 3-2 series
lead against Dallas last season in the Western finals. A younger
team could put the Avalanche over the top and back in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   2. EDMONTON OILERS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 33-37-12 (second place), lost in first round of
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Former defenseman Kevin Lowe is in as the new coach,
replacing the fired Ron Low. The Oilers lost captain Kelly
Buchberger in the expansion draft and are in the middle of a
contract squabble with leading scorer F Bill Guerin (64 points).
Backup G Bill Ranford was signed after being released by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: Dallas offered G Roman Turek to the Oilers for F Ryan
Smyth (31 points), but GM Glen Sather declined, believing that
Smyth will develop into a star. ... Another reason Sather said no
to Turek: G Tommy Salo went 8-2-2, 2.31 after being acquired from
the Islanders. ... Penalty-killing ranked 21st in the league and
must improve. ... D Tom Poti made the league's all-rookie team, but
it's a matter of time before he gets too expensive to keep.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 67 _ power-play goals allowed by Oilers last
season, most of any playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: F Doug Weight. He led the Oilers in scoring five
seasons in a row (1993-98), but missed 43 games with knee problems.
A 20-goal/70-point season is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: The Oilers probably will sneak into the playoffs, but
they won't go far. It would be interesting to see what Sather,
perhaps still the league's best, could do with a decent budget.
This could be his last season.
</P>
<P>
   3. VANCOUVER CANUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Replay: 23-47-12 (fourth place), missed playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Last sip from Cup: None.
</P>
<P>
   Plus/minus: Drafted its hockey and marketing centerpieces, twins
Daniel and Henrik Sedin of Sweden. But both elected to return to
amateur teams for one more year. GM Brian Burke dealt D Bryan
McCabe to Chicago on draft day and signed two free agents _ D Doug
Bodger, who bombed out in L.A., and F Andrew Cassels.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: F Mark Messier has only 35 goals and 108 points in
two seasons with the Canucks. Messier had 83 goals and 183 points
in his final two seasons with the Rangers. ... More production is
needed from F Alex Mogilny, whose goal total (14) was not on the
same level as his salary ($4.2 million). ... F Markus Naslund is
coming off career-best 36 goals. ... The Canucks haven't made the
playoffs the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 5 _ Number of Canucks head coaches in the past
four seasons: Rick Ley, Pat Quinn, Tom Renney, Mike Keenan, Marc
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Burke. The team is for sale and is losing money, and
his golden-boy draft picks are in high school. The GM will take the
most heat.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: No worse than last season, but probably no better.

Savard from the Rangers. Finally signed 1997 No. 1 pick Daniel
Tkaczuk. Lost G Ken Wregget and F Andrew Cassels to free agency and
F Ed Ward in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Note this: The Flames probably overachieved to win 30 games,
which tells you something about their talent level. ... The Flames
have high hopes that Savard can develop into a top scorer, but he
has only 51 points in 98 games. ... Valeri Bure (26), Cory Stillman
(27) and Jarome Iginla (28) are the only returning 20-goal scorers.
By the numbers: 0 _ number of playoff series the Flames have won
since winning the Stanley Cup in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on: Sutter. The contract aside, this wasn't a 30-win team
last season, and the coach will be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Yuck.

 &HT;    Stars fade, best still rises in West
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Gretzky's first season in the NHL was Atlanta's
last. Twenty years later, the Flames have been replaced by the
Thrashers and the league bears little resemblance to the one
Gretzky crashed as an 18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL opens its regular season Friday, having ballooned to 28
franchises. Whether having T-shirts stands in multiple markets can
compensate for the loss of the league's No.1 ambassador is the big
question. Gretzky retired after last season, was rammed into the
Hall of Fame and will be honored in opening night ceremonies when
his first team, Edmonton, plays host to his last, the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   That matchup serves as a microcosm for the NHL's problems.
Edmonton is forever a team loaded with young talent but is too
cash-poor to keep the players. The Oilers and other Canadian teams
continue to struggle financially and threaten to move somewhere
south of the U.S. border, where $1 in revenues is not worth 65
cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, conversely, spent $67 million on six free agents in
the offseason, including forwards Theo Fleury and Valeri Kamensky,
both of whom were deemed too expensive for still-loaded Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole tradition of seeing guys come out of your farm team
and play with your team for 10 or 12 years really hasn't been the
case for a few years now and it's going to become less so,''
Toronto Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ``It's just what's
happening in the game today.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Dallas, Colorado, Detroit, Philadelphia and
Toronto will be among the teams challenging for the Stanley Cup. If
Buffalo makes another run, it better hurry. Goalie Dominik Hasek
says this will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Another star gone.

FASTER THAN A SPEEDING DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP 
LET THEM COUNT THE WAYS 
BORING AND FLASHY 
THE SEARCH FOR TALENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Yankees had never gone to the World Series with free
agents like Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, David Cone and David
Wells, if the Atlanta Braves had never won division championships
with free agents like Greg Maddux, Fred McGriff and Terry
Pendleton, if the Florida Marlins had not won the World Series with
free agents like Kevin Brown, Moises Alou and Bobby Bonilla, the
Arizona Diamondbacks could be accused of buying themselves a
division championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diamondbacks, who won the National League West title
Friday night, have gained their place in baseball history the
old-fashioned way _ they have earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Playing by the rules of the game, just as George Steinbrenner
did so well in restoring the Yankees to the top of the game in the
mid-1970s when free agency began, the 2-year-old Diamondbacks have
vaulted to the top far faster than any expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in their second seasons, seven of the other 13
expansion teams finished in last place, four lost more than 100
games, four others lost more than 95 and eight finished more than
30 games from first place. Only one had a winning record. But in
establishing a standard for expansion teams, the Diamondbacks have
done it with far greater dexterity than the use of a checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Diamondbacks, who could play the Mets in the playoffs _
if the Mets join them in the playoffs _ signed free agents like
Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Steve Finley. But they traded
for Luis Gonzalez, Tony Womack, Matt Mantei and Dan Plesac, not to
mention Matt Williams last year, and they plucked Omar Daal, Brian
Anderson and Hanley Frias in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell was a free agent the Diamondbacks signed for their
first season. Asked when he thought people would begin saying
Arizona bought a championship, the second baseman said, ``They've
already said it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added: ``That may be the case; we went out and got some
players. But everybody talks like we signed 40 free agents. We
didn't. We made some good trades.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jerry Colangelo, the team's managing partner, sanctioned _
make that encouraged _ spending for free agents, the baseball
people, from General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. to Manager Buck
Showalter, made shrewd personnel decisions. The key contribution
was made by Sandy Johnson, the baseball lifer who is the assistant
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of another club said Johnson was the force behind
the trades for Gonzalez, the NL leader in hits; Womack, the league
leader in stolen bases; and Mantei, the closer, without whom the
Diamondbacks would not be heading for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took prospects and traded them for players who could help
the Diamondbacks now,'' the executive said. ``He's about winning
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also pushed to keep Frias in the major leagues when the
young shortstop was having trouble keeping his batting average as
high as .170. Johnson knew the 23-year-old, from the Dominican
Republic and out of the Texas organization, would be certain to
blossom.
</P>
<P>
   A flower grows in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   When Andy Fox, the team's regular shortstop, was out from Aug.
28 through Sept. 18 with a rib injury, Frias filled in most of the
time and hit .396 in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Matt and Jay had to carry the load and it was
tough,'' Johnson said. ``This year it seems like everybody stepped
up and everybody stayed healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   A seven-game winning streak in the last week of May catapulted
the Diamondbacks into first place, where they remained through
June. The San Francisco Giants supplanted the upstart
southwesterners at the top of the division for the first three
weeks of July, when the Diamondbacks lost 12 of 18.
</P>
<P>
   But then Arizona reeled off a string of winning streaks, and 30
victories in 38 games. The Diamondbacks were not only back in
first, but they also had an 8{-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, the Diamondbacks, dissatisfied with the
offensive production of first baseman Travis Lee, summoned Erubiel
Durazo from the minors. The move has turned out to be as good as
all of the others. In less than 40 percent of the number of
at-bats, the 25-year-old Mexican has two more home runs than Lee
and half the runs batted in. Durazo, at .316, is also outhitting
Lee by 79 points.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Diamondbacks are one of the most well-rounded
crews in the league, ranking second in runs scored, possessing one
of three earned run averages under 4.00 and fielding one of the
three best defensive teams.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Randy Johnson is No. 1 in ERA, strikeouts, innings
pitched and complete games, while Gonzalez leads in hits, Womack is
tops in stolen bases and Williams ranks third in RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bell. At the age of 33, he has turned into a home
run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My year probably stands out more than anyone else's,'' Bell
said, by no means speaking immodestly. ``I don't think anyone
considers me, and I don't consider myself a home run hitter. It's
just kind of happened this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed his unexpected power to his place in the lineup,
behind Womack and ahead of Gonzalez and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tony gets on first,'' Bell said, ``it puts a lot of
pressure on the pitchers to speed up their delivery home. Instead
of making a quality pitch, they leave the pitch out over the plate.
With Gonzo and Matt hitting behind me, it puts pressure on the
pitchers to throw strikes to me to try to get me out instead of
facing those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is more shocked than I about what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, on the other hand, have not shocked anybody.
They have just impressed everybody. They have gone from last place
with a 65-97 record, to a division championship with more than 90
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together a team that looked like it was going to be
competitive,'' Bell said. ``It has turned out to be everything you
want from a competitive team.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Let Them Count the Ways
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has always thrived on statistics, but computers are
responsible for escalating statistics to absurd levels. Latest
example:
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones of Atlanta, the Braves report, can become the
first player in history to hit .300, score 100 runs, drive in 100,
hit 40 home runs and 40 doubles, walk 100 times and steal 20 bases.
Why not throw in the one triple and the six sacrifice flies he has
and see where that places him?
</P>
<P>
   It recalls Mickey Mantle's reaction about 10 years ago to Jose
Canseco's feat of becoming the first player to have 40 home runs
and 40 stolen bases in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known it was going to be such a big deal,'' Mantle
remarked, ``I would have done it four or five times.''
</P>
<P>
   Boring and Flashy
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura, the Mets' third baseman, was talking about the
low-key, boring baseball personality he and his infield teammate,
John Olerud, possess. Another of their infield partners, Ventura
said, is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he said of Rey Ordonez, ``Rey is like any other
Latin shortstop. He's flashy and loud, the epitome of the Latin
shortstop. He has more of the flair and the energy that the rest of
us don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The question was raised later about whether Ventura was guilty
of the kind of ethnic stereotyping that has put some sports people
in trouble. Ozzie Guillen of Atlanta, a veteran shortstop from
Venezuela, was asked what he thought. Not only wasn't he offended
by Ventura's remark, but he also confirmed Ventura's
characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we stay in this game,'' Guillen said. ``I think
Latin shortstops, when they come up here, they have to do a little
extra. They don't have the power of Garciaparra or Jeter or Ripken.
When people go scout in Latin America, they're looking for flashy
shortstops. They're not looking for a power hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Guillen added, plays made by Ordonez and his
contemporaries, including himself, are overrated. ``Sometimes they
make plays look tougher than they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Guillen made a startling admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather play like Robin Ventura and never make a mistake
like he does,'' Guillen said. ``We're going to make more mistakes
than him. Ordonez will make more mistakes than Robin because of the
way he plays. I don't think he can play different. He has to play
the way he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do Latin American shortstops play the way they do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because the infields where they play growing up are
real bad,'' Guillen said. ``They got to be ready to catch the ball.
American kids have nice facilities. They're always playing at nice
fields. They have all the equipment. Their parents take them to the
ball game. We play on sandlots, on streets, in the middle of the
weeds, all kinds of rocks all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why we have to be flashy, because we don't know
when the ball's going to take a bad hop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Search for Talent
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers, in desperate need of an infusion of
talent, puzzled some baseball executives by hiring Dean Taylor as
their general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rules and contracts guy,'' an executive of another club
said. ``He's never been involved in player development or scouting.
He's going to have to put together a whole group for development
and scouting. They need someone who's aggressive in getting
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor served as assistant general manager with the Braves under
John Schuerholz for nine years. He was the executive who in 1991
discovered a loophole in the rules governing post-season rosters
that has allowed teams to put an injured player on their 40-man
major league rosters, then substitute a healthy player for him and
use him in the post-season.

 &HT;    Holyfield fighting for a legacy
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With three heavyweight championships in his career
portfolio, Evander Holyfield believes his position in boxing
history is already solidified. But how? As a quality fighter who
beat an underwhelming cast of foes? Or as an all-time great who
conquered all challengers of his generation? Or somewhere in
between?
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield contends: ``I don't fight for history. I fight for my
love of the game.'' Yet, how he's remembered as a fighter matters
to him. A lot. And he knows what he does in his Nov. 13 rematch
with Lennox Lewis could go a long way toward solidifying his
status.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason he's so committed to overcoming the physical
issues of the first fight, which ended in a controversial draw
although Lewis controlled the bout in most observers' minds.
Holyfield complained of leg cramps and general lethargy. Now,
Holyfield is into a three-times-a-day training regimen since
shifting his workout headquarters from Atlanta to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning, he jogs. He lifts weights in afternoons
and works with a ballet instructor on stretching in the evenings.
In two weeks, he'll add sparring to that mix. All the while, he's
on a diet emphasizing nutrition and balanced food groups. This with
an eye on the fight _ and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing training right now that I'd usually complain
about,'' he said. ``But not this time. It has to be done to get
ready, to give myself every chance to jump into (Lewis') chest.''
</P>
<P>
   And to elevate his historical position. Talk to Holyfield about
it, and it's clear it's something he's given considerable thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just my opinion,'' Holyfield said. ``You look at
everybody in boxing who is called `great.' Look at their records
and then look at mine. Let's take Muhammad Ali. Ali was great. No
question. He was a three-time heavyweight champion. Well, Evander
did that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who'll be 37 next month, rose from the bar stool
then. He grabbed the remote control and turned down the sound on
his projector screen television. His excitement was evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you look at the tough guys Ali fought,'' he added.
``Well, there was Joe Fraizer, George Foreman, Sonny Liston. Those
were his biggest fights. Now, who did Evander fight? Well, there
was Mike Tyson twice, Riddick Bowe (three times), Michael Moorer
twice and Lennox Lewis _ all who were champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has yet to be beaten, but Holyfield considers that a
formality. ``He will get punished,'' he said of his British
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But back to history. ``Ali traveled the world and touched and
inspired a lot of people,'' Holyfield went on. ``Well, Evander has
inspired a whole lot of people, too, around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's inspired to fight because it's his passion and he's
mastered it. But he backed off from his July proclamation of four
more fights and going on a ``world tour'' promoting boxing before
one finale bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave the game because there's no one who can beat
me.... I've fought every guy who was good, every champion in the
'90s,'' he said. ``Who didn't I fight? Tyson was the champion from
'86 to '90. Buster Douglas beat Tyson. Well, I beat Buster Douglas.
I beat Bowe. I beat Michael Moorer. I beat Foreman. Next is Lewis.
Then who's left?''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield understands who paved the way for his career; he
reveres the past champions. ``Ali, Fraizer, Foreman, Floyd
Patterson set the ground work,'' he said. ``It would be wrong to
put my name with theirs. I learned from them. That _ and the modern
times _ have given me an advantage. I'm supposed to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a better, easier path than Ali. There's no war for me
to contend with like he had. I learned from Joe Louis that you can
retire and have money.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield certainly will do that, whenever he quits. ``Even in
earnings,'' he said, ``no one has made more money in the game than
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is to know when to get out of the game. No need to
take an unneccessary chance for peanuts _ $10 million _ and fight
some young guy who might beat me. Not because he's better, but
because he's younger. I want to be remembered as I am, not as I
was. I don't want people to say I stayed too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff I've done over the years that people
haven't looked at. I guess when I'm gone, they'll give me my due.''

 &HT;    Orioles' streak comes too late

<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   AL EAST
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask about Baltimore's recent 13-game winning streak.
Manager Ray Miller still is going to be fired after the season. Cal
Ripken is out with back surgery. The roster is still littered with
aging, used-up players.
</P>
<P>
   So why now? Right-hander Scott Erickson, who started 1-8, has
gone 14-3 since. Rookie Jason Johnson has five wins in a row, and
Sid Ponson could win 15 games. Two rookies, second baseman Jerry
Hairston and center fielder Eugene Kingsale, have brought life to
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're having a lot more fun playing,'' pitcher Mike
Mussina said. ``We've mixed some youth in with veterans and we're
getting some better pitching.''...
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Pat Hentgen reads in every town that the Blue Jays
will dump him this winter. ``I'd like to play my whole career
here,'' he said. ``I mean, I've been a Jay now for 14 years, and I
don't see how anyone in my shoes would like to keep reading it.
I've been a Blue Jay since I was 17.''

<P>
   Hargrove touchy on Yankees
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has gone 10-22 against playoff candidates New York,
Texas and Boston. Manager Mike Hargrove, who has driven this club
harder than past editions, called a team meeting after a 9-4,
four-error drubbing by the Yankees _ to praise the team for the way
it ``had accomplished a lot, and for them to go out and have some
fun the rest of the way, and let's finish this up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hargrove was touchy about losing seven of 10 to the Yankees.
Asked about the kind of message that sent to New York, he snapped,
``If I want to send a message to Joe Torre, I'll write him a
letter.''...
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times in Kansas City: With Jermaine Dye (114),
rookie Carlos Beltran (104) and Mike Sweeney (101), the Royals have
three 100-RBI seasons for the first time in their history. They
also have no pitcher with a winning record on the active roster.

</P>
<P>
   Hudson catches fire for A's
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland A's liked Tim Hudson enough in the 1997 draft that
they selected him in the sixth round out of Auburn. However, they
also liked three other pitchers enough to draft them ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Hudson made it to Class AA, but he lost nine
games at Huntsville in '98 and wasn't among the 26 pitchers the A's
invited to spring camp. At 160 pounds, he did not look impressive,
and while he had good action on a splitter and slider, he needed
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, the same Tim Hudson won his first major-league game
and then reeled off 10 wins in his first 11 decisions. Without him,
the A's would not be a playoff contender. With him next season,
Oakland has another young contributor on what should be a dangerous
team in coming years....
</P>
<P>
   Former Toronto and Baltimore general manager Pat Gillick already
has had a clandestine ``informal'' interview for the Seattle
general manager spot. Ex-Yankees and Astros GM Bob Watson
interviews this week.

 &HT;    Fan-friendly Marlins owner

   ATLANTA _

   NL EAST
</P>
<P>
   Baseball let in a live wire when it approved the sale of the
Florida Marlins to John W. Henry. He is opinionated, he's rich, and
he has a heart. An episode at Pro Player Stadium during last week's
sparsely attended Montreal doubleheader proves the point.
</P>
<P>
   Ryne Richardson, a fan from Washington, was visiting Miami and
decided to take in the games Tuesday, one of a handful of fans
buying upper-deck general-admission seats, with maybe 1,000 people
in the stadium. Suddenly, an usher introduced Henry, who invited
the whole section to sit in some $110 seats behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most down-to-earth guy, being a millionaire,''
Richardson said. ``The usher said that he was the owner. I thought
he was just joking with us.''...
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Philadelphia manager Terry Francona said the
next 20 games, all against playoff contenders, would be a gauge of
the Phillies' competitiveness. The team promptly ripped off 17
losses against three wins.

<P>
   Brewers consider managers
</P>
<P>
   Dean Taylor's next trick, after landing Milwaukee's general
manager job, is to heed his boss' father. Wendy Selig-Prieb,
Brewers president and daughter of commissioner Bud Selig, has some
pressure to hire a minority manager, because her father put out a
directive to all clubs to give serious consideration to minority
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees hitting instructor Chris Chambliss has been
reported as a primary candidate, and Atlanta hitting coach Don
Baylor's name also is circulating. Others drawing consideration are
Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey Sr., Philadelphia coach Hal McRae, San
Diego coach Davey Lopes and New York Yankees coach Willie
Randolph.... Houston is doing its best to avoid worrying about the
standings and on-charging Cincinnati. Outfielder Carl Everett said,
``I don't believe you should look back. Ask Lot's wife.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rockies might land Reds' Bell
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had identified Buddy Bell as a primary managerial
candidate, which will push Cincinnati to determine if it really
wants to keep him on as a director of player personnel. Bell is
viewed as the Reds' most logical choice to replace manager Jack
McKeon, who doesn't seem ready to retire but is haggling with
management over a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   New Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd has raided Cleveland's
front office, where he once was an assistant GM. O'Dowd had hired
Bill Schmidt, the Indians' national cross-checker, as his new
scouting director and Cleveland scouting director Josh Byrnes as
his assistant general manager. Boyd Coffie, minor-league field
coordinator the last two years in Cleveland, has the same post with
the Rockies....
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield has advised the Dodgers not to trade away right
fielder Raul Mondesi, despite his demands to leave. ``If you give
Mondy some more positive influences in here, that will help,'' he
said. Sheffield's comments came the same day he missed batting
practice because he thought the Dodgers had an off-day.

 &HT;    Saving face after Shulock-Alvarez situation
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It will take time before the John Shulock-Wilson
Alvarez situation is forgotten. Alvarez, the Tampa Bay left-hander,
swears he wasn't trying to take Shulock's head off last week when
his misguided fastball blasted Shulock in the mask. The 20-year
umpire said cryptically, ``He's going to get his.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Anaheim on Monday, Alvarez was losing 7-1 when catcher
Mike DeFelice signaled for a fastball. DeFelice said later he
called for a breaking ball, but Alvarez threw a heater that hit
Shulock in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Shulock began ranting at Alvarez, so much that manager Larry
Rothschild pulled him. Shulock then began poking DeFelice in the
chest protector while venting during the pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Wilson would try to hurt somebody,'' Rothschild
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have a way of evening out in this game,'' Shulock said,
``and one of these days somebody is going to hit a line drive off
the side of his head, and I'll be the first guy laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shulock was suspended by the league Friday for the final three
games his crew is to work this season and fined him an undisclosed
amount.
</P>
<P>
   RUSTY HURTING
</P>
<P>
   What the Texas Rangers had hoped would not happen has come to
pass. Outfielder Rusty Greer, struck near his left eye in the Sept.
13 with a thrown ball during batting practice, has failed in his
first attempts to return to action. Greer complained that he cannot
see the ball while in the field.
</P>
<P>
   After ophthamologists first had said that his eye would suffer
no lingering damage, they subsequently determined he had a bruised
retina. After sitting out a week, Greer lasted just four innings in
his return game before coming out. He has spent games watching from
the bullpen and trying to reacclimate himself, but doctors now have
no idea when he might return.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKING BARRY'S HEART
</P>
<P>
   Should the Arizona Diamondbacks clinch the NL West in San
Francisco this weekend, eliminating the Giants from postseason
contention, left fielder Barry Bonds will have witnessed seven
clinchings by his opponents. ``I don't want to be on the field,''
he says. ``I've seen enough of that.'' A recap of Barry's

EDITORIAL: TESTING TIME ON THE TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a week in the presidential campaign, and although
skeptics might say that the news has been dominated by money and
the horse race, we find encouragement in the vibrant
unpredictability of the entire scene. Not only are voters learning
a lot about the candidates, the candidates themselves are being put
to school on the hard realities of running.
</P>
<P>
   For no one have the lessons been ruder than for Vice President
Al Gore. Like former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984, he is
beginning to learn the downside of an entitlement strategy. There
is something in grass-roots Democrats that rebels against
nomination by pre-emption.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bill Bradley is reaping an outsized benefit as the
only name Democrat willing to play against what looked like a
stacked deck. Bradley capped the week by tightening the money race
and by forcing the Gore campaign to send President Clinton to rally
the Democratic National Committee. Bradley also got endorsements
from Rep. Jerrold Nadler and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, both of
New York, who celebrated the event by hurling the dread ``can't
win'' label at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But an insurgency campaign like Bradley's has risks that will
come more fully into play in the weeks ahead. He has his own
charisma gap, and Gore, for all his stiffness, is extremely
dangerous in one-on-one debate. Also, by trying to pass Gore on the
left, Bradley risks depiction as a panderer on the Old Democrat
model. As Al Hunt showed in a Wall Street Journal column last week,
both the press and politicians will be looking hard at such Bradley
cave-ins as his endorsement of the ethanol tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bottom line for the Democrats is a surprising one. In
New Hampshire, New York and just possibly across the nation, the
party is preparing for a highly competitive two-way race rather
than a simple coronation of Gore. Right now, Bradley has the hotter
hand. The vice president, for his part, must repair his gasping
organization and then confront a much stronger opponent than he or
anyone else expected.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, things seem almost sedate among Republicans, and
the policy debate on that side is more fully developed. Gov. George
Bush of Texas tried to move up the substance ladder with a
workmanlike speech on national security. He criticized the
``unfocused deployments'' of the Clinton administration, but failed
to answer fully a question that dominated his father's term, which
is when and where to intervene in foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is testing whether a campaign driven by
reformist principles rather than ideology can prevail in the modern
GOP. Steve Forbes continues to illustrate that while money is not
everything, it is the one thing that is making Iowa competitive.
After massive expenditures, he is in second place there, polling 16
percent to Bush's 38.
</P>
<P>
   Even a two-ring circus needs a sideshow, and that brings us to
Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. Perot has been worried that
Minnesota's wrestling governor, Jesse Ventura, was about to take
over the Party of Ross. So Perot's emissaries have been trying to
clear the way for the badly tarnished Buchanan to get the Reform
Party nomination. This would, of course, change the party ethos
from populist protest to nativist rage. It would also provide
Buchanan a chance to play out his Republican intramural class
grievances against yet another George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Our main point here is that one should not be taken in by the
conventional wisdom that campaigns do not matter, that issues do
not get discussed and that citizens do not pay attention. Attention
is being paid, in large part because Americans have before them a
cracking good campaign that will shape the political landscape of
the first decade of the new millennium. &QL;

<P>
   LORAIN, Ohio _ A decade ago, only a few, intrepid scuba divers
plunged into the murk of Lake Erie. Parts of the lake were
periodically glazed green with algae, and others were fouled with
the same pollution that helped set ablaze the Cuyahoga River in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the lake is clearer than it has been in decades, and
hundreds of divers are coming from as far as Florida to explore its
best kept secret: a vast underwater paradise of well-preserved
shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started diving in the 1970s, you could only see
out to here,'' said Sue MacNeal, stretching a well-tanned arm in
front of her. She and her husband, Russ MacNeal, operate a diving
shop and two charter boats in Elyria, on the lake, and on a recent
warm day they were steering one of them down Lorain's Black River
toward the sun-dappled open waters of the lake. ``Two feet was good
visibility back then,'' Mrs. MacNeal said. ``Sometimes you'd feel
the wrecks before you'd see them. Now, we can see up to 50 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much to see. Only a few years ago, estimates of the
number of wrecked ships in Lake Erie hovered around 250. Now, 1,700
wrecks have been documented in the lake, and researchers like
Charles Herdendorf believe there could be as many as 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that 50,000 commercial ships were constructed around
the Great Lakes, and it's not unreasonable to believe that 10
percent of them are now on the bottom,'' said Herdendorf, an
oceanographer and underwater archeologist. ``During the panic of
1857, a lot of ships were allowed to just sink in the harbors
because their owners didn't have the money to operate or maintain
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons Lake Erie has so many wrecked ships. It
is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, with a maximum depth of 212
feet versus Superior's 1,333, so there are more spots for ships to
run aground. In addition, storms get particularly nasty on Lake
Erie, with the wind quickly whipping the shallow waters into
punishing waves.
</P>
<P>
   Collisions claimed other ships, like the Morning Star, a
side-wheel steamer that sank in 1868, taking 23 to 32 people down
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Erie's wrecks have been obscured for decades by algae at
the top of the water and sediment swirling below, but two factors
have changed the lake's complexion. The United States and Canada
have spent $5 billion on the treatment of waste water and other
pollution controls since the 1960s, reducing phosphorus, a primary
nutrient for algae.
</P>
<P>
   And in a quirky twist of fate, the zebra mussel, one of 140
nonnative species that have conquered Lake Erie, has proved a
blessing for divers. These thumbnail-sized shellfish, which
officials believe arrived in the ballast water of oceangoing ships,
absorb particles in the water, including algae and sediment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw our first zebra mussels on Oct. 15, 1988,'' said
Jeffrey Reutter, director of Ohio Sea Grant and the Stone
Laboratory, the nation's oldest freshwater biological field
station. ``Two years later, the density of zebra mussels was 30,000
per square meter. The increase in water clarity was equally
dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers have taken to the newly clear waters with zeal. There is
now a Lake Erie Wreck Divers Club, and hundreds of divers not in
the club explore the more accessible wrecks and artificial reefs,
three created from the remains of the old Cleveland Stadium. Two
club members, Michael and Georgann Wachter, have published a book,
``Erie Wrecks'' (Corporate Impact, 1997), about some of the
best-known sites on the western side of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The MacNeals take more than 100 divers each year to well-known
sites, and they know as much about the contents of the western side
of the lake as most people know about their basements. MacNeal, who
is chairman of Ohio's Submerged Lands Advisory Council, also
follows clues from history books and Coast Guard records and
explores deeper waters with sonar for undiscovered wrecks. The
MacNeals have found eight wrecks, some of them old wooden boats
that look as they probably did when they sank. The chill of the
lake's water preserves them and there are no worms to gnaw them, as
there are in the seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 140-foot wooden schooners out there with their
bowsprits still in place and their chains hanging over their
sides,'' MacNeal said, seemingly unaware of the sudden back and
forth pitch of his own boat as he gazed toward the center of the
lake. ``They're just sitting on the bottom looking like they're
about to set sail.''

 &HT;    Dirty drinking water drives fear in N.C.
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARBORO, N.C. _ Simmering for years, the witch's brew was
finally unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was 30 inches of rain over two weeks in flood-prone
areas of the state, overflowing lagoons of hog waste, 2 million
dead chickens, unearthed caskets, spilled sewage, junked
Oldsmobiles and more than 30,000 drowned pigs.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to the sea, Hurricane Floyd's toxic flood waters
washed through Tarboro's water treatment plant and shut it down.
The taps might not flow clean again for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Dozier won't even touch a cup of coffee unless he knows
where the water came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're scared,'' said the 32-year-old Tarboro parks worker,
who has followed the city's advice and had a tetanus shot. ``Even
when they do get clean water, people are going to think it's
contaminated. I'm scared myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Unprecedented flooding has damaged more than 7,000 homes. The
deluge polluted more than 200 sewage treatment plants and nearly
400,000 private wells. Coastal fisheries could continue to be
fouled well into the next year. Agricultural losses may exceed $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, environmentalists say, unchecked development in
North Carolina's river basins from Raleigh east to New Bern helped
lead to the worst natural disaster in state history.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, farmers have drained wetlands of eastern North
Carolina and turned them into valuable fields of hogs, chickens,
turkeys, tobacco and cotton. Developers transformed abandoned
farmland into industrial parks, golf courses and subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Raleigh, construction in places like Crabtree Valley,
something like the Buckhead of North Carolina, dumped sediment in
the Neuse River, which winds more than 230 miles to the Pamlico
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   With every ditch dug, every Wal-Mart parking lot paved, the flow
of rainwater and storm runoff gained a new and easy path to the
river's edge. Nothing could stop it from taking with it animal
waste, farm pesticides or the oil leaking from neighborhood cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rainfall may be an act of God,'' said Marion Smith, executive
director of the Neuse River Foundation, an environmental watchdog
group in New Bern. ``But God doesn't drain the wetlands and God
doesn't build in the flood plain.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the boom in eastern North Carolina comes from
agriculture, a staple of the state's economy, especially east of
Interstate 95. The state leads the nation in production of turkeys
and flue-cured tobacco. It ranks No. 2 in hogs, behind Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   For years, hog farming has angered environmentalists, fearful
that waste escaping from lagoons and being sprayed on fields
created ecological dynamite. The nutrients deplete oxygen, kill
fish in rivers and streams and render drinking water foul and even
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers are certain to examine how well hog lagoons
fared during Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Basnight, president pro tem of the North Carolina
Senate, said the environmental review will encompass general
planning, not just one industry. Everyone may need to move out of
flood plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the kind of review you have in San Francisco after
an earthquake. Do you build back or do you not?'' said Basnight, a
Democrat from Dare County on the Outer Banks. ``We will look at all
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Goldsboro, the barrage of environmental complaints infuriates
hog farmer Bob Ivey.
</P>
<P>
   The Neuse River flooded four or five of Ivey's hog lagoons. He
said they worked to specification, keeping their contents until the
Neuse spilled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can engineer and plan for what we've been
through,'' Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard trucks have helped the 45-year-old farmer feed
hogs and move them to higher ground. Upstream and downstream,
municipal sewer plants have failed. His home is flooded. Friends
have drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you died from dadgum hog manure, I'd have died a long time
ago,'' Ivey said. ``Would you want to be exposed to dadgum manure
or dadgum exposed to water people urinated in and defecated in?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, what do you want us to do? We've had back-to-back
hurricanes, and we're trying to save what we've got. They want to
try and shut me down when everyone else around me is flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Floyd, even modest rains had caused lagoon breaches in
the eastern third of the state. In the early 1990s, a blue-ribbon
panel was appointed to review hog waste disposal. Hog farmers
traditionally dig earthen pits to create lagoons to contain sewage
and other waste. Waste from the lagoons is then sometimes sprayed
on croplands as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation adopted by the state several years ago was
that hog farmers maintain a minimum distance between the top of the
lagoon and the soil level in an effort to prevent the lagoons from
overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   But the report took into account only the type of flooding that
could occur several times in a century, said atmospheric scientist
John Sigmon, a gentleman farmer appointed to the panel. Floyd's
rains caused flooding that occurs once every 500 years, according
to federal hydrologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were not federal and state programs to help rebuild,
you might solve the problem,'' Sigmon said. ``Land use has changed.
There are more parking lots, more houses, more shopping centers
that would have been flooded land. If this same thing would have
happened 75 years ago, you might not even have known about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After fish kills on the Neuse River and flooding caused by
Hurricane Fran in 1996, the General Assembly forbade new swine
operations in the state. Last session, it extended the moratorium
through July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hunt said his administration would work to phase out
the lagoons, though there's no timetable. Because of North
Carolina's hog farm woes, Georgia environmental authorities this
year imposed strict new rules for controlling pollution from large
hog operations in the Peach State. Similar rules for poultry farms
and other livestock operations in Georgia are being crafted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, North Carolina officials are concentrating on animal
disposal. Three incinerators heated to 3,000 degrees _ capable of
burning 4,000 pounds an hour _ are roaring in hog country. For dead
poultry, front-end loaders are scooping up the birds and composting
them with wood chips and dry waste. Cattle and horses will be
buried.
</P>
<P>
   There's little anyone can do about the pollution. Ultimately,
Mother Nature will flush the waste through the Pamlico Sound and
into the Atlantic. No one's going to skim sewage or catch diesel
fuel or pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it's out of the barn, it's gone. There's nothing you can
do,'' said Doug Lair, chief of the Emergency Response Branch of the
federal Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   If consumed, the toxic cocktail could cause untold health
problems. Coliform bacteria are in the water and could cause fever,
diarrhea, cramps and vomiting. The vast flood waters form an ideal
habitat for mosquitoes that may carry equine encephalitis, a rare
but sometimes deadly disease. Planes will spray 3 million acres
with malathion and other pesticides to keep the insect population
down. Officials recommend residents in flooded areas boil drinking
water three to five minutes before use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it and you could probably catch it if you drink the
water,'' said Dr. John Hamilton, chief of the infectious diseases
department at Duke University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Initial assessments of the environmental damage won't be ready
until the water recedes more this week. Rivers still are cresting,
and some won't fall significantly for a few days. The damage is
more widespread than the flooding that consumed southwest Georgia
in 1994, when Tropical Storm Alberto lingered for five days near
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the water goes down can we get an idea of the scope
of the problem and assess the real environmental problem,'' Lair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from Tarboro High School, which is sheltering
3,000 stranded people, the 63-room Comfort Inn struggles to stay
open without running water _ just like the other buildings in town.
McDonald's is closed. So are Burger King and Pizza Hut. The Dairy
Queen made a go of it before inspectors shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort Inn guests flush their toilets by dumping garbage cans
of water they've scooped from the swimming pool. A handwritten
warning is taped to the ice machine: ``Do not use ice for drink or
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Guest Martha Plemmer heats her water in the coffee maker and
pours it in the sink. Then she dabs that on her and finishes with
alcohol to take a bath. ``It's like that through the whole town,''
said Plemmer, an evacuee from nearby Princeville, where coffins are
floating, house tops poke through the water and her 20 cats may
have drowned.
</P>
<P>
   There are tobacco fields, cotton crops, chicken coops and hog
lagoons all around Tarboro. Like many places in the South, new
industry is blending with the rural charm. A distribution center
for the QVC shopping network is coming. A Wal-Mart Super Center is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from it all is Frances Liverman's On the Square
restaurant downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Country roads went forever to nowhere when Liverman was a kid.
But the hamlets and town now are strung together like pearls:
Nashville, Rocky Mount, Tarboro, Wilson, Greenville. ``It tells me
things are changing when towns are growing together,'' said
Liverman, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Liverman is like thousands in the flooded region. There's water,
water everywhere but only the mop can drink.
</P>
<P>
   She treats water like the plague. She wears rubber boots and
powder blue Rubbermaid gloves as she scrubs her plank floor with
water and Murphy's Oil Soap. Last weekend, the flood creeped into
her brick building and rose 6 inches, leaving a dingy brown mark on
a display case.
</P>
<P>
   Without running water, the Health Department won't let her open.
She normally serves sandwiches to the courthouse employees who are
regulars. At the curb of her shop, a narrow two-story brick
building with a striped, sky-blue awning, flooded supplies sit in a
trash heap. Ruffles potato chips, lemons, Dill's French dressing,
Styrofoam cups.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors sweep out their shops. Live oaks line the sidewalks.
The rumble of portable generators fills the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just worries me that there's so much in the water,''
Liverman said. ``When the water finally goes down, you don't know
what you're going to find.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll be closed at least two weeks, maybe longer. How she'll
make a living, she doesn't know. Inspectors will be back to tell
her how to disinfect the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting our lives in their hands.''

<P>
   The reading season has just opened, and here's your fall list.
Pop quizzes to come.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economist (yes, even a coach
there asked him to be lenient with an athlete), locates the end of
intercollegiate sports innocence in 1852 when a railroad offered
``lavish prizes'' and ``unlimited alcohol'' to lure Harvard and
Yale rowers to a race on a New Hampshire lake. The lures have
worked ever since, although most of the prizes seem to be going to
coaches and schools. Nothing is as heartbreaking as the $8 million
in post-season bowl revenue Notre Dame missed out on when a kicker
missed an extra point.
</P>
<P>
   In remarkably clear and clear-eyed prose (even his charts are
readable), Zimbalist follows the money instead of the ball in the
emotion-charged world of college sports. ``Unpaid Professionals''
(Princeton University Press) uses this basic starting point _ ``No
other industry in the United States manages not to pay its
principal producers a wage or salary'' _ to survey the compromised
standards of academia and suggest reforms, which include outright
professionalization of teams. One provocative innovation would be
requiring the National Basketball Association and the National
Football League to support their college ``minor leagues''
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbalist will be joining such reformers as Professor William C.
Dowling, architect of the Rutgers 1000 campaign _ which is devoted
to de-emphasizing sports at the university _ and Professor Murray
Sperber of Indiana at an extraordinary conference at Drake
University in Des Moines on Oct. 21 and 22 ``for those who are fed
up with the corruption, exploitation and hypocrisy in collegiate
athletics and are willing to work to end it.'' Created by Professor
Jon Ericson, the gathering is unusual in that it not only starts
with the consensus that the system is wrong, but that the ultimate
responsibility to fix it is in the shaky hands of a faculty that
either ignores sports or is besotted by it.
</P>
<P>
   One wrinkle in the student-athlete system is the role of the
traditionally black colleges, before and after integration, in
creating leadership. Did anyone think all their coaches and
quarterbacks were white? As African-American institutions, those
colleges were far more important than the relentlessly
sentimentalized Negro baseball leagues. And the colleges still
exist and have influence. ``Never Before, Never Again,'' (St.
Martin's Press, $24.95) is the autobiography of Coach Eddie
Robinson of Grambling, written with Richard Lapchick, the founder
of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society. Since both men are
determinedly friendly (George Steinbrenner wrote the foreword,
Jesse Jackson the afterword), the criticisms are muted, but the
sense of place and history, and ``the winningest'' football coach's
own story are happily preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Sports,'' edited by Jay Coakley and Peter Donnelly
(Routledge), is a basic sociology text heavy on ethnographic
methodology. But there is enough truth to the title to make this
interesting to the general reader.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Saltzman Chafetz and Joseph A. Kotarba follow Little
League mothers ``doing gender,'' working harder at fulfilling their
stereotypes than the ``son gods'' they are servicing. Todd Crosset
describes the almost familial relationship between female pro
golfers and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Beckey Beal reports on the subversive dogmas of skateboarders;
they believe they are combating mainstream competition with
cooperation. Alan M. Klein contributes a timely piece on the North
American socialization of Dominican baseball players, and Douglas
E. Foley goes to South Texas to study Friday night rites, including
the ``ritual of reversal'' called ``powderpuff football'' in which
the cheerleaders don pads and try to play seriously and the players
don drag and mock women. This experience leads Foley to return to
Iowa after more than 40 years and interview the Indian
``hellraiser'' who starred on his own high school team.
</P>
<P>
   A hockey wife, writing under a pseudonym to protect her
husband's career, and Bette McKenzie, a hockey daughter and former
football wife, write revealingly about the culture of celebrity
sports families. Each deserves a book of her own.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee-table gift book on the list is ``Glory'' (William
Morrow, $45), a collection of Richard Corman's startling
photographs in which the obvious subjects _ Muhammad Ali, Cal
Ripken Jr., Michael Jordan, dancers, Special Olympians _ seem to be
moving in previously unseen and revealing ways.
</P>
<P>
   For pure fun and apocalyptic nightmares, there is ``Roller Derby
to Roller Jam: The Authorized Story of an Unauthorized Sport'' by
Keith Coppage (Squarebooks, $19.95), as much promo as history of an
exhibition that is trying to reinvent itself on the model of pro
wrestling, with characters and story lines. I always liked roller
derby because the sex and violence was right up front.
</P>
<P>
   There were mom-and-son combos (the ``diabetic housewife,''
Josephine Bogash, and Billy, stars of the '30s and '40s) and
matinee idols (Charlie O'Connell and Joan Weston) and an inspired
silliness that seemed only a putsch away from the fascist image of
Rollerball. Now it's all back, cable ready, and a good, small,
accessible, metaphorical subject for some of those apprentice
sports sociologists.

GRAND JURY IN RAMSEY CASE RECONVENES, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The grand jury investigating the killing of JonBenet
Ramsey reconvened in Boulder Thursday after a four-month hiatus.
But with prosecutors having made no request to finance the panel
after its term expires in less than a month, its future and that of
the investigation are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Financing will expire on Oct. 20 for the grand jury, which has
been investigating the killing of JonBenet, a 6-year-old beauty
queen, off and on for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office has not made a request for
additional financing, and a Boulder County commissioner said last
week that if such a request were made, the grand jury and the
county's district attorney, Alex M. Hunter, would have to produce
``compelling reasons'' to justify spending more money on the
inquiry, which has cost Boulder and Boulder County more than
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the grand jury's term expiring in October is a
natural point of closure,'' said Paul Danish, one of three members
of the Boulder County Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The death of JonBenet has raised suspicions and criticism about
her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, the police and prosecutors. The
girl's strangled body was found in her family's Boulder home on
Dec. 26, 1996, after her parents reported that she was missing and
that they had found a ransom note.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter impaneled the grand jury after critics and some police
officers said he was dragging his feet on the case. But the
investigation has been impeded by what many have called sloppy
police work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skepticism about the investigation, Henry C. Lee, a
prominent forensic expert who has worked on the case and who is now
the head of the Connecticut Department of Public Safety, said the
inquiry could go on with or without the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really set the deadline to solve the case,'' Lee
said in an interview on the Fox Network. He noted that there is no
statute of limitations on murder. Lee, who joined the case in 1997,
met with Hunter last week in Denver.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The grand jury has heard from Boulder police detectives and
officers, handwriting analysts and JonBenet's brother, Burke. The
parents have not been called to testify, but their videotaped
remarks are thought to have been shown.
</P>
<P>
   Although police have said the parents are under an ``umbrella of
suspicion,'' the Ramseys, who now live in Atlanta with Burke, have
maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Because of grand jury secrecy, it is not known whether the
jurors took the summer off to wait for more evidence or test
results, or whether they will hear more testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has said he will soon impanel a new grand jury, to comply
with a state law that requires an active panel at all times. The
new grand jury would convene after Oct. 20, when the current grand
jury is scheduled to complete its work, he said. The new grand jury
will probably deal with other matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Colorado law, the grand jurors can indict a suspect in the
killing, agree they have not reached a conclusion, or decline to
indict someone, in which case they can file a report on their
findings. But any such report would probably be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Silverman, a Denver lawyer who is not involved in the
case, said of such a report, ``If it's released to the public it
could be available to the killer and presumably compromise chances
that person is brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman is among many critics who say that a steady flow of
leaked information and crucial errors made in the early hours of
the investigation may have jeopardized chances of solving the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a former Boulder police detective, Linda Arndt,
appeared on national television and said that she knew who the
killer was, although she did not name anyone. Ms. Arndt, who was
the first detective on the scene the day JonBenet's body was found
and whose work in the case has been widely criticized, is suing
former Chief Tom Koby of the Boulder police and the City of Boulder
over how she was treated in the aftermath of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to hear Linda Arndt say she knows with
certainty who killed JonBenet, also say she is certain there will
be no indictment,'' Silverman said. Ms. Arndt testified before the
grand jury several months ago. ``She had a chance to see and hear
from the grand jury, and she came to that conclusion.''

INJURIES TO KEY PLAYERS LEAD TO POOR STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Dan Reeves, the Atlanta Falcons' coach, made a
comment that not only made him look slightly foolish but also
angered some of his players. Reeves suggested, on the day after
running back Jamal Anderson suffered a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his knee, ending his season, that the injury occurred
because of Anderson's two-week contract holdout during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was furious with Reeves' words. His holdout was
relatively short, and he still participated in five weeks of
training camp and played in several preseason games. Players have
hurt their hamstrings because of holdouts. They do not tear up
their knees because of them.
</P>
<P>
   While Reeves' comment was absent-minded and insulting to his
star player, it might have been made out of frustration. He has a
lot of company; this season has been frustrating to many teams.
Injuries, parity and the rise of young stars have turned the
National Football League upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's final four are a combined 1-7 going into Sunday's
games _ the Jets (0-2), Denver (0-2), Atlanta (0-2) and Minnesota
(1-1). That is the worst combined start by a previous final four
since the 1970 merger between the American Football League and the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have devastated the defending division champions. The
Jets were heavy Super Bowl favorites until they lost quarterback
Vinny Testaverde to a ruptured Achilles' tendon and wide receiver
Wayne Chrebet to a broken foot. The Falcons are forced to play
without Anderson, and quarterback Chris Chandler missed last week's
game with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his denials, Terrell Davis, the Denver Broncos' running
back, is hurting because of the constant pounding he is taking,
since teams are focusing on stopping him since there is no John
Elway to burn them deep. Davis may not be seriously hurt, but after
the opening-season loss to the Miami Dolphins, he had a large
bruise on the back of his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are the only final-four team without any of their
star players spending extra time in the trainer's room. But they
have their problems. Last season Minnesota averaged 34.8 points a
game. This season, they have scored a total of 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   There is no conspiracy theory about why there are a high number
of injuries to key players. It is simply bad luck. Ernie Accorsi,
the general manager of the Giants, a smart football man and
football historian, recalled one season in the early 1970s when
O.J. Simpson, Joe Namath and Gale Sayers, the biggest stars at the
time, were all seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pretty wild situation with all the injuries so far to
key players,'' Accorsi said, ``but it is not unusual. It has
happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   What may be unusual is that the injuries are running deep, not
just to the stars, but across every position and every team. In
week two, eight backup running backs saw significant time because
of injuries to starters, including James Stewart from Jacksonville,
who had 124 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And four backup quarterbacks played, including two former Jets,
Glenn Foley for Seattle and Neil O'Donnell for Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries have been a reason why teams such as the Detroit
Lions are 2-0. But the rise of young stars have also fueled the
strong starts in Detroit, Washington and Indianapolis. Stephen
Davis, the Redskins running back who was once better known for how
his teammate Michael Westbrook pummeled him during a fight in
practice, is playing well. Lions quarterback Charlie Batch is
making people forget about Barry Sanders. For the Colts, wide
receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James are top
players.
</P>
<P>
   As for parity, there are two ways to look at why there is no
dominant team. One, there is mediocre football being played. Two,
there will be a number of exciting races down the stretch. Late in
the season, it is not unrealistic to think that many teams in the
more competitive divisions will have similar records, fighting for
a division title and playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   DEION SANDERS TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   The most famous toe in football will be on the field next week.
Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders, who had toe surgery during the off
season, is scheduled to go against the Arizona Cardinals on Oct. 3.
Sanders wants to play because he feels the Cardinals do not respect
the aging Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has another reason to return. He earns a $1.5 million
bonus if he plays in 70 percent of the defensive plays and makes
the Pro Bowl team. That's a pretty good incentive.
</P>
<P>
   PROGRESS IN HIRING BLACKS
</P>
<P>
   With only three black head coaches in the NFL, the league
obviously has a long way to go before the playing field is level
for blacks trying to break into head-coaching positions. But
Sunday's Minnesota-Green Bay game shows that progress is being
made.
</P>
<P>
   The game features eight blacks, four on each team, in
high-ranking coaching or front-office positions. This season, Green
Bay became the first team in league history with a black head coach
(Ray Rhodes) and two black coordinators (Sherman Lewis on offense
and Emmitt Thomas on defense). In the Packers' front office, Reggie
McKenzie is the club's director of pro personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Black coaches and personnel men have said for years that what it
takes to get more blacks in key positions is to have more
open-minded people doing the hiring. Race has never been a factor
with Ron Wolf, the Green Bay general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, in addition to Coach Dennis Green, who is also the
vice president of football operations, there are three blacks in
key positions: Ray Sherman, the offensive coordinator; Alex Wood,
the quarterbacks coach, and Frank Gilliam, the vice president of
player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay there is concern about the injured thumb of
quarterback Brett Favre. How much it is hurting will not be truly
known until he throws the ball under game conditions. ... The
Dolphins love their newly-acquired wide receiver Tony Martin, who
spreads the field and is the first true deep threat the team has
had in years. ... After hearing Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan
accuse him of receiving preferential treatment from the officials,
Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss replied: ``If they're not scared
to put you out there one-on-one, then get on out there. That just
shows you that any guy with a lot of talk needs a lot of safety
help over the top.'' ... Barry Sanders remains resigned to the fact
that he will never again play for the Lions. One thing about
Sanders: He is stubborn. ... The San Diego Chargers' victory over
Cincinnati last Sunday was impressive. About 20 players had the
flu, and some members of the coaching staff vomited on the sideline
during the game. Still, San Diego committed no turnovers and forced
five.

CLAIMS OF POLICE CORRUPTION FUEL CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A former police officer's account of abuses of
power in a Los Angeles Police Department station house has shaken
the city's political establishment, renewed calls for increased
civilian oversight of the agency and halted the enforcement of a
law promoted as a strong antidote to gang crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few days we have seen a dark shadow cast over
the Los Angeles Police Department,'' Mayor Richard J. Riordan said
at a Police Academy graduation ceremony on Thursday. ``The news is
grim. The department's reputation is being questioned. The
integrity of our officers is in doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The department has suspended or fired 13 officers based on
information from former Officer Rafael A. Perez, who pleaded guilty
this month to stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence
locker. Perez agreed to tell what he knew in exchange for a lighter
sentence in the cocaine case and immunity for his confession on
another matter. He told investigators that he and his partner shot
an unarmed gang member, Javier Francisco Ovando, and planted a gun
on him. He also said that another incident, in which two suspects
were shot and one died, was ``dirty,''meaning the police may have
concealed what actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a judge suspended enforcement of an injunction that
bars individual members of the 18th Street gang, to which Ovando
belonged, from associating with each other. The suspension was
based on the belief that declarations filed by officers in support
of the injunction may have been perjured.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups, lawyers and one prominent state politician
have criticized the Police Department's handling of the case and
expressed doubt that the department could effectively settle its
own problems.
</P>
<P>
   The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union called
for the appointment of a special prosecutor to handle corruption
prosecutions and the creation of an independent panel to conduct a
department-wide inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly believe that an internal police mechanism,
although warranted in this case, is wholly inadequate to look into
a scandal of this magnitude,'' said Elizabeth Schroeder, a lawyer
for the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has said he will convene an
investigative team of 60 command officers to examine the way the
department handles shootings involving officers and allegations of
corruption and how well officers are supervised, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   The department has rejected criticism of its handling of the
case, noting that it was the department's original investigation of
Perez that led to his prosecution and ultimately to his giving
details of abuse of power among his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief has stated that we're doing everything in our power,
and we're the ones that initiated this investigation 17 months
ago,'' said Sgt. John Pasquariello, a department spokesman. ``We
can do the job thoroughly and efficiently, and we're not going to
leave any stone unturned.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in a direct challenge to the chief's authority, the city
attorney's office published an opinion last week stating that the
appointed civilian Police Commission, not the chief, is the head of
the Police Department. That reverses decades of practice in which
the chief has exerted complete control over police matters.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion also gave broad authority to the department's
inspector general, a public watchdog position created in the wake
of the 1991 police beating of Rodney King, allowing him access to
any department document he seeks. The issue has been the subject of
debate for the last year, leading to the resignation of the
previous inspector general. Parks opposed that requirement, and in
recent weeks the new inspector general, Jeffrey Eglash, has
expressed concern that his access will be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat, has criticized the department
for keeping Ovando in protective custody when he will likely file a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the department and the city.
``It's a very troubling conflict of interest because he will be a
potential plaintiff against the department that is now debriefing
him, caring for him, housing him, feeding him,'' Hayden said in an
interview. The department said Ovando was free to go but had chosen
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   And the district attorney has been criticized by the County
Board of Supervisors for closing the ``roll-out'' unit of
prosecutors who went to the scene of police shootings to
investigate. Gil Garcetti, the district attorney, told the
supervisors that budget constraints forced him to choose between
the roll-out team and other law enforcement basics.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also sparked renewed interest in the report that a
suspect, Ismael Jimenez, was beaten in the Rampart station house in
February 1998 until he vomited blood. The officer accused in the
beating, Brian Hewitt, was fired after an internal affairs
investigation. Investigators presented the case to the district
attorney's office for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The report included physical evidence from the interview room
carpet, analysis of blood spatter patterns on a wall and statements
from a doctor saying that Jimenez's injuries were consistent with
choking. The district attorney's office declined to prosecute the
case, citing Jimenez's varying accounts of the incident. Federal
officials are now said to be looking at the case.

BROKEN DREAMS (AND PUTTERS) ARE DISPERSED AMID THE PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ During his 1987 Ryder Cup singles match, Ben
Crenshaw walked over to Jack Nicklaus, the American captain, and
confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my putter,'' Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You broke what?'' Nicklaus replied.
</P>
<P>
   In his anger at falling behind Eamonn Darcy of Europe, the 1984
Masters champion had slammed his putter into the acorn-strewn
ground as he stomped off the sixth green at Muirfield Village in
Ohio. For golf's best putter, it was as if Michelangelo had broken
his only brush while painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, as
if Mozart had smashed his only piano. But that's what Ryder Cup
pressure can do.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of that match Crenshaw putted with his 1-iron or
with the blade of his sand wedge, and he putted well. But he lost,
1 up. So did the U.S. team, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
   In breaking his putter, Crenshaw, now the American captain here
at The Country Club, had succumbed to pressure unlike that in any
other golf event. Especially in Sunday's 12 singles matches when
it's mano a mano.
</P>
<P>
   And especially the pressure on the 12 U.S. golfers to justify
their reputations as the world's best. You can be sure that
Crenshaw will tell his golfers not to slam their putters.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 singles pairings emerge from a blind draw. Crenshaw will
submit his list of 12 golfers, in order.
</P>
<P>
   Mark James, the European captain, will submit his list of 12
golfers, in order.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, there's no strategy involved in the pairings, but there
should be. It would be more interesting if the captains were to
match the golfers as if playing gin rummy. Let one captain name a
golfer, then the other captain names his selection. It would even
add to the pressure that makes the Ryder Cup so special.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, pressure. It's something golfers seldom talk about _ except
at the Ryder Cup, because they feel it more there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little bit of pressure out there,'' Davis Love III
acknowledged Friday, ``that I don't normally feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That was after Love's alternate-shot morning match when his
birdie putt on the 17th hole salvaged what would be one-half point.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Ryder Cup, the pressure is different than it is even
at, say, the U.S. Open or the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   In those two major championships, a golfer is out there on his
own. If he doesn't win, he lets himself down. If he finishes second
or third, he still has earned substantial prize money.
</P>
<P>
   But with a loss at the Ryder Cup, a golfer lets down his
teammates and, in a sense, his country. And the pressure for the
Europeans is the same as it is for the Americans, as Bernhard
Langer learned at Kiawah Island, S.C., in 1991's last singles
match.
</P>
<P>
   Langer needed to hole a 6-foot putt on the 18th green to retain
the cup for Europe, but when his ball slid to the right, the United
States won. In 1995 at Oak Hill outside Rochester, N.Y., Curtis
Strange was 2 up on Nick Faldo on the 16th tee, but he bogeyed the
last three holes as Faldo holed a 6-foot par putt on the 18th to
win, 1 up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was shaking,'' Faldo said later, ``except the
putter.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the United States won the cup, in 1993 at The
Belfrey in England, the oldest American golfer, 51-year-old Raymond
Floyd, won a critical singles, 2 up, over Jose Maria Olazabal of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Tom Kite had the best American singles record,
5-0 with two halved matches.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Snead was 6-1, Lee Trevino and Billy Casper each were 6-2-2,
Arnold Palmer 6-3-2, Gene Littler 5-2-3. Among the Europeans, Peter
Oosterhuis, now a television golf announcer, was 6-2-1, Faldo
6-4-1, Langer 3-3, Tony Jacklin 2-8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin's halved match developed in 1969 at Royal Birkdale in
England in a duel with Nicklaus that went to the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus holed a 4-foot putt for par, assuring not only half a
point for a halved match but also a final 14-14 score that assured
the Americans' retention of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Jacklin still had a 2-foot putt. If he missed, it would have
lifted the Americans to a 14{-13{ victory. But in a grand gesture,
Nicklaus conceded Jacklin's putt, preserving the 14-14 score, the
closest the Great Britain team had come to winning since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Tony the putt because he was a hero in Great Britain,''
Nicklaus recently told Golf World magazine. ``I didn't feel Tony
would have missed the putt, but I was not going to give him the
chance to miss it. I didn't want to take any chance of having
Tony's stature in the game or in Great Britain diminished by a
short putt in the Ryder Cup. We were going to retain the cup either
way. I just felt it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Ryder Cup pressure-cooker, it was.

MIRER SEEKS FLOURISH AGAINST THE REDSKINS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be different today, Rick Mirer promised.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about him, Vinny Testaverde insisted.
</P>
<P>
   It will take time, Curtis Martin admitted, but it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   We've got the weapons, Keyshawn Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
   The wraps are coming off, Bill Parcells announced.
</P>
<P>
   It was Friday, and a certain amount of optimism about the Jets'
newly retooled offense was beginning to surface, as quarterback
Rick Mirer slowly adjusted to his new role as the club's No. 1
signal-caller.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the pressure of an 0-2 start bearing down on them,
with the surging Redskins returning to the Meadowlands Sunday, with
the backup quarterback, Mirer, having played a full game, the Jets'
offense is going to be asked to, finally, score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It has not happened in five-plus quarters, including last week's
one-field-goal game against the Bills in Mirer's first start as a
Jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we played vanilla last week,'' Mirer conceded.
``We're ready to move on from there. I anticipated we weren't going
to take chances early in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Mirer, he did lead the Jets to within six inches
of Buffalo's goal line with less than three minutes remaining in
the first half. But Jerald Sowell failed to punch the ball in.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the offense Sunday turns from vanilla to rocky road, or
even to rainbow sherbet, may have to do with how many weapons Mirer
can use. He has the redoubtable Martin as his running back. He will
have the blocking, pass-catching tight end, Eric Green, returning
from a pinched nerve. He has the speedy Dedric Ward learning more
about being a starting wide receiver. He has the supremely
confident Johnson, and he has the sophisticated offenses
blueprinted by Charlie Weis.
</P>
<P>
   When Mirer has made things work in past years, it has been with
a steady, conservative attack. Nothing in his seven-year pro career
suggests that the Jets will try anything different Sunday other
than permit him to scramble if all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   In 55 pro starts, Mirer has connected only six times on
touchdowns of 50 yards or more. He has never collaborated on a
touchdown pass of 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, by contrast, did that three times last season. And
in Game 3 against Indianapolis, when Testaverde made his Jets debut
as a starter, he had help in a third-and-2 situation from the
versatile Ray Lucas, who scrambled for 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has been at the ready whenever the Parcells' Jets have
needed a little razzle-dazzle _ first for the stolid Neil
O'Donnell, then for Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he spelled O'Donnell in Game 12 against Minnesota and
picked up 15 yards on one play. In Game 15, against Tampa Bay, he
ran twice, gaining 1 yard and 9 yards. Against Detroit at the
season's end, he was on his way to a starring role with three runs
for 30 yards and a 3-for-4 passing performance for 28 yards, but
then threw an interception near the Lions' goal line that kept the
Jets from making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mirer, Lucas' role will be modified Sunday.
The erstwhile backup is likely to be listed as the third
quarterback, a designation that could keep him from seeing any
action until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gadget plays aside, the Jets' plan Sunday will no doubt rely
heavily on the run. It was the base of their 12-4 season last year.
It was so effective, in fact, that even when Martin was halted, the
Jets won. The reason was the brilliant play-fake orchestration
between Testaverde and Martin. Testaverde would fake a handoff, the
seven or eight defenders bunched up at the line for Martin would
move, and suddenly there would be a Testaverde pass.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses were so consistently frozen that the Jets won the two
poorest rushing games Martin had as Testaverde starred.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like that between Martin and Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably not at its best right now,'' Martin admitted.
``It's something you develop. Vinny and I had it. I'm still
developing it with Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin explained how both runner and passer have to look at the
field while looking at each other as if a handoff is about to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, meanwhile, understands that he must start connecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that right now Curtis is waiting for me to throw
completions, but the defenses are bunching up because it's kind of
vanilla,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer said he has ``no problem with Curtis on the play-action.''
</P>
<P>
   If there isn't, and the offense sings as it did last year, the
Jets' recovery could start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer will be playing without any advice from Testaverde on the
sideline. Testaverde said it could be dangerous for him to stand
there on crutches, and in any event his left foot starts to throb
whenever he stands for a while. He has to keep it elevated to
offset the repair on his torn Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's a little more comfortable and a little
more confident in Rick,'' Testaverde said. ``I'm sure you will see
a different Jets team out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells promises this much: ``Mirer is more comfortable this
week than last week. We can be a little more expansive this week.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin, Parcells said, ``What we have to do is create
balance in our attack.'' Martin had only one second-half carry last
Sunday, and only nine for the game _ the fifth-lowest number of his
career. The Jets were able to create third downs only twice in 11
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday begins a new week, however, and it may be important from
a comfort factor that it's Mirer's second as the Jets' starter _
twice as many as he has ever had before.

MRS. CLINTON ROAD-TESTS A STUMP SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ In a pair of trial runs at a stump speech,
Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded out the themes of her expected
campaign for the U.S. Senate on Saturday, listing the weak upstate
economy, affordable health care, education, the environment, Social
Security and gun control as the most important issues facing New
York.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mrs. Clinton has done more listening than talking on her
visits to the state, often taking positions only when prodded by
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday she gave a spirited run-through of her agenda to
welcoming audiences, first at a fund-raising breakfast for the
Schenectady County Democratic Committee and then at a labor union
rally in Albany. She also made some of her most overtly partisan
remarks of the year, assailing Republicans in Congress for passing
a tax cut that she said put social programs at risk, and for
blocking an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 300 people at the Schenectady Museum in this
faded industrial city, Mrs. Clinton spoke at length of the need to
revive the anemic upstate economy and stem the migration of people
from the region. ``If upstate New York were a separate state, it
would rank 49th in job creation and income growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the social policy issues with which she has been most
closely identified, she touched on support for education, and
pledged, ``We will figure out a way to provide quality, affordable
health care to every American.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a swipe at congressional Republicans' bid to cut taxes
by nearly $800 billion over 10 years, a bill that is supported by
her likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
and that was vetoed by her husband, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to use the budget surplus that has been created by the
good policies of this Democratic administration to make sure that
Social Security and Medicare are on stable financial ground into
the next century,'' she said. ``Are we going to be responsible or
are we going to go for the short-term, quick-fix political gimmick?
Well, I was very proud of my husband when he vetoed that
short-term, quick-fix political gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, said her
remarks were as close as she had come yet to making what will
become her standard stump speech. ``Those are the themes being
road-tested right there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally attended by a few thousand cheering union members in
a park in Albany, Mrs. Clinton focused on issues dear to organized
labor, including her support for raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe with all my heart that no working American who goes
to work 40 hours a week, who is there being a responsible worker
and citizen, that no working American should live in poverty,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the Republican leadership in Congress had
recently blocked a vote on a minimum wage increase. And, with an
implicit dig at Giuliani, who has declined to state a position on
the issue, she added, ``It is wrong, and we should take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her several public appearances Saturday, Mrs. Clinton
did not take questions from reporters, who were unable to ask her
about the two most recent controversies involving Giuliani: his
threat to block funds for the Brooklyn Museum of Art because of its
scheduled exhibition of controversial art works, and his
administration's plan to cull Medicaid records of welfare
applicants to find those who have been treated for substance abuse,
and insist that they receive continued treatment in return for
welfare benefits. She did not raise either subject.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not make any public appearances Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton did edge closer than ever to confirming what
has, for months, seemed evident: that she will formally become a
candidate for the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a Democrat. ``I haven't announced anything,'' she said,
``but I'm leaning so far toward running that I'd fall over if I
leaned any further.''

ARMSTEAD WALKS THE WALK AND TALKS THE TALK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Jessie Armstead would be asleep, at home in the
Oak Cliff section of Dallas, a harsh, combative place where
street-corner conflicts were settled with knives and baseball bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not guns,'' Armstead, the Giants' Pro Bowl linebacker,
said last week of his old neighborhood. ``We were lucky. Just
knives and bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstead's older brother Bobby would come through the bedroom
door some nights to wake Jessie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a guy at the park, he's about your age and he told me
he can whup you down there,'' Bobby would tell his only brother.
``Let's go. You need to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie would put on his clothes. He would walk down the hill to
Birdie Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you'd have to fight him for as long as it took,''
Armstead said. ``It was rough down there. But that's the way things
were. Guys would come get me out of my house all the time. What are
you going to do? You can't lie in bed. You need to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it was. You can wake me up at 2 in the morning
and say, `Let's go.' I'll go. I can't back down.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were all there was to Armstead, it would explain why he
plays football the way he does _ as though he were still warring at
Birdie Park, hurling himself into savage collisions, talking trash
nonstop as he gestures and challenges opponents, teammates, even
fans in the stands to meet the intensity he has brought to the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   He's 28 now, but somebody woke Jessie up and told him there are
11 guys about his age down at the stadium who say they can whup
him. His brother Bobby is at the door: You need to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie is the Tasmanian Devil out there,'' said Michael
Strahan, Armstead's teammate and friend.
</P>
<P>
   But growing up tough and staying that way doesn't explain nearly
enough about Armstead; indeed, it too easily suits the image that
has grown up around his career, an image epitomized by his
on-the-field warrior persona.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people think they know Armstead from what they see on
the field, or because he went to the University of Miami, where the
football program relished an outlaw image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people scared off in Jessie's presence,'' Strahan
said. ``They'll go, `There's Jessie Armstead. He must be nasty.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is so nasty, he sends his ailing father, Bobby Sr., roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants his father to enjoy some of the nice things in
life,'' Strahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead calls his mother, Mary, every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``From wherever he is in the world,'' Mary said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what makes her most proud of her son, Mary Armstead
answered at once: ``That he's well-mannered. And he got his college
degree in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Which Armstead did, in criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Armstead said he has never tasted alcohol, does not smoke, and
has not used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Miami, guys would be drinking,'' Armstead said.
``They'd say: `You one of the guys or not?' I'd say: `I'm one of
the guys who drinks Sprite.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, a goody two shoes. He says he has never had so
much as a speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that,'' Mary Armstead said. ``He drives me crazy
when I drive with him. I want to put my foot over to the
accelerator and push on it. I'll ask him to please go a little
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say: `Nope, I don't want to get a ticket.'''
</P>
<P>
   He has had two run-ins with the law, both when he was 15. He was
detained by police for illegally racing his dirt bike, and later,
was caught stealing clothes with friends at a mall. ``He knew he
broke my heart,'' Mary Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie promised his mother he would never be in trouble again.
``There's never been anything else,'' Mary said. ``He's always had
respect for his promises.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, for all the yelling he does at the offense, one of the
most respected Giants. He is, despite the running commentary he
delivers to opponents in every game, respected by players around
the National Football League, who have voted him to the Pro Bowl
for two consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy who took all the lessons his rough-and-tumble
neighborhood taught him and found a place where they belonged _ the
football field _ without letting those lessons intercede in ways
that might ruin the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard football players say they can't just turn the
aggression on and off,'' Armstead said. ``That's going to get you
in trouble and I don't think it's true. I have two sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as his wife, Channon Armstead, who has known Jessie since
they were 15, and who like the rest of the Armstead family calls
Jessie by his nickname, Jay, said: ``There's No. 98, and there's
Jay. Two different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gentle, kind family man with our two daughters. But if
someone even accidentally bumps into one of the kids when we're
out, he'll turn into that football man in a second. He's going to
protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of his personality, Armstead said, evolved
naturally. His father, a retired bus-company owner, convinced his
sons they would have to fight for everything in life. Mary Armstead
managed a pharmacy and encouraged her boys to study, be courteous
and think about turning the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be reading them the Bible and my husband would be telling
them to get back out there and take no hostages,'' Mary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad put the `t' in tough,'' Bobby Jr., said of his father,
whose kidney problems have put him on dialysis as he awaits a
kidney transplant. ``Jay takes after my father. Neither one ain't
scared of nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie didn't play organized football until eighth-grade, but he
played the game at Birdie Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full contact games on a rocky field,'' Jessie said. ``Guys
were separating their shoulders and bleeding because they hit their
face on the rocks. It wasn't no smooth, pretty game.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas' Carter High, he was an instant star, with a national
recruiting magazine naming him the best high school player in
America as a sophomore and in each of the two years that followed.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami, he played immediately as a freshman, then blew out his
knee as a sophomore. Although he returned to play well in both his
junior and senior seasons, pro scouts thought he was too small to
play linebacker in the NFL. He's 240 pounds now but carried just
225 pounds on his 6-foot-1-inch frame coming out of college. Plus,
his knee injury worried teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Armsteads watched the 1993 draft in their Dallas home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched all 206 picks over two of the longest days of our
lives,'' Bobby Jr., said. ``Then the Giants, with the last pick of
that draft, took Jessie.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan believes Armstead has never gotten over those two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie plays with a chip on his shoulder,'' Strahan said. ``It
comes from being picked last.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Armstead four seasons, but by the beginning of 1996, he
had convinced the Giants he was their best weakside linebacker. In
the next three years, he helped convince coaches around the NFL
that what they needed was more linebackers like him _ smaller,
quicker outside defenders for a quicker, pass-happy game. It has
started a trend, and Sunday night, when the Giants play the
Patriots at Foxboro Stadium, Armstead will be starting his 51st
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been proving to people that they're wrong about me all my
life,'' Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And there is a history to that claim, too. Like many of
Armstead's life stories, it begins in Birdie Park.
</P>
<P>
   One night, when Jessie was 13, the fisticuffs at the park spread
to the front of a nearby house.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie and Bobby Armstead were brawling with a set of brothers
until a third brother emerged from the house with a 10-inch butcher
knife in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw it at me and the blade went in through my hip and
stuck all the way into the pelvis bone on the other side,'' Jessie
Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   With the wooden handle sticking out from his hip, Armstead got
on his bike and rode home. Struggling to get into the door, the
wooden knife handle caught on some iron burglar bars protecting the
front of the Armstead house. The handle snapped off, leaving the
blade inside Jessie's hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie had left the house with white pants, socks and shoes,''
Mary Armstead said. ``When I looked up at him, his pants, socks and
shoes were completely red with his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons entered Armstead's hip from both sides, removing the
blade in two pieces in two separate surgeries. During the month
that Jessie spent in two hospitals, doctors told Mary and Bobby
Armstead that their son would never walk without a cane, maybe not
walk at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wrong about me,'' Armstead said last week. ``You
know? Like we used to say, you need to walk.''

MAGGERT THE ONE   TO FINALLY FIRE   A WINNING SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ From the start, Jeff Maggert and Hal Sutton
knew something was different.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries, sensing the urgency of the moment, cheered halves
of holes as if they were wins.
   And, surely, through the first part of Maggert and Sutton's
Ryder Cup foursome (alternate-shot) match against Colin Montgomerie
and Paul Lawrie Saturday morning at The Country Club, that was all
the Americans could do _ make putts for halves, to prevent a repeat
of the carnage of Friday when the Europeans had roared to a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But with that strategy came something else, a growing sense of
confidence, which finally was justified when Maggert and Sutton
posted a stirring 1-up victory over the previously unbeaten British
duo.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 1 point in a long, uphill struggle to regain the
Cup, but it was also a table-setter that caused American captain
Ben Crenshaw to raise his feet in exultation when Maggert's
conversion of a 22-foot birdie on the par-4, 370-yard 17th hole
gave the Americans the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do something good,'' said Maggert, who was
the star of the match with his birdie putt and a marvelous second
shot on the par-4, 436-yard 18th that landed 2 feet from the pin,
giving the Americans a conceded birdie on the hole. ``Hal had been
playing so well and carried us.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Europeans _ especially Montgomerie and Lawrie, who
won their first two matches in Friday's competition _ was a
daunting challlenge.
</P>
<P>
   So fragile was the confidence of the gallery that when Sutton
pulled his second shot on the first hole into a greenside bunker,
while Montogmerie hit his second shot 8 feet from the pin, someone
in the gallery murmered: ``Down 1 already.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't happen then, as Maggert hit a sand wedge 8 feet
past the pin, and Sutton made a hole-saving par after Lawrie had
missed the Europeans' birdie attempt.
</P>
<P>
   There was little reason for confidence after the second hole
when the Europeans went 1 up after Lawrie rolled in a 6-footer for
a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans hung around, making saves until the par-5,
513-yard ninth hole when Maggert, chipping out of the rough in
front of the green, chipped the ball inside 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   When Montgomerie, who had to back off his 8-foot birdie putt
after a fan snapped a flash camera from the hill above the green,
eventually missed his birdie attempt, the Americans finally were
able to square the match when Sutton rolled in his 3-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was will against will, and the Americans showed they were
just as tough as the Europeans, going 1-up on the 11th, giving it
right back on the 12th, and then going 1-up after 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans had a chance to at least get a half, but Maggert
took care of that with the Americans' second shot, which resulted
in a 2-footer.
</P>
<P>
   With the Europeans unable to hole a tricky 40-foot downhiller,
Montgomerie and Lawrie conceded the hole, and, for the first time,
a match. ``It was just a great day,'' Sutton said. ``Jeff did
everything. We're fortunate to be on top.''

PUTTS DIDN'T FALL, BUT   O'MEARA-FURYK DID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw said it best Friday night after
watching his American Ryder Cup team stumble out of the gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holing out is the name of the game in match play,'' he said.
``That's what determines holes.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved so very true Saturday morning, when Mark O'Meara and
Jim Furyk, two of the better putters on the PGA Tour, failed to
make a birdie and fell to Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood, 3 and 2,
in their foursomes match.
</P>
<P>
   Both were guilty. If it wasn't O'Meara sliding putts wide right,
it was Furyk sliding them left. And it didn't matter whether the
putt was from 20 feet or 10 feet. They just couldn't drop the ball
into the hole when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   That made things so much easier for Clarke and Westwood, who
beat Tiger Woods and David Duval, 1 up, in Friday's four-ball
match.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they set The Country Club course afire. The European
duo had only three birdies, but with no pressure from O'Meara or
Furyk, they could be content with pars _ especially after going 2
up after 12 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said O'Meara, who is averaging 3.47
birdies per round on the PGA Tour. ``We didn't play poorly, but we
didn't make any putts. We didn't really ever have it close enough
to make any birdies. They birdied the two par-5 holes where we had
good drives and didn't make the birdies. It was difficult. They
played well, they putted well, and they're doing all the things to
win. Unfortunately, we're not doing those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk said the ninth hole, where Westwood and Clarke grabbed the
lead for good, was the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had similar putts, pretty severely breaking putts,'' he
said. ``Lee Westwood made his birdie putt and I missed. I missed
some other putts that went right over the edge. Once again, we
never really had it that close.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and Furyk took a 1-up lead on the third hole when Furyk
made a 3-footer for par, and Westwood and Clarke bogeyed from 20
feet. But the Euopeans squared the match and then forged ahead for
keeps when Clarke drilled a birdie putt on the sixth (15 feet) and
Westwood on the ninth (10 feet).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good performance, steady,'' said Westwood. ``We
didn't make too many mistakes. We're pleased with the point. We
came out stronger after the rain. I don't know why. Maybe I needed
to sit down and rest for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clarke, ``We're just playing well together. We enjoy
playing together. We play a lot of practice rounds and there was no
reason not to stick us together. We're both playing well and Lee
(Westwood) had some great putts at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something O'Meara and Furyk couldn't say.

NEW JERSEY'S NEW ABORTION LAW REGARDING MINORS IS BLOCKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COURTS-ABORTION) 
(js) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey Supreme Court judge temporarily blocked a law
Saturday that would have required girls under age 18 to notify at
least one parent before getting an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Gary Stein blocked enforcement of the law, which would
have gone into effect Sunday, until it could be reviewed early this
week by all seven members of the court, the state's highest. The
ruling came in response to a last-minute appeal by the American
Civil Liberties Union, which had unsuccessfully appealed to two
lower state courts last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means it's not going to start tomorrow,'' said Jennifer
Dalven, a lawyer for the ACLU, after a telephone conference call
Saturday with Stein and a representative from the state attorney
general's office. Ms. Dalven said she expected the full court to
hear the case either Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are relieved,'' Ms. Dalven said. ``We are trying to strike
it down, you just have to move slowly in the lawsuits. We're
seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Marguerite T. Simon rejected
the ACLU's effort to delay enforcement of the law. Abortion rights
advocates filed an emergency appeal with the Appellate Division of
state Superior Court, but judges there declined to overturn the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saturday's ruling disappointed many abortion opponents,
at least one remained confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This in no way is the last word,'' said Marie Tasy, the
legislative director for New Jersey Right to Life. ``I think this
is a very temporary decision. We're confident that the Superior
Court of New Jersey will rule in favor of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of 39 states, and the sixth in the Northeast,
that have passed laws requiring pregnant girls either to gain
parental permission or notify at least one parent before having an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike similar laws in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Pennsylvania, which require parental consent for a minor to have an
abortion, New Jersey's law requires only that a pregnant girl tell
a parent before proceeding with an abortion.

EDITORIAL: SCHOOL BUS SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended some
sensible design changes for school buses to prevent injuries in
side-impact collisions and rollovers. School buses are already one
of the safer modes of transportation for youngsters. Last year
there were only 29 school bus-related fatalities, six involving bus
occupants and 23 involving pedestrians. Those figures seem small
when compared with the 41,471 people killed in motor vehicle
crashes in this country. But inadequate data collection at school
bus accident sites has made it difficult to determine the number of
injuries in school bus accidents, leaving the overall safety record
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, the safety board has called for a better
system of data collection and for crash data recorders on buses,
the rough equivalent of ``black box'' data recorders in airplanes,
to improve accident investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The board has also urged the Department of Transportation to
strengthen the sides and roofs of buses and improve the seating
compartments, much as one might pack china for shipping in a box
with strong sides and extensive padding to keep it from shifting.
</P>
<P>
   This would entail a seat design with lap and shoulder restraints
and more cushioning. Many school buses do not have seat belts, and
there has been much head-scratching over this issue in the last two
decades. The slick 1970s bench seat in place today was never
designed to be used with seat belts. Lap belts used with this seat
may actually increase injury in some crash scenarios by allowing a
child's head to hit the seat with more force than if the child had
been unrestrained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is not enough to increase safety within the buses.
Most fatal accidents occur outside the bus, suggesting that the
main gains in safety will come from improvements in loading,
unloading and driving the buses.

GENTLE BEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Phil Mickelson was heading to the first tee
in Saturday afternoon's matches when US captain Ben Crenshaw
spotted him and gave him some words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Just trust that putting stroke,' '' said
Crenshaw. ``I said, `Make it (his putting stroke) a sweep and hit
it solid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   All Mickelson needs, Crenshaw said, ``is for one or two to go
down and he's off.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's words were fine _ even if 16 hours too late _ but
actions would have spoken louder than words for the US captain.
Putting has been the bane of the US team (``Putt up or shut up''
could have been the team's epitaph after the early matches),
leaving Crenshaw frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that the US captain trotted out a team for Saturday's
morning matches _ Mark O'Meara and Jim Furyk _ that would have even
furrowed the brow of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln, the
Americans' chances of winning were that slim. Meanwhile, Mickelson
was sitting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson asked Crenshaw Friday night to sit him out after
Mickelson missed two crucial putts on the 16th and 18th holes that
afternoon. Mickelson was crushed by missing the short putts and
conceded the obvious, that his putting ``is certainly a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The misses on 16 and 18 were inexcusable, but to get into
position to miss those putts, Mickelson had to hit three of the
more magnificent shots of his match. His drive on 16 left him 5
feet away, and on 18, a huge drive and short iron _ the best shot
of them all _ also left him 5 feet away. ``I felt I'd played
extremely well,'' said Mikelson, except, of course, for those
putts.
</P>
<P>
   So Mickelson asked out of Saturday's morning matches, as did
Davis Love and David Duval. Love's absence was understandable _ he
is coming off a neck injury _ while Duval had played so poorly on
Friday that his absence shouldn't have caused a stir.
</P>
<P>
   But Crenshaw never should have agreed. For one, Mickelson needed
to be back on the course as soon as possible after missing putts
that crucial, much as the best remedy for getting thrown by a horse
is get aboard again as soon as possible. Otherwise, fear builds.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, Mickelson should have been told forcefully by
Crenshaw that he was needed by the US team, that his game had been
magnificent Friday and the Americans could not win without him.
Missed putts or no missed putts, Mickelson was indispensable to the
US team, Crenshaw should have said so.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mark O'Meara went onto the course and missed no crucial
putts. There will be no tales of gruesome misses by O'Meara
precisely because the remainder of O'Meara's game did not put him
in position to miss crucial putts. O'Meara and Furyk seemed out of
their match after the fifth hole and lost to Darren Clarke and Lee
Westwood, 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mickelson sat. And a man with true putting problems _
Payne Stewart _ played. Stewart missed five makeable putts inside 5
feet that might have saved his team, including a 3-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson asked to sit and Gentle Ben agreed. The gentle
seldom win the Ryder Cup, and Mickelson is too good a golfer to
miss any match.

PARTISANSHIP LIMITED   FOR AMERICAN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When Jim Furyk hit an iron shot to within 12
feet of the pin on the par-4 fourth hole Saturday, the largely
American crowd cheered loudly. In contrast, the European supporters
groaned when Darren Clarke put his ball in a greenside trap.
</P>
<P>
   But when Lee Westwood, Clarke's teammate, blasted out to within
2 feet of the cup, both Americans and Europeans cheered lustily.
When the next pairing came through, Tiger Woods's looping birdie
putt fell, and the crowd roared. But when European Padraig
Harrington answered with a 15-foot birdie, the loud cheers were
noticeably nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   To most spectators, applauding great golf _ by either side _ is
only polite. But other American fans, and some Europeans, detect a
certain coolness toward the US team by American spectators,
impressed by the scrapiness of a Europeam team that came here as
decided underdogs; and put off by the preoccupation with money by
some of the American Ryder Cuppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American fans are quite enthusiastic, but some of them are
quite disenchanted with some of their own players,'' remarked Brent
Mason, a British fan from Leeds. ``I've heard more than a few
Americans say, `Why can't our guys behave like the Europeans?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that disenchantment, boorishly expressed, was evident
late Friday as America's two marquee players, Woods and David
Duval, were on their way to defeat as the sun set. When the
Americans misplayed the 18th hole, one piqued American fan heckled
Duval for having likened the Ryder Cup to an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of the exhibition now?'' the spectator
yelled. ``This is a long way for you to come for a whipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the American players' wives, clad in their
fashionable matching outfits, were heckled.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons as complex as Furyk's unorthodox takeaway, the
American team has not been carried by its fans. To be sure, there
was not much for Americans to cheer about all day Friday and
Saturday morning. Many spectators were literally neutralized by
their inability to see much of the golf on a course that was not
designed with spectating in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, fans were quick to point to a certain reserve among
American fans, in sharp contrast to the partisan support European
players have come to expect when the matches are played on their
home ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not unlike a gallery at a regular US pro tour event.
There's just not a lot of partisanship,'' said Phil Schneiders, a
Scottsdale, Ariz., golfer who has been to two Ryder Cup
championships in Europe. ``The crowds over there are much noisier
and much more behind their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneiders said he doubts there's much animosity toward the
American players because of their pampered image. Instead, he said,
fans seem impressed by the European team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Parr, a member of the Loch Lomond Golf Club near Glasgow,
said he thought the European team neutralized much of the potential
fan support for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long, the European players have worked quite hard to
establish good relationships with the crowd, signing autographs and
speaking to fans,'' Parr said. ``They're more relaxed, and they're
smiling more often. The crowd appreciates how they work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Then too, he said with a smile, there is a natural American
inclination to root for the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the crowd is not actively wanting the Europeans to
win,'' he said. ``But I think they're happy to see them doing
well.''

ODD DUET PRODUCES A VICTORY FOR THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Desperately in need of finding someone to
match Tiger Woods's pace and stride _ not to mention his long,
daunting shadow _ the Americans Saturday summoned Steve Pate, a
38-year-old fellow Californian with limited Ryder Cup experience,
and the unlikely duet danced off with an impressive and gritty 1-up
victory in the morning foursomes at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Pate, who entered with a combined mark of 1-5-1 in
Ryder play, took a commanding 3-up lead over the first three holes,
the start to what looked like a runaway victory for the beleagured
American team.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching the European pair of Padraig Harrington and
Miguel Angel Jimenez chip away and pull even over the next eight
holes, the Yanks needed Woods's 25-foot putt for an eagle-3 on the
14th to provide what would be the winning margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really jelled well today,'' said Woods, who suffered a pair
of losses in Friday's opening matches when the Yanks dropped six of
eight matches. ``More than anything, our personalities jelled
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that partnership, Pate initially said they both
asked for the pairing, before kiddingly (and emphatically) adding,
``We demanded it!''
</P>
<P>
   Given how the match started, the Americans came out seemingly
winning on demand, striking strong second shots and feathering in
soft putts. They birdied the first four holes, winning 1, 2, and 3.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight on No. 1 was the second shot, by Woods, an iron
that he stuck two feet from the pin. The Europeans conceded the
putt. On the par-3 second hole, Woods's iron off the tee landed
eight fee short of the pin, with Pate adding the soft touch for the
birdie. On No. 3, Woods was back with another great iron shot that
left the Yanks with no more than 12 feet, and Pate once more added
the finger-roll finish.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of hell Friday, when the Yanks lost everything but
the anchor to Old Ironsides, suddenly the Americans had a helluva
twosome. Pate and Woods, the Golden State's golden boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a good margin early,'' said US captain Ben Crenshaw,
who paired Pate and Woods again for an afternoon round of
four-ball. ``Steve played some very fine shots on the back. I
wanted to send them back out because I think they have a feel for
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez and Harrington slowly chipped their way back to all
square, beginning with a birdie on No. 6, another on No. 8 and an
match-tying par-4 on No. 11. Pate hit the third shot on No. 11 for
the US, a chip from 50 feet that rolled 15 feet beyond the flag _
which would prove too difficult for Woods to salvage par. When
Jimenez rolled a 20-footer just left of the hole, the Yanks
conceded the par, and effectively, the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The dastardly 12th provided the round's best entertainment,
starting with Harrington's deep drive that exited to the right of
the fairway and landed in a tire rut along a stonedust path.
Jimenez made two drops, but finally had to settle for a lie not
much better than the tire rut, before following with a brilliant
shot from the rocky road. Both sides were now lying two, all of 12
inches from each other in tall grass surrounding a bunker at the
right edge of the green. Ultimately, the Yanks and Euros halved the
hole _ and two holes later, the match would be settled, punctuated
by Woods clenched right fist, held high for gallery and glory.

WHERE`S THE BEEF? AMERICANS FIND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Friday afternoon's victory may have been more
prestigious, but Saturday morning's was more appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``More time for lunch,'' observed Lee Westwood, savoring the
prospect after he and Darren Clarke had feasted on Mark O'Meara and
Jim Furyk, 3 and 2, in their Ryder Cup foursomes match. The victory
helped the Europeans seize an 8-4 lead over the United States,
before the teams stopped to break bread. ``That'll be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of priorities, and food certainly is one of them
for Northern Ireland's 220-pound Clarke and England's 195-pound
Westwood, beefy best buds who put the ``united'' in United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an appreciation of gustatory pleasures, they
share a rakish sense of humor, complementary games, and an obvious
aversion to the PGA fitness trailer. And if someone offered them a
pint of stout, chances are they wouldn't run away in horror.
</P>
<P>
   When Westwood was asked what exhortation captain Mark James had
employed to maintain their focus in the wake of their epic 1-up
victory over the world's top two players, Tiger Woods and David
Duval, in Friday's four-ball play, the Briton responded, ``Don't
drink too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just kidding, as usual, but the one-upmanship of
America's finest Friday, which gave Europe an improbable 6-2
first-day lead, certainly merited a toast or two. If nothing else,
it was an elixir for the duo's spirits, which had been jolted
Friday morning when they dropped their opening foursomes match, 3
and 2, to Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert _ the man who had rankled
Westwood by calling the Americans ``the world's 12 best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood, who happens to be ranked fifth in the world, had to
defer his revenge, but he and Clarke took it out on Woods and
Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us a lot of confidence, beating the No. 1 and 2
players in the world,'' he said. ``It made us feel we could beat
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and Furyk aren't just anybody _ they are rated 11th and
14th, respectively, in the world _ but they were no match for the
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both hitting the ball great,'' said Clarke. ``We try to
hit the fairways and greens and take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly took it to Furyk and O'Meara. The latter had
volunteered to sit out Friday morning's matches because he was
displeased with his game, but had been sorely disappointed when US
captain Ben Crenshaw bypassed him in the afternoon. O'Meara
probably wished he'd stayed on the practice range by the time
Westwood and Clarke were through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said O'Meara. ``We didn't play poorly,
but we didn't make any putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood missed one for par on the third, putting the Europeans
1-down, but that was their only misstep of the day. Westwood evened
matters when he dropped a 22-foot birdie putt on the par-4 sixth
and O'Meara missed from 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The match turned the Europeans' way on the par-5 ninth. Clarke
hit a magnificent chip from behind a bunker and Westwood deposited
a 12-foot birdie, then watched O'Meara push his 10-foot bid to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' said Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   The margin kept growing after a 25-minute delay caused by the
threat of lightning on the 10th. ``Maybe I just needed five minutes
to sit down,'' said Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   He and Clarke proceeded to revel in the sunshine that supplanted
the rain by capturing the par-4 12th (on a 7-footer for par by
Clarke) and par-5 14th (a 15-footer for birdie by Clarke). When
Furyk's 20-foot birdie attempt didn't fall on 16, the match was
over.
</P>
<P>
   It may have qualified only as dessert after their Friday
afternoon epic, but Westwood and Clarke aren't fussy about what's
put in front of them on the table.

 &HT;    MEXICAN GAYS HOLD FIRST OPEN PILGRIMAGE FOR TOLERANCE AT SHRINE
TO VIRGIN MARY
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY Clutching roses, dahlias and a lavender banner,
Mexican gays on Saturday conducted their first open pilgrimage to
pray for tolerance at this country's revered Virgin of Guadalupe
Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   ``God doesn't exclude us. He made us this way. And if we expect
others to overcome their fear of us then we must overcome our fear
to appear in public,'' said Guadalupe Lopez, 36, a lesbian who
dared join the controversial procession of about 150 people down a
main avenue here leading to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virgin of Guadalupe, bless us,'' proclaimed a lavender banner
that pilgrims carried as they entered the crowded basilica at
midday on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrimage organizers said they came to pray for an end to hate
crimes against homosexuals and transvestites in Mexico _ including
the killings of a gay couple they said occurred in Mexico City two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although many said they were afraid they might be harassed in
this mostly socially conservative country, participants met with no
difficulties as they sang and walked several kilometers toward the
basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the march _ including the ecumenical Metropolitan
Community Church here _ said they received threats after the
pilgrimage was announced earlier this week. The Catholic Archbishop
of Mexico also put out a disapproving press release distancing the
Catholic Church from the gay procession.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin of Guadalupe Basilica is the second most visited
Catholic shrine in the world. The Virgin of Guadalupe, a
dark-skinned Mary who legend says appeared to a Mexican Indian in
1531, is considered the patron saint of Mexico and is also dear to
other Latin Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother who protects all of us from oppression in Latin
America is the Virgin of Guadalupe,'' said the Rev. Gabriel Sosa of
Mexico's Metropolitan Community Church, which called for the
pilgrimage with a group here known as the Committee for Sexual
Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Community Church is an ecumenical Christian
organization with about 300 churches that welcome gays around the
world, Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the office of the Archbishop of Mexico
reacted to news of the gay pilgrimage by rejecting the procession
as an act of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Church does not reject people who have problems
or confusion with the sexual identity that God naturally gave
them,'' the church said in a press release. ``All human beings are
considered children of the creator subject to love and pardon.
However, church doctrine rejects the disorderly use of sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa shrugged at the Catholic hierarchy's position and said he
knows of many clergy who accept homosexuals as they are.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the archbishop, Esteban Gonzalez, 32, pointed at
the sky and said, ``What is there to pardon? The only one who can
pardon anyone is that person who is up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he came to the pilgrimage because he wanted to
feel ``closer to God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think events like these are important to helping gays
gain respect here,'' he said. ``Change here is very slow.''
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol of the purity of their devotion to the Virgin, the
gay pilgrims wore white to the procession. They also carried tiny
Mexican flags and bouquets of flowers, particularly roses, a
traditional offering for the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Reyna, a 22-year-old student and member of the Committee
for Sexual Diversity, said many gays decided not to attend the
pilgrimage out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are risks,'' she said, explaining that the committee has
counted about 150 violent ``hate crimes'' so far this year against
gays in Mexico City, including killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Catholic and I feel bad that the church doesn't open
itself up more,'' she said. ``In time, we hope that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who joined the procession, which drew Mexican
media coverage, were mothers or other supporters of gay liberation
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my sons died of AIDS four years ago,'' said Angela
Castro. ``Since then I've marched against discrimination.
Discrimination begins at home. I've fought with my husband and my
in-laws over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers of the procession appeared more tolerant than the
church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have different ways of living, but we're all believers
in the Virgin,'' said Ana Maria Casteneda, who sells balloons to
worshipers on their way into the shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we judge them?'' said Rutilio Salazar, an elderly
photographer who earns a living snapping souvenir shots of
pilgrims. ``When one comes to the holy sanctuary of the Virgin one
should never be rejected or judged.''

MAGGERT CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IN US FOUR-BALL EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Not to second-guess our earnest American
captain, but where exactly was Jeff Maggert for Saturday
afternoon's four-ball matches?
</P>
<P>
   You don't throw Fred out there without Ginger. You don't send
Bethune out there without Cookman. You don't suit up Johnson
without Johnson. So what was Gentle Ben doing, anyway? didn't he
notice that the team _ that's T-E-A-M _ of Hal Sutton and Jeff
Maggert had been his most formidable duo during the first day and a
half of Ryder Cup competition?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize enough that we are doing this as a team,''
asserted Sutton after the Americans had won holes 17 and 18 in
dramatic fashion for a 2-up triumph over Colin Montgomerie and Paul
Lawrie. That victory gave the US a valuable point _ in this fierce
competition every point is valuable _ in the opening match of the
day. It was a true clutch performance by Messrs. Sutton and
Maggert, given that the scoreboard was already bearing the grim
tidings of two more American disasters before their own match was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made Sutton and Maggert 2-1 in the first two days of
competition. Compared to any other American grouping, that made
them a veritable Hogan and Snead.
</P>
<P>
   This much we know: European captain Mark James would never have
broken up a winning combo. In days one and two he has only used
nine of his 12 players. Jean Van de Velde, Jarmo Sandelin and
Andrew Coltart have been relegated to Christian Laettner/Dream Team
status (everyone gets to play in  &UR; Sunday's  &LR; singles matches,
however). And had current Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal not
volunteered himself out of the morning match on both Friday and
Saturday, Captain James wouldn't have made any changes at all.
Padraig Harrington would not have been paired with Spaniard Manuel
Angel Jiminez; he'd have joined the aforementioned trio in the role
of cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   But Crenshaw did it his way, replacing Maggert with Justin
Leonard for the afternoon four-ball match with James's kilted
warriors, Montgomerie and Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   The Crenshaw explanation has something to do with Leonard
perhaps getting hot with his putter. Perhaps the mentor simply
thought the talented Leonard was due. After all, with the morning
loss he and partner Payne Stewart had sustained to The Kid and The
Kook (sometimes known as Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik),
Leonard's Ryder Cup career record was 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that Maggert and Sutton had been working well
together. ``Jeff and I play similar games,'' analyzed Sutton. ``We
both drive the ball straight, and we're both good iron players.''
</P>
<P>
   You can say it was circumstance, but the fates conspired to make
Maggert the hero of the morning match, for it was the Texan who
rammed home a birdie putt on 17 that altered a match that had been
all square since the 11th hole in favor of the Americans, and it
was the Texan who sealed the match with a sparkling second shot
7-iron that rolled to a concedable distance on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putt was not normally a putt you think about making,'' he
maintained. ``I had a good read on it. It was uphill. I didn't have
to worry about the ball rolling real far past the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the dramatic 7-iron, Maggert had this to say: ``I was
just thinking, `Knock it in there tight for a birdie,' '' he
explained. ``Paul (Lawrie) had hit his shot over to the right. I
just wanted to hit a solid shot and give Hal an opportunity for a
birdie in case he needed it. I had a perfect (7-iron) yardage
there, and just tried to hit a solid shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert isn't exactly regarded as the warm and cuddly type in
his homeland, and that's nothing compared to his current status
across the pond, where he and Stewart have been portrayed as
Villains 1 and 1A. Stewart earned his status by declaring that he
couldn't wait to start earning Ryder Cup points so he could defend
the 1999 Cup, while Maggert became a pariah when he said that
America had the ``12 best players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where all that came from,'' he protested. ``Go
look at the PGA's transcript.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's. Here is what the transcript has Maggert saying at the
general interview session last Tuesday: ``I think alternate shot is
a little more crucial on how you pair guys together. Let's face it,
we've got the 12 best players in the world and if they just go out
and play golf and hit golf shots, it's hard to mess up putting two
guys together.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the British journalists have picked up on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I mean is that we have to think we're the 12 best
players, or why even bother to compete?'' he pleaded. ``If we don't
believe that, there's something wrong. If anything, it's a
compliment. We will have to play well together to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll never buy this explanation over there, but no matter.
What's indisputable is that Jeff Maggert has contributed mightily
to the American's cause, so much so that it was a bit odd not to
see him paired with somebody Saturday afternoon, even if it wasn't
Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ben it's tough to play five matches and be as fresh for
singles,'' said a diplomatically-inclined Maggert. ``I struggled
Saturday in the four-ball format (he and Sutton lost, 2 and 1, to
Jimenez and Olazabal), and didn't hit the ball as well as I would
like to.''
</P>
<P>
   All we know is that the last time we saw Jeff Maggert strike the
ball it landed about a foot and a half from the hole from 175 yards
out. That's a tough memory to shake.

ON THE 6TH, GOING FOR A DRIVE   WASN'T THE BEST ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MATSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The easiest hole on the course might be the
par-4 sixth. Or maybe it just looks easy.
</P>
<P>
   Its perched green sits on top of a hill only 310 yards from the
tee. Even with tall pines standing sentry along the back of the
tiny green, and bunkers guarding the left front and the right side,
it remains a seductive target. So close.
</P>
<P>
   On the tee, the Americans puff their chests and flex their
muscles and reach into their golf bags. Driver. Driver. Driver. US
captain Ben Crenshaw even had the narrow up-slope between the
bunkers short of the green cut at less than an inch so that long,
accurate drives might bounce onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans seem to see a different possibility: An iron off
the tee to lay up, a wedge close to the pin, a good chance for an
easy birdie.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like a hole a professional could quickly wrestle to the
ground. But when accuracy is essential, does a driver give any
advantage over a precise iron? In best ball strategy, long hitters
expect to aim for the green. But in alternate shot play, a more
conservative approach seems to work better.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's morning foursomes, three of the four American duos
lost the hole, driving into big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and Steve Pate came to the sixth 3 up over Miguel
Angel Jimenez and Padraig Harrington. Woods hit his drive into the
rough short of the left side of the green. Pate chipped to 13 feet,
but Woods missed the birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, meanwhile, laid up in the fairway and Harrington stuck
his wedge to 5 feet for an easy birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Woods made the same mistake, again driving into the
rough and scrambling for a bogey with Tom Lehman, while Sergio
Garcia and Jesper Parnevik took their par and won the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Justin Leonard's drive landed in the left rough and
Payne Stewart's sand wedge left the team with a three-putt from 25
feet for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, however, hit a 5-iron off the tee to 89 yards and
Parnevik dropped a wedge onto the green. The ball spun back 2 feet
from the hole and the Europeans has another smart victory on No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Stewart, all square when they stood on the tee, left
the sixth green 1 down.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk and Mark O'Meara lost the hole, too, to Darren Clarke
and Lee Westwood, but theirs was a simple two-putt from 15 feet
after Westwood sank a birdie putt of 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   After their opening day 6-2 lead, European captain Mark James
spoke about his team's approach. ``We're going to maintain the
focus and go out and shoot the lowest numbers we can and just try
to play our normal golf games: Hit fairways, hit greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems easy enough, doesn't it?

ILL WIND BLOWS FOR STEWART, LEONARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ That wasn't a frontal system that moved
across The Country Club Saturday morning. It was a nasty European
weather pattern _ El Nino packing a Swedish deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping through the Americans twice Friday, Sergio Garcia
and Jesper Parnevik came back again to blow away Payne Stewart and
Justin Leonard, 3 and 2, in the second set of foursomes and picked
up a critical point for the defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very, very well again,'' said Parnevik, after he and
his 19-year-old partner went 4 up after 11 and closed out the Yanks
on the 16th hole. Meanwhile, Stewart and Leonard, who hadn't played
together in the Friday foursomes, performed as though they'd been
thrown together on the practice range.
</P>
<P>
   After claiming the second hole when Garcia missed his par putt,
the Americans didn't win another until the 13th, when Stewart sank
a birdie putt from the fringe. By then, they were already on life
support. ``We just didn't play all that well,'' Leonard said with a
shrug after he and Stewart had bogeyed five holes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans didn't have their chances. Leonard left a
beautiful long putt an inch short that would have won the seventh.
Stewart had a winner lip out on the 12th, missed another winner on
the 15th, and ended the match watching a 6-footer slide by.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, meanwhile, followed the match-play book as though
they'd memorized it in nursery school. They sank key putts on the
front nine to halve holes they might have lost. They played well
within themselves. And when the chance came, Garcia and Parnevik
got their hosts in a hammerlock and slowly squeezed the life out of
them.
</P>
<P>
   All they needed was a bit of American bungling on the par-5
ninth. Stewart hooked his tee shot into the woods, then put his
approach into the rough. Leonard chipped past the hole, Stewart
missed the putt, and the Europeans were 2 up at the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Had Leonard's 30-foot putt not stopped just short on the 10th
and Garcia not made a pressure 15-footer for birdie, the US might
have been able to scramble back. Instead, after losing the 11th
when Stewart's chip from the rough ran comically long, the Yanks
were in deep trouble, 4 down with seven to play.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Europeans were marking anything up. ``Everybody
thinks 4 up is a huge gap but it's not,'' said Parnevik. ``All of a
sudden they make two birdies and we're only 2 up and anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, it looked as if anything might. Stewart sank a
putt from the fringe to win the 13th, then dropped another on the
14th to halve. But when Stewart missed and Garcia made to halve the
15th, the Europeans were dormie and the Yanks needed a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard knocked his tee shot onto the green within reach of
the pin on the par-3 16th, it looked as if the US might stay alive
for at least another quarter hour. But Stewart watched the bird
take wing and El Nino and his Swedish playmate had another point in
their pockets. ``We're hanging in there and won on the 16th,''
mused Parnevik. ``And that's pretty good.''

PATE A BOOST FOR WOODS' MORALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The awkward look of terror and torment on
Tiger Woods's face finally melted away Saturday. Coupled with new
partner Steve Pate, the world's No. 1 golfer played day No. 2 of
the Ryder Cup, with his trademark confidence and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, looking relaxed yet focused, made sensational iron shots
and ultimately clinched a 1-up victory in morning foursomes with a
clutch 25-foot putt on No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' said Woods, when asked what he thought of being
paired with the steady Pate, who was dropped into the Yanks' lineup
after sitting out Friday's matches. ``I absolutely loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, known for his sense of humor and well-liked by his peers,
at times appeared blase on The Country Club's lush loop Saturday.
Leading Miguel Angel Jimenez and Padraig Harrington 3 up, Pate
munched on an apple while scaling a hill on the sixth hole. Perhaps
this was the World Series of golf, but Pate had the air of a man
headed to a company picnic. Any second, his caddy might have pulled
a papier-mache red-and-white tablecloth from his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is pretty good,'' said Pate, who, in his only prior
Ryder Cup appearance in 1991, teamed with Corey Pavin for a loss,
only to exit when he was involved in a car crash in Kiawah Isle
(South Carolina). ``We know what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate walks with a comfortable, leisurely swagger, the ying to
Woods's ramrod straight yang. It looked at times as if Pate were
providing Falstaffian relief for Woods, who, at 23, is
unquestionably talented, but also undeniably young.
</P>
<P>
   Woods wears an icon's crown and already is wealthy beyond
imagination, but the Ryder Cup has shown him to be uncomfortable,
unsettled, unsure. His suit of expectation needs tailoring, and
with Pate by his side, it appears he found a partner who fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood is pretty upbeat,'' said Pate, who for a day was the
Yanks' pschological maestro. ``We're just ready to keep playing
golf.''

MONTGOMERIE PUTTING UP THE POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When European coach Mark James sent Colin
Montgomerie to the leadoff match with partner Paul Lawrie Saturday
morning at The Country Club, he was hoping to put a quick end to
any thoughts of a United States comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen in a 1-up loss to Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert,
but Montgomerie, in particular, made the Americans sweat down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin's a wonderful player,'' said James. ``And the players
look to him for inspiration and leadership and respect his game
immensely. And he does set the tone, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Montgomerie took a 4-1-2 record from the 1997
and current Ryder Cups into Saturday's foursome match as well as
his usual repartee with a gallery whose pro-American slant really
got his competitive juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Friday, when he and British Open champ Lawrie
dispatched Phil Mickelson and David Duval, then went all square
with Davis Love and Justin Leonard when Love sank a miracle
30-footer at 18, it was the Americans who finally knocked off
Montgomerie in team play.
</P>
<P>
   But this most veteran of European Ryder Cuppers didn't go down
without a fierce, and sometimes emotional fight.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie stepped away from a birdie putt at the sixth hole
when the some in the gallery hadn't stopped clapping and cheering
following a successful Sutton birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton wasn't impressed with that display. ``I didn't want them
to call out to Colin,'' he said. ``What I wanted them to do was get
behind us a little bit more. I want the best for the European team.
I don't want anyone to treat them negatively in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty answered the negative, loquacious few with a perfect putt,
then threw his arm and fist in the air. At 10, when his long chip
helped save par, there was a smile of acknowledgment, quickly
replaced by a determined look that there was serious work to do.
</P>
<P>
   That work was interrupted for 20 minutes when play was
suspended, and it appeared the Europeans would benefit: A poor
Sutton drive set up a winning par for Montgomerie and Lawrie to
even the match.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until Maggert's heroics on 17 and 18, as the
American supporters, along each fairway, cheered ``USA, USA,'' in
counterpoint to the smaller bands of fans who yelled ``Monty,
Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Montgomerie put an iron shot a foot from the pin, forcing
Maggert to make an 8-footer for a matching birdie. At 16, he nailed
a 6-footer, dead-center for par to keep things even and at 17, he
put his approach shot 20 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where Monty was finally upstaged. Maggert made a
clutch, 22-foot twisting birdie to win the hole and followed it
with a 7-iron to 18 that finally proved a Montgomerie team could
indeed be beaten by the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's a very tiring week, mentally more than
physically,'' said Montgomerie. ``I just hope that I can get as
many points as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, that's been a lot of points for Montgomerie, who teed it
up again in the afternoon with Lawrie against Steve Pate and Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Four down, one to go.

CASEY HAS THE RIGHT MOVES IN QUARTERBACK MATCHUP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ All the publicity surrounding Penn State's
new wide-open passing offense was just talk Saturday against
Indiana. But the No. 2-ranked Nittany Lions received plenty of big
plays elsewhere to win, 45-24, in the Big Ten Conference opener for
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions' best weapon in heart-stopping victories over
Pittsburgh and Miami was resourcefulness. But Saturday, on a sunny
afternoon before 96,416 at Beaver Stadium, Penn State needed an
unexpected amount against the surprisingly game Hoosiers (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Branch's 90-yard punt return for a touchdown and Rashard
Casey's 31-yard scramble for a score on Penn State's next
possession helped turn a 17-10 nail-biter into a 31-10 cushion in
the third quarter. Indiana stayed close behind its option
quarterback, Antwaan Randle El, but the Lions never led by less
than 14 in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype accompanying Randle El into this game, Casey
was the dominant multiple threat. He completed 13 of 15 passes for
two touchdowns, and ran for 66 yards and a touchdown while still
alternating with Kevin Thompson (7 of 12 for 86 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Casey, of Hoboken, N.J., thrilled the crowd with his moves. The
Nittany Lions were leading by 24-10 early in the third quarter when
the Lions' Askari Adams recovered Derin Graham's muffed catch of a
punt at the Indiana 31. On the next play, Casey rolled right, cut
up field, broke a tackle, then switched fields again. For his
closing move, Casey swan-dived over the cone for a touchdown;
ninety-eight yard kickoff returns have taken less time.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' defense had a trying day chasing Randle El. Penn
State Coach Joe Paterno had hoped his team would have a dominant
performance before next week's bye, but it did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Randle El, who ran for 67 yards on 17 carries and completed 11
of 23 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns, froze the Nittany
Lions on defense one last time, allowing him to throw a 27-yard
touchdown to Versie Gaddis to close Penn State's lead to 38-24 with
10 minutes 54 seconds left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was closer, and Penn State held an uncomfortable
17-10 lead going into the locker room. The Nittany Lions expected
to resurrect their rushing attack against the Big 10's worst
defense, but found themselves sputtering. Penn State managed just
78 yards on 24 carries before the half, and had to rely on a gift
turnover to get on the scoreboard after Indiana took a 3-0 lead on
Andy Payne's 40-yard field goal on the first drive.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's second drive was rumbling along when Randle El threw
right to Adams as if he were part of the pass pattern. Adams then
weaved 37 yards down the left sideline for a touchdown with 8:11
left in the first quarter. The kick gave Penn State a 7-3 lead but
did nothing to assuage the unease of Paterno and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Casey, who had shown big-play capability, relied on
short passes to combine for 11 of 12 completions for 152 yards. In
completing just 1 of 5 passes for 4 yards, Casey prematurely
released bullets that fluttered away from his receivers. But he was
exciting on the option.
</P>
<P>
   And his throw to tight end Tony Stewart at the start of the
second quarter stretched into a 30-yard gain that set up the
Nittany Lions with a first-and-goal at the Indiana 5.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Aaron Harris backed 1 yard into the end zone two plays
later to increase the Nittany Lions' cushion to 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   Randle El, who is the Hoosiers' point guard on the basketball
team, leads the football team in passing, rushing and scoring. As a
quarterback he made a better running back in the first half. He
also has a propensity to make decisions at the last moment, even
while in a tackler's grasp. His derring-do guided Indiana on a
12-play drive of all running plays that he capped with a 1-yard
high-step for a touchdown to pull the Hoosiers within 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions thought they had recovered a Randle-El fumble
a play earlier, but they were whistled for being offside.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nittany Lions last possession of the half, Penn State
turned to kicker Travis Forney. His 26-yard field goal was good to
make it 17-10.

PARNEVIK-GARCIA MAGIC WONDERFUL TO WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ One of them was 15 when the other was born.
One speaks Swedish, the other speaks Spanish. One eats herring, the
other eats (itals)huevos(unitals). One brought his wife here, the
other brought his mother. One is a captain's pick, the other a
wonderchild who made the team in a whirlwind five months. One
provides the chill, the other the duende.
</P>
<P>
   What Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia have together is a
wondrous alchemy, a balance of skills and styles that has made them
the stars of the European team and the darlings of the gallery at
The Country Club this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him and Sergio have just clicked,'' said European captain Mark
James, who put the 34-year-old Parnevik and the 19-year-old Garcia
together at their request as soon as they arrived here and has been
shrewd enough to leave well enough alone as they've ripped through
the American team.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia amuses Parnevik with his easy grin, his fist-pumping
enthusiasm, and his adolescent disregard for stress. ``Everyone
thinks he's just a rookie, but he's been around a long time,'' said
Parnevik. ``He made his first cut on the European tour when he was
15. Every time I need him, he's right there. Every time he needs to
hit a good shot, he does it. He's doing everything he has to do.
You can't ask for anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   And Parnevik, studying lies and lines interminably beneath his
flipped-up cap, settles and stabilizes ``El Nino.'' ``I'm so
confident with him,''' Garcia said after he and Parnevik had wiped
out Payne Stewart and Justin Leonard to remain unbeaten after
Saturday morning's foursomes. ``I'm so confident that he's going to
hit good shots and make some good putts. He's just perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   They are endearing co-conspirators, walking side by side along
the fairways, chatting and nodding and tipping their caps to the
R-dropping hordes on the far side of the ropes who've adopted them
as their favorite foreigners. ``I think it's the emotion,'' Garcia
said. ``They like us and that's very good. They're taking good care
of us.''

 &HT;    CHALLENGED BY BRADLEY, GORE MAKES EMOTIONAL PLEA FOR DEMOCRATIC
SUPPORT
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore shed his trademark formality
in an unusually emotional speech that energized powerful Democrats
on Saturday, the strongest indication yet that Gore understands the
formidable challenge he faces from Bill Bradley for the party's
2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's performance at the close of the Democratic National
Committee's fall meeting was like no other in his campaign to date,
and it contrasted sharply with the low-key, plodding address that
Bradley delivered to the Democrats only minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   It came only one day after the release of a new CNN/Time poll in
which Gore, for the first time in the Democratic contest, trailed
Bradley in New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, upon arriving at the hotel ballroom where
the DNC was concluding its three-day meeting, waded through the
crowd to reach the stage as the 1973 O'Jays classic ``Love Train''
added a pulse to the air. He did not even wait for Party Chairman
Joe Andrew to formally introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   And once on stage, Gore abandoned the lectern that had been
fixed with the vice presidential seal and wandered about the stage
in the style of a TV talk-show host, jabbing the air for emphasis,
especially when criticizing Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   And while Gore did not mention any of the recent polls showing a
surge in Bradley's popularity, the vice president vowed that he
intends to ``work my heart out'' in order to win the presidential
nomination that only months ago seemed his for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   His exit followed a similar script. He shook hands with as many
of the 428 DNC members as he could. As he did, hundreds of Gore
campaign workers, confined to a ``guest'' area in the back of the
ballroom, waved ``Gore 2000'' placards in time with Shania Twain's
``Rock This Country,'' the informal theme song of the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, made a non-descript entry to the
stage after a formal introduction by Andrew. Bradley, too, brought
hundreds of poster-waving ``guests''' to the meeting. And he also
waded through the crowd after speaking.
</P>
<P>
   But the scholarly former senator, who has prided himself on his
plodding manner in the campaign, spoke in an understated delivery
with reading glasses perched atop his nose. And much of his speech
was designed to spell concerns about his allegiance to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporters have occasionally raised that issue by citing
Bradley's criticism of the party at the time of his retirement from
the Senate in 1996 and his briefly flirtation with an independent
run against President Clinton that same year.
</P>
<P>
   They made their point at the DNC meeting Saturday by wearing
buttons that read, ``ALways a Democrat'' - with ``AL'' in blue and
the rest of the letters in red.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back speeches by Gore and Bradley marked the first
time the two foes have made a joint appearance before the same
crowd. And it occurred in an unusually charged atmosphere. Hotel
hallways, bars and restaurants were jammed with campaign officials
and activists trying to analyze the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It also produced the kind of logistical jockeying normally
expected later in the primary season. Gore was originally scheduled
to address the DNC first, but at the last minute demanded the final
speaking slot, apparently in an effort to leave the DNC members
with a lasting impression before they return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley told the DNC members that he became a Democrat in 1964
after watching Barry Goldwater, the GOP's presidential nominee that
year, vote against the Civil Rights Act in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that much of the party establishment is backing Gore in
the two-man race, Bradley insisted that a ``spirited debate of
ideas'' between the two of them would help energize the party for
the general election contest against the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He congratulated the new general chair of the DNC, Philadelphia
Mayor Ed Rendell, who had previously endorsed Gore, and reported
Rendell's promise that ``things will be fair'' in the Democratic
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that such party luminaries as House Leader Dick Gephardt
and Senate Leader Tom Daschle are supporting the vice president, he
added, ``I want you to know. . . whether you are for me or against
me that we share that same goal of mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Democratic contest should be conducted in a manner
that shows disaffected voters that ``politics doesn't have to be
about negative campaigning, that it could be about ideas.'' And he
said the nominee should be chosen by ``the people,'' not the party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley credited the Clinton-Gore administration with being ``a
good steward of a good economy,'' but asked, ``What else is there
to do?'' He promised to champion gun control, expansion of health
insurance coverage, campaign finance reform, anti-poverty programs
and improving race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore did not mention his challenger by name, he seized
on the fact that Bradley had not mentioned abortion rights, Social
Security, Medicare and collective bargaining rights. He vowed to
make all of them a priority in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also offered a veiled criticism of his challenger's having
once supported a limited experiment with vouchers in trying to
improve public schools. ``I have never been for vouchers,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's sharpest criticism was aimed at Bush, with his most
direct reference to the Texas governor yet. He questioned the
decision of the ``the current Republican frontrunner'' to oppose
hate crime legislation in Texas or to support a state law
protecting gun manufacturers from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience of Bush's comment that ``a wave of
evil'' was responsible for recent shooting tragedies in schools and
churches around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evil stalking the land ... evil has always been with
us,'' he said. ``We have the power to overcome evil with good.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I would say to the current Republican frontrunner _
Why don't you join us in the effort to take the weapons of evil out
of the hands of evil-doers. That would do a lot of good in this
country.''

<P>
   After five years and millions of dollars, the Justice
Department's criminal investigation of the tobacco industry boiled
down to this: one misdemeanor charge against an obscure
biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had scrutinized whether industry executives lied and
perjured themselves in 1994, when they testified before Congress
that cigarettes were not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had plowed through corporate documents for
evidence that cigarette makers manipulated the level of nicotine in
their product. Whistle-blowers were interviewed by prosecutors, and
company scientists testified before grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno announced a broad
civil lawsuit accusing cigarette makers of racketeering and fraud
and seeking to recover billions in health-care costs related to
smoking. Justice officials also publicly acknowledged a decision
that had been clear for months _ that the criminal inquiry had been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case that the criminal division decided they were not
likely to win,'' said a Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   How the government's investigation of an entire industry came to
an end without producing indictments is the story of an ambitious
effort made more difficult by the complex science of cigarette
making, disagreements between federal officials, disappointing
witnesses and an unfavorable court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, prosecutors faced the problem of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that cigarette makers had knowingly misled the
public and regulators about the health risks of smoking and the
addictive nature of nicotine. Faced this spring with expiring
deadlines for filing a criminal action, the government chose an
easier course, a civil lawsuit in which its burden of proof would
be lower.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the criminal inquiry began, cigarette companies have
denied that they misled the government about their knowledge of the
health hazards of smoking or that they manipulated nicotine levels
to keep smokers smoking. In the last two years, the nation's
biggest tobacco companies have agreed to pay $246 billion over 25
years to settle lawsuits filed by states to recover health care
costs related to smoking and signed consent agreements not to
misrepresent the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the government's lawsuit last week, tobacco
companies asked why the Justice Department had chosen to charge
them with crimes in a civil suit, when it had dropped its criminal
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot help but question the department's motives in
making those same allegations under the guise of a quasi-criminal''
case, said Kenneth Handal, associate general counsel for Philip
Morris Cos., ``after it found no basis for bringing those same
charges in its criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   With Philip Morris, the other defendants in the civil suit are
Brown &AMP; Williamson, a division of BAT Industries PLC; R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co.; Lorillard Tobacco Co., a division of Loews Corp.;
Liggett Group, a division of the Brooke Group, and two now-defunct
trade groups, the Council for Tobacco Research USA Inc. and the
Tobacco Institute Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's criminal inquiry goes back to April 14,
1994, when seven top executives of cigarette companies stood before
Congress during the hearing about the risks of their products and
swore that nicotine was not addictive and that no one had proved
that smoking caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., sent a memorandum to
Reno urging her to investigate the executives for possible perjury
because of the mass of scientific evidence on the addictiveness of
nicotine and the link between smoking and cancer. The assignment
was passed on to Jimmye Warren, a senior trial lawyer in the
Justice Department's fraud section, who decided to look into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Proving perjury, however, is extremely difficult, and the
tobacco industry wasted little time mounting a counteroffensive.
Three lawyers hired by cigarette makers, including Robert Fiske,
the original Whitewater prosecutor, and William Hendricks, a former
top Justice official, soon went to the Justice Department to argue
that lawmakers had asked broad questions and that the executives
had expressed their beliefs, for which they could not be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than ending, the investigation mushroomed. By 1995,
thousands of secret Brown &AMP; Williamson documents taken from a law
firm by a paralegal, Merrell Williams, suggested that the company
had long known about the risks of smoking. States including
Mississippi, Minnesota and Florida had sued cigarette makers, and
the discovery process would produce millions more documents. And
whistle-blowers like Jeffrey Wigand, a former top executive at
Brown &AMP; Williamson, had also appeared to accuse industry officials
of lying about their products' addictive nature.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, federal prosecutors had convened grand jury inquiries
in Alexandria, Va.; Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York; the
District of Columbia and New Orleans, to investigate the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   One Justice task force was investigating whether Philip Morris
had illegally manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to
keep smokers addicted. A second group was investigating whether
R.J. Reynolds, despite its denials, was aiming its advertising at
underage smokers. A third was looking into whether Brown &AMP;
Williamson had made false statements to federal officials about
efforts to genetically engineer seeds to produce plants with higher
nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   After infighting among the different jurisdictions, top
officials at the Justice Department in Washington took control of
the grand jury investigations in mid-1996 and consolidated them. It
became the government's most significant prosecutorial effort aimed
at a single consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   The potential criminal violations under investigation were
broad, including accusations of fraud, conspiracy, racketeering,
obstruction and perjury against tobacco executives.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials said that the criminal inquiry led
into a succession of dead ends. Several prosecution theories were
tried, including sweeping charges of a pattern of deceitful
conduct. Senior officials concluded that they were not likely to
prevail in a criminal trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At one point, prosecutors weighed whether they could file a
criminal racketeering complaint, using a federal law usually
applied against organized crime and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   That approach would have permitted authorities to use industry
documents dating back decades that showed company officials
plotting strategies over how to deflect public concerns about
smoking risks. And a senior FBI official involved in the tobacco
inquiry said he and other agents had urged such an approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials decided to bring a simpler
fraud case. It would show a more recent pattern of misconduct, but
it also had a problem: Any indictment would have to be brought this
year because of the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually that approach was also abandoned because of the
difficulties in showing that executives had intentionally and
fraudulently misled the government about the dangers of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators unearthed evidence showing that the executives had
maneuvered carefully in their communications with regulators around
issues like nicotine addiction, often guided by lawyers who advised
them on nearly every major action. At one point, government
prosecutors considered bringing charges against those lawyers but
then dropped that possibility because it would have been a
difficult legal hurdle, said one plaintiffs' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Osdene, the head of research at Philip Morris for nearly
two decades, was viewed by many plaintiffs' lawyers as a witness
whose testimony in the criminal inquiry might spell doom for the
industry. Documents indicated that Osdene had shifted the company's
sensitive nicotine research abroad, apparently to avoid scrutiny by
regulators, and possibly destroyed important records. Two FBI
agents arrived at Osdene's home in Richmond, Va., in 1996 with a
subpoena for any Philip Morris documents he had retained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Osdene tried to strike an immunity deal with the
Justice Department, but his offer was rejected. Several lawyers
knowledgeable about the case said that he later reached such an
agreement with prosecutors, but added that any testimony he might
have given did not affect events. Osdene did not return telephone
calls. His lawyer, John Nields, declined to comment on whether
Osdene had been granted immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The company that faced the greatest danger was Brown &AMP;
Williamson, because it was the only producer notified by the
government that it was a target of its investigation. Prosecutors
were looking at whether company officials had, among other things,
lied to the Food and Drug Administration during meetings in 1994
when they said they had not developed genetically engineered
tobacco seeds with enhanced nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators discovered that such a seed, code-named Y-1, had been
developed for Brown &AMP; Williamson by a small biotechnology company,
DNA Plant Technology Corp. of Oakland, Calif. And in the first and
only charge brought in the criminal case, Justice Department
officials accused the firm of conspiring with a cigarette maker to
produce nicotine-enriched tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, DNA Plant Technology pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor count of conspiring to illegally export the Y-1 seeds
and agreed to cooperate in the government's continuing inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson officials were soon brought to testify before
a grand jury in Washington. But that inquiry also died. Raymond
Marshall, a lawyer in San Francisco who represented DNA Plant
Technology, said he never heard from Justice Department officials
again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government's inquiry suffered a setback when a
federal appeals court ruled that the FDA did not have authority to
regulate tobacco, raising doubts about the ability of prosecutors
to bring charges that companies had made false statements to the
agency. In a separate ruling, another judge declined to give
prosecutors access to certain Brown &AMP; Williamson records, saying
that they were confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Both enthusiasm and time were running out. By early this year,
prosecutors were assigned to different jobs, and it was clear, said
industry lawyers, that indictments were highly unlikely because
statutes of limitations were expiring.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Clinton abruptly announced during his
State of the Union address that the Justice Department planned to
file a civil lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers like Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Kent Conrad of North Dakota had met with Reno to urge such
action last year, after the collapse of tobacco legislation in the
Senate. And for a time, officials in the Justice Department's civil
division had debated whether to bring such a suit.
</P>
<P>
   But G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame University law professor who
consulted with Kennedy and Conrad, said the president's speech had
sounded the starting bell that resulted in last week's filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president hadn't told them to do it, they would still
be debating,'' Blakey said. ``It was basically a thunderclap.''

TO TEST FOR DEADLY VIRUS, CITY CHECKS DEAD BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a new effort to identify the mosquito-borne
disease that has killed three people in New York City, health
officials sent dozens of staff members through city streets on
Saturday to retrieve dead birds for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The search for dead birds comes one day after experts discovered
that a disease they first believed to be St. Louis encephalitis _
which killed dozens of birds at the Bronx Zoo and has infected at
least 14 people in New York City and four in Westchester County _
may actually be the rare West Nile virus, which has never been
diagnosed in the Western Hemisphere, government scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on
Friday night that they had identified a West Nile-like virus in
four birds from New York that they had tested in Fort Collins,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The birds included two flamingos and an Asian pheasant from the
Bronx Zoo, and a crow reported to be from Scarsdale, said Kristine
Smith, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   In starting the bird hunt on Friday night, city health officials
opened special telephone lines and asked residents to call in
sightings of dead birds. By noon Saturday, the City Health
Department had received a dozen reports of dead birds in all five
boroughs, and sent staff from its pest-control division to retrieve
specimens, said a spokeswoman, Sandra Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds will be kept on dry ice and brought to our Bureau of
Laboratories,'' she said, adding that most of the dead birds
reported were crows, which have been dying in large numbers since
the beginning of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in Suffolk County collected five dead crows on
Friday, and sent them for analysis to the state Department of
Environmental Conservation on Saturday, said the director of public
health, Mahfouz Zaki. And after receiving reports at 5:30 p.m. on
Friday that earlier samples from dead crows tested positive for
disease, they sprayed south Huntington with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, a team from the Parks Department swept through
Central Park on Friday night searching for dead birds but found
none, said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern. He said that more teams
would be dispatched, but that all park staff had been notified and
were on the lookout.
</P>
<P>
   News that the infection might be West Nile virus has deepened an
epidemiological mystery that began in July with the deaths of
numerous crows around the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   A pathologist at the zoo, Tracey McNamara, first noticed that
large numbers of crows were dying, reaching 40 by August. Then
birds at the zoo, including a guanay cormorant, three Chilean
flamingos, a pheasant and a bald eagle, died.
</P>
<P>
   Though the symptoms of the two diseases are similar, and the
steps to combat them are the same, the mosquitoes that carry them
can differ, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith of the state Health Department said the mosquitoes
that carry St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile viruses, the Culex
pipiens, are generally active from dusk to dawn. However, another
type of mosquito known to carry the West Nile virus, the Aedes
vexans, is also active during the day, she said. Both illnesses
usually produce only mild symptoms, but in some cases can cause
neurological disorders and even death.
</P>
<P>
   The identification of a West Nile-like virus stunned health
officials. ``It is totally unprecedented,'' said Duane Gubler,
director of the division of vector-born infectious disease at the
Centers for Disease Control. He said that the ``movement of people
and the jet airplane'' have increased the movement of pathogens.
And while the implications of the suspected virus are unknown, he
said, ``We could expect to see it move north and south in the
Western Hemisphere.''

COLOMBIA'S TRAGEDY, CAPTURED IN CLOSE-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an Editorial Observer piece on
Sunday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be numbed by the panorama of violence raging in
Colombia. Drug killings, paramilitary massacres, guerrilla
kidnappings, death squad murders and street crime have all
intertwined. Diarrhea and tuberculosis get less attention in some
public health reports than the disease of the sicario, or hired
killer _ which often takes the form of two young men, a motorcycle
and a .38.
</P>
<P>
   Violence becomes human and real, however, in the films of Victor
Gaviria. Gaviria has made two movies set in what is perhaps the
world's most deadly neighborhood, the slums of the northeastern
hills surrounding Medellin. ``Rodrigo D.: No Future,'' which came
out in 1990, and last year's ``Rose Seller'' depict the aimless
brutality suffered by, and inflicted by, young people in these
slums. The films are fiction but have an authenticity because the
actors are themselves the criminals, gang members and street
children they portray. They often meet the same fates as their
characters. Since ``Rodrigo D.'' was filmed in 1986 _ a year when
Medellin's leading cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds _
nine of its leading actors have been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   The films tug at reality in other ways. ``Rodrigo D.'' _ which
won various prizes _ shocked Medellin and Colombia, and sparked a
national attempt to help the children. But violence still dominates
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gaviria, from Medellin's middle class, was told about life in
the slums a short distance from his house by the grandson of an
actor in one of his earlier films. Few in beautiful, green and
prosperous Medellin knew of the city's slums. By Colombian
standards, the slums, with their sturdy brick houses, are not poor.
</P>
<P>
   The question of why entire neighborhoods seem bent on dying in
the street has produced a local science called violentology.
Colombia's violentologists believe that the breakdown of community
values matters far more than income. Medellin's slums were mostly
settled by some of the 3 million people who fled political violence
in Colombia's countryside during the 1950s, an uprooting that
stripped them of their traditional way of life and sense of
community. Then came the rise of cocaine in the late 1970s. The
employer of choice in the slums, where there were few other jobs,
became the legendary drug lord Pablo Escobar.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs led to another sort of breakdown, the absence of a working
government. Crime swamped Colombia's courts, which were never
functional, and now the slums feature a form of privatized justice.
People settle scores not with trials, but by hiring sicarios. Drug
addiction is terminated not in treatment clinics, but by death
squads with names such as ``Death to Addicts,'' which enjoy wide
popular support.
</P>
<P>
   The character of Rodrigo D., a sullen boy of 17 who wants to
start a punk band, was played by Ramiro Meneses. Meneses, now in
his early 30s, has become a successful actor in Bogota. But nine
other actors were murdered, some in acts of revenge for their
crimes. One actor, who habitually robbed bus drivers, was murdered
by sicarios hired by a group of drivers, Gaviria said. Another, who
helped write the film script, was killed by sicarios hired by the
family of a man he had attacked.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Rose Seller,'' an adaptation of Hans Christian
Andersen's ``Little Match Girl,'' Gaviria spent two months looking
for actors among the neighborhood's street children. He then rented
a house for his actors, and put them through nine months of
improvisational exercises and training in such basics as not
looking at the camera. He asked them about their lives _ ``What
would you do if someone stole your boyfriend?'' _ and fed the
answers back into the developing script. It centers on the day
before Christmas in the life of 13-year-old Monica, a runaway from
a sexually abusive home who lives by selling roses to diners in
posh restaurants and the occasional purse-snatching. Filming took
five more months.
</P>
<P>
   The actors were a challenge. ``These are very disorganized kids
who live completely in the present,'' says Gaviria. ``You couldn't
call a meeting for tomorrow because they'd forget.'' But he found a
wealth of talent. ``Street children are already actors,'' he says.
``They spend all day putting on masks, fooling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaviria feels that the filming affected them. ``With all their
hyperactivity, their focus on the present, they don't reflect much
on what happens to them,'' he says. ``They told me that
participating made them examine where they are.'' Some went back to
school. A rose seller named Lady Tabares, who played Monica, now
lives in a house paid for with money collected by local
journalists. She still sells flowers, although she and her
colleagues are now celebrities to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gaviria's films have had a wider impact as well. ``There was an
imaginary Berlin wall we had built between the rich city and these
northeastern neighborhoods,'' says Maria Emma Mejia, a co-producer
of ``Rodrigo D.'' who became the nation's commissioner for the
security of Medellin just after the film's release, and later
foreign minister. The strategy for Medellin was originally based
purely on increasing the security force presence in those
neighborhoods, she says. `` `Rodrigo D.' shocked us into realizing
that this would have been a terrible mistake.'' She created drop-in
centers, better schools, classes in auto mechanics and sewing,
micro-enterprise projects, discussion groups and a television show
with neighborhood youths talking about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she says, some of the schools and other projects are
still there, but the budget is gone for most. The slums are no less
violent. The right-wing paramilitary leader Carlos Castano has
replaced Pablo Escobar, now dead, as the local patron. Slum youth
not only kill each other, but are also hired to kill union
activists and other leftists. There is also, Gaviria says, a small
left-wing guerrilla presence. ``I would say I got to know 100 kids
as friends during my time as commissioner,'' says Ms. Mejia. ``Four
or five of them are still alive today.''

DIVORCE-COURT SCANDAL SPURS FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metin Erkin responded to the news with a single,
panicked question: ``What are you telling me, that my divorce is no
good?''
</P>
<P>
   And Svim Erkin, who thought she became the former Mrs. Erkin
months ago, responded with equal fright. ``I don't want to go
through it again,'' she pleaded. ``I don't want to be married in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Erkins, a Staten Island couple who thought they divorced
last year, are among hundreds of New York ex-couples ensnared in a
bribery scandal in the Manhattan divorce court. Their lawyer,
Joseph Canepa of Queens, is accused of paying Steven Singer, the
chief divorce court clerk in Manhattan, $100 to $150 to expedite
and not closely review their uncontested divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Singer, who pleaded guilty to three counts of
bribery on Sept. 17 in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, is at the
center of a bribery network under investigation that may involve as
many as 20 other lawyers and court officials. They said the bribes
_ which were largely paid by low-cost, high-volume law offices and
businesses known as ``divorce mills'' _ totaled tens of thousands
of dollars and involved hundreds of cases dating from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said that the divorces like the Erkins' that are
now being reviewed by prosecutors and court auditors will remain
valid unless problems are uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said they fear that some spouses, particularly
poor and immigrant women, may have been victimized by spouses who
forged their signatures on divorce settlements that involved scant
child support or alimony. Another unintended consequence of the
scandal could be that in a handful of cases, people who thought
they were divorced and have remarried may now be unwitting
bigamists.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the bribes spread last week, several anxious people
called the court system to see if they were, in fact, divorced,
court officials said. ``We are reassuring them, to the extent we
can, and indicating to them that these matters were also
individually reviewed by judges,'' said John Werner, chief clerk of
the Manhattan state Supreme Court's civil branch.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell R. Wilson, 42, a Bronx woman who said she never received
any divorce papers from her estranged husband, was one of those who
called. She wants court officials to investigate her case. ``I have
absolutely no idea if I'm divorced,'' she said Friday. ``The only
reason I think I'm divorced is that my daughter was at his
wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know if Wilson used one of the lawyers or
law offices accused of making bribes. She said she received
court-ordered child support. Divorce records are sealed, so it was
not possible to confirm any link to the investigation. Efforts to
reach her former husband, Benjamin Wilson, 45, by telephone were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about this, it just sounded so much like the man I
used to be married to,'' Ms. Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Yi Chen of Commack and his presumed ex-wife, Yan Yu Chen,
are another couple ensnared in the scandal. Canepa, the Queens
lawyer, is accused of bribing Singer in June 1998 to expedite the
Chens' uncontested divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Yi Chen's daughter said in a telephone interview on Thursday
that her father was not home but that he had remarried after her
parents divorced. Ben Yi Chen did not return repeated calls to his
home or office requesting comment. Efforts to reach Yan Yu Chen
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach other couples listed in the indictment filed
against Singer were also unsuccessful. But the Erkins, the Staten
Island couple, probably summed up the group's feelings. The
ex-husband and ex-wife agreed that they did not want to relive
their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Erkin, 31, a payroll manager for a Manhattan company, said he
had no knowledge of the reputed bribes and said his wife fully
agreed with the terms of their divorce. The couple had no children
and little property to divide, he said. (She got the apartment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted it more than I did,'' he said, referring to the
divorce. ``I brought her the papers. She went to the notary and did
everything. Let the district attorney call my ex-wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Erkin, 28, an administrative assistant, also said she had no
knowledge of any bribes and signed the divorce papers herself. ``I
actually had it notarized,'' she said, her voice tinged with dread.
``I hope everything is all right. I hope this doesn't affect me in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But court officials said that in cases in which the couples
agreed to the terms, the divorces should remain legal and valid.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news to Ms. Erkin. She and her ex-husband live
near each other and occasionally bump into each other on the bus.
The two get along fairly well, she said, but revisiting such a
tender subject is something that she, like so many divorcees, would
definitely prefer to avoid. ``We're still friends _ we talk,'' she
said. ``We don't hate each other, not that much anyway.''

MUSLIM CADETS WHO COMPLAINED OF BIAS DECIDE TO LEAVE  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-one Muslim cadets from the Middle East, who
said they were harassed and even beaten by their classmates at the
State University of New York Maritime College, left the college and
moved to a hotel on Friday night. The students had refused to
attend class since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the Muslim freshmen, and the dispiriting
circumstances surrounding it, sent ripples of introspection through
the barracks under the Throgs Neck Bridge in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Cadets at Maritime train for careers in the shipping industry in
a four-year program that resembles that of the U.S. Naval Academy.
Set against a tidal passage and within a pre-Civil War shore
battery, the college is rooted in nautical tradition, with cadets
sporting crew cuts and khaki uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But the structured routine was disrupted on Tuesday when the
Muslim freshmen announced that they were quitting the college,
saying they had been abused and even beaten by classmates after
being repeatedly subjected to insulting remarks about their
religion and limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   One cadet, Abdullah al-Shammari, 24, of Saudi Arabia, said he
was attacked the day before the announcement by a classmate who
wore a ski mask. The attack was the second reported in two weeks.
In the first report, on Sept. 13, two Muslim cadets said five
assailants beat them in their darkened bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   None of the cadets were injured seriously, and the college has
vowed to expel any cadets involved. A campus police investigation
is continuing, and the office of the chancellor of the State
University, John W. Ryan, is reviewing the case. Adm. David C.
Brown, the college president, said the reviews to date had found no
indication the incidents were intended as hazing, which the college
prohibits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Middle Eastern students said they believed that their
ethnicity made them targets. Many of the Americans were baffled,
and wondered aloud if the Arab students had been adequately
prepared for the school. Others said they were sad to see their
foreign peers quit. Midshipman Ryan Kenna, 18, a freshman, said he
had befriended some of the Middle Eastern cadets and would miss
them for reasons both personal and professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Middle East is such a big shipping point, it would only
benefit us to learn from them now, instead of us going out into the
industry and having such a big culture shock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Middle Eastern cadets arrived in the Bronx last winter,
they were enthusiastic. They hailed from four Arab nations, and all
their expenses were underwritten by United Arab Shipping Co., a
Kuwait-based concern that was grooming them for management
positions in the national shipping line of the Arabian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since 1995 the college had trained two dozen Saudi
naval cadets. The Saudis had familiarized the college with Muslim
holidays and daily cycles of prayer, and maintained a mosque in the
barracks. Watching the Saudis graduate, the new cadets anticipated
a smooth stay in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first arrived, we loved it so much,'' said Homood
al-Tawari, 23, of Kuwait. ``Everybody was friendly. Everybody was
so polite.''
</P>
<P>
   But after spending seven months polishing their English, the
Muslims soured to their college in August when they began
indoctrination in the regiment of 680 cadets.
</P>
<P>
   First they struggled as lowly ``midshipmen under guidance,'' or
``mugs.'' Many lagged in their studies, having trouble mastering
mathematics and engineering in a second language while meeting
cadet duties. They said their frustrations mushroomed after the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Midshipman David Giancarli, 24, a senior, said he was disturbed
by the allegations of violence. But he said he had seen no
instances of unfair treatment based on ethnicity or religion.
``When you are an underclassman, you get picked on,'' he said. ``I
was picked on because I was fat, and I took it for a whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Freshman year at Maritime College is certainly not for everyone.
Mugs live in dormitory-style barracks that are a study in Spartan
simplicity. They must jog to and from class and have few
privileges. They are not allowed to outfit their rooms with
posters, radios, televisions or fans. Visitors leave, and lights go
out, at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the quadrangles bustle with upperclassmen who enforce
myriad rules. Older cadets can require mugs to light their
cigarettes on demand. To be ready, mugs carry books of matches in
plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim cadets acknowledge that the mug regimen influenced
their decision to resign. ``We are not like students here,'' said
one of the cadets who said he was assaulted, Faisal Ahmad, 24, of
Kuwait. ``We are like hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Robert J. Weaver, commandant of cadets, said he had
received no official reports of discrimination. But he did not
directly dispute the cadets' accounts. ``I could never say that
didn't happen, because with more than 600 people, you could have
one person do something stupid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   American cadets said some of the complaints were a
misunderstanding. ``If you mispronounce their names, to them it is
a big insult,'' said Midshipman Edward Leight, 20. ``But sometimes
it's a hard name to pronounce, and you just get it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After the resignations, the college allowed the Muslim students
to remain in the barracks and to confer among themselves and their
shipping company managers in Kuwait before their decision to move
out.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, representatives from the State University
chancellor's office last week reviewed records and conducted
interviews related to the complaints. Jon Sorensen, the
chancellor's spokesman, said the preliminary review found the
college ``had not been lording over these kids in any inappropriate
way'' and that campus safeguards were adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Other than moving the cadets off site, the United Arab Shipping
Co. had not decided how to handle the complaints. Two company
agents who visited the college on Thursday declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The college said the majority of Muslim students appeared to be
following a few of their most dissatisfied peers, and the cadets
maintained a united stance. Prior to their departure they made
their sentiments clear: ``We are like one hand, we are like
brothers,'' said Wajdi al-Hawar, 20, of Saudi Arabia. ``If we are
going to leave, we will leave together.''

NORTH KOREAN MINISTER URGES U.S. TO LIFT ECONOMIC EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Following its decision to suspend missile
testing, North Korea demanded Saturday that the United States
respond with its own ``good deeds,'' including an end to
Washington's longstanding economic embargo against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fortunate that the United States has recently decided to
partially lift economic sanctions,'' North Korean Foreign Minister
Paek Nam Sun said in a speech during the annual debate at the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Paek continued, ``we look forward to the
comprehensive and actual lifting of all economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Once the United States stops treating North Korea like an enemy,
Paek said, ``and moves toward improved relations, we will also
respond with good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has promised not to test any long-range ballistic
missiles during its current talks with the United States. The
official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday that the tests
would be suspended ``in order to create a more favorable
atmosphere'' for the talks, which are scheduled to resume next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans tested its last long-range missile by firing
it over Japan, frightening the Japanese. There have been fears that
North Korea might mark its 50th anniversary as a Communist state by
firing a newer missile that is believed to have a longer range and
to be able to reach Hawaii and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Paek reiterated Pyongyang's contention that it
intended only to launch a peaceful satellite in order to catch up
with its neighbors in the field of peaceful space activity. ``We
would be ready for discussions on the missile issue at any time if
hostile nations are sincere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding cautiously to questions at a news conference later,
the foreign minister insisted that Pyongyang has ``thoroughly
frozen'' its nuclear activities. But he left little doubt that the
moratorium on testing missiles was temporary. If North Korea
decided that it needed to launch a missile, he told reporters, ``we
will launch.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Paek described Japan's reactions to North Korea's
last missile test as ``hysterical''. He called the protests a ruse
to cover up Japan's failure to make moral and financial amends for
``crimes'' against Koreans who lived under Japanese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a tougher line against Japan than against the United
States, Paek accused Tokyo of ``fabricating threats'' in order to
re-arm itself and re-emerge as a military power.
</P>
<P>
   But Paek emphasized that his country did not consider the United
States a permanent enemy, and said that Pyongyang had shown good
faith in five years of bilateral talks with the Americans. In
addition to lifting the trade embargo, Paek said that the United
States should sign a peace treaty with North Korea, ending their 50
years of belligerency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later what Pyongyang specifically expected of Washington,
the North Korean foreign minister said that the lifting of
sanctions should be ``comprehensive,'' and ``should be translated
into action.'' This seemed to imply that in addition to food and
economic aid, Washington should promote trade with Pyongyang, which
was brought to the brink of collapse by famine and ideological
mismanagement of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extended olive branch, Paek returned several times
to the saber-rattling that characterized North Korea's posture for
so many years. If the United States tried to test his country's
military power or subjugate its people, he said, ``Such reckless
acts will surely be inviting our strong self-defense measures,
eventually causing catastrophic consequences.''

REAL ESTATE: STORING ALL THAT EXTRA STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., N.J., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is your stuff getting to be too much for your
apartment? Maybe it's time to rent an apartment for your stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all seem to have so much extra stuff,'' said Chris McGrath,
president of the New York Self Storage Association, a trade
organization based in Albany. ``And after a while most folks,
especially folks in the city, find they need just a little more
space for their things.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, who owns self-storage businesses in upstate New York
and Vermont, said that storage facilities can range from
bare-bones, no-frills affairs at bargain-basement rents to
structures with electrical service, 24-hour availability and
security systems using motion detectors, closed-circuit television
and pass-key-activated entry gates and doors. Some high-rent units
are even climate-controlled to protect valuable furniture and
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need will often depend on who you are and where you
are,'' McGrath said, explaining that those who vacation in the same
area every year but do not own a vacation home might want to rent a
small no-frills storage locker nearby to avoid having to transport
clothes, beach chairs, skis, fishing gear, bicycles, rubber rafts
and even rowboats.
</P>
<P>
   Those who may need to store fine furniture, artwork or antiques,
he said, might want to spend the extra money for a
climate-controlled storage locker _ one designed to eliminate
excess humidity _ to insure that their valuables are not damaged by
mold or mildew.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said that someone who has to store lots of furniture for
a short period probably should rent the smallest locker necessary
and pack it as efficiently as possible. But, he said, those who
need long-term storage and access on a fairly regular basis might
want to rent a slightly larger locker and pack it for ease of
access. ``You might want to leave an aisle open down the center and
not pile things up too high,'' he said, adding that it is also wise
to try to anticipate what will be needed most often and load those
things closest to the door.
</P>
<P>
   But how does one estimate how much storage space is enough?
``That's what we're here for,'' said Tom Tresnan, general manager
of Lackland Associates, a self-storage facility in Middlesex, N.J.
``Our managers are trained to consult with people when they come in
and give them a good idea of how much space they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Tresnan, who is also president of the New Jersey Self Storage
Association, said that there are some basic guidelines for
estimating space. For example, he said, a person with three or four
rooms of furniture could probably get by with a storage unit as
small as 10 by 10 feet, if the items are packed efficiently. ``But
different units have different ceiling heights,'' he said, and
renters should try to find lockers with the highest ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Other things to look for, he said, are hours of operation,
security measures and cleanliness. ``Is the place well-lit and
well-fenced?'' he said. ``Do they have a computerized gate access
system and surveillance cameras? And will you be able to get access
to your goods when you want to?''
</P>
<P>
   Most storage facilities in urban and suburban areas, Tresnan
said, do not provide 24-hour access. Many have extended hours, he
said _ generally from 6 a.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. _ and some will allow
off-hours access if arrangements are made in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Customers should also find out if extermination services are
provided on a regular basis. ``We tell all our tenants that they
cannot store any foodstuffs or perishables in their lockers,''
Tresnan said. ``But once somebody puts their lock on the door, we
have no way of knowing what's inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Tresnan said, rents for storage lockers are paid
monthly, in advance. Generally speaking, he said, rents in suburban
areas can run from $40 a month for a five-by-five-foot locker with
a seven-foot ceiling to about $130 a month for a 10- by 10- by
10-foot unit.
</P>
<P>
   In urban areas, of course, the rents are typically higher. Neal
Eisenstein, vice president of sales and marketing for Manhattan
Mini Storage, a storage company with 13 locations in Manhattan,
some of which are open 24 hours a day, said that his prices can
range from $48 a month for a four-by-four-foot locker five feet
high to $700 a month for a 9-by-18-foot unit with a 10-foot
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstein said that since homeowners' insurance policies in New
York generally do not cover personal possessions not on the insured
premises, his company encourages customers to make sure they get
additional insurance for items in storage. If customers do not have
homeowners' or renters' policies, he said, they can purchase a
Keepsake Protection Plan from Manhattan Mini Storage for as little
as $6 a month per $1,000 of stored goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people think about most when putting their things in
storage is peace of mind,'' he said. ``Sometimes people find that
when they put stuff into storage it gives them a new feeling of
freedom from clutter. Some people even think of their storage
locker as an extra closet down the street. And then there are
others who put the lock on the door and don't come back for
years.''

METEOROLOGY LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The rains started Saturday as an annoying
drizzle, and then turned into a dangerous downpour. Fans headed for
the nearest overhand, pulled out their ponchos and put up their
umbrellas. Due to the weather and threat of lightening, PGA
tournament officials suspended play at 9:45 a.m. for 20 minutes.
The rain caught many spectators unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the Weather Channel (Friday night) and was here
(Friday),'' said Brian Manton of Lisle, Ill. ``The Weather Channel
said today would be even better than (Friday) with a passing shower
in the morning. I thought it would rain for 10 or 15 minutes. I
left my one waterproof jacket back at the hotel. The Boston
meterologists leave a lot to be desired.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   He is a professional golf instructor, but there are days when
Shawn Callahan goes to work and stops what he's doing to watch the
student. That's because the student is Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, 37, whose father Don is the longtime head pro (now
director of golf) at The Country Club, is on the staff at the Butch
Harmon School of Golf in Las Vegas. In that capacity, Callahan has
had many opportunities to watch Woods, whose incredible talents are
even more impressive when viewed close up, said the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes out 8 to 10 times a year. He likes to relax, fool
around, then work out. People don't know how hard he works.
Amazing, but every time I see him he strikes it better. I don't
know how he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the round of golf they played recently when Callahan,
a solid 3-handicap who can move it pretty good off the tee, slammed
one about 310 yards on a par 5 that measured 630 yards. ``We were
trash-talking all around,'' said Callahan, ``and I said, `Don't
even try to catch that one. You'll hurt yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Woods answered with a ferocious swing. ``He nailed one
and we stepped it off at 396 yards.'' Callahan was laughing.
``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Don Callahan served as the assistant under the
legendary Claude Harmon, Butch's father.
</P>
<P>
   Claude, the former Masters champ, was beloved in the industry
and Don Callahan found his way in this business thanks to his
guidance. From Winged Foot in the summer, Harmon and Callahan would
work winters at Thunderbird in Palm Springs, Calif. Callahan took
the job at The Country Club and eventually replaced Harmon as head
pro at Thunderbird, too.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Don Callahan has been friendly with Butch Harmon for
years. ``When I had the offer to work for (Butch), I went to see
him to make sure the job was for me and not because I was Don's
son,'' said Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously he heard something he liked because he joined Harmon's
staff nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job in Houston, Butch said, `Don't buy
furniture because I'm going to set up a golf school in Vegas.' I've
been there since Christmas of '97 and everything is going well.''

   Painful memories
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He will be watching the Ryder Cup Matches from his home in
Texas, and Jacky Cupit will be thrilled if the US wins. But pardon
him if he watches with bittersweet thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest memory I have (of The Country Club) is a bad
memory,'' said Cupit, whose double-bogey on the 71st hole cost him
a chance to win the 1963 US Open. He parred 18 to get into a
playoff, which he lost to Julius Boros.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is a bad memory, it is very clear one.
``Communications were not as good as they are today. I had a
one-shot lead, but didn't know it, so I hit a 3-wood off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cupit, who was 25 at the time and an unheralded player, drove it
directly at the infamous Vardon Bunker at the corner of the dogleg
left 17th. Just ahead of him, Arnold Palmer had three-putted, so
Cupit now had a two-shot lead. He didn't know that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had stayed in the sand I would have been OK, but it went
through and into rough on a very steep slope where the grass was
real tall. With the lie, my only shot was to get it back to the
fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Cupit did, but he got too cute with his third shot from 80
yards, and it ended up 30 feet from the pin. Three putts later, he
had made a double and dropped into a tie for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it cost me the tournament,'' said Cupit, 61, who
still plays a lot of golf after undergoing major heart surgery four
years ago, ``but who knows what would have happened on 18 had I
made par at 17? And at 18 I had a putt to win, from 15 feet, but it
just stayed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big disappointment. A huge disappointment. But I
really didn't get down on myself because I was young and thought I
would have a lot more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never did get that chance again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Campbell paved the way
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is one sure winner in these 33d Ryder Cup Matches, it
would have to be Willie Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Campbell?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Willie Campbell, the first golf professional at The Country
Club, who credited for the original design of this classic layout
in 1894. That should be memorable enough, but he also moved down
the street and convinced Boston officials that the city needed to
encourage the game. Thus, the city's Franklin Park golf course was
born.
</P>
<P>
   History, all of it, has become the passion of Brian DeLacey of
Jamaica Plain. He became intrigued about the course at Franklin
Park and started looking into its history, which led him to
Campbell and The Country Club, and to Musselburgh, Scotland.
Musselburgh, along with Prestwick and St. Andrews, is important to
the history of golf, and DeLacey has been there several times to
research a book on Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   To pay tribute to Campbell, who died at age 38, DeLacey put
together a small ceremony Friday night. It began at the gates of
The Country Club, with a procession to the golf course at Franklin
Park, then to Forest Hills Cemetery, where Campbell is buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Police Gaelic Column of Pipes &AMP; Drums took part in
the ceremonies.

   NORTH CAROLINA FLOODING

   FLOODWOES _ North Carolina is the nation's largest producer of
turkeys, second-largest producer of hogs and third-largest producer
of chickens in the United States. That adds up to a recipe for
disaster with Hurricane Floyd's flooding overflowing animal waste
holding tanks throughout the eastern third of the state.
Environmentalists, of course, are saying ``I told you so,'' as
farmers and agribusiness officials try to contain the problem. And
state and federal health officials are monitoring the situation,
advising most people in that area of the state to boil their water
before using. Will this lead to any change in regulation of

become a truly self-supporting industry of frugality, or are they
merely going through a useless mandated exercise that costs

pricey new sets needed to enjoy a digital picture. To surmount the

of their own neighbors and fearful that their apartment building

Soviet Union in 1991 have Russians felt so strongly, and vocally,
about anything. Reports of rampant corruption bring a shrug and a
yawn. Russians have become all too accustomed to expect the worst

demands bribes from passing motorists to the bandit capitalists who
have pumped billions of dollars out of Russia and into Western
banks. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 30

   VENEZUELA-ECONOMY _ CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment,
political unrest, restive labor unions, a declining middle class,
stifled consumer spending: the portrait of Venezuela's economy
isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign investment. Yet American
companies are already here in a big way, their names gracing
Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over billboards lining
the country's modern interstate-like highway system: Ford, IBM,
Coca-Cola and dozens of others. (Williams, Cox News Service). 30.

   BRITAIN-GMFOODS _ LONDON _ The panic over genetically-modified
food is reaching deep into everyday life in Britain. Seizing on the
public's suspicions about these scientifically manipulated
products, supermarkets are jumping all over themselves to be the
first to offer the most pure products _ those with ``absolutely
no'' GM ingredients. Now pubs and other restaurants must disclose
whether their fare contains ``Frankenstein'' food. All this even
though there is no genetically modified food grown in Britain, and
the only exposure Britons have is when they consume a few products
from the United States, where people have long been accustomed to
the presence of GM food. What gives here, and what are the
implications for the U.S.? (Roughton, Cox News Service).

OUTDOORS: OPEN SEASON FOR HUNTERS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late summer's searing persistence made it difficult for hunters
to think of tramping the woods in quest of deer or upland birds, or
huddling in a duck blind on a cold, gray dawn. But Canada goose and
ruffed grouse hunting is under way and the seasons for other
species are about to begin in some areas of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The state's huge area and varied topography and wildlife habitat
call for a complicated set of hunting regulations, and all nimrods
are urged to peruse those regulations with care. One cannot sally
merrily forth to hunt without knowing the boundaries of the zone
one is in and the seasons for that zone. As an example, the state
has five waterfowling zones _ Northeastern; Lake Champlain;
Western; Southeastern, and Long Island _ each with its own seasons.
Things get even more complicated in the pursuit of deer, where
there are not only four zones with varying bag limits, but also
different seasons depending on whether the implement of choice is
bow and arrow, modern firearms or muzzleloading ones.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfowl hunting should be rewarding this year. The U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service's spring survey of breeding duck populations
in North America has indicated that a record number of birds will
be flying south this fall and winter. This season's basic daily bag
limit of six ducks reflects this optimistic assessment. There are
separate regulations for sea ducks and mergansers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, opening day for duck hunting ranges from Oct.
2 in the Northeastern Zone to Nov. 19 in Long Island. Hunters
should remember that the daily limit for the highly prized black
duck, which has been in trouble for years, is one, and that within
each zone's regular seasons for ducks there are periods when black
ducks cannot be shot.
</P>
<P>
   The regular Canada goose seasons, which are split, begin in
early November in the five zones, except on Long Island. The daily
bag limit in the Long Island regular season (Nov. 19-Nov. 28 and
Dec. 2-Dec. 31) is four. In addition, there will again be a late
Canada goose season _ Jan. 15-Feb. 15 _ five birds a day, in
portions of Chemung, Tioga, Broome, Delaware, Sullivan, Orange,
Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk
Counties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a state hunting license, those in quest of
waterfowl or any other migratory game bird, including woodcock,
must purchase a federal duck stamp (some states require a state
duck stamp also, New York does not) and must also register with the
state's Harvest Information Program (888) 427-5447. You will be
asked to answer a few questions and will then be assigned an HIP
number. The federal government requires states to implement this
system, and also requires hunters to register in each state in
which they plan to hunt migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, the basic season's limit for a deer hunter
using a modern firearm is one antlered animal, but it is
theoretically possible for a resident with special permits or a
nonresident with a combination license and special permits to take
a total of five animals. Archers may shoot a deer of either sex. In
many instances, primitive weapon (muzzleloading) buffs may take a
deer of either sex. New York also allows muzzleloaders to hunt deer
with a smoothbore weapon; rifling is no longer required.
</P>
<P>
   All of New York state's hunting regulations, except for those
applying to waterfowl, are contained, including maps, in the
state's current Hunting and Trapping Regulations Guide, which is
available at license-issuing agencies and regional offices of the
state's Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   For deer hunters, New York's Northern Zone _ which comprises the
state's northeast quadrant _ is divided into three portions for
muzzleloading hunters. The northwestern strip has two seasons, Oct.
16-Oct. 22 and Dec. 6-Dec. 12, and one deer of either sex may be
taken in the later season; the same is true in the southeastern
strip. The zone's central area, which permits taking a deer of
either sex, has a single muzzleloading season, Oct. 16-Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Muzzleloading hunters are permitted to shoot a deer of either
sex during the single Dec. 15-Dec. 21 season in the state's west
and southeast zones. There are five relatively small areas in the
southern zone _ among them Suffolk and Westchester Counties _ where
this muzzleloading season is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Even as waterfowl and big-game hunting gets under way,
small-game and upland bird hunting is also starting up. The fall
turkey season opens Oct. 1 in some areas and Oct. 25 in others.
Unlike the spring season, which is for gobblers only, a turkey of
either sex may be taken and hunting is from sunrise to sunset.
Three of the four regions in the state in which turkey hunting is
allowed, limit a hunter to one bird for the season. In what could
be roughly described as the southeastern portion of the state, the
season has its longest run, Oct. 1-Nov. 21, and one may take two
birds, both in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The ruffed grouse season started Sept. 20 in the northern half
of the state and opens Oct. 1 in the lower half. It closes Feb. 29
in both areas. The daily bag limit is four birds. Grouse hunters _
particularly if they use a dog _ often have opportunities to shoot
woodcock, and if they wish to do this they should remember that
they will need an HIP number. The statewide woodcock season is Oct.
6-Nov. 4 and the limit is three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters of varying hares (snowshoe rabbits) will have their
first opportunity to hunt these winter woodland ghosts Oct. 1 in
the northern portions of the state, where the season ends March 19.
For some, a late winter quest, which requires snowshoes or skis,
for varying hare in the foothills of the Adirondacks, is the proper
way to bring the year's hunting season to a close.

DETECTIVES STILL SEEKING STUDENT'S KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Kansas)  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been more than six months since Amy Watkins, a
26-year-old graduate student from Kansas, was stabbed in the back
as she trudged with groceries toward her apartment in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the New York City Police Department has spent
thousands of hours searching for her killer. By this week, they
said, their leads had dwindled to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at day one,'' said Lt. John Cornicello, commander of
the 77th Precinct's detective squad. ``We haven't lost hope. We are
trying to make our own breaks instead of waiting for them to come
to us. But the case has turned into a brick wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of Ms. Watkins, who friends say had planned to
devote her life to social work, represents one of the department's
most difficult and frustrating types of cases: a murder committed
by a stranger who leaves little physical evidence and is seen by
virtually no one.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like Ms. Watkins', the police basically have three
hopes for capturing the killer: He turns himself in; he talks about
the crime to someone else, who turns him in; or he attacks someone
else in the presence of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins was murdered at 9:45 p.m. on March 8, shortly after
taking the subway home from a Bronx community center where she
worked with battered women, the police said. They said she got off
at the Seventh Avenue stop in Brooklyn, got cash from an automated
teller machine on Flatbush Avenue and then bought groceries at a
nearby store before starting down Prospect Place toward her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   When she was between Vanderbilt and Underhill avenues, the
police believe, Ms. Watkins was attacked from behind.
</P>
<P>
   The police say Ms. Watkins' attacker left his weapon _ a large
carving knife _ in her back but took the time to grab her tote bag
and pull it from under her body. They believe he then ran toward
Washington Avenue, where he sifted through it and stole her money,
although it is possible that someone else moved the bag after he
dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down with a profiler from the violent crimes program at
the FBI,'' Cornicello said. ``It appears we have a random
encounter, motivated by robbery and probably some sort of drug
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins' father, Lawrence Watkins, a teacher at the
Dominican Academy in Manhattan, said that he was not looking for
retribution, but that he hoped his daughter's killer would be
caught to spare another family his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Since his daughter's murder, he has been attending monthly
meetings of New York Parents of Murdered Children, a support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose a child by violent means, you begin to feel a
vague anxiety and fear, a feeling that life is not safe,'' he said.
``There is a tremendous feeling of guilt _ why we were not there? _
things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The detectives on the case have ruled out theories that Ms.
Watkins was killed by someone she knew or by someone who might have
been stalking her from the shelter where she counseled battered
women. It does not appear that her work ever brought her into
contact with an irate husband or boyfriend of any of the women
there.
</P>
<P>
   Cornicello said it was unclear whether the man who killed her
followed her from the automated teller machine, noticed her at the
grocery store or simply waited in a dark corner on Prospect Place
for a likely victim to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said that his daughter had been outgoing, but not naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cold, and her head was probably down as she walked,
with the cold and the wind,'' he said. ``I suspect she was not in a
position to react quickly to someone who would have been waiting.
She would have been easy prey.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many people got in touch the police early in the case,
with some claiming to have seen a distant figure running away,
Cornicello said his detectives had received little information in
recent months. They have reinterviewed witnesses, he said, and were
looking for the woman who found Ms. Watkins' tote bag. The hope is
that she might now recall a detail originally overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the detectives have spent most of their time
interviewing suspects picked up in other cases, particularly those
involving knife attacks. The police believe that Ms. Watkins'
killer was proficient with the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Cornicello said he hoped that the killer would tell someone
about the crime, and that the killer's confidant would tell the
police. A reward of more than $10,000 has been offered by the city
and private institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Watkins said small things reminded him of his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The murdered leave behind unpaid bills, loose ends that are
difficult to pick up,'' he explained. ``She recently got a letter
from a friend who did not know she had died, and her bed was not
made when we went to her apartment. These are little things, but
you have to walk in and deal with that, and it is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins was attending the Hunter College School of Social
Work, which has commissioned a mural in her memory and is trying to
put together a scholarship fund in her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``These terrible events can certainly bring out good things,''
Watkins said, ``and I think Amy's life has made an impression on
many people. It has brought home to them the reality of death and
that young people must do with their lives before they end.''

RUTGERS, 0-3, LOSES TO BOSTON COLLEGE, 27-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Boston College had the best runner on the
field in Cedric Washington. It had the more efficient quarterback
in Tim Hasselbeck. And it did not drop passes or throw
interceptions the way Rutgers did.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a comfortable 27-7 victory for Boston College
Saturday in the opening game of the Big East football season. A
crowd of 27,330 at Rutgers Stadium watched the Eagles improve to
3-0 and Rutgers fall to 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had 147 yards rushing on 21 carries and scored two
touchdowns. Hasselbeck finished 17 of 22 for 168 yards passing,
including a touchdown. Rutgers receivers dropped six passes, and
the Scarlet Knights were hurt further by three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers made only two scoring threats. In the third quarter,
trailing by 13-0, the Scarlet Knights struck on Mike McMahon's
56-yard touchdown pass to Errol Johnson. Boston College followed
that with a quick three-pass drive, with Hasselbeck's 21-yard pass
to DuJuan Daniels raising the Eagles' lead to 20-7. Late in the
third quarter, on a 37-yard field-goal attempt, Steve Barone of
Rutgers kicked a line drive wide left.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon completed 16 of 32 passes for 228 yards. After 11 sacks
in the first two games, the junior quarterback was sacked only once
Saturday, but he still took a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College dominated the first half more than its 10-0 lead
showed. Hasselbeck passed efficiently and Washington and Carlton
Rowe ran well, but Rutgers proved its own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's first interception, on the fifth play of the game, was
made by Eagles linebacker Scott Bradley on a ball that bounced off
the hands of Rutgers fullback Dennis Thomas. Nine plays later, John
Matich kicked a 31-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Boston College drove 87 yards
in 11 plays. Washington carried on the last three plays _ 11 yards,
17 more and then 8 _ for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seemed too early in the season for a must-win game,
this was close to one for Rutgers. In Terry Shea's fourth year as
head coach, the Knights have been desperately trying to shed their
reputation as Big East doormats.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, they did not win a game and lost by such scores
as 59-19, 48-14, 48-0, 50-3 and 49-7. Last year, they improved
dramatically, to 5-6, and Shea's colleagues voted him the
conference's coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   This season has not started well for Rutgers. In the opener, it
gave up seven sacks and lost, 21-7, to California. Next, Rutgers
let a good Texas team get off to a 24-3 lead, and the Longhorns
went on to a 38-21 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College's opening two victories did not come easily. The
Eagles beat Baylor by 30-29 in overtime and Navy by 14-10. The
Boston College offense had been good, averaging 427 yards a game
overall, 224 yards a game rushing, but the defense had been porous.
</P>
<P>
   That defense had been expected to be tested here by Jacki Crooks
of Rutgers, who rushed for 108 yards against Cal and 84 against
Texas. But there was no Crooks Saturday because of a disciplinary
measure by Shea. The coach suspended Crooks and four other players
(none of the four had played this season) for an unspecified
violation of team rules. Shea would not be specific, though it was
common knowledge that the players had missed practice last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Saturday is game day, but Rutgers had no game listed
on its schedule for Sept. 18. It had practices planned for Thursday
and Friday, with the players off on Saturday. But when Hurricane
Floyd washed out practices on Sept. 16 and 17, Shea scheduled a
workout for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No one connected with the team would say why the players were
absent. But one person did point out that flood waters prevented
people from getting from one end of campus to the other, and that
telephone service was affected.

EXPANSION OF RAIL TRANSIT PLANNED FOR NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an anxiously awaited financial blueprint, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Wednesday will propose
spending $17 billion in a five-year capital plan, with provisions
for work on a new Second Avenue subway and other expansion
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with the tax revenue that pays for most of its operations
and encouraged by sharp increases in ridership on its buses and
subways, the MTA will propose spending $5 billion more than its
current spending plan, which expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed plan leaves unanswered how the MTA will pay for
all the projects it proposes. The plan, according to several people
familiar with it, relies on more than $2 billion that must be
raised in ``new government assistance or other MTA resources,'' a
provision that transit advocates say could result in a fare
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the five-year plan have not been disclosed,
a senior MTA official, who spoke on the condition that his name not
be used, said Saturday that the spending plan would allocate $14
billion for maintenance work on buses and subways and the
completion of projects that are already under way, including the
renovation of several subway stations in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   He said the remaining $3 billion is designated in the plan for
``moving the system forward,'' mainly through the acquisition of
new subway cars, commuter rail cars and buses, and several subway
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would provide $700 million for a Second Avenue subway,
a proposed expansion that has the support of many Manhattan
residents and elected officials. The MTA official said the proposed
amount would cover environmental studies and engineering work, with
some money left for initial construction.
</P>
<P>
   Although several versions of the Second Avenue subway have been
proposed, with some advocates insisting that it be built from the
Bronx to lower Manhattan, the capital plan is more modest,
proposing a new subway tunnel from 125th Street to 63rd Street. A
new underground walkway at 63rd Street would connect to the N and R
lines to enable passengers to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the groundswell of public support for a new Second
Avenue line, the version proposed in the five-year plan could be
its most politically divisive element. An unusually broad
coalition, the Empire State Transportation Alliance, which includes
labor unions, environmental groups, the New York City Partnership
and others, has been lobbying the MTA to make the Second Avenue
project a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York Assembly, who
represents the Upper East Side, has said in recent weeks he would
block approval of the five-year plan if it did not provide money
for a line running the full length of Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the MTA board, which is expected to vote on
Wednesday, the five-year plan would go to Gov. George Pataki, who
is expected to endorse it. The state Legislature would then
consider it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The largest project in the plan, budgeted at $1.6 billion, is a
new tunnel for the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal,
giving commuters direct access to the east side of midtown
Manhattan. The MTA official said Saturday that the amount provided
for that project, which has long been advocated by Pataki, would be
enough to complete it by the end of the five-year spending period.
</P>
<P>
   Other large projects envisioned in the plan, both advocated by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, would extend the N line in Queens to La
Guardia Airport, and extend the No. 7 line from Times Square west
to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and other developments on
the west side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA official declined to say how much would be allocated for
those projects. He said another major expense covered in the plan
is a $1 billion allocation for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel
Authority, which would include the $300 million replacement of the
deck on the Triborough Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the MTA to buy 1,000 new subway cars and
1,050 new buses, of which 300 would be powered by natural gas or
other fuels that emit fewer pollutants than diesel, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan is being proposed during what is widely
regarded as a period of renaissance for New York City public
transportation, it seemed certain Saturday to provoke questions
over whether the sharp increase in spending can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the uncertainty is that the increased popularity
of the MTA's buses and subways has not resulted in an increase in
fare revenues, because the recent introduction of fare discounts
and unlimited ride Metrocards has enabled frequent users of the
system to ride for less.
</P>
<P>
   In August, anticipating an MTA plan for new subway construction
and sharp increases in spending, New York City's Independent Budget
Office, a nonpartisan research group that advises the City Council,
warned that the MTA could face looming budget deficits if the
economy sours.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a
riders advocacy group, noted that the MTA had not ruled out fare
hikes to pay for the increased spending. ``They have laid out their
choices, and they are not easy ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the plan that seemed certain to draw opposition
from environmental groups was the MTA's proposal to buy far more
diesel-powered buses than those powered with alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesel pollution is the No. 1 environmental issue in New York
City,'' said Richard Kassel, senior lawyer for the Natural
Resources Defense Council. ``By saying two out of three new buses
will be diesel, they are taking two steps in the wrong direction.''

REAL ESTATE: URBANITE REFUGE IN BACK-COUNTRY VIRGINIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: D.C., Md.)  (js) 
 By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Va. _ Because it is in the rugged Blue Ridge
Mountains and is not served by railroads or major highways,
Rappahannock County's residential and commercial growth has lagged
far behind the counties that abut it on three sides, which are
considered part of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   This suits most people here just fine because the county's
natural beauty and relaxed pace of life are what makes it such a
good place to live, says John McCarthy, the county administrator.
Between 1930 and 1970, the county's population declined from 7,717
to 5,199 as the move from farms to the cities continued.
</P>
<P>
   However, slow but steady construction of new homes since _
currently at a rate of about 50 a year, with some costing more than
$1 million _ has brought the population of the 267-square-mile
county to about 7,200 as it becomes an important getaway for
affluent city dwellers and a year-round home to urban refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Werner Krebser, the chairman of the County Planning
Commission, said there had been general agreement between old-time
landowners and newcomers on a slow-growth policy. Since 1966, the
county zoning ordinance has required a minimum residential lot size
of 25 acres on most of the land outside its four hamlets and the
town of Washington, the county seat.
</P>
<P>
   There are no supermarkets, convenience stores, fast food
restaurants or stoplights in the county. Day-to-day needs are met
by traditional general stores, which also serve as community
gathering places. (The county does, however, have a widely known
and luxurious restaurant and hotel, the Inn at Little Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   The absence of these amenities is one of the main reasons why
James Abdo, a Washington, D.C., real estate developer, said he
bought a 60-acre farm south of Sperryville from David Brinkley, the
retired news commentator. ``I hope I don't live to see them
there,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Abdo, who is 39 and single, says he drives the 80 miles from the
nation's capital to the 60-acre farm he bought seven-and-a-half
years ago for $335,000 nearly every weekend. He said he wanted to
expand the main house, but that he been holding off until he meets
``the woman of my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very special place to me,'' he said. ``It's part of
the fabric of my life. I want it to be a special place for that
person, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley, who owned the farm for more than 30 years, wasn't the
only notable to find the county a convenient place for a hideaway
or a year-round home.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor Lorin Maazel has built a house, guest cottages and
a recording studio on a 193-acre farm here. He is also a key
supporter of the Hearthstone School, which was built on his
property and which his young children attend. Former U.S.Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, the political cartoonist Jeff MacNelly and the
political commentators Rowland Evans and James Kilpatrick also
maintain homes here.
</P>
<P>
   David Adoff, a real estate agent, and his wife, Hildy Teegen, an
associate professor at George Washington University in the nation's
capitol, decided to settle here after driving through the county on
their way to the Shenandoah National Park four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What clinched their decision to buy a home here was a chance
stop at the Mountainside Market, a 4,000-square-foot general
store/deli/laundromat built along the road to the national park
that serves as the community hangout for the artists, musicians and
alternative culture element in Rappahannock County.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple looked at the store's eclectic deli menu and
inspected its diverse stock _ which includes art objects and
shelves of vegetarian foods, herbal and homeopathic medicines and
150 types of beer _ ``we decided that if the community can support
this kind of food and drink, this is a place we want to live,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adoff, a former home builder who publishes an online guide to
the county and works part-time for a real estate firm, and his wife
have since purchased three lots along a hollow leading up to the
Skyline Drive. They have also built a 2,000-square-foot,
cedar-sided home with views of the surrounding mountains on one
five-acre lot and a 1,000-square-foot guest house, which they rent
out to tourists, on a four-acre lot. All three of the lots were
laid out prior to the passage of the 25-acre zoning ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the couple put the house up for sale for $279,000 and
the cabin for $160,000 so they can build a new house elsewhere in
the county.
</P>
<P>
   Adoff said that because of the 25-acre zoning, Rappahannock
County homes are expensive. Residential lots will sell for $3,000
to $5,000 per acre, depending upon the view. To this must be added
the cost of digging a well, installing a septic field and building
a driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the expense of housing, the typical buyer is a
professional in his or her 50's or 60's who wants to spend weekends
in the county until moving there permanently at retirement, Adoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful visitor's draw to the county is the Inn at Little
Washington, an 80-seat restaurant and a 14-room inn that is
consistently ranked as one of the finest country inns in the
nation. The inn draws its name from a local name for the town of
Washington, population 190. It is named for George Washington, who
as a young surveyor laid out its five-block by two-block street
grid in 1749.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's co-owner and chef, Patrick O'Connell, a native of
Washington, D.C., said he had fallen in love with the county's
countryside as a child in family drives to Luray, Va. In 1967, the
self-taught chef purchased a three-acre property near here while he
was still in his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he purchased a 100-acre farm at the foot of
nearby Old Rag Mountain, where he raised vegetables for sale to
health-food shops in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   His vegetable business soon evolved into a catering enterprise
that took him into the homes of many well-to-do families in the
Virginia hunt country, which includes the eastern part of
Rappahannock County.
</P>
<P>
   Learning of his clients' need for a place where they could
entertain, he and his partner, Reinhardt Lynch, leased half of an
old garage in the Town of Washington for $200 month and converted
it into the restaurant. The inn opened in 1978, and over the years,
the lush rooms, with rates of $340 to $640 a night, not including
meals, and a $5 million kitchen wing have been added.
</P>
<P>
   All along the way, the Inn has eagerly sought out specialty
products, such as smoked trout, fallow deer, exotic vegetables,
mushrooms and rabbits from local farmers. In recent months, David
Cole, the former president of America Online's Internet services
unit, announced plans to convert two historic buildings across the
street from the inn into a center that would retail organic food
items such as the Kobe beef and premium berries he is raising at
his nearby Sunnyside Farm.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buildings would also become headquarters for
walnutacres.com, an online organic-foods store that would sell
products from Sunnyside and Walnut Acres Organic Farms, a leading
provider of organic foods based in Penns Creek, Pa., that Cole
acquired a controlling interest in this summer.

PAIRING STRATEGY SEEMS TO FAVOR THE EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ It is a difference of opinion as striking as the
Vardon grip vs. the interlock. Neither is wrong, both can work.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw has chosen to use all 12 of his players in the
first two days of the Ryder Cup Matches at The Country Club,
sticking with a philsophy that is typical of a United States
captain. Mark James, on the other hand, has ridden nine horses, and
won't introduce the remaining three members of his European team
until Sunday's singles matches. (Trust us, Jarmo Sandelin, Jean Van
de Velde, and Andrew Coltart have checked in and are present and
accounted for.)
</P>
<P>
   For years, US captains have had the luxury of a team so dominant
they could sit out key players, get everyone in the lineup, and
still win. Thus in 1977 did US players yawn when Tom Weiskopf _
arguably one of the game's great players at the time _ said he
would not play for personal reasons. The US won anyway, 12 1/2-7
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Then Europe developed a nucleus _ Seve Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam,
Bernhard Langer, Nick Faldo, and Sandy Lyle were dubbed the ``Fab
Five'' _ that embraced the Ryder Cup as their personal crusade.
Whatever it took to win, they would do, and when that meant playing
five matches every time, they did not flinch. If that meant taking
a partner and dancing with him for three or four matches, they
said, ``Start the music, give us matching shirts, and show us to
the first tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fab Five is no longer part of these festivities, but the
philosophy lives on. Stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, the first time in 28 years that the US lost the
Ryder Cup, the Europeans essentially have said, ``We know you have
more depth. Now hand us the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, with Lyle being replaced by Ryder Cup rookie Jose Maria
Olazabal as a key team member, the Europeans used five players
(Ballesteros, Faldo, Langer, Woosnam, and Olazabal) in all five
matches. Four players went the distance in '89, three in '91, four
in '93, four in '95, and five in '97. James will establish Ryder
Cup history Sunday when seven players take part in their fifth
match. (In that same period, the US used more than one player in
all five matches only once, in 1991 when it played three thanks in
part to Steve Pate's injury.)
</P>
<P>
   So some players had to laugh when Jeff Maggert, after his
morning foursomes win with Hal Sutton over Colin Montgomerie and
Paul Lawrie, said, ``It's a lot to ask to play five matches.''
European workhorses Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Sergio Garcia,
Jesper Parnevik, Miguel Angel Jimenez, Colin Montgomerie, and Paul
Lawrie might take exception.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up the Maggert-Sutton team after three solid efforts
raised eyebrows. So did Crenshaw's explanation for putting Leonard
in with Sutton for afternoon play: ``It's a hunch.''
</P>
<P>
   James cannot be accused of relying on a hunch. He came in with
one game plan and one game plan only _ ride eight or nine players
to a two-day lead and hope to win enough singles matches to reach
the magical number of 14.
</P>
<P>
   The only decision he had to make was whether to play Olazabal
with Jimenez in foursomes, and even that became easy because
Olazabal took himself out of that phase of the competition. Enter
Padraig Harrington to complete the roster, at least the roster
James is counting upon.
</P>
<P>
   Singles has never been the European strong point (Oak Hill, 1995
excluded) and James knows this. Just as European captains
Ballesteros, Bernard Gallacher, and Tony Jacklin knew it before
him. Since 1987, a European has played in all five matches 25
times; Europe's singles record in those instances is 8-13-4.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't really mattered as the Europeans have found a
successful strategy. That is, putting players together and sticking
with them, even at the first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Oak Hill in 1995? Gallacher threw out his iron _
Montgomerie and Faldo _ in the first match, a rather daring move
considering there wasn't much iron to throw out. Faldo and
Montgomerie were beaten twice on the first day, 1 up, and 3 and 2.
So on Day 2, facing a 5-3 deficit, what did Gallacher do? He stayed
with his plan, again leading off with Faldo and Montgomerie. The
veterans, well aware of the burden placed upon them, came through
with a 4-and-2 triumph over Jay Haas and Curtis Strange, a match
that helped put in motion a 3-1 morning advantage in foursomes. We
know what happened the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   This year? Westwood-Clarke, Parnevik-Garcia, Montgomerie-Lawrie
have been glued to each other. The strategy could very well blow up
in James's face, but, quite honestly, it was the only game plan he
could go with.
</P>
<P>
   And, if it works again, perhaps future US captains will start
thinking about finding permanent partners for their stars like
Tiger Woods. Saturday, he played with his fifth different partner
in eight Ryder Cup team matches.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For hundreds of years, millions of blacks were
captured in Africa and forced to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the
Americas, where they became slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, more than 1,000 black descendants of
those slaves made a symbolic trip from St. Paul Community Baptist
Church in East New York, Brooklyn, to the shores of that same ocean
to pay homage to their ancestors, as part of a religious
remembrance of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   The travelers arrived on the beaches of the Rockaway peninsula
about 4 a.m. for a sunrise service led by the Rev. Johnny Ray
Youngblood, the pastor of St. Paul, who organized the tribute,
which is held every year.
</P>
<P>
   As African drums played in the background, those who gathered _
most of them dressed in white garb to symbolize their desire to
cleanse the sting of slavery _ heard Youngblood and others speak
about their belief that the roots of modern-day racism and hatred
can be found in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's gathering focused on how to escape being victims of
``Maafa,'' the Kiswahili word that means unspeakable horror and
that is now being used to describe the slave trade, which
Youngblood calls the ``middle passage holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants seemed to share Youngblood's beliefs that black
Americans are still affected by the slave trade that flourished
centuries ago and that the best way for black Americans to recover
from the wounds of the past is to mourn, which allows them to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The process, he said, helps blacks deal with much of the anger
that many of them feel.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Hyatt, a 38-year-old bus driver from Brooklyn who
attended the sunrise service, said blacks should always remember
their ancestors' suffering. ``In certain respects we need to be
like the Jews and say, `Never forget' _ even more than that, `Never
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Frances Henry, a church member who works as a funeral director,
said that before going to the event for the first time in 1997, she
was ``pent up with anger'' and ``felt like dirty laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving us the knowledge of the struggle we went through,'' she
added, ``felt like dirt being loosened from laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the washing stage,'' Ms. Henry said. ``We still have
more to do, but are getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ceremony continued, participants spoke about their
lingering pain, sang and wept. As the orange sun began to rise, the
participants threw carnations into the ocean as a symbol of their
respect for those who came before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry to connect to their roots,'' said Janet
Bigot, a junior high school counselor who lives in East New York.
``But one cannot help but be angry because of our conditions in a
society that has thrived on the blood, sweat and tears of our
ancestors. Angry is normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bigot said she was most moved by the participants'
reflections on the slave trade. ``We are saying to our ancestors
that although we have not experienced what you had to go through,
we understand and we will not forget,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood called for the U.S. government to pay reparations to
all black Americans for their ancestors' enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the government has paid reparations to
Japanese-Americans who were kept in internment camps during World
War II, Ms. Bigot, a member of Youngblood's church, said slavery
reparations would ``show respect, pay some mind for what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The sunrise service was part of a weeklong observance of the
heritage of slavery in many black churches across the nation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The week of events at St. Paul's included remarks from a variety
of black Americans, including Leonard Jeffries Jr., a professor of
African-American studies at City College, who spoke on Monday about
``Historical and Political Context of the Healing of African
People'' and Alton Maddox, who spoke about racism and the law. Both
men are controversial: Jeffries has been criticized for
anti-Semitic statements, and Maddox was one of the lawyers at the
center of the Tawana Brawley case.
</P>
<P>
   The events at St. Paul's included a workshop called ``Undoing
Racism,'' examining how to achieve that goal in a nonviolent and
practical way.
</P>
<P>
   Orville Froome, a businessman from Valley Stream, compared the
lingering effects of slavery to child abuse. ``It is almost like
someone who has been mistreated as a child and they are carrying
all this pain because of slavery,'' Froome said. ``Yes, we are
hurt, and what an event like this does is help us heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Paterson, who lives in Brooklyn and attended the week's
events, said she left ``on an emotional high.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Youngblood hopes to hold the event in Central Park,
which is not fraught with the symbolism of the ocean, but which
might draw more participants.

NEW JERSEY FLOOD-CONTROL PLAN STALLED FOR DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOUND BROOK, N.J. _ Ever since six men died in a flash flood in
1973, the Army Corps of Engineers has been planning a vast
construction project to tame Green Brook and other flood-prone
streams around this borough and a dozen nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   But work has been delayed over and over _ by federal budget
cuts, by drastic changes demanded by Congress, by the corps'
cumbersome bureaucracy, by environmental questions, and by
political tussles over how to apportion the costs and benefits of
the $330 million flood-control plan.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as thousands of residents pick through the ruins of
precisely the kind of flooding the corps set out to prevent a
quarter-century ago, officials are left to contemplate both a
meteorological nightmare and a bureaucratic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had better foresight, that project could've been done
now and Bound Brook wouldn't have been flooded,'' said Clark
Gilman, 60, the chief of flood-plain management for the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection, who has been working on the
plan for 25 of the 30 years he has held the position. ``It's real
sad. Nero fiddled and now Rome's burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials who assessed the damage this week found that
flooding from Tropical Storm Floyd rose 2 feet higher than even the
theorized catastrophe that they had used as a worst-case scenario.
What had been a computer-generated line on their maps was now drawn
on the town's streets and buildings in rainbow stains of oil and
brown smudges of sewage and mud.
</P>
<P>
   As Bound Brook, Green Brook Township, Middlesex and other
communities in the low plains of northern New Jersey tallied losses
from the floods, debate intensified over the long-planned, but
never-executed Green Brook Flood Control Project.
</P>
<P>
   It was only out of respect for the two people who died when the
Raritan River and Green Brook combined to immerse this place that
some officials refrained from saying, ``I told you so.'' But
several came close.
</P>
<P>
   William Slezak, the civil works chief in the corps' regional
headquarters in New York, said that despite the epic dimensions of
this deluge, it would have been largely held back by the planned
network of levees, channels and flood walls. The corps, saddled
with a reputation for excessive building and wasteful spending,
this time appeared to have the right idea. The plan called for
levees with an extra three feet of height, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just tears your heart out, the fact that we just weren't
able to provide the protection in time,'' Slezak said.
</P>
<P>
   The long, strange history of the Green Brook Flood Control
Project is a study in the tortuous course that must be run by
complicated engineering projects, particularly when they span 3
counties and 13 municipalities, as this one does.
</P>
<P>
   Over two decades, competing political interests at the
downstream and upstream ends of Green Brook pressed different
representatives in Congress either to drop aspects of the plan or
to change its focus, each time causing delays. Communities with
fewer flooding problems questioned whether they should have to
share costs with those, like Bound Brook, that faced the biggest
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The debate played out year after year in The Courier News and
other local newspapers. Even though the federal government would
pay 75 percent of the costs and the state 19 percent, elected
officials focused on the impact on municipal and county budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment was the peculiar kind of amnesia that settles
in after disasters, said Eric Evenson, the New Jersey district
chief for the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my personal observation that the public at large, between
droughts and floods, tends to forget,'' Evenson said. ``The level
of urgency for dealing with rare events just isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever doubted the potential for devastation when the
lacework of rivers and brooks that feed into the Raritan River
swells during extreme storms.
</P>
<P>
   The flat plain below the 500-foot ridges known as the Watchung
Mountains has flooded at least since Colonial times, with Green
Brook developing a particularly nasty reputation as an amplifying
funnel for water cascading from the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Through the late 1880s and into this century, floods along Green
Brook occurred regularly. Finally, in August 1932, New Jersey
officials took the first stab at finding ways to hold back the
waters, publishing a report titled ``Control of Floods on Green
Brook in the Counties of Middlesex, Somerset and Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of it.
</P>
<P>
   It took back-to-back severe floods in 1971 and then 1973, and
the loss of six lives in the 1973 flash flood, which occurred on a
tributary of Green Brook, to prompt new action. Altogether, floods
along the Green Brook watershed from 1900 to 1996 caused $2.4
billion in damage, the Army Corps of Engineers has calculated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, with strong local support, the corps began assessing
whether levees, concrete channels and other means could minimize
damage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, New Jersey empowered communities that shared
flooding problems to form flood control commissions, and the Green
Brook Flood Control Commission was formed. It remains the only such
commission in the state, Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   The group, comprising representatives from each county and town,
met 10 times a year, year after year, working as a prod to the
corps and as a lobby in Washington to try to push Congress to keep
the money moving.
</P>
<P>
   It took the corps seven years to devise a preliminary plan. In
1980, the experts concluded that a project tightly focused on
preventing flooding in the hardest-hit areas, like Bound Brook,
could save lives and money. That conclusion met the agency's rules
that economic benefits outweigh costs.
</P>
<P>
   But prosperous suburbs farther up the Green Brook watershed,
like Berkeley Heights and Scotch Plains, were upset that they were
left out. They, after all, had suffered some of the worst effects
of past floods, recalled Vernon Noble, 80, a former mayor of Green
Brook who has been chairman of the flood commission since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   The commission pressed members of Congress to force the Army
Corps to redo its plan.
</P>
<P>
   But it had to wait six years to get its wish.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for the plan ebbed as memories of the floods faded. At
the same time, as part of a war on pork-barrel spending, President
Reagan cut nearly all money for water projects around the country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Noble and other commission members _ who are unpaid _ made
annual pilgrimages to Washington to testify about the need for
protection. They got their five minutes, sandwiched between
delegations from other states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Congress authorized money for the Green Brook project,
but only if the Army Corps expanded it to include protection for
communities all along the stream, not just at the soggiest end.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers had concluded that this was not economically
justified, but Congress essentially demanded that they find a way
to justify it, said Gilman, the New Jersey flood official.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sent us back to square one,'' said Slezak of the Army
Corps regional office. By the late 1980s the plan had to
fundamentally change anyway, he said, because so much time had
passed that the entire area had changed. There were corporate
parks, parking lots and shopping centers where there had been
vacant land _ some in spots where levees were supposed to go. More
years slid by.
</P>
<P>
   Private environmental groups also began to fight more
vigorously, opposing two big flood-control reservoirs that were
planned for wooded, wild areas at the base of the Watchung range.
Such basins hold back flood waters temporarily and release them
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The groups also contended that the plan might encourage more
development close to rivers, said Sunil Somalwar, a physics
professor at Rutgers University who is a vice chairman of the New
Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, there's this promise that once the Army
Corps steps in, floods will disappear, so let's go build close to
the river,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The project also lost steam within the corps as managers came
and went, lured to higher-paying jobs in industry, Slezak said.
Other water experts in the project point to the frequent rotation
of officers through the top corps post in the region, which caused
a loss of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Budgets also tightened again as the Clinton administration cut
federal money for flood projects within individual states, New
Jersey and corps officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A bad flood in October 1996 reinvigorated the flood plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the following summer, it was changed once again. Sen. Robert
Torricelli, after strong lobbying by residents of Berkeley Heights,
pushed through a law prohibiting the corps from building the basins
at the upstream end. Over the years, the upstream communities had
become more focused on environmental issues and less on the flood
threat.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the project was put on hold so that construction
around Bound Brook could begin. Many officials involved in the plan
say they doubt the upper part of the Green Brook project will ever
be built.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, a flood-control plan that began in 1980 as a focused
effort in the lower portion of Green Brook, then was expanded at
the behest of Congress, now reverted to its original dimensions.
Along the way, a decade was lost.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gov. Christie Whitman and federal officials gathered
in a Bound Brook park to announce that ground would finally be
broken in the spring of 2000 on the first stage, the replacement of
a 68-year-old bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Now that park is a swamp, and the curbs of adjacent streets are
banked high with discarded furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Until late this summer, some residents of Bound Brook were still
trying to block parts of the plan. And even now, others along the
watershed, including some officials from neighboring Middlesex
County, still question the need for the levees and pumping
stations. Local environmental groups, and the state's Sierra Club
chapter, still oppose the plan, saying the government would do
better if it bought homes and businesses in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   In case the project drags on, corps officials this week said
they were planning to update the old brochure promoting the flood
plan _ adding photographs of the latest disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As the remains of Floyd blew in on Sept. 16, J.B. Wiley Jr., an
engineering consultant for the local flood control commission, was
in his house in Bedminster Township, 20 miles upstream from Bound
Brook, watching the upper Raritan River rise.
</P>
<P>
   After the water began lapping against the road, he jumped in his
car and drove toward the borough. ``I was thinking about all those
nice people who'd said this would never happen, therefore we didn't
need the project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Bound Brook as the evacuations began. ``Watching
all those poor people,'' he said, ``really fired up my
determination to see this thing through.''

REAL ESTATE: SHORTAGES ARE SLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Pa., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the pipes in the trenches to the trusses for the
roof, from the panels for the walls to the insulation between the
beams _ and, just as acutely, in the search for skilled workers to
hammer it all together _ home builders are struggling with
shortages of supplies and labor.
</P>
<P>
   In coping with the scarcities, the builders find themselves
engaged in frenetic juggling acts that have consequences for their
profit margins and for homebuyers' budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed by bottlenecks for one material, then another,
developers are realizing just where they rank in their suppliers'
pecking orders, their allocation for a particular product dependent
on how much they bought last year _ a serious circumstance for the
little guy. Stymied by delivery delays, some find themselves
staring at foundations without frames, frames without walls. Others
turn to alternative materials or methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I've got war stories,'' said Jeffrey Levine,
president of Levine Builders, a Queens, N.Y.-based corporation that
has built about 3,000 housing units over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft walls for three elevators in a 240-unit co-op building
going up at 95th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan were
supposed to be lined with fire-resistant coreboard, Levine said,
``but due to its lack of availability, time constraints dictated
that we make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Masons will now have to build brick firewalls, Levine said _ at
a not inconsiderable extra expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The masonry costs about $2.50 more per square foot than the
coreboard,'' Levine said. ``The elevator is 10 by 10, and it's 10
feet from floor to floor, so that's 400 square feet per floor. At
$2.50 extra a foot, that would be $1,000 per floor for each
elevator.'' There are three elevators in the 11-story building, or
33 times $1,000, for a total added cost of $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York suburbs, according to one estimate, increases in
the cost of lumber can add $4,000 to the price of a typical home
and $10,000 to a luxury residence.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers pass along those extra costs to the homebuyers.
But, said Levine, ``depending on the circumstances of the
contractual agreements, if it's a fixed-price contract I bear the
burden.''
</P>
<P>
   What the developers cannot avoid passing along are the delays in
completion dates _ postponements that have sent buyers packing for
motel stays or to the homes of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mutinsky is president of the New Jersey division of Centex
Homes, a company that last year built 15,000 houses around the
country. ``When I moved from Florida to New Jersey in 1985,''
Mutinsky said, ``the home-building market was very active. And, at
that time, the same types of delays were occurring'' _ including
for the home Mutinsky had ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up in a hotel with my children and a dog,'' he said,
``and here I am almost 15 years later, causing that same problem to
my homeowners. I never wanted to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutinsky estimates that the panoply of delays he faces these
days has pushed back completion dates on his projects by at least
three months.
</P>
<P>
   At Island Estates at Shoreham in suburban New York, where 140
houses are pushing toward completion, the builders are also feeling
the squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one supplier say, `OK, I'll give you Sheetrock if you
buy lumber from me,' '' said Lennard Axinn, a partner in Island
Estates. ``We were desperate. It was a different form of ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are houses delayed by the shortages,'' Axinn
said. ``That has an impact when the homeowners are counting on
moving in by a certain date, getting the kids into school. Of
course, they were screaming at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the builders require an excess of sympathy, since their
problems are the product of a booming, profitable housing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're operating at sales levels that are, basically,
records,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders. There were 886,000 new homes sold in
the country last year, ``an all-time high,'' Seiders said. The
previous record was 819,000 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   And through July of this year alone, 577,000 new homes were
sold, Seiders said. ``Compared to the first seven months of last
year, that's an increase of 6 percent,'' he said. ``So it was a
record year last year, and the first seven months this year we ran
above last year's pace _ that's red hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand, as usual, is reflected by prices. In New Jersey, for
example, said Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of that
state's Builders' Association, ``prices are surging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that the average price of a new home in New
Jersey is about $250,000, up more than 10 percent from a year
ago,'' O'Keefe said. ``It's attributable to the robust demand, and
constrained supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of supplies and labor, said Seiders, ``tops the problem
list for builders at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of 400 members of the association, 72
percent nationally and 77 percent in the Northeast _ the nine
states from Pennsylvania through New England _ said they were
experiencing shortages of materials. Asked about labor, 75 percent,
both nationally and in the Northeast, said they were experiencing
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The builders' concerns about supplies surpassed even their
reaction to the fact that the Federal Reserve has twice raised
interest rates in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he did not want to sound like ``a cheerleader for a
slowdown,'' Seiders pointed out that ``usually when the Fed is in a
tightening mode, that's enough to throw the builders into a state
of panic.'' However, he said, builders are ``pretty sanguine about
that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be the most interest-sensitive sector of
the economy,'' he said. ``So, obviously, when the Fed has tightened
policy a couple of times, they really do want this sector to lose
some steam. But the builders are not carrying on about the
tightening. It's hard to operate in a market where you have trouble
getting decent workers and things like gypsum wallboard. So a
rebalancing of supply and demand in this market would not be a bad
thing.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those in the trenches of the building business,
keeping their balance can require a juggler's touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got me going,'' said Mutinsky of Centex Homes in
New Jersey when asked about the pitfalls of the current
construction cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, in developing the land, we have a problem getting
ductile iron water main,'' Mutinsky said. ``That has added a
three-week delay. And once the water main comes in, the
subcontractor doesn't have the manpower to make up that three
weeks' difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a problem with the availability of PVC pipe,'' he
continued, referring to sanitary sewer pipe made from
polyvinylchloride. ``We have just been informed that the prices are
going up; they won't tell us how much and there may be a shortage.
This is what they're telling me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the actual construction of the home, Mutinsky said: ``In
the permit process, municipalities in New Jersey have 20 days to
review and comment on and/or approve your plans. But they're so
swamped with applications and no manpower to handle them that on
the 19th day you get an additional list of deficiencies from the
municipality. It's either a true deficiency or a delaying tactic to
give them more time to review the application.'' That alone,
Mutinsky said, adds a month's delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, framing the house,'' he said. ``I have an additional
one-month delay receiving the pre-manufactured panels and trusses _
these are the wooden floor and wall panels and what holds up the
roof. Again, because of the demand, we wait an additional month for
the delivery of those. And again, the framer does not have the
additional crews to make up that lost time.''
</P>
<P>
   But, by far, the greatest shortage confounding the industry is
of gypsum wallboard _ otherwise known as coreboard, drywall or by
its trademarked name, Sheetrock. ``We used to be able to get it in
two days,'' Mutinsky said, ``but due to the allocations, it's now
up to almost 14 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays are not sequential, but overlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to contract with a customer,'' Mutinsky said, ``we
used to anticipate a six-month delivery of that home. But because
of all of the above, we now state anywhere between eight to 10
months out. That's an average of an additional three-and-a-half
months.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not for lack of trying that the wallboard industry has not
filled all of its orders, said Pam Kassner, spokeswoman for USG (G
for gypsum) Corp., the nation's largest manufacturer of wallboard.
``The industry and USG, we've been running 24 hours a day since
last summer,'' Ms. Kassner said. ``The demand is at record
levels.'' Last year, the industry produced 28 billion square feet,
and expects to exceed 30 billion this year, Ms. Kassner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shipping, but it's never enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the price has gone up. The cost to a distributor for
1,000 square feet of wallboard was $149 at the end of July, 17
percent higher than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will get better toward the end of the year,'' Ms. Kassner
said. ``We have new plants from us and our competitors coming
online.'' But demand, she said, will not dip. ``We think it's going
to be just as strong in 2000 as in '99, and the repair and remodel
market is growing gangbusters.'' Potent, too, is the office market,
which also uses wallboard.
</P>
<P>
   The supply-price equation for lumber is also vexing for
builders, though more difficult to quantify because lumber is much
more of an international commodity, subject to the vagaries of many
a national market. In some parts of this country, builders are
befuddled by price fluctuations; in others, they are hamstrung by
actual shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong demand for new homes, lumber prices in the
United States actually slackened somewhat last year, primarily
because profound weaknesses in Asian economies undercut the demand
in those nations _ particularly Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we were able to consume a huge amount of lumber at pretty
attractive prices last year,'' said Seiders. ``But then prices
spiked up from last year's low.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price for 1,000 board feet of lumber was $349 in
1998. By mid-July of this year, it had bounded up to $490.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, according to Joanne Carroll, president of JMC
Resources, a housing research firm, lumber costs for a typical
2,000-square-foot home have risen by about $4,000 since last year.
For a trophy house in a swank Connecticut suburb, the price of
lumber spiraled up by about $10,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end, said Norton Wheeler, the lumber buyer for
United Builders' Supply in Waterford and Niantic, Conn., ``a sharp
rise in lumber costs could knock a first-time buyer out of the
box.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, however, the average national lumber
price has slipped back to $390 per 1,000 board feet _ still
considerably above last year's mark. ``Lumber prices are very
volatile,'' Seiders said, ``a lot of ups and downs, a lot of
speculation. Usually when you talk about shortages, the symptom is
high prices, but you can still get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 12 houses out here in East Windsor,'' Mr. Mutinsky
said of one of his projects in New Jersey. ``I had to wait 10 weeks
for delivery of the wall panels when the normal delivery is five.
If I can't put lumber on a foundation, it sits.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it has something to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of approved, developable land is dwindling
rapidly,'' O'Keefe of the New Jersey Builders Association said,
``and, consequently, we may see a trailing off in production in
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet incessant demand, some builders are turning to
commercial or industrial sites that can be rezoned for residential
use, or to previously ignored parcels passed over because they were
too difficult to build on. For example, Brian Stolar, president of
Pinnacle Communities of Millburn, said his company was buying a
35-acre site on a hilltop in Wayne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Scarce land coupled with high demand can be costly. John Udell,
president of Weichert New Homes, a land broker, estimates that land
today constitutes 35 percent to 40 percent of the cost of a new
home, compared with 30 percent just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, even assuming that all the land and all the supplies can be
acquired according to a reasonably coordinated schedule, there's no
telling whether the developer will be able to hire workers capable
of doing the pipe-fitting, the cementing, the wiring, the sawing,
the hammering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost worse than these material problems are the labor
problems,'' said Axinn of Island Estates in Suffolk County. ``It's
been sort of a balancing act so we aren't getting creamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, 80 percent of Axinn's workers do the basic building
and 20 percent perform what he calls customer service, like
touching up paint and fine trim work after the house is up. ``We've
had to reallocate those resources so that people in customer
service can help complete the homes,'' Axinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutinsky said that when he first came to the New York area in
1985, hard times had hit the Sunbelt states, ``and the skilled
labor from down there came north, so that all these Texas license
plates showed up on the sites here.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recession of the late '80s and early '90s, however,
many small- to medium-sized builders went out of business in the
New York area. ``Thus, the license plates went back to Texas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Residential developers have also been losing workers to the
booming commercial segment of the building industry, said Seiders
of the national home builder's association _ adding, somewhat
sheepishly: ``Right now, in fact, we're adding four stories and a
wing to our headquarters building here in Washington, near the
White House, and the contractor is luring workers from the
residential area.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Carl Goldberg, a partner in Roseland Property Co.
of Roseland, N.J., which builds about 1,500 homes a year in the
region, the industry must do more to expand the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 19 months, the scarcity of qualified workers has
become a crisis,'' Goldberg said. ``It's not only a problem in
numbers, but also because people haven't had full training.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the lack of trim contractors _ those carpenters who do
the fine finish work _ Goldberg said, ``I often hear people saying
these days, `Gee, they don't do things like that anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer and fewer students are choosing to go to vocational
school, Goldberg pointed out, and trade union apprenticeship
programs are running at about about 60 percent of capacity. The
industry needs to create outreach programs and provide scholarships
to entice young people into trade schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to communicate that there are opportunities in being a
licensed electrician or a licensed plumber, financial
opportunities,'' Goldberg said. Take, for example, a carpenter, he
said: ``Four or five years ago, a carpenter would make $16, $17 an
hour. Now, most of the time, it's upwards of $25 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, residential development is a profitable enterprise
these days. Still, all the crunching and juggling has taken its
toll on builders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn how not to lose sleep,'' Mutinsky said, ``but it
does bother you when you come to work in the morning. It's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Marshall Davis, president of Carlton Construction in New
City, N.Y., put it, ``Yes, we are pulling our hair out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is good,'' Davis said, ``but it's not a fun job
anymore.''

DIRTY DENNIS IS NOW A HERO DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In proud, sports-loving New Zealand, Dennis Conner was the man
everyone loved to hate. During the 1987 America's Cup trials in
Australia, Conner, the four-time cup winner, cast aspersions on the
Kiwi team's sportsmanship. He fanned the flames in 1988 by calling
the New Zealand designer Bruce Farr a loser during the contentious
U.S. catamaran defense off San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Down under, Conner's nickname was Dirty Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   But now the 57-year-old sailor is undergoing a public makeover
in, of all places, Auckland, New Zealand. That's the site of the
Louis Vuitton Cup series, a round-robin tournament beginning Oct.
18 to determine which of 11 challenging syndicates will face
defender Team New Zealand next February for the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Conner's popularity was evident earlier this month when his new
Stars &AMP; Stripes was christened at his Auckland compound. Before a
packed house, the boat was unveiled with keel and rudder in full
view _ a radical departure from the usual cup practice of shrouding
the underbody and appendages when the boat is out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my gift back to the people,'' Conner told a cheering
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Back in San Diego last week, Conner admitted that his reputation
in New Zealand had been dicey. ``But now they love me,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``They're pulling for me to be the
challenger. But I'm under no delusions. If I am the challenger,
they won't be rooting for me to beat the home team.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner has bolstered his image with frequent visits to New
Zealand and with his participation in two Whitbread round-the-world
race campaigns. But good feelings won't win yacht races, and many
cup observers believe Conner's odds on challenging are long.
</P>
<P>
   The relevant issue is cash, or lack thereof, which is
restricting Conner to a one-boat campaign. Although he won't reveal
his budget, Conner can't compete fiscally with the flush two-boat
programs from U.S. syndicates Young America and AmericaOne, Italy's
Prada Challenge, and Japan's Nippon Challenge. Conner ranks these
groups as his top competition.
</P>
<P>
   The two-boat theory calls for contrasting designs, one for use
during the early stages of the round-robin, when the breeze is
fresh, and a second for the later, light-air rounds. ``I don't
think that's going to work like everyone's dreamed,'' Conner said.
``There's going to be some light-air days and heavy-air days
throughout. You can only change boats at the beginning of each
round robin.''
</P>
<P>
   So Conner, who pioneered the two-boat concept in the '80s but is
now banking on a boat for all seasons, won't concede that he's at a
drastic disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of these programs, the second boat isn't in the water
yet,'' he said. ``It's really full-scale design experimentation as
opposed to a two-boat program to optimize sails and crew work and
appendages. It would be good to have two bites of the apple as long
as both could be optimized, but it's yet to be proven how valuable
that will be this time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Conner believes the Auckland site will play to his
strengths. ``The sailing is generally going to be in winds like
those on like Long Island Sound,'' he said. ``Very shifty. There's
going to be more of a premium on the sailing than we've seen for a
long time. Lately, the premium's been on the faster boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Conner feels he has an advantage. In girth and demeanor,
he is sailing's version of Bill Parcells. Like the coach, he
attracts veteran talent. With experience at every position and an
afterguard including a six-time J/24 world champion, Ken Read, as
helmsman, a two-time America's Cup winner, Peter Isler, navigating,
and a match-racing master, Peter Holmberg, calling tactics, Conner
has an elite team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for anyone to say they have a better crew
than mine,'' the skipper said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though Conner insists that he's still competitive, he says
he accepts his secondary role on the race course. ``How could I do
my best job at fund raising if I was out practicing in Auckland
today like Kenny?'' he said. ``And if I went out and steered now
without practicing, would I be letting my guys down? I would. It's
hard to be the best at what you do and do it part time.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this a kinder, gentler Conner? ``I'm probably still feisty
if people try to take advantage of me,'' he said. ``But I've always
been very straightforward and told the truth as best I could.
Sometimes that gets me in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's interesting to note that Conner calls all of his
one-design sailboats Menace. For despite the new image, before all
is said and done, Conner, who is approaching his eighth America's
Cup campaign, will most likely be menacing someone on or off the
water. Still, the pressing question isn't whether the old tiger is
sporting fresh stripes. What everyone wants to know is if America's
Cup has another one in him.

BYE WEEK IS TIME OF JOY FOR PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>

By DEION SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders' column, as told to staff
writer Clarence E. Hill Jr., will appear in the'' Star-Telegram
``every week during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Super Bowl week is unforgettable. The hype
that surrounds the game. The fans welcoming you into the host city,
the red-carpet treatment for the team that's expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   The midweek controversy. The game. The postgame interviews. The
parties _ yeah, I used to do the parties. The flight back home to a
huge welcome. And finally the parade _ oh yeah, I missed that _ but
I'm sure it was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   In all 11 years as a professional football player there is only
week that could come close to the Super Bowl week. It's a week that
gets players and coaches equally excited. It's called the bye week.
</P>
<P>
   My first year in the league I noticed some guys got more excited
about this bye week than any other week we had on the schedule, so
I called the NFL and asked if they could put that bye team in our
division so we could play them twice.
</P>
<P>
   We were 3-13 in Atlanta that year, so please understand I was
just trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bye truly means bye for most players and coaches. Traveling to
wherever or doing whatever that gives an escape from the rigors of
the NFL. I'm either fishing, sitting on the beach with family, or
honeymooning for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise the Lord'' for this column. In a conjunction with the
bye week, I decided to devote time this week entirely to answering
some questions from fans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a deeply religious person as well as a football player,
what were your thoughts on the shooting at Wedgwood Baptist Church
in Fort Worth?
</P>
<P>
   DS: Sadly, I've arrived at the conclusion that bad things do
happen to good people, i.e., Martin Luther King Jr., John F.
Kennedy Sr. and Jr. and the teens at Columbine High School, just to
name a few. Somewhere in the midst of these tears and pain we must
believe that there ``is'' a silver lining in this cloud. Too often
it takes tragedy to bring our homes, families, schools, churches
and communities closer. Instead of dwelling on what happened, I'm
more focused on what we could do to prevent this in the future.
While I'm still searching, I'll start with one of Jesus'
commandments _ love thy neighbor as thyself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How tough has it been sitting on the sideline being a
cheerleader rather than being the person creating the cheers? What
do you do on the sideline to keep you from not going nuts over not
being out there?
</P>
<P>
   DS: I've come to realize that life presents you with many
moments. Some of which you must maximize in order to obtain the
success in which you seek. I really don't get anxious for anything
because I know how important timing is in life. It's not my time
yet, but when it comes again, and it will soon, I will maximize my
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your toe injury and subsequent rehab has resulted in some
people calling you injury-prone. Do you think that's a fair
assessment?
</P>
<P>
   DS: No, I don't. But it is a fact that in 1997 I broke two ribs
and missed games. And, of course, I missed time last year and this
year with my current toe situation. But it is so easy to forget I'm
the same man who played 120 snaps a game offensively and
defensively for my team in 1996. The truth is that this is the
first time-consuming injury that I've sustained in an 11-year
career. I'd rather not suit up than suit up and not show up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several new high-profile cornerbacks have come into the
league the past couple of years, led by the Redskins' Champ Bailey
and the Raiders' Charles Woodson. How good are they, and how do
they compare to you?
</P>
<P>
   DS: Obviously, the most recognized are Bailey and Woodson
because of the accolades out of college. They are the truth; what I
mean is they have all the tools for success and big-play potential.
Both are blessed with veteran cornerbacks tutoring them, such as
Darrell Green and Eric Allen. What has always separated me was
knowledge of myself, my opponent and the game within the game. When
they get that, look out.
\Ntagtop:Deion Sanders will answer one question every week. E-mail
your questions to cehill\Nstar-telegram.com.

 &HT;    The fading glory of Houston's Astrodome
 &HT;    By Brad Buchholz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A few days after we moved to Houston in 1966, my
father loaded the family into the Chevrolet and drove us to see the
Astrodome. Nothing was happening at the stadium that day. The idea
was simply to go _ and behold it.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome, after all, had been dubbed the ``Eighth Wonder of
the World.'' The man who envisioned it, Judge Roy Hofheinz, had
brazenly compared it to the Colosseum in Rome. In this golden age
of can-do, will-do Texas _ an era of NASA space shots, Big Oil and
Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House _ it was our duty, as new
Texans, to consider the glory of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The great dome sat alone in the wild against a flat, treeless
horizon. It was as if no other structure was worthy to rest in its
shadow. I remember silver glints of sunlight against the arched
roof. The Dome conveyed more power from a distance; there was a
silent, solitary grandeur about it. A Texas Giza, on pale
grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   What was it that we were seeing that day? Urban and rural Texas
at the crossroads? Nature, subordinate to man? The future of
baseball? The future? We didn't see the inside of the Dome that
afternoon, but it was more fun to imagine: They play baseball in
there! In air conditioning! ``The Eighth Wonder of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the Astrodome no longer is referred to as a
``wonder'' _ unless, of course, the word is spoken with a hint of
sarcasm. The world no longer beholds it. LBJ is dead. The moon
shots have ended. Oil no longer propels the economy. And the Dome
is no longer unique.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this baseball season, the Houston Astros _ the
Dome's first tenant_ will leave the Astrodome and move downtown
into a baseball-only facility with a retractable roof. While the
Dome will remain open, for now (the Houston Livestock Show &AMP; Rodeo
is booked there, in the spring), it will no longer serve as a venue
for professional sports. The Astros' final regular-season homestand
begins Tuesday, and a banner near the right field foul pole has
begun the countdown: ``Five Dome Games Left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Astrodome is like an old car,'' says Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio, who has played in the Dome for 12 major-league
seasons. ``It's dependable. It's reliable. It still gets you to
work every day _ even though it may make a lot of noise along the
way. But the thing is: We have a brand new car now, sitting right
next to it. I have to admit: The thought of driving it is pretty
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   I laugh along for a moment, charmed by the vivid metaphor. But
I'm sure that Biggio catches me when I close my eyes and sigh. For
I remember, yesterday, when the Astrodome was as sleek and modern
as the rockets at Cape Kennedy _ and all of Houston was eager to
join the ride.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLEASURE DOME
</P>
<P>
   When the Astrodome opened _ April 9, 1965 _ it was a national
event. President Johnson and his family were there, seated beside
Judge Hofheinz in a private box. Gov. John Connally was there.
Astronaut Gus Grissomand his family were there. And of course, the
Houston Astros and the New York Yankees _ with Mickey Mantle _ were
there. It was a spectacle, an event covered by 175 print
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even Jules Verne or Walt Disney, in their most fantastic
moments of genius, ever conceived anything quite like this
unbelievable palace of baseball luxury,'' wrote John Steadman of
the Baltimore News-American. ``Words and pictures cannot begin to
adequately describe the majestic view which overwhelms the visitor
comparable to the first time we viewed Niagara Falls. Awesome
beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days of its fresh paint, the Astrodome was a delightfully
entertaining place _ rich with color, Lone Star braggadocio, and
allusions to space. It was Texas busting its buttons. The outfield
scoreboard _ 474 feet wide and four stories high _ was wildly
famous. After Astro home runs, fans were treated to a 40-second
multicolored montage of Texas chest-thumping _ with its snorting
steers, cowboys and six-guns, and a calf-roping sequence. A few
strains of ``The Eyes of Texas'' reminded opposing teams this
wasn't Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome took itself very seriously. Ultimately, the hokey
self-reference became a large part of its charm.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who greeted you in the parking lot was dressed in space
gear. The attendant who showed you to your seat was a Jetsonlike
``Space-ette.'' The crew that dragged the infield _ the Earthmen _
were dressed as astronauts. These were heady days in Texas; the
Astrodome was nothing if not a reflection of its time.
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome, the largest clear-span building of its day, was
also a forerunner. The idea of the private luxury suite, in the
form of the custom-designed sky box, began in the Astrodome. When
grass wouldn't grow inside the Dome, the Astros and Monsanto Co., a
St. Louis chemical manufacturer, collaborated to develop AstroTurf,
the first artificial grass. The Astrodome built the longest dugouts
in baseball, installed cushioned theater seats, developed the idea
of a scoreboard that mixed information, advertising and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   There were five restaurants in the Dome those first years _
including the Domeskeller, a 2,000-seat picnic area behind the
outfield wall decorated in an Austrian beer garden motif, and the
Trailblazer, on the loge level, where visitors could order
full-course meals. Such ideas are common today, but they were
revolutionary in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In the heyday of the Astrodome, the structure always assumed top
billing over the featured event. It was baseball, in the Astrodome.
Elvis, in the Astrodome. Judy Garland, in the Astrodome. Bullfights
and chuck wagon races and Bob Hope and Doc &AMP; Festus and Evel
Knievel and the Final Four, in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The building had its own electronic personality _ and people
reacted to it. As a mock tribute to the home run sequence on the
scoreboard, the New York Mets once lit sparklers and danced in the
dugout after they hit a home run. Spectators weren't just
encouraged to cheer; they were instructed. One ``rally'' call on
the message board was simply the silhouette of a pair of arms,
clapping. As obedient children of a TV culture, we watched and
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was in awe of the building. There was no way you
couldn't be,'' recalls Houston manager Larry Dierker, who was an
18-year-old pitcher on the '65 Astros. ``It was so unlike anything
anyone had ever seen before that huge, open span. It was
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astrodome freed man from the inconvenience of nature. The
temperature was always 72 degrees, the humidity was always 50
percent, and there was no rain or wind. The scoreboard told us so _
while reminding us, during sporadic weather reports, that it was
hot as hell outside.
</P>
<P>
   When the games were over, my father and I would walk to the car
in the north end of the parking lot. Along the way, my eye would
catch sight of the abandoned Colt Stadium _ the Astros' first home,
their temporary home, during the Astrodome construction, from 1962
to 1964. I couldn't take my eyes off the place. It was the past.
And it gave the Astrodome a strange sense of scale.
</P>
<P>
   The old place looked dusty and gray. I felt the pull of its
ghosts and forgotten games. Nature already had begun to reclaim it.
Behind its outfield wall, I imagined weeds and faded paint. I
wished I could go in there. Whenever we drove from the parking lot,
I found myself looking over my shoulder, hoping to catch a glimpse
of the life behind its walls.
</P>
<P>
   THE JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   If the Astrodome was the reflection of its time, it was also the
reflection of the man who envisioned it. Judge Roy Hofheinz was a
dreamer and a bully, proud of his reputation as a huckster, a man
of great imagination and precious little tact. Although it has
never carried his name, the Astrodome is forever his house.
</P>
<P>
   When Hofheinz introduced the idea of the Astrodome in the late
1950s, he already was famous _ though not necessarily popular. A
child of Texas, raised in poverty, he'd passed the state bar exam
at age 19, won a seat in the Legislature at 22 and begun an
eight-year run as Harris County judge at 24. In the 1940s, he built
a personal fortune _ dealing in real estate, buying and selling
radio stations, developing his law practice. In 1952, Hofheinz
re-entered politics and served as mayor of Houston through 1955 _
though his own council tried to impeach him along the way. The
Judge loved circus and spectacle. His Galveston Bay retreat _ ``The
Huckster House'' _ was a childlike showplace, with rooms decorated
in distinct themes: the Circus Room, the Temple of Chance, the
Brig. During a visit to Rome, he had been intrigued to learn that
the ancient Colosseum had a curtain that scrolled across the top of
the building during harsh weather. Soon afterward, he became a
devotee of Buckminster Fuller, the inventor of the geodesic dome.
He said Fuller convinced him ``it was possible to cover any space
if you didn't run out of money.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard about Houston's bid for a major-league baseball
team, Hofheinz and his friend and real estate partner, W.E. (Bob)
Smith, approached the Houston Sports Association and encouraged
them to think big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I would come in for 1 percent, provided they adopt
my theories about how we should go about it,'' Hofheinz told the
National Observer in 1968. ``I didn't want anything to do with
knocking at baseball's door like a pauper. I wanted to get this
place (the Astrodome) and use it like a credit card.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge showed the National League his model of the Harris
County Domed Stadium in 1960 _ and Houston got the franchise.
Construction of the Dome began in March 1963. Cost of the
structure: $35.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hofheinz was the godfather of the Dome throughout construction.
He involved himself in all decisions _ from china patterns, to
staff and team uniforms, to restroom design. The scoreboard was a
pet project; he called it ``my $2 million toy.'' He picked the
specific colors of each section, he said, to best complement a
woman's complexion. When copyright problems arose over the team's
original name _ the Colt .45s _ the Judge decided his ball club
should be called the Astros. He decided the building should be
called the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a very hard-headed person. He would draw a line
and never cross it,'' recalls Fred Hofheinz, who served as a vice
president of the HSA under his father in the 1960s and later served
two terms as mayor of Houston. ``You couldn't negotiate with him.
But he was generally right.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Astrodome became a Hofheinz empire, and eventually
he controlled 88 percent of the Houston Sports Association. His
Astrodomain grew to include the Astrohall exhibition center, the
Astroworld amusement park and the surrounding hotel-motel complex.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Astrodome, the Judge built a fantastical complex of
VIP suites beyond the right-field pavilion. His six-story, 24-room
AstroSanctum included a lavish presidential suite, bowling lanes, a
projection theater, a barbershop, a six-hole putting course, a
circus-style playroom and puppet theater.
</P>
<P>
   Within the themed rooms, there were grand chandeliers, Louis XIV
antique furniture, zebra-upholstered chairs, gold-plated toilet
handles, telephones with Hofheinz's picture inside the circular
dial. The Judge loved to play. There was a trick bathroom elevator
that rattled and clanked and led to a room that was equipped with
little more than a barrel, a hose and a bucket of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm through, no man will be able to copy what I've
built,'' he once said. ``What you see now is only a small part of
my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judge did not have long to enjoy it. When his wife, Dene,
died suddenly in 1966, he moved out of the family residence and
lived inside the Dome for years _ a modern King Ludwig, alone in
his fantasy castle. He once said he would spend entire weeks in the
building without going outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hofheinz eventually remarried, he suffered a massive
stroke in 1970. Partially paralyzed,he lived another 12 years,
though he no longer had the vigor to maintain his empire. The
baseball team enjoyed only two winning seasons in 15 years.
Attendance sagged. The building fell into disrepair. Heavily
leveraged, Hofheinz was forced to sell his empire in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Roy Hofheinz died in November 1982, at age 70. On the day
of his burial, the funeral procession circled the Astrodome twice
and then proceeded to the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRETCH RUN
</P>
<P>
   In these final days of the Astrodome, I find myself daydreaming
about the Judge _ and things past _ as I visit for the last time. I
haven't been to the Dome very often since my father's death in
1990. He loved the place, simply adored the Astros and held a
season ticket at the end. But it hurt too much for me to come alone
after he passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome is no longer the place I remember. On the field, before
a game with the Mets, Larry Dierker is thinking much the same thing
as he recalls walking into the Dome for the first time in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I feel as though I've walked into the next century.'
And now, as we go into the next century, we need a new ballpark! It
makes you think twice about the idea of `ahead of its time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be the most complimentary thing to say, but the
Astrodome created the prototype for the multiuse stadium. And since
then, frankly, all the multiuse stadiums have proven inadequate. .
. . It's much the same with artificial grass, which seemed great at
the time: no worry, no water. In those two ways, it broke ground _
but maybe it wasn't the right ground.''
</P>
<P>
   As the game begins, I wander the stands. There's nothing but
dead air in straightaway center field _ site of the old scoreboard,
which was dismantled in the renovation project of 1988. In its
place: rows and rows of plush, cushioned seats where no one sits.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with the times _ following trends, no longer setting
them _ the Astrodome has opened a brew pub, Lefty's, near the left
field foul pole. The object here seems to be to drink lots of beer
and taunt Mets outfielder Rickey Henderson. There's an
old-fashioned scoreboard where the keepers update scores by sliding
numbered markers into wooden slats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to this,'' I say to myself. ``The Space Dome has
gone retro.''
</P>
<P>
   In the box seats, Astros fan Ted G. Kennedy wonders about the
Dome's future after the Astros depart. ``There's always the
temptation to hold onto it, like an antique, and keep it on the
mantle. But you can't do that,'' he says. ``From now on, it's
basically going to be little more than a stockyard for the rodeo.
It's sad. It's bittersweet. The building is outdated. It's time to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the home team dugout, I find 83-year-old Miriam Smith, a
season ticket holder since 1965. In front of her, carved on top of
the dugout, is a message: ``Nolan Ryan wuz here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate to see us move,'' she says sadly. ``I've been
going to games in Houston since Texas League days _ in Buff
Stadium, then Colt Stadium. I remember the mosquitoes and the rain.
And I hope the mosquitoes bite all the people who voted for that
new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Roaming the concourse in the late innings of a Phillies game, I
watch people. Once in a while, I see people connecting with the
past. A gray-haired couple holding hands, taking the long, last
look. In the mezzanine, I spot a middle-aged man in a ball cap,
alone, leaning on a rail. At the end of the inning, he pulls away,
wipes a tear, and heads to the door.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be my last time? I walk back downstairs, determined
to find the place where my father sat. I'm pretty sure I can find
it _ except that they've reconfigured the front rows a bit, changed
the angle of the protective net behind home plate _ so I can't
quite place it. Is it this row? The next? Too much time has passed.
I'm so frustrated that I can't find it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of the Astrodome in 1999 _ the impassioned
search for things that are long gone. The tour
</P>
<P>
   When I was a child, the Astrodome tour was a big deal. Millions
of people visited the Dome during the 1960s and 1970s. I never
imagined that the tours still existed _ and yet retired high school
teacher Alma Slawinski drags open the gate every morning at 11
o'clock to lead the first of two excursions.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's a bad idea. But I pay my $4. It's my last chance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small tour today. Me and a family of five from France.
Anne-Marie Bousch, the mother, is the only one who speaks passable
English. Alma tries hard _ but the tour is a disaster. The family
Bousch understands only a fraction of the presentation. Alma
doesn't know the Dome well. And of course, there's nothing to see.
The Judge's secret quarters were destroyed in the renovation. The
scoreboard is gone. The sky boxes are locked, and besides, they've
lost their magic. The baseball dugouts have been cut in half. There
are no secret places. Nothing in the building shouts ``Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   We watch a film that is out of focus and out of date. The
Houston Oilers are still referred to in the present tense. The
Astrodome Museum is locked. Alma says a sign indicates a siren will
sound within 45 seconds if she tries to open the door. We're
reminded the Dome is no longer the tallest, the largest, the
newest. But wait. I stop in front of a kitschy European-style
crest, made of wood, painted on each side, attached to wooden cross
supports. It's out of place. Alma stops me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, before you ask, let me tell you that I have no idea where
that coat of arms came from.''
</P>
<P>
   But I know! It's a piece of the Domeskeller! The Judge's old
Austrian beer garden! Redemption! One last fragment of the Hofheinz
myth!
</P>
<P>
   As we prepare to leave the Dome, the Family Bousch is polite _
but unimpressed. ``Maybe if we'd come last year,'' Anne-Marie tells
me. ``You see, we have a grand new stadium in Paris. It seats
65,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the Texas heat, husband Jean lights a pipe;
Anne-Marie calls the family together to translate the experience
into French. I start to walk away _ but I can't do it. I can't
fight the urge to explain on the Astrodome's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand Texas, and know the time, to truly
understand this place,'' I find myself saying to Anne-Marie. ``When
this was built, Texans were flying to the moon. A Texan was
president of the United States. When this was modern _ when this
was brand new _ there was nothing in the world quite like it. And
all of Texas was proud.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way out, I drive past the site of Colt Stadium. The old
ballpark isn't even there; it was dismantled years ago and shipped
to Mexico. Not even a footprint remains. Nature has taken its
course.

 &HT;    Rising property taxes effect Bush's tax cut propsal
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ About one in three Texas school districts is
considering raising or already has increased its property tax rate,
bringing into question the value of a $1.3 billion tax cut that
Gov. George W. Bush routinely touts in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as property values around the state continue to
rise. Taxable property values increased significantly in most
Central Texas districts, including Austin, meaning even higher
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office says _ and some school board officials agree _
that without the $1 billion cut, more school districts might have
raised their rates or rate increases might have been greater.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Steve Forbes, another GOP candidate for
president, says the tax rate increases shed needed light on Bush's
record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on reports out of Texas, (Bush's tax cut) has been
illusive,'' said Forbes spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers this year adopted about $3 billion in measures meant
to lower and hold down state and local taxes, including $1.3
billion in local school property tax relief. But much of that money
was set aside for districts growing at above-average rates and
districts with outstanding construction-related debt. ``If your
district doesn't fall into one of those categories, you're not
going to get as much benefit,'' said Rep. Paul Sadler
(D-Henderson). Sadler is chairman of the House Education Committee
and was a key architect of the education spending bill that Bush is
now touting.
</P>
<P>
   That bill resulted in higher state spending and was aimed at
forcing districts to lower their local tax rates. For example, in
order to get the additional state money to pay off debt, districts
had to lower local tax rates that are earmarked for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The law also set aside $1.7 billion to increase salaries for
teachers, school nurses and librarians.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts, such as Austin, are growing and have
building-related debt. But those districts either aren't growing as
fast as others or, like AISD, get more money from their local taxes
than the state will replace.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's school board adopted a 12 cent hike earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school finance bill that passed this session made real
strides forward in increasing teacher salaries and helping school
districts to pay for bonds to pay for new facilities,'' said Dick
Lavine, a policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy
Priorities. ``But the increase in tax rates by so many districts
indicates that most schools still lag far behind where they need to
be in terms of paying teachers and providing the programs that our
children need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavine, whose group advocates for more spending on public
services, said he believes much of the bill was intended to improve
education, and that any tax cuts were an added benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over additional education spending versus tax cuts
pushed passage of the bill to the brink of the legislative session,
which ended in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler supported efforts to target tax cuts to so-called
fast-growth and high-debt districts. But he also warned fellow
lawmakers that Texas school districts need discretionary money to
cover other programs. He held out for a bill that included money
for early-education programs and unencumbered state dollars until
late on the last night that the bill could be passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a tax cut, but if you don't leave a cushion of
discretionary dollars, the school districts are going to have to
raise taxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Dunn, a spokesman for the Texas Association of School
Boards, said the lack of discretionary dollars is exactly the
reason many districts are increasing rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tied strings around that money so tightly,'' Dunn said.
``They earmarked it for teacher pay raises and debt service and
they left some, but districts are having to meet the costs of
increasing technology, rising health insurance cost and any pay
raises for administrative or non-teaching staff. It's all having to
come out of the small part of discretionary money or tax
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   According to information gathered by the TEA, 378 school
districts have adopted or are proposing property tax rate increases
averaging 7 cents per $100 of value.
</P>
<P>
   Another 378 districts have or are considering tax rate cuts
averaging about 5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,042 school districts in Texas. The TEA didn't have
information on about seven districts and 279 said they were
considering no changes to their tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan, said voters should hold
their local school boards accountable if they are unhappy about
tax-rate increases. He said the governor and lawmakers did what
they could to cut taxes and voters appreciate the effort.

 &HT;    Few match case Braves' Jones has made for NL MVP
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Larry Walker thinks Robin Ventura should win it.
Sammy Sosa thinks he should win it again. Chipper Jones thinks Jeff
Bagwell will win it. All of them are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, they should be. Instead of becoming clearer as the
season winds down to its final days, the competition for the
National League's Most Valuable Player award is becoming more
confused. Muddied by pennant drives and some nearly identical
statistical portfolios, the race has been reduced to the definition
of what is valuable and what is indispensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the toughest year to pick an MVP in some time,''
Mark McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the season hits the final week, Braves third baseman
Chipper Jones has spoken the loudest, and surely has done the most
for baseball's winningest team. He should become the franchise's
first since Terry Pendleton in 1991 to earn the MVP award. Though
ballots are due from the Baseball Writers' Association of America
before the playoffs start, the results will not be released until
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the award strictly in the sense of the most
valuable player, I'd have to say to the Braves this year, he's the
most valuable guy we've got,'' said pitcher Terry Mulholland, who
witnessed Sosa's MVP campaign last summer as a Cub. ``Obviously you
have to exclude pitchers, but with what he's contributed on a daily
basis, it's amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team offensively is not playing to the potential it would
play with Andres (Galarraga) in there and Javy (Lopez) in there, if
Brian (Jordan) was healthy. Given that, everybody says Bagwell has
had to pick up the slack for Moises Alou being out and I'm sure he
has. But it just seems we've been in more of a battle than they
have. I mean that series we just played with the Mets, Chipper was
a one-man wrecking crew.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a strategy to winning the vote, Jones' timing in the
Mets series (four homers, seven RBIs) was critical. He
out-performed two chief rivals (New York's Ventura and Mike Piazza)
in front of a large contingent of writers. But then, Jones has been
at his best in big series all summer.
</P>
<P>
   In 33 games against the Mets, Cincinnati, Houston and Arizona,
Jones hit .372 with 16 homers and 34 RBIs. He is second in NL total
bases (353) to Sosa, third in slugging (.649) to Walker and
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the league has batted better after the sixth inning
than Jones (.370), nor has any regular come through late in close
games (two-run games from the seventh inning) than Jones, who is
hitting .415 in those situations. With 10 homers and 20 RBIs in the
first 19 games of September, he is willing the Braves to their
eight consecutive divisional title.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jones will not view life in these terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Certainly the possibilities are
there but a lot of other guys have had great years as well, who are
going to have something to say about it. You talk about the numbers
Bagwell has put up pretty consistent all year. It's hard to imagine
him not winning it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the five chief candidates _ Jones, Piazza, Ventura, Bagwell
and Arizona's Matt Williams _ Bagwell has the most similar case to
Jones. While Piazza and Ventura profit by hitting in a lineup
studded with seven .300 hitters, while Williams is surrounded by
the dangerous Luis Gonzalez and Jay Bell, Jones and Bagwell have
been compensating for missing stars.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, unlike Bagwell, Jones hasn't come to the plate
with Craig Biggio standing on second base all year, ready to be
driven in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not Bagwell's fault,'' Jones replied. ``He's playing
his game and his teammates are playing their game. He's put
together some phenominal statistics. But I've had a lot of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize for all their stuggles in the first half,
my one and two guys (players hitting first and second in the
batting order above Jones at No. 3) have done a pretty good job of
getting on these last couple months. Would people be saying the
same things about me if we hadn't had the injuries and hadn't had
the tight pennant race?''
</P>
<P>
   Jones isn't finished. His next double (No. 42) will set an
Atlanta record. Three more home runs _ not inconceivable for a
player with 10 home runs within his past 18 hits _ and Jones
surpasses Hank Aaron's franchise record (47 in 1971). He has
already broken the NL record for homers by a switch-hitter and has
set an Atlanta record with 86 extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who have watched all of the at-bats have been the ones
most awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learns from his previous at-bat,'' teammate Brian Jordan
said. ``He keeps that book in his mind how that particular guy
pitches to him. I'm still learning to do that. I'm just trying to
play off talent alone. The mental side of the game, he's already
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Jones has little left to prove in his career, except
perhaps driving the Braves to another world championship. The last
week may well determine the MVP vote but it will not determine much
about the three weeks that follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The MVP) would be an honor, to say the least,'' Jones said.
``I'm having one of the best years certainly I've ever had. But you
know, it's not first and foremost in mind. I don't go out there
every day saying, `If I have a bad day, I might lose the MVP.' I'm
going out there concentrating on what it's (taking) to win
ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really thinking about it. I think if I was not in a
pennant race, maybe it might get to me somewhere down the road. But
the fact of the matter is the National League East.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true candidate.

 &HT;    Farewell to Tiger Stadium
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On April 20, 1912, Navin Field, which Detroit Tigers
owner Frank Navin had graciously named for himself, opened for
business, and Ty Cobb did the rest. The Tigers beat St. Louis 6-5
in 11 innings. Cobb went for a couple of singles, engineered a pair
of double steals _ he stole home in the Detroit first _ that swayed
the game, the first historic episode in what had become one of
baseball's most historic venues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Navin Field became Briggs Field (for new owner Walter
Briggs), which in 1961 became Tiger Stadium (by somewhat more
modest owner John Fetzer), which after Monday becomes an abandoned
antiquity on the corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues. The
Tigers conclude their last home schedule at the old house against
Kansas City, finishing 87 years of baseball that will not be
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb established his gnarly reputation there. Lou Gehrig played
his first game there, and bowed out of his last. Al Kaline ran down
everything in the gaps. Mark Fidrych redefined flake there. Reggie
Jackson poked one through one of the light towers on the right
field roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feel and an ambience to these old parks that the new
ones don't have,'' said former Tigers third baseman Travis Fryman,
who has six old Tiger Stadium seats installed in his family room.
``This is a great old place.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasize the old, because for all the fans and players that
mourn the old place's passing, a world of others are happy to see
it slip away. It is crumbling and dilapidated and deserves a decent
funeral. Whereas Boston's Fenway Park, opened on the same day,
remains one of the game's true cathedrals, Tiger Stadium' years
have sagged upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of buddies who came in from Chicago,'' recalled
Minnesota pitching coach Rick Strelmaszek. ``And they were watching
the game, and the Detroit fans were rocking. My buddies were in the
first level, and they were drinking beer _ even though it was cold
_ and paint flakes fell into their beer as the people in the second
deck were stomping their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   No park, Wrigley Field included, had deeper grass, a condition
that Jack Morris, with his sinker and the Allan Trammell-Lou
Whitaker middle infield, exploited shamelessly. Baltimore manager
Ray Miller several years ago tested the stuff for camouflage
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a ball, and they put it right between the mound and
second base at the end of batting practice,'' Miller said. ``Nobody
discovered it until about halfway through the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaline remembers when he first saw the place in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first impression was when we came into the old train
station,'' Kaline said. ``I was sitting by Johnny Pesky and he said
we'd be passing the stadium on our way in. It looked almost like a
battleship from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   It still does. And it is sad when a great ship goes down.

NIEUWENDYK FOLLOWING HUMBLE PATH BLAZED BY GREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a mythical concept, void of fanfare, monetary reward, or
even a cheap wall plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I just made it up, kind of like ESPN did with those
absurd ESPYs.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, however, the Rusty Greer Award isn't
important. Here in the Chicken-Fried Kingdom, once you wade through
all the jock egos, and the monster money that drives those egos,
you come to appreciate the rare ``old school'' personalities in
local professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, ``old school'' was used to describe Greer long
before it became a cheesy Madison Avenue advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember exactly, but I think it was former Rangers
general manager Tom Grieve, who some six years ago was thinking
hard in an attempt to give a just-up-from-the minors Greer the
proper compliment. What came out was something about the way this
kid played the game being ``old school.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, has been Greer ever since. No jocks around
here could touch him when it came to being underappreciated,
underpaid, unassumed with the big league spotlight, and in general,
an on-and-off-the-field example of what the public loves.
</P>
<P>
   Greer won the Rusty Greer Award so often it was almost retired.
But this year there's been a sudden news flash.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Rusty Greer Award is not Rusty Greer, due to
no fault of Rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there have been several challengers, including Michael
Finley of the Mavericks. But then Finley's $8 million a year
contract kicked in, and he was eliminated in the underpaid
category. Otherwise, Finley still qualifies in all other good-guy
departments. He's a hard working talent on a bad and basically
forgotten NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   No member of the Cowboys has ever been seriously considered. In
local precincts, no member of the Cowboys is ever underappreciated.
The deep snapper is even a star. So was the blocking fullback.
</P>
<P>
   But because defensive end Greg Ellis will always be defined by
``they took ``him'' instead of Randy Moss,'' it means Ellis remains
obscure. But in reality, he's got the look of a big-time player,
plus, there's off-the-field class galore. And if you're scoring
along at home, Ellis has one more touchdown than Moss this season.
</P>
<P>
   But to replace Rusty Greer as the local winner of the Rusty
Greer Award, you've got to be ultraspecial.
</P>
<P>
   Move it on over, Rusty. Say hello to Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Be voted the NHL's Conn Smythe Trophy as the league's most
valuable player in the Stars' playoff run to the Stanley Cup; have
six game-winning goals in the playoffs; lead the NHL in playoff
goals (11); make the team's second line of
Nieuwendyk-Langenbrunner-Reid the most productive in the playoffs;
do all that, yet very quietly and very humbly concede that the
stars of the Stars are named Modano and Hull. That's Joe
Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very comfortable with my role and with my job,'' he said
last week. ``I don't need the attention. I don't think of it as not
being appreciated on this team. I know in my own mind what I bring
to the team, and I know that's also recognized by the right
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a great player who is often overlooked is one thing. But
for this season, Nieuwendyk will also be underpaid. In the final
season of his contract, Nieuwendyk's salary of $2.6 million is a
steal for the Stars. Both Mike Modano ($6 million) and Brett Hull
($5.5 million) will be paid over twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, who just turned 33, could be kicking and screaming
about renegotiation, but any winner of the Rusty Greer Award is
above such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed the contract. There's a year left on the contract,''
said Nieuwendyk, shrugging. ``I want to stay here. I'd like to
finish my career here. But the contract stuff can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have told Nieuwendyk they want him back. But
negotiations won't take place until the season is over. Do
remember, however, that to start last season, Nieuwendyk was coming
off double knee surgery. His regular season started building in
January and February. By playoff time in the spring, he was fully
healthy and on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will start this season as healthy as I've been in years,''
Nieuwendyk said. Based on that, a return to the 40-goal level (he
had 28 for the regular season last year) is a strong possibility.
The Stars might be sorry they didn't get a contract extension done
over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what the Rusty Greer Award is all about _ being
underpaid, underappreciated and whine-free. Joe Nieuwendyk fits in
all categories. nn

 &HT;    No ground zero: Falcons' target St. Louis
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It wasn't supposed to be like this, the Falcons 0-2
and reeling, minus their big-money running back, and with so many
problems popping up that trying to get on a winning track almost
seems like a secondary focus.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIII is still in the rear-view mirror, but it seems
like a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons try the Rams (1-0) today in perhaps the most
important September game in franchise history, the good news is
that quarterback Chris Chandler is likely to return from his
strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much of the country seems ready to write off the Falcons
since running back Jamal Anderson is out for the season with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Anderson is merely saying what's politically correct,
he's not among the doomsayers.
</P>
<P>
   He's mindful of the fact his primary replacement, the smaller (5
feet 11, 200-pound) and quicker Byron Hanspard, just three years
ago rushed for 2,084 yards at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Hanspard missed all of last season after a
serious left knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're two very different runners, and I think ... our offense
will try to include more things that are Byron's strengths,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that accomplished what he did in college, rushing for
2,000 yards in a season, is capable of getting the job done. I hope
he doesn't break my records right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Hanspard to plow between the tackles two dozen
times, like Anderson sometimes did. He'll get a few cracks, but
more of his action will swing wide, and second-year back Ken
Oxendine (6-0, 230) will get some of the dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though it's not like Chandler to agree with the
common-sense approach, even he concedes that Anderson's absence
could place more pressure on him and the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be if we can't run the ball,'' he said.
``Sometimes, teams pass to loosen things up for the run game
(instead of the other way around). San Francisco has done that for
years, partly because they're usually receiver-rich, and
runner-poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, though, are not receiver-rich, in part because
speedy Tony Martin was waived.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the defense is playing well, allowing just 17
points per game, one point better than in the Super Bowl season.
The offense, though, has been erratic, and seven turnovers have set
up 31 of the opponents' 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense has to get it going, and they can,'' linebacker
Henri Crockett said. ``It's not up to me to get mad at them because
I don't know what's going on on the offensive side of the ball.
I've got enough problems on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There are problems off the field, too, something the Falcons did
not face last season.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts have become a contentious issue with some of the
agents for nine starters, including defensive end Lester
Archambeau, who can become restricted and unrestricted free agents
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lester is like the Rodney Dangerfield of the Falcons,'' said
Archambeau's agent, Alan Herman. ``He doesn't get any respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything became surreal in the middle of the week when ESPN
took comments made by coach Dan Reeves, and edited them to make it
look as though he said Anderson's injury was attributable to his
14-day contract holdout in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't appear to be what Reeves meant, but Anderson fell
for the ESPN version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all took it as a shot,'' said Ali Anderson, one of his
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the gloom, the Falcons are not dead.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC, and NFC West are lame.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit running back Barry Sanders retired, wide receiver Herman
Moore is injured, and second-year quarterback Charlie Batch is at
the helm. Yet, the Lions are 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 season, the Falcons started 1-7, yet entered the
15th game with a mathematical shot at making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope, particularly if the Falcons can hang onto the
ball for a change, and get a few takeaways, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no team in the league good enough to turn the ball
over, and not control the clock and win,'' defensive end Chuck
Smith said. ``There's a lot of parity. I don't see the '78 Steelers
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   No last season's Falcons, either.

 &HT;    Challenge for Buick is keeping big names
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the need for a post-Ryder Cup respite has
removed some prominent names from this week's $1.8 million Buick
Challenge field, the tournament will not lack news value or star
quality beginning Thursday at Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of golf's spectrum, the tournament has four Ryder
Cup players and coach Ben Crenshaw in the field.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, also playing is John Daly, dropped last week
by Callaway Golf _ whose frustrated CEO, Ely Callaway, comes from
nearby LaGrange _ for violating stipulations of his contract that
prohibit gambling or drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Although executive director Dick Ellis presumed he would be
seeing seven Ryder Cup players at the Mountain View course,
reconsidering after verbal commitments and pulling out before
Friday night's deadline were David Duval, Payne Stewart and Hal
Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Still in the field, which last year was the 13th best in golf,
are Brookline participants Davis Love III of Sea Island, the 1997
champion; Justin Leonard, Jeff Maggert and Steve Pate.
</P>
<P>
   Also playing are 13 of the top 30 money winners (eight of the
top 20) and a list that includes defending and two-time champion
Steve Elkington of Australia, Atlanta's Stewart Cink and Billy
Andrade, England's Nick Faldo, almost-Ryder Cup player Bob Estes,
Bob Tway, Paul Azinger, Curtis Strange and Glen Day.
</P>
<P>
   Recently turned pro Ryuji Imada of Georgia and 1998 U.S. Amateur
champion Hank Kuehne are playing, along with Northwestern's Luke
Donald, the 1999 Fred Haskins Award winner, who received a sponsor
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is pretty darn close to last year,'' Ellis said.
``The Ryder Cup is tough (to overcome). We'd love to have a couple
more of them, but we feel good about things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View Course is in typically fabulous condition,
after being closed since Sept. 13. It is regularly voted as one of
the most popular courses by PGA Tour players.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's presence might be surprising in that he just last week
declared that he can no longer function without drinking and
gambling. He was dropped by Callaway after refusing to enter a
treatment facility.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1991 PGA and 1995 British Open champion has a good
reason to play. He needs the money. Daly, 33, has millions in
gambling losses and was fired from a contract that had $3 million
in remaining compensation through 2001. He owns a monthly
obligation of near $40,000 for mortgage, alimony and child support
payments.
</P>
<P>
   His severance from Callaway was not surprising considering
reports that Daly had been drinking at the Irish Open last month
and seen gambling in Las Vegas.

CRENSHAW FOLLOWS A HUNCH ON LINEUP  
 A TARGET PLAYER IS BEATEN  
 WOODS OFF ON HIS DRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It sounded like a foregone conclusion. When
Jeff Maggert came off the 18th green at The Country Club on
Saturday after teaming with Hal Sutton for a stirring victory in
the first morning match, he was asked about going out again for an
afternoon four-ball match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Five matches is a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Maggert was a spectator Saturday afternoon as the
U.S. captain, Ben Crenshaw, sent out Justin Leonard with Sutton,
despite the fact that Maggert and Sutton had been the Americans'
most consistent and successful pairing. Explained Crenshaw, ``I
have a hunch about Justin Leonard.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no guesswork involving Maggert and Sutton. They scored
the only U.S. victory on Friday, in the morning foursomes, or
alternate shot, competition. After losing a four-ball match in the
afternoon, they came back Saturday morning and knocked off Europe's
undisputed leader, Colin Montgomerie, and his partner, Paul Lawrie,
in a key foursomes match.
</P>
<P>
   If like personalities and golf games make for a successful
pairing, then Sutton and Maggert seem like obvious partners. They
are the epitome of steadiness and consistency, especially off the
tee, and set each other up well. When the Americans practiced here
late last month, the American captains asked whether Sutton and
Maggert would feel good about playing with each other, and they
did, getting an early taste of their partnership at Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here this week realizing that's what we wanted to
do,'' said Sutton, ``so we practiced together all week and we're
comfortable playing with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As pro golfers, of course, they keep a little bit of the
spectacular in reserve. They drew on it at just the right time
Saturday morning, with Maggert sinking a 25-footer on the 17th hole
to go 1 up, and then sticking his approach shot to a foot and a
half on No. 18 to close out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal drove it perfect there on the last hole,'' Maggert said,
``leaving me with perfect yardage for a 7-iron.'' An almost-perfect
pairing. Until Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A Target Player Is Beaten
</P>
<P>
   In winning the first match Saturday morning, the United States
cracked ``the rock,'' the first step in what they hoped would be a
wholesale crumbling of the European team.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they finally beat Colin Montgomerie, the undisputed
leader of the Europeans, the first man out for them in each round,
taking the point in hostile territory. Despite his noted testiness
with American crowds, which surfaced again Saturday morning,
Montgomerie, the 36-year-old Scot, had played superbly. ``Like a
rock'' said Paul Lawrie, his playing partner in every round .
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie has seemed determined to succeed almost in defiance
of the Brookline galleries, which have treated him with a tough,
competitive edge or a striking lack of civility, depending on your
viewpoint. On Friday he complained to an official who several times
called out the incorrect winner of the hole, and stepped away from
putts from time to time to let the crowd calm down.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the strained relations continued, as Montgomerie
stared into the crowd several times, irritated by a camera flash or
an extended roar for the Americans. At the sixth, he stepped away
several times at the par-4 sixth hole as he waited to putt, then
finally stepped up to make the putt. He told Hal Sutton as they
walked off that the crowd's actions only made him more determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want them to call out to Colin,'' Sutton said. ``What
I wanted them to do is get behind us a little bit more. I want the
best for the European team. I don't want anyone to treat them
negatively. `'
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie is the No. 3 player in the world rankings, but has
never won on U.S. soil, and has had problems with what he felt were
overzealous galleries. On Saturday morning, it was Sutton and
Maggert who gave him the most trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Woods Off on His Drives
</P>
<P>
   Before the competition started, there was much speculation about
whether Tiger Woods would try to drive the short, par-4 sixth hole.
At 310 yards, it is reachable, but all the players carry, because
of a row of bunkers that protect the front of the green. Woods had
said it would depend on the wind, and the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the situation was right, in Woods' mind, in each of the
first three rounds. Each time, standing on the tee, Woods pulled
out his driver and launched into a long, arcing swing with the
power that only he can bring to it.
</P>
<P>
   The results were hardly spectacular. In Friday's foursomes, he
flew long past the pin into the light rough, and he and his
partner, Tom Lehman, ended up making bogey and losing the hole. It
was a turning point as Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik, 2 down at
that point, won the hole and went on to win the match. In the
afternoon, Woods blocked his drive way right and was out of the
hole, leaving it to his partner, David Duval, to tie the hole, and
they, too, went on to lose.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, playing with Steve Pate, Woods blasted his
drive into the wet rough on the left, and again the Americans lost
the hole, although they held on to win the match.

VYING FOR METS TICKETS WITH FINGERS CROSSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's tough being a Mets fan these days.
</P>
<P>
   First, the team hits the skids, putting its playoff hopes in
doubt. Then Saturday, to add to the pain, Mets management opened
its playoff ticket sales at Shea Stadium by selling the very first
batch to Joe Garruba, a die-hard Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to trade them for Yankees tickets,'' bragged
Garruba, 27, of Bethpage, N.Y., clad in a Yankees jacket and
Yankees cap, as he held up his seven tickets for the news cameras.
``Don't miss the Yankees logo,'' he instructed the photographers
jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   Overhearing all this, Mets fans waiting in line behind Garruba
began loudly volunteering their thoughts on Garruba's wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   But, aside from a few shouts of ``Go Mets!'' the fans behind the
blue police barricades at the stadium Saturday morning proved to be
a mostly somber bunch. Losing has that effect on people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fan here has faith that the Mets will make the
playoffs,'' said John Hammer, 17, of Brooklyn, who arrived at the
stadium at 3 a.m. with two friends. ``Valentine might choke,'' he
added, referring to the Mets acerbic manager, ``but the Mets
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a days-long buildup of fans camping overnight, the Mets
offered chances to buy playoff tickets through a lottery system, in
which Met, the team mascot, randomly selected numbered balls from a
large bin. The balls corresponded to numbers on the wristbands
arriving Mets fans received.
</P>
<P>
   But by 10 a.m., when ticket windows slid open and police
officers began funneling Mets fans through a series of narrow
chutes and barricaded holding pens leading to the windows, not all
that many Mets fans were around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were equipped for about 2,500, and I'd say there's only
1,300 here,'' said Eddie Enterlin, a Mets employee directing the
human traffic in front of Gate C Saturday. Asked about the dearth
of bodies on this, a usually frenetic first day of playoff ticket
sales, Enterlin shrugged. ``They're watching the scoreboard, these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most fans buying tickets at the stadium Saturday said they would
simply get refunds if the team misses the playoffs altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of horrified that they're maybe not going to make
it,'' Dennis Guyadeen said after buying four tickets for the first
home playoff game (if there is one). ``I don't know how they lost
to Philadelphia yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they lost steam,'' said Guyadeen's friend, Sylvester
Harriett, of Patterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets gave out a trophy to the most devoted fan, Kenneth
Reese, 24, of Ozone Park would probably win it.
</P>
<P>
   Between 8 p.m. Thursday and shortly after 10 a.m. Saturday,
Reese lived on a small red lawn chair outside Gate C, commiserating
with police officers, listening to his portable radio and getting
to know a few other ``wackos,'' as other Mets fans called the
sleep-over crowd.
</P>
<P>
   His booty: eight field-level tickets, at $40 each, and a
sunburned nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge Met fan,'' Reese, in a Mets jersey and Mets cap,
said, still clutching his red chair and his Mets blanket. ``It's
the only team I'll do this for. It's my life, my love.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Garruba, the Yankees fan who had arrived at only
6:30 a.m. Saturday and still got to the ticket window first, Reese
shook his head in disgust and said, ``It made me sick.''

 &HT;    Brother crew chiefs on front row
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Jerry Nadeau's stunning crash in ``Happy Hour''
practice on Saturday evening caused a history-making moment for
today's MBNA Gold 400 to lose its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau offically will line up at the No. 2 position next to pole
sitter Rusty Wallace. Nadeau's crew chief is Ryan Pemberton, and
Wallace's team is directed by Robin Pemberton, his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time in NASCAR's 51-year history that
brothers who are crew chiefs have their cars starting on the front
row together at a Winston Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nadeau's stay up front won't last long. Because Nadeau
has to use a backup car, he must drop to the back of the pack
during the final warm-up lap before the green flag is waved.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau's accident during the last practice session was
heartbreaking for the No. 36 team, which is co-owned by Atlantans
Read Morton, Nelson Bowers and Tom Beard. Nadeau lost control of
the car on the front stretch and collided into the inside retainer
wall. He was uninjured and finished practice in the backup car.
</P>
<P>
   The Pembertons have been competing against each other since
their childhood in Ballaston Spa, N.Y., and say nothing will change
for the historic race day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perfect way for (today) to end would be for us to win the
race and Rusty get his 50th (career) win and for those guys to
probably run second or third,'' said Robin, who is 13 years older
than Ryan. ``I've got the pull for (Wallace's teammate, Jeremy
Mayfield) too, but somewhere in that mix would probably be one of
the greater days in my life for sure.''

 &HT;    Younger Petty's wreck has clan fuming
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Casey Atwood was the winner of the MBNA 200 on
Saturday, but the Busch race will be more remembered for what
happened before the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The event featured two controversial wrecks, including one that
ignited an angry exhange of words between third-place finisher Jeff
Green and NASCAR's most famous family.
</P>
<P>
   On lap 181, Green appeared to bump into the rear of Adam Petty,
grandson of legendary driver Richard Petty. The younger Petty, who
was running third at the time, was sent spinning into the outside
wall and then rolled back down the track, where he was T-boned by
Mike Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   Petty was taken by ambulance to Dover's Kent Hospital and
complained of soreness in the areas of the ribs, elbows, and hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit disappointed with the way (Green) handled
himself out there,'' said fuming father Kyle Petty. ``I guess that
is why Jeff Green doesn't have a Winston Cup car ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Green, ``(Petty) was using his foot instead of his head
a little bit, I think. I'm not going to spin out anyone in any
shape or form, especially at Dover.''
</P>
<P>
   The other incident involved the two top drivers in the Busch
points standings, leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth. They
were battling it out side-by-side for the lead on lap 120 when
Earnhardt ran into Kenseth, who wrecked and did not return to the
race. Earnhardt, who repeatedly apologized for the accident, had
brake problems the rest of the way and finished 33rd, gaining only
10 points on Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end?
</P>
<P>
   Today's MBNA Gold 400 should reveal more information on Ray
Evernham's future as crew chief for Jeff Gordon. Will mechanic
Brian Whitesell make the race-day calls in place of Evernham? Will
Evernham step down as crew chief after the race or wait until the
end of the season?
</P>
<P>

   Racing death
</P>
<P>
   As usual with a racing death, the fatal accident of Kevin
Gobrecht in a World of Outlaws event on Friday night in Eagle,
Neb., sent shock waves through the Dover garage area. Gobrecht was
operating a sprint car owned by Busch driver Dave Blaney, who
requested no interviews Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Unfortunately, death can be the) nature of the beast,'' Ward
Burton said. ``Everybody knows we try to go fast, we run our
vehicles on the ragged edge a lot of times and things happen around
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my life being cut short would be... I'd leave things
undone that I would want to accomplish in my life. The biggest
(worry) is that my children would not have a father and my wife
wouldn't have a husband. I think all the drivers tend to position
things so that our family is protected in case of a career-ending
accident or (death).''

   The Winston Cup schedule for the 2000 season is being held up
while last-minute TV broadcast rights are being finalized. The
following year's schedule is traditionally released in early
September. ``I have to be honest _ we're a little bit behind,''
NASCAR czar Mike Helton said, ``but we're anxious to get it out so
that everybody knows what the deal is. We've simply been working on
a lot of details, and those details take time. Sometimes we're not
as punctual as we'd like to be, but we're very near to putting it
out.''... Ward Burton said he is ``just now 100 percent'' after
recovering from a concussion at the Michigan race on Aug. 22...
Darrell Waltrip and Todd Bodine were among five drivers failing to
earn a spot in today's race.

EARNEST HOBERECHT, POPULAR NOVELIST IN OCCUPIED JAPAN, IS DEAD AT
81 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Japan)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earnest Hoberecht, an American who became a major literary
figure in Japan just after World War II on the strength of some
romance novels he wrote in a matter of weeks, died Wednesday at an
Oklahoma City hospital. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Hoberecht (pronounced HO-bright) turned a Tokyo assignment for
United Press International as a correspondent and news executive
into an improbable literary success story by filling a void created
by a ban on American books.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was imposed by the U.S. Army out of fear that books like
Sinclair Lewis' ``Main Street'' that were critical of U.S. society
might lead to Japanese derision of Americans, with possible
political repercussions back home.
</P>
<P>
   But by writing novels in English and having them immediately
translated into Japanese, Hoberecht became, for a little over two
years, the best-known, and virtually the only, American writer
available in Japan as it rebuilt itself and its society under the
Allied occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Hoberecht had hundreds of thousands of fans, many of them young
women eager to learn how an American man might address matters of
the heart. In a long magazine article about Hoberecht, the author
James Michener said Japanese students often asked whether Hoberecht
was better than Hemingway. He said one scholar had asked him to
compare Hoberecht's writing with that of Jean-Paul Sartre.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Hoberecht wrote news articles and tried to recruit Asian
subscribers for the wire service, United Press International. He
wrote his novels after 5:30 p.m., generally by dictating to a
secretary. A translator who had won considerable local attention
with a Japanese version of ``Gone With the Wind'' then put it into
Japanese. Hoberecht many times suggested that his success was
partly due to the graceful style of the translation.
</P>
<P>
   One of his early successes was ``Tokyo Romance,'' published in
1946. It told of an American correspondent based in Japan falling
in love with a Japanese movie star. The affair had to be secret
because her studio forbade such fraternization. There was a murder
and other complications, but the most popular part of the book was
the description of a kiss, which Time magazine said at the time
went into ``great quivering detail.'' Kissing, if done at all at
that time in Japan, was a very private thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his own well-publicized kiss that had first brought
Hoberecht to Japan's attention. As retold in Collier's magazine,
Hoberecht had visited a movie set with the intention of kissing
Hideko Mimura, a highly regarded actress. He told her that Gen.
Douglas MacArthur had suggested that kissing in movies would be ``a
step toward democratization.'' When he kissed her, she immediately
fainted. It was sensational national news.
</P>
<P>
   The Collier's article suggested that the success of ``Tokyo
Diary'' resulted from the publicity. The book quickly sold 300,000
copies and would have sold more except for a paper shortage,
contemporary reports said. ``The Japanese women were crazy to find
out how American men made love,'' Hoberecht told Michener.
</P>
<P>
   When the book was published in America, however, the response
was disappointing, from reviewers to buyers. Life magazine called
it ``the worst novel of modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was all the Japanese response favorable. One reviewer
compared the novel unfavorably to modern Russian works and
concluded, ``The people of America must be intellectual midgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hoberecht went on to write ``Tokyo Romance,'' which in
many ways resembled ``Tokyo Diary,'' in just 27 days. Michener
wrote that Hoberecht then wrote to his parents in Oklahoma for
writing he had done in his boyhood and college years. This resulted
in ``Unpublished Short Stories of Earnest Hoberecht.'' Then came
``Shears of Destiny,'' a novel he had written before the war and
could not publish in the United States. His last book before the
ban on American books was rescinded was ``Democratic Etiquette,''
which included some suggestions on how to kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Hoberecht was born on Jan. 1, 1918, in Watonga, Okla., where he
grew up. He earned a journalism degree from Oklahoma University,
then worked as a reporter for The Memphis Press-Scimitar. He quit
to go to Hawaii to work as a laborer at Pearl Harbor, then became
editor of the Pearl Harbor Bulletin, the Navy Yard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   United Press hired him to cover the war, and he spent most of
his time with the Fast Carrier Task Force. After the war he rose to
general manager for Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his hometown in 1966. There he ran a number of
family businesses, including an insurance company and a title
company. His writing was restricted to occasional letters to the
editor complaining about low wheat prices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he found himself sitting at a local lunch counter next
to Mary Ann Shaklee Karns. They each had four children from a
previous marriage, and they were married seven months later. She
remembers contemplating having a home with eight children and
telling him, ``We should get the Medal of Honor for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoberecht is survived by his wife; his four children, Tony
Hoberecht, of Tulsa, Trevar Hoberecht III, of Las Vegas, Nev.,
Nathalie Kitson of Edmond, Okla., and Shelley Hoberecht Spaeth, of
Watonga; his stepchildren, Mona Loudon, of Oklahoma City, Anita
Cowan, of Watonga, Brett Karns, of Watonga, and Bruce Karns, of
Yukon, Okla.; a sister, Jeanne Hoberecht Mills, of Lafayette, La.;
and 17 grandchildren.

FINALLY, A CHANCE FOR EVERYONE TO GET INTO IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ They sit and wait and cheer, just like the
galleries that have given the European Ryder Cup team a sense of
belonging at The Country Club this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For European team members Andrew Coltart, Jarmo Sandelin, and
Jean Van de Velde, all of whom sat out for the second consecutive
day Saturday, it was patience, patience, patience. All will play in
Sunday's individual matches.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a solid lead on the first day, European captain
Mark James did not want to disturb the team's chemistry. So the
trio had to play cheerleader again.
</P>
<P>
   If the Europeans were trailing and the teams weren't working out
well, there might be some grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans have made this a team game. All for one and
one for all seems to mean more to the members of the European team,
who were given little chance to retain the Ryder Cup before the
matches started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team game,'' said Van de Velde. ``It's not an
individual ego track. The captain picks the pairings he feels most
confident with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just play one game and put a point on the board, it would
be great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always expect to play,'' Van de Velde said. ``If they want
me, I will be there. I'm ready. All I care about is carrying that
cup around on Sunday night.''

A GOOD MORNING'S REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw's selection of
Tom Lehman and Phil Mickelson for four-ball proved to be a good
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Both sat out the morning foursomes and were more rested than
opponents Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke, who were playing their
fourth round in 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw had hoped Lehman and Mickelson would get off to a fast
start and lead the way to a US afternoon sweep, something that
hadn't happened since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put numbers up there so that the rest of the team
could see it and spur them on,'' said Lehman. ``You've got to give
my partner credit. I started slowly and he carried me until I got
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's hunch paid off as the Americans rode to a 2-and-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were steady, never letting their opponents win a
hole until 16, when they stood dormie.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson and Lehman were paired during the 1997 Ryder Cup at
Valderrama, Spain where they earned two halves. It was a happy
reunion. They started the afternoon off right for the Americans,
going 1-up on the third hole.
</P>
<P>
   Before the match, Crenshaw took Mickelson aside for a talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Phil this afternoon to trust his putting stroke,''
Crenshaw said. ``I told him, `Make a sweep and hit it solid.' All
he needs to do is for one or two to go down and he's off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who missed short putts on Friday afternoon that
contributed to a four-ball loss, sported a new putter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a different look, something to gain confidence with.
I've carried it in my bag and have done this before,'' said
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   The putts went down for Mickelson on the front nine to help give
the Americans a 2-up lead at the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was the only player in the match to hit the third
green in regulation when he knocked a 180-yard 5-iron to 25 feet.
While others were scrambling to make par, Mickelson drained his
putt for a birdie-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson put his team 2-up on the eighth hole when he rolled in
a 15-foot downhiller from the back fringe.
</P>
<P>
   The European duo put on a charge on the par-5 ninth when Clarke
knocked his second shot onto the green. He lagged his sidehill putt
to 3 feet for a sure birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mickelson was in the high rough and Lehman was on the
back fringe. Lehman imitated Mickelson's feat on No. 8 by draining
the tricky downhiller before putting on a fist-pumping exhibition
that resembled the Funky Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody was laughing; they were the only Americans leading
their match.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum carried to the next hole where Mickelson nearly
holed his approach shot and was treated to a bear hug by Lehman.
The Europeans conceded the birdie and the Americans walked from the
green 3-up.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood and Clarke made things interesting on No. 16. Both
Lehman and Mickelson had the opportunity to make matching-winning
birdie putts, but neither came through, and Clarke drained a
15-footer from the back fringe to keep the match alive.
</P>
<P>
   On 17, Clarke and Westwood had putts for birdie and a chance to
extend the match to the 18th. But they missed, Westwood's last
attempt hitting the hole and squirting out.

CHANGE OF PUTTERS HELPS MICKELSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Just like Friday, when he missed two critical
putts, Phil Mickelson was tentative as he stood over a 25-foot
birdie putt on the third hole Saturday afternoon. He backed away,
the uncertainty evident on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Then, his lips pursed, Mickelson stepped up to the ball and
stroked it into the hole, giving himself and partner Tom Lehman the
first lead of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Mickelson's nerve and Lehman's steel, it was an
advantage they never relinquished. The American team took the first
match of the afternoon, beating Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke, 2
and 1.
</P>
<P>
   Again on the short, par-4 eighth, Mickelson _ who changed
putters overnight _ calmly dropped in a 15-footer for another
birdie to put the Americans 2 up. The US captain, Ben Crenshaw, all
but leaped onto the green to thump Mickelson on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   After Lehman rolled in a downhill 30-footer for a birdie to
halve the par-5 ninth hole, Lehman nearly hit the pin with his
second shot on the par-4 10th. But his ball spun 6 feet from the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that wasn't good enough for Mickelson. From 131
yards, Lehman took out a wedge, and all but holed the shot: His
ball stopped 2 inches above the cup. The birdie, conceded, gave the
Americans a 3-up lead. It was a lead that survived a European
challenge on the par-5 14th when Mickelson halved the hole with a
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mickelson played a better round of golf on Friday _
except for the short putts he missed at 16 and 18 _ Lehman said
afterward that his partner's play Saturday was phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He held me up when I was really struggling,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, too, gave the men a boost with constant shouts of
encouragement. But no spectator gave Mickelson more of a boost than
Dave Gannon, a 32-year-old golf professional from the Golf Club at
San Leandro in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   When Mickelson hit his second shot over the green at 13, and
behind a square boulder that was not embedded in the ground, Gannon
obligingly stepped forward, picked up the boulder and moved it
aside. Mickelson chipped his shot through the green, but he holed
another chip from 30 feet to halve the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his solid play, Mickelson said after the match concluded
on 17 that he and Lehman could have closed out the Europeans
earlier had they made more putts.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who missed a 4-foot birdie putt at 13 that would have
put the Americans 4 up, clapped his partner on the back, and said,
``We might have won 7 and 6 if i'd made any putts.''

EUROPEANS STEADY IN THEIR DOMINANCE OF WOOD, PATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The match swayed back and fourth all
afternoon, and in the end it swayed toward Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Posting birdies on two of the last four holes, Colin Montgomerie
and Paul Lawrie bested the US pair of Tiger Woods and Steve Pate, 2
and 1, in their four-ball (best-ball) competition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans began aggressively, just as they had in their
morning foursomes (alternate-shot) match against Miguel Angel
Jimenez and Padraig Harrington, again carding a birdie on the first
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Pate performed the early heroics, chipping in from to send an
immediate message to Montgomerie and Lawrie that this was going to
be just as tough a match as the British duo had had with Hal Sutton
and Jeff Maggert in the morning foursome match.
</P>
<P>
   But by the third hole the Europeans had squared the match, as
Montgomerie rolled in a 12-foot putt on the 451-yard par-4 after
Pate and Woods had missed birdie chances.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie's putter stayed hot on the 335-yard, par-4 fourth,
where he almost routinely sank a 10-foot putt for another birdie.
Woods then missed his from 9 feet, giving the Europeans the hole.
</P>
<P>
   But then it was Pate who got hot, making birdies on the sixth
and seventh, the latter courtesy of a marvelous 5-iron to 2 feet,
and the US was 1 up.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. On the 378-yard, par-4 eighth hole, Montgomerie
sank another 10-footer from above the hole to square the match once
again.
</P>
<P>
   As the last foursome of the afternoon moved to the back nine,
the round was looking like a basketball game, with scoring surges
and lead changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans went ahead again on the 447-yard, par-4 10th hole
when Montgomerie almost holed his second shot from 177 yards, then
tapped in for a birdie. The Americans almost halved the hole,
however, as Woods's gallant chip from just off the green rolled to
within 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Europe, once again.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's self-confidence _ or perhaps overconfidence _ almost
hurt him on the 11th. With Pate safely in the fairway, Woods chose
driver instead of 3-wood and pulled his tee shot into the woods,
194 yards from the hole. However, his brilliance got him out of
trouble, as he hit a low flier that hooked over the pond, landed in
light rough, and rolled onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   The shot apparently shook up Montgomerie, who badly pulled his
second shot, putting the pressure on Lawrie, who responded with a
brilliant shot that flew over the pin and settled 10 feet past.
</P>
<P>
   Next it was Pate's turn, and he was up for the challenge. He hit
a 6-iron to just outside of Lawrie's, giving the Americans two
legitimate birdie attempts to the Europeans' one.
</P>
<P>
   Pate missed his, as did Wood, but Lawrie as well. The Europeans
were still 1 up headed to the 486-yard, par-4 12th, the most
difficult hole on the course.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans took advantage. Both Woods and Pate reached the
green in two on their way to pars, while Montgomerie and Lawrie
failed to reach the green in regulation, then missed long par
putts. The US pair had squared the match once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had an opportunity to take the lead on the
534-yard, par-5 14th when Woods put his second shot 10 feet above
the pin, but his eagle attempt rolled just past.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie kept the pressure up on the 432-yard, par-4 15th,
rolling in a 15-foot birdie putt after Woods and Pate had missed
theirs. The Europeans were 1 up with three to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans went dormie on the 186-yard, par-3 16th. Lawrie
hit his tee shot 3 feet from the pin for a birdie, putting the
pressure on the Americans. First, Pate's drive hit the crown of the
green but didn't release to the hole the way Lawrie's had. Then
Woods put his tee shot into the gallery on the right.
</P>
<P>
   When Pate missed his putt, the Americans were done.

NATIONS QUESTION UN'S PROPER ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary General Kofi Annan's plea last week
for the world to help bring peace to forgotten corners of Africa
appears headed for a test as early as Tuesday with a plan to send
6,000 peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, a place scarred by a new horror
of war, mass amputations.
</P>
<P>
   And looming ahead for the UN Security Council may be a second
test, a proposal to send an astoundingly large force of 15,000 to
20,000 troops to broker a shaky peace in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, which until recently was a battlefield in which nine
separate nations or rebel forces had squared off.
</P>
<P>
   The UN peacekeeping force now numbers 13,335 troops, and the two
plans proposed for the African nations could nearly triple the size
of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Debates on these two plans _ at the same time the UN is gearing
up to administer Kosovo and East Timor, as well as possible peace
efforts in Angola and along the Eritrea-Ethiopia border _ would
help determine the outcome of wars for years to come. It may signal
whether the United Nations will become a central mediator or a
ceremonial bystander. It could clarify whether the United States,
the world's sole superpower, might be stuck as its supercop as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And, the UN debate would give Africa a fresh answer about the
depth of the commitment of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   After Annan's dramatic appeal, President Clinton called on
nations to take a ``shared responsibility'' to end warfare because,
he said, America could not intervene everywhere. But he kept the
door slightly ajar, saying no country should be ``indifferent to
the destruction of innocents in any part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's speech, which kicked off the 54th General Assembly, grew
out of broadly felt frustrations from around the world since the
1994 genocide in Rwanda that UN and US responses were far quicker
to white people's wars and far slower to battles involving people
of color. For weeks in 1994, the United States blocked UN action in
Rwanda, where more than a half-million people were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general envisioned a new world order that put the
UN Security Council as the chief arbiter of disputes; nations
assuming more of an international conscience rather than strictly
following their own strategic interests; and borders offering no
defense for states that commit atrocities against its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   He had barely finished speaking from the dais before others
began the debate. Some Western leaders applauded Annan. China,
Russia and some African leaders were sharply critical, saying it
smacked of colonialism and hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's speech raised more questions than answers: Who will pay?
Is the United Nations capable of dramatically expanding
peacekeeping operations? How long should the operations last?
Should peacekeepers be given liberal rules of self-defense? Should
future UN missions take on more tasks?
</P>
<P>
   ``The world doesn't change 180 degrees overnight,'' Edward
Mortimer, Annan's chief speechwriter, said in an interview. ``The
secretary general is trying to capture a direction for change. . .
. There has to be a degree of consistency about it. If you are
prepared to pull out all the stops in Kosovo and Haiti, and you do
nothing for people in Africa, it takes the edge off of the
moralistic gloss you are are putting on your actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The test on Africa also depends on African nations, of course.
No proposal for peacekeepers in the Congo, the former Zaire, will
go forward until all the nations involved in that war give security
guarantees. And no UN force will go into Angola or the
Eritrea-Ethiopia border until there is a declared peace.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve center for peacekeeping operations is tucked into the
southeastern corner of the 32rd floor at UN headquarters. There, in
the Situation Center, intelligence specialists track what may be
the world body's most dangerous assignments.
</P>
<P>
   They conduct live video conferences on split TV screens, talk on
secure phones tucked inside briefcases, and send and receive coded
cables in the 24-hour-a-day Duty Room. After the Kosovo war, for
instance, supervisors held almost daily discussions beamed onto
their TV sets, often from Geneva, Rome, and Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sent its first peacekeeping force to
Jerusalem in June 1948 in the midst of the Arab-Israeli war. The
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization is still there,
although its mission is far different. Now it supports UN forces in
the Golan Heights and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 51 years since, the Security Council has authorized 49
peacekeeping operations, 36 of them in the last 11 years. Wearing
UN blue helmets or berets, usually only lightly armed for
self-defense, peacekeepers have become far more than just a wall
between combatants. Now they are police officers, civilian
administrations, and election observers, among other things. During
an upswing in activity in 1993, the missions included 70,000
peacekeepers, at a cost of $4 billion. Current operations cost
slightly under $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many successes, including 1988, when UN
peacekeeping operations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But
recent failures also loom large, including missions to Somalia and
Bosnia in which scores of peacekeepers were killed or injured.
Critics say the Security Council failed to give those peacekeepers
adequate rules of engagement, or even funds.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is last year's UN retreat from Angola. Alex
Vines, who wrote a scathing review of UN operations in Angola for
Human Rights Watch, said UN observers lost credibility there
because they refused to apportion blame for past abuses. ``The core
problem really in Angola was a lack of political will. They didn't
want to rock the boat,'' said Vines in a telephone interview from
London. ``The UN was regarded with disdain there. It turned out to
be a paper tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest problem for future UN peacekeeping missions
isn't likely to be past critiques.
</P>
<P>
   Money's the trouble. Finding enough troops also could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are going to have a UN capable of operating
globally with all the international conflicts that we will see in
the future,'' said Richard H. Shultz, a national security
specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University. ``They don't have the resources and capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Shultz also said that the Clinton administration will be
reluctant to commit many resources to missions in Africa in part
because deployments in Bosnia and Kosovo are likely to last years
and cost billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the president and you're going to contribute 5,000
troops to the Congo? I don't think so,'' Shultz said. ``This is
where Kofi Annan is going to have his problems.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Africa remains a ``key priority'' for Clinton, but said the
president has not made any decisions about sending US peacekeepers
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the US has 376 people on UN missions, ranking No. 14
in the world. Only five of them are soldiers; most are police
officers. The United States, the largest contributor to UN
peacekeeping, lags far behind in its contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, it has paid $50 million toward a $570
million assessment. That is part of US arrears to the United
Nations, which total more than $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to make a decision on future US deployment based on
our interests, capability, and our resources,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer, Annan's speechwriter, said nations will closely watch
the US role in future missions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about US reluctance to commit troops, he said, ``We have
to be a bit careful. I'm sure no American would want to imply that
it doesn't matter a how many Africans or Yugoslavs . . . are
killed, as long as no American peacekeepers are killed.''

GORE, BRADLEY AUDITION BEFORE THE DNC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and Bill Bradley took their presidential
campaigns Saturday to the Democratic National Committee, and
offered them more a choice of personalities than a clash of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who spoke first at the fall meeting of the committee,
was greeted with prolonged chants of ``Brad-Lee, Brad-Lee'' when he
stepped to the podium. Gore took the more unconventional route,
striding briskly from the rear of the hotel ballroom, shaking hands
and kissing familiar faces, as ``Love Train,'' the 1973 pop hit by
the O'Jays, blared from the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   While neither candidate appeared to have switched people's votes
Saturday, the joint appearance of the two men pointed out that a
genuine, although still civil, contest is shaping up for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to energize voters, from my perspective, than
a contest that brings two people together for a spirited debate of
ideas, a real contest with real choices decided by voters in
caucuses and primaries across this nation?'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While Bradley used the DNC meeting to answer questions about
why he would challenge Gore for the nomination, Gore tried to leave
the impression that he had stuck it out to fight the tough battles
against Republicans. This was an implied contrast to Bradley, who
quit the Senate in 1997, declaring that politics were``broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the Democrats that neither he nor they had ``walked
way from a challenge,'' but that they had stayed and fought. ``I
look at people here and everyone of you, back home, you're fighting
in the trenches, and you're working all the time to make it the way
it's supposed to be because you care,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   While known for his stiffness, Gore wandered about the stage,
except on the occasions when he walked back to the podium to refer
to notes. Bradley stayed at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley got a wildly enthusiastic reception from
guests, some of whom had been urged to attend through e-mail,
including students from American and George Washington
universities, his reception was more mixed among the 428 DNC
members, who will make up 20 percent of delegates to next year's
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also worked to draw its supporters, and
succeeded in a last-minute effort to give Gore the last word at the
meeting. Gore had been scheduled to speak before Bradley, an
arrangement that apparently was acceptable until Friday, when it
became clear that President Clinton would not speak at his
scheduled Saturday time.
</P>
<P>
   The president instead spoke at the meeting on Friday because he
was undergoing a physical exam Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was logistical, but it's just typical politics,''
said a Bradley aide, who added that the campaign was not extremely
upset about the schedule change.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches to the DNC members and guests, both candidates aired
views on improving race relations, tightening gun-control laws, and
expanding prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley also focused on campaign finance reform and child
poverty, Gore spoke more about education and tossed bouquets to
various Democratic interest groups from women to gays to
minorities, promising that if elected he would create laws more
hospitable to them. Several DNC members waved Gore signs as he
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate got in digs at the other.``I think it's about
time somebody stood up to the NRA,'' said Bradley, referring to the
National Rifle Association and implying the Clinton-Gore
administration had not. At another point, Bradley said, ``What we
need is a little plain speaking about where we are in the world
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for his part, took a swipe at Bradley's support for school
vouchers on an experimental basis, and for a Senate vote that would
have increased the age limit for Social Security recipients. ``I
want you to know I have never been for vouchers,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   And because Bradley had not mentioned the need to shore up
Social Security and Medicare, Gore said he favored doing so because
that hadn't ``been mentioned here yet Sunday.'' He pledged to fight
against any proposal to privatize Social Security or raise the
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did give the Clinton-Gore administration credit for the
booming economy and won applause when he said, ``I think that
President Clinton has done a remarkable job on the issue of race in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the loudest applause came when he mentioned the nation's
prosperity and said, ``There is no reason we can't dramatically
reduce the number of children living in poverty.'' And the audience
roared when he poked fun at himself, telling the story of four Iowa
women who didn't know who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked up to them and I said, `Hi, I'm Bill Bradley.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And they said, `Who?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley, I'm running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they said, `President of what?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and Bill Bradley are two great public servants,'' said
Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia, who was elected Saturday
by the DNC board as general chairman, replacing Colorado Governor
Roy Romer. Rendell said the party would ``be fortunate to have
either one of them'' as president.
</P>
<P>
   Edna O'Neill, a DNC member from Rhode Island, said she is
``leaning towards Gore,'' but is going to the Democratic convention
as an uncommitted delegate. ``They are running against each other
because they are really the cream of the crop,'' she said, ``both
of them.''

JIMENEZ' HOT PUTTER GIVES EUROPEANS AN EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Miguel Angel Jimenez, the 35-year-old
Spaniard playing in his first Ryder Cup, displayed a cool demeanor
and a hot putter Saturday afternoon at The Country Club, giving him
and countryman Jose Maria Olazabal a jump-start against Justin
Leonard and Hal Sutton in their four-ball match.
</P>
<P>
   And he was pretty solid at the finishing hole as well.
</P>
<P>
   With Olazabal out of the par-4, 436-yard 18th with a bogey 5 and
the Americans in ``gimme'' range after two superb shots out of the
front bunker, Jimenez, the only member of the foursome to reach the
green in regulation, rescued his partner and got a point for his
team by halving the hole and the match.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping away from the 25-foot putt because of crowd
noise, Jimenez nearly sank it for a birdie and a win. But he
settled for a tap-in par, thwarting a gallant US comeback that
nearly included an ace by Sutton at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who carried his team all afternoon, was hot early on.
He sank birdie putts at Nos. 4, 5, and 6, turning a 1-up US lead
into a two-hole advantage the Europeans would need.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a question about Jimenez's tenacity: Last
year, he won the Turespana Masters despite kidney stones so painful
he required midround injections. He approached these Ryder Cup
Matches humbly, saying, ``I thank God to be here. I'll try to help
my partners with my game. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an understatement. Just ask Leonard and Sutton, who
took the early lead when Olazabal missed a 4-footer for par at the
par-3 second, and narrowly missed extending their advantage at the
third when Sutton's 30-footer hung at the lip, but didn't fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jimenez went to work.
</P>
<P>
   He canned an 8-footer dead-center on 4 for his first birdie, a
12-foot curler from the back of the fifth green for his second, and
an authoritatively struck 9-footer on the sixth for birdie No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The teams halved the par-4 eighth, then Leonard canned his
team's only birdie of the front nine, a 3-foot job for a 4 on the
513-yard hole after a superb sand wedge.
</P>
<P>
   The back nine started as a sparring match.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's 25-foot birdie effort on the 10th slid past, then
Olazabal's 15-footer for a win curled around the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The teams halved the next three holes, with the most dramatic
moment Sutton's saving putt for a par 4 on 11.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the Americans would square the match at the par-5
14th. Leonard and Sutton both had birdie putts, while Olazabal was
out of the picture and Jimenez's third shot had rolled off the
undulating green and well onto its collar.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez pitched to about 8 feet, then sank a tricky putt that
just held the right edge of the cup for par. That was good enough
as neither Leonard nor Sutton came particularly close on their
birdie tries.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard redeemed himself at the par-4 15th while keeping his
team from going 2 down. After the Spaniards made routine pars,
Sutton couldn't escape trap woes and bogeyed, but Leonard calmly
stroked in a 7-footer for the halve.
</P>
<P>
   That wound up being important because Sutton nearly holed his
tee shot on the par-3, 186-yard 16th, as his ball bit two inches
from the pin. The putt was conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal couldn't connect from 40 feet, but Jimenez, who had
wielded the hot putter earlier, had a chance to halve from 12 feet
and barely missed.
</P>
<P>
   The match stayed even after 17 when Leonard's 9-foot birdie
attempt died short of the cup. Jimenez made a comeback 3-footer for
par.

   (NYT10) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 25, 1999 -- COURTS-ABORTION, 9-25 --
Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law Policy
in New York, which sued to overturn abortion laws in three states.
A ruling on Friday by a federal appeals court, struck down a
particular late-term abortion procedure, a procedure in which the
fetus is partially extracted from the womb and then killed by the
insertion of a tube into the skull and the extraction of the brain.
The ruling represents the first significant legal step that may
compel the Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of laws
barring the procedure. (G. Paul Burnett/New York Times Photo)

may abandon the GOP to seek the reform Party's nomination. ``I

Department lacks the skilled people it needs to deal with the

accomplished, she says, when ``we cannot staff our embassies, let
alone the department.'' (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Europeans are putting into cups the size
of paint cans. Our Guys are aiming at thimbles.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is the best golfer in the Nike world, but he is the
Roger Clemens of Ryder Cups, winning only twice in nine starts
(2-6-1). The ``I'' of the Tiger seems in conflict with team
matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, according to their captain, are ``somewhat
chuffed,'' which we think means ``pleased.'' Our Guys are gagging
on their wallets, their rankings, and some of their comments.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun went down over The Country Club, there was a bad
moon rising and the Ryder Cup scoreboard read, Europeans 10, Our
Guys 6. Play resumes this morning, and unless Our Guys stage an
unprecedented rally (they need 8 1/2 of 12 remaining points), the
Europeans will put the Cup back on the Concorde and take it across
the pond sometime Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was little Saturday to alleviate American fallout from
Friday's European rout. US wonderboys Woods, David Duval, and
Justin Leonard continued to struggle against the likes ot
19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia and the ever-maddening Colin
Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Monty no doubt will be the cleanup batter in Mark James's lineup
Sunday. The wide-body leader loves nothing better than beating
Woods, which he (along with teammate Paul Lawrie) did in Saturday's
best-ball match.
</P>
<P>
   Monty was somewhat riled by the local crowd and said, ``That's
the best thing we can do _ silence the crowd by outplaying them. .
. . They need pumping up because they're losing and they're losing
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Start with Woods, who had a good excuse when he was
a Ryder rookie in Spain two years ago but has dropped three of four
matches in Brookline. He was playing well coming into the
tournament, but the Ryder Cup is becoming his personal nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit it beautifully all week and I've putted well too,''
said Woods. ``Unfortunately, it's just not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Leonard, a one-time British Open champ who is
winless (0-3-4) in seven career Ryder matches. The US had a good
thing going with the Hal Sutton-Jeff Maggert duo (two wins), but
team captain Ben Crenshaw elected to rest Maggert for the afternoon
session and replaced him with Leonard, who struggled mightily.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's David ``the Ryder Cup is an exhibition'' Duval.
The No. 2 player in the world, Duval was on the bench in the
morning but played in the nightcap and managed to halve a match
against Europe's awesome tandem of Garcia and Jesper Parnevik.
Credit Duval with 1 point of a possible 6 thus far, while Garcia
and Parnevik have rung up 7 of 8 possible points.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a business luncheon Friday, the great Arnold Palmer
_ a veteran of nine Ryder Cup teams _ said, ``Maybe our guys are
too businesslike about what's happening. Maybe they're taking it
too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks following the morning match pitting Payne Stewart and
Leonard against Garcia and Parnevik might have come to the same
conclusion. Garcia and Parnevik are of different generations
(Sergio is 19, Jesper 34) and speak different languages, but they
enjoyed one another while the grim-faced Americans barely spoke.
Messrs. Woods, Duval, and Leonard walk the course like they're en
route to an appointment with their dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Davis Love appeared to have the Swede and Spaniard
beaten in the four-ball, but Garcia won the 18th hole and the US
had to settle for half a point. It was devastating, emotionally and
numerically.
</P>
<P>
   Love said, ``No matter what we do, it seems like they do us one
better. It seems like a loss to us, and I'm sure it seems like a
win to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Droll Euro captain Mark James, who says he keeps his troops
fresh by feeding them chocolate, has used his roster much like K.C.
Jones with the 1985 Celtics: He's played only nine of his 12
players. Scotland's Andrew Coltart, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin, and
France's Jean Van de Velde have not yet played. It's unprecedented
for a captain to keep three players on the bench Friday and
Saturday, but the Euros don't care about sparing players' feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's play, the US has more rested players and a
reputation for dominance in singles match play. Two years ago at
Valderrama, the US was hopelessly behind going into the final day
but made things close by winning eight of 12 one-on-ones. They'll
need more than that.

DUVAL-LOVE WRING OUT A TIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MATSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ David Duval did a little jig on the 10th
green Saturday afternoon. After sinking a long, difficult downhill
putt for a birdie that won Duval and partner Davis Love a second
straight hole from Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik, the normally
dour Duval spun and punched the air.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval's dance was nothing compared to the air-punching,
hip-swiveling moves Garcia put down on the 18th hole after nailing
a 6-foot putt to win the hole and halve the match.
</P>
<P>
   In the second match of the best-ball foursomes, everybody
danced. And everybody led.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a frenetic match of shuffling leads, each team had
earned a point.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth match in two days for Garcia and Parnevik, who
have earned 3 1/2 points to lead the European effort.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who got a chance to sleep in Saturday morning after a
draining two matches Friday (two halves), and Duval, who lost twice
Friday, had a chance to win. Several chances.
</P>
<P>
   But a quick, strong start by the Americans _ 2 up after four
holes _ was countered by a putting streak from the Europeans. The
teams were all square after nine holes and though the American
three times wrested a one-hole lead, each time Garcia and Parnevik
took it back.
</P>
<P>
   On 18, after Love missed a 12-foot birdie putt that would have
won the match, Garcia ripped the heart out of the American team by
sinking his birdie to square the match one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it feels like a loss to us but I'm sure it feels like a
win to them,'' said Love.
</P>
<P>
   Love opened the match with a 10-foot birdie putt on the first
hole and Duval's 10-footer on No. 4 gave the Americans confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia started the Europeans' run with a 10-foot birdie putt on
the difficult fifth green. Parnevik topped that with a 25-foot
uphill putt on the sixth, and when Garcia slipped in an 8-footer to
win the eighth hole, putting the Europeans 1 up, Love and Duval
looked a little weary.
</P>
<P>
   But Love put the spring back in their step at No. 9. His tee
shot on the long, torturous hole landed on the rock outcropping
that cuts into the right fairway. His ball was lying quietly in
trampled fescue and after Duval knocked his approach shot from a
nearby perch on the same hill onto the green, Love uncorked a
powerful shot.
</P>
<P>
   The green was too far ahead to see clearly, about 230 yards, but
the noise from the crowd made it plain: Love's ball landed next to
the pin. When the players reached the green, Garcia and Parnevik
immediately conceded the eagle and walked on to the 10th tee.
</P>
<P>
   The reeling and wheeling was not over.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's putt on No. 10, with celebrities and US team members
crowding the fairway to watch, might have given the Americans a
final boost.
</P>
<P>
   But again Parnevik, who has played this Ryder Cup as if he was
the world's best player, sank a slippery 20-foot putt on 11 to
square the match. Duval's 12-foot putt into the heart of the 13th
restored the US lead, just in time for Parnevik to sink another
putt, this one from 10 feet, on No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans took their last lead at 16, when Love watched
Parnevik and Duval miss birdie putts before slowly setting his
8-footer into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Love missed a birdie putt on 17 before the heartbreaker on 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I'd had a putt on the last two holes,'' Duval
said. ``It's a little disappointing right now. Like Davis said,
once they had a chance to get out of something they did.''

BAVASI SOON WILL KNOW FATE WITH ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ In two weeks, Bill Bavasi will know his future
with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The executive vice president and general manager either will
oversee the housecleaning in Anaheim, or he will become a victim of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Angels president Tony Tavares has said that every individual in
the organization will be scrutinized following one of the worst
seasons in franchise history. That includes Bavasi, the team's
general manager for six years, whose contract will expire following
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The season ends Oct.3. A decision on Bavasi is expected Oct.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be done quickly,''' Tavares said. ``We need to make a
lot of decisions about a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Tantamount to any other personnel decision is Bavasi's fate. He
either will be re-signed or pink-slipped.
</P>
<P>
   What does Bavasi think of the situation? Fully in character,
he's revealing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi is one of the best poker players among baseball's GMs. He
keeps his cards close to his chest at all times. He never discusses
potential trades, never addresses rumor. Even after the fact, he
won't say what deals were on the table or what the sticking points
were.
</P>
<P>
   He is protective of his information. Except this time, it's
Bavasi who's in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know what's going to happen any more than the rest
of us,'' Angels vice president and longtime friend Tim Mead said.
``So he's going to conduct himself every day like he's the general
manager. He will work with the thought in mind that nothing will
change. That's what he has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Bavasi has done, busying himself with next
season's preparations, even bringing in former Milwaukee field boss
Phil Garner this week to interview for the Angels' managerial
opening.
</P>
<P>
   He's interviewing candidates at a time when, two weeks from now,
the candidates for his own job might begin lining up.
</P>
<P>
   During Bavasi's tenure, the Angels have zero division titles,
zero postseason games and three horrific September collapses. The
last one, in 1998, might have been averted had Bavasi pulled the
trigger on a trade-deadline deal to bolster the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bavasi has a spot to hang his hat, it is his ability to
tie up home-grown players to long-term contracts at or below market
value.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are in position to clean house because they have
movable contracts. The Dodgers, with bloated, multiyear deals
committed to nags like Eric Young, Carlos Perez and Devon White,
have no such flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   And Bavasi has the loyalty of most of the team's core, if that
means anything. Gary DiSarcina, Troy Percival, Tim Salmon and
Garret Anderson are among the players developed and wrapped up to
long-term contracts by Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given me the opportunity to play in the big leagues and
I'll always be loyal to him for that,'' DiSarcina said. ``It's been
an aberration of a season. It's unfair to put all the blame on one
or two people. Obviously, Billy will step up and say it's his fault
because he put the players here. That's honorable, but not exactly
appropriate. The players are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an unfinished job here. As a player, I hope I'm here
to finish with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Player opinion won't matter much to Tavares. Many of them might
not survive the purge anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One who will is Mo Vaughn, the Angels' franchise player, whose
disenchantment with Terry Collins had an impact on the manager's
resignation last month.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was enticed to Anaheim largely on the strength of a
pages-long letter from Bavasi that expressed admiration and respect
for the slugging first baseman. Vaughn signed a six-year, $80
million contract on Nov. 15, and despite a hobbled ankle, he has 29
homers and has topped the 100-RBI mark.
</P>
<P>
   His happiness is a primary concern, and because Vaughn signed to
play for Bavasi, he might take issue if the Angels opt to make a
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make those decisions, so it's not my business to
comment on them,'' Vaughn said. ``But personally, I think we're
starting to get things straight in here. (Bavasi) can turn this
around. In the right circumstances, he could still do a very good
job here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi also has league-wide respect. Some GMs believe he isn't
willing to compromise, but then, that's also the reason Bavasi has
made just two fatally flawed trades in his six years -- the Damion
Easley and Jim Abbott deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my dealings with him were very professional,'' said Former
Dodgers GM Fred Claire, who discussed several trades with Bavasi
since 1994 but never agreed upon one. ``He would come straight at
his objective. There was never any dancing around with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi's level approach to negotiating contracts has worked the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his first long-term deal and he was a tough nut,''
DiSarcina said. ``He's pretty good at what he's doing. He's honest
as Abe Lincoln, and a player can't ask for anything more than
honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain. Despite rumors of the franchise's
impending sale to Broadcom CEO Henry Nicholas III, the decision to
retain or fire Bavasi will be squarely in Tavares' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can speculate all they want, but I have to make a
decision,'' Tavares said, ``and I won't until the season is over.''

DUSTY BAKER Q &AMP;A
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAMIAN SECORE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though Dusty Baker was always labeled as a Dodger
during his playing career, he's always thought of himself as a
Northern California guy. It's where his family and livelihood is,
his job being manager of the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   His association with the rival Giants may have prompted the
Dodgers entourage to ask, `Why the Giants?' when Baker accepted the
position Dec. 16, 1992. Baker's response would be, `Why not?'
</P>
<P>
   He's twice been NL Manager of the Year. He took the Giants to
the playoffs in 1997, to a one-game, wild-card playoff last year,
and kept them in the hunt this year despite a rash of injuries to
those like Barry Bonds (47 games missed), Jeff Kent and Ellis
Burks, and handling a young pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   He's never felt like a traitor towards the Dodgers. Meanwhile,
he's carved his reputation as one of the game's elite managers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun: With the injuries, how had your team been able to stay
in the pennant race for so long?
</P>
<P>
   Baker: I think it's a testament of their intestinal fortitude,
their desire, the fact that these guys come out and play hard. You
know, most teams don't play hard everyday. You play hard, you get
good pitching, you got a good chance to win. Plus the fact that we
lost Barry (Bonds) for those days and we had a guy like Armando
Rios come up and play. We lost Ellis (Burks) and Armando got to
stay and play some more. Then we lost Jeff (Kent) and we had Ramon
Martinez fill in. A lot of it we got to give to our bench players,
guys that came up from Triple-A, so I got to commend our minor
league system for being so deep and talented.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What improvements or changes are needed for next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think staying healthy and the fact that our young pitchers
are gonna have to mature and get better _ Shawn Estes, Joe Nathan,
Russell Ortiz and the other young guys we have. We have to shore up
our bullpen. But it gives me a lot of satisfaction to know that
these guys don't quit, and just knowing that with any kind of luck
or any kind of year where we have everybody healthy that soon we'll
be knocking on the door and going all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you still feel like a Dodger in any way?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not really. None of me is Dodger blue anymore because I
haven't been here since 1983. Things change and things become a
memory in your mind. I enjoyed the days that I played here. I
enjoyed the guys that I played with here. I love it up North. My
folks are there. We moved from Riverside in 1965 to Sacramento, so
the majority of my life has been spent there even though all of my
early days were spent in Southern California, which I enjoyed a lot
too. But I like to fish and hunt, and these are things that are
most conducive to my personality and are a lot easier to do in the
North than it is in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your fondest Dodgers memories?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably the guys that I played with and going to the World
Series and the playoffs. Just knowing that when you went to spring
training, that you had a real good chance of going to the World
Series. Playing with Davey Lopes and Reggie Smith and Garvey and
Cey and Yeager and Ferguson and Darrel Thomas, Lee Lacy, Manny
Mota, Jose Morales, and all the other guys; we were a very
close-knit team. We hung together, we ate together, we had a couple
beers together, guys would stick around and talk baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have you perceived the Dodgers-Giants rivalry to be
during your playing days and now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Twenty years ago, there wasn't much of a rivalry, I don't
think, because we were winning most of the time. It's hard to have
a rivalry when we were doing most of the winning. At that time, our
main rivals were the Cincinnati Reds and the Houston Astros; those
were the good teams. Since I've been here, it's been more of a
rivalry from Northern California from the Giants fans to the
Dodgers fans than from the Dodgers fans to the Giants fans.

IN DUELING SPEECHES, GORE AND BRADLEY TRY TO COURT DEMOCRATIC PARTY
LEADERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In back-to-back speeches before the year's biggest
gathering of Democratic power brokers, former Sen. Bill Bradley
sought Saturday to loosen Vice President Al Gore's grip on the
Democratic Party's leadership, while Gore staved off the challenge
with a lively appeal on issues dear to the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two contenders were on stage separately at the fall
meeting of the Democratic National Committee, this was the first
time party loyalists had compared them so directly in what has
become an unexpectedly hard-fought campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Belying their reputations as less than exhilarating speakers,
Gore and Bradley delivered dueling presentations that made for the
most dramatic party meeting in years. The crowd gave enthusiastic
receptions to both men as they avoided direct assaults on each
other and vied for the party's heart.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was stocked with White House officials and other
political luminaries eager to witness the face-off at the last
formal party meeting before the Democrats pick their nominee in Los
Angeles next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's pitch was well received, as he sought to persuade
Democrats that he shared their goals _ and was not looking to rip
apart the party. But then Gore won many over with an unusually
lively appeal that he had the heart to champion Democratic issues
like education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The audience applauded Bradley especially enthusiastically when
he named party leaders who back Gore and would be elevated if the
Democrats won control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Rangel may not be for me, but I sure want him to be
the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,'' he said of the New
York congressman. ``Dick Gephardt may not be for me, but I sure
want him to be speaker of the House of Representatives. Tom Daschle
may not be for me, but I sure want him to be the Senate majority
leader.'' Gephardt is minority leader in the House, Daschle in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 428 members of the Democratic National Committee _
whose support is crucial at the party's convention _ have already
signed up with Gore. He has cultivated them for seven years and
been a fixture at party gatherings. Bradley had not attended a
national party meeting in years.
</P>
<P>
   His reading glasses perched on his nose, Bradley offered an
understated address that was full of wry lines. For example, he
said his father did not want him to be a professional basketball
player _ until he learned how much the job paid. Even Gore
loyalists, who sat in the front of the vast ballroom at the
Washington Hilton, rose to their feet at the end of Bradley's
speech, in which he touched on themes like controlling handguns and
lifting children out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who in recent weeks has been confronted with polls and
other evidence suggesting that Bradley is emerging as a potent
rival, was greeted like a conquering hero to the strains of the
O'Jay's hit, ``Love Train.'' Leaving the lectern (a move that
obscured the vice presidential seal) and referring only
occasionally to notes, Gore acknowledged his friends in the
audience and vowed ``to work my heart out'' to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had had no use for politics after serving in
Vietnam and after his father lost his Senate seat from Tennessee.
But later, he said, when he was working as a journalist, he
experienced ``the thrill of watching democracy in action'' that was
``almost impossible to describe _ and it never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, seeking to strike out on his own, did not mention
President Clinton even once, although Bradley referred to Clinton's
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   And neither foe mentioned the other. The closest Gore came to
criticizing his challenger was in a reference to school vouchers,
which Bradley once supported on a trial basis. ``I have never been
for vouchers,'' Gore declared. ``We need to invest in our public
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men saved their sharpest criticism for the Republican
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and his reluctance to
expand his state's hate-crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for affirmative action because it's still needed,'' Gore
said. ``And I am also for the passage of a hate-crimes law. When
James Byrd is dragged from the back of a pickup truck because of
his race. When Matthew Shepard is crucified on a split-rail fence
by bigots, how can any political leader in either party say that
there is a difference between hate crimes and other crimes?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said, ``The governor of Texas had let it be known that
this bill would not reach his desk.'' If he is the Democratic
nominee, Bradley said, ``I will make it an issue in the
presidential election in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   They both touched on many of the same red meat issues _ like gun
control, Social Security, health care and campaign-finance reform.
Gore went so far as to promise high-quality preschool for every
child in America. And Bradley said: ``There is no reason we can't
dramatically reduce the number of children living in poverty in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the fierceness of the competition for the nomination, the
behind-the-scenes maneuvering, and intrigue, was limited. Hours
before the program began, party officials shifted the schedule so
Gore could speak last.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials insisted that the schedule change was intended
to give more prominence to the election of Mayor Ed Rendell of
Philadelphia as the party's general chairman. The program was also
designed so that Bradley was safely off stage and out of the hotel
before the vice president appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's loyalists did make a subtle move to remind Democrats that
Bradley left the Senate in 1996 with bitter parting words for the
American political system. They passed out red, white and blue
buttons that said, ``ALways a Democrat!'' _ with ``AL'' in big
letters. But Bradley's forces e-mailed young supporters,
encouraging them to attend the meeting and arming them with
placards. Both sides turned out roughly the same number of
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley did an admirable job,'' said Bob Ream,
chairman of the Montana Democratic Party. ``But it was a remarkable
improvement in Gore's performance. Is it going to be a real race?
It is a real race.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speeches were only the beginning. Even after he left the
ballroom Saturday, Bradley abruptly returned to shake hands with a
longtime Democrat whose support he desperately needs: John J.
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The federation has been leaning toward endorsing Gore, but
Sweeney said Bradley has ``a good message'' and ``has shown he
wants to run a high-level campaign here and wants to come out with
a victory.''

 &HT;    Tough course left for Americans
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Heavy underdogs given little respect a few
days ago, they have put the pressure on the underachievers at the
Ryder Cup. After a break-even Saturday at The Country Club, Europe
takes a 10-6 lead into today's closing singles of the 33rd Ryder
Cup at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to avoid a third consecutive defeat by the Europeans, the
Americans played more to their games Saturday after a nervous start
Friday, but still face a tough task today.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the Americans have trailed entering the
final day on U.S. soil, the other two occasions occurring in
England in 1949 and 1993. At The Belfry in '93 _ scene of their
last victory _ the Americans trailed 8 1/2-7 1/2 after two days,
dominated the singles 7 1/2-4 1/2 and won the match 15-13.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-2 after Friday's opening competition, the Americans
split the Saturday morning foursomes (alternate shot) matches to
trail 8-4, then held their ground in afternoon best ball, winning
one match and halving another.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans need just four points in the 12 singles matches to
retain the cup, bringing odds that don't favor the United States.
Only once in the past 40 years has the European team failed to win
at least four points in singles, limited to 3 1/2 in 1979, when the
U.S. pulled out a 17-11 win.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman and Phil Mickelson won the only match for the
Americans in best-ball Saturday, defeating Darren Clarke and Lee
Westwood 2 and 1. Mickelson missed crucial putts on 16 and 18
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the rest of the team to see that lead group doing
some damage was real important,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's star team of 19-year-old Sergio Garcia and Jesper
Parnevik, who have sunk putts and chips from everywhere, salvaged a
half against Davis Love III and David Duval in best-ball. Garcia
and Parnevik were 3-0-1 over two days after Garcia made a 7-foot
birdie putt at the 18th, matching a birdie Love made on the 16th
for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have fun, I play well,'' said Garica, the youngest player
in Ryder Cup history. ``I've been getting crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great two days,'' said Parnevik, who pitched in
for a surprise matching par at the 14th. ``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's only best-ball win came from their consistent Scottish
team of Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie, who defeated Tiger Woods
and Steve Pate 2 and 1 in the anchor match. Miguel Angel Jimenez
and Jose Maria Olazabal halved their match with Americans Justin
Leonard and Hal Sutton.

YANKS CAN'T CLOSE THE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ There was a trace of electricity in the air
Saturday as the 33d Ryder Cup matches resumed with the European
side in command, 6-2, after Friday's opening matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks broke quickly from the gate, but the brief dousing of
the course, which delayed things a bit, seemed to cool them off and
the morning foursomes ended with each side earning 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   It left the Europeans with an 8-4 advantage, the same as they
enjoyed after the rain-delayed second day two years ago at
Valderrama, Spain, where they ended up celebrating a 14 1/2-13 1/2
victory that kept the Cup in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the team of Phil Mickelson-Tom Lehman building a
3-hole through No. 10 and never looking back except for a little
scare on the par-3 16th when Lee Westwood ran in a sizable putt for
a birdie to keep things interesting, the closest the US side could
close the gap was 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the guys to look up on the board and see us go 1-up, 2-up,
and 3-up, they could say, `Let's keep on going,' '' said Lehman.
``I think for the rest of the team to see the lead group doing some
damage was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, but it wasn't quite enough to lift the troops completely
out of the doldrums. Momentum definitely shifted back across the
pond in the four-ball matches when Tiger Woods missed from 6 feet
on the 17th, allowing the irrespressible Colin Montgomerie and
British Open champion Paul Lawrie to chalk up a huge point over him
and Steve Pate, America's other winning combination in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, who had missed makeable birdie putts on 15 and
17, sank the one that really counted on the 18th. His birdie from
just outside 6 feet enabled him and Jesper Parnevik halve their
match with Davis Love-David Duval and remain undefeated for the
weekend with 3 1/2 points.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's team matches ended with Miguel Angel Jimenez
watching his potential winning putt die on edge of the cup on 18,
which locked up a halve for him and fellow Spaniard Jose Maria
Olazabal with Hal Sutton-Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   So, with all said and done, the day ended as it began _ with the
Europeans up by 4 points. They led 10 1/2-5 1/2 entering singles
matches two years ago at Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   There were some brilliant shots over the closing holes Saturday.
Sutton, who had been absent from Ryder Cup play for 12 years,
nearly holed his tee shot on 16, and the Spanish Armada once again
ruled supreme: Garcia and Parnevik went 3-0-1 in four matches.
Jimenez, who was an assistant captain two years ago, completed a
1-0-3 trip, and Olazabal, whose career was in jeopardy just a
little over two years ago with a serious foot problem, has been
2-0-1. The Spanish have contributed to a total of 9 points.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Pate started their morning with four straight birdies
in the alternate-shot competition, and would have surged to a 4-up
advantage had Dubliner Padraig Harrington not rolled in a birdie
putt to halve a hole. The visitors then proceded to win the 6th,
8th, and 11th to pull all square. This was the way it went until
Woods rolled in a putt for an eagle and a 1-up edge on the par-5
14th.
</P>
<P>
   In that match the 17th, the most notorious hole a the Country
Club for swinging momentum, proved key again when Harrington's
approach shot to the severe slope in back of the pin refused to
spin bck to the hole. ``I got robbed,'' said Harrington. ``I
couldn't believe it when the ball stopped on the slope. It was
obvious it would have been stone dead if it had rolled back. That
was an important point at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18th wasn't pretty, but Woods lagged his putt to the lip for
a conceded par and the 1-up victory that left the Europeans with an
8-4 lead entering the afternoon fourball competition.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, the US picked it up early and led all four matches.
Montgomerie put a temporary end to that holing a birdie putt on the
third with partner Paul Lawrie at his side to square things with
Woods and Pate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to maintain our lead,'' said European captain Mark
James, who played on seven teams and made a run at making it an
eighth this year. ``We achieved our objective to play some good
golf today, and to win points they had to play well. They know what
they are up against, and we know what we are up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of relying on big guns. I have a feeling
that some players are playing slightly better than others and are
slightly more capable of shooting lower. It's a very narrow margin,
and I'm going with those players because they are doing a good job.
To change tactics would be dangerous. It's something we've all
discussed. I think we're happy doing what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The team of Jim Furyk and Mark O'Meara, who are generally
regarded has having two of world's best short games, failed to
register a single birdie in their 3-and-2 foursomes setback to
Westwood and Darren Clarke. ``It's disappointing,'' said O'Meara,
who sat out the first two matches and didn't play in the afternoon.
``We didn't play poorly, but we didn't make any putts. They birdied
the two Par 5s (9, 14), where we had good drives and didn't make
any birdies. That was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And the overall difference between the teams still stands at 4.

MASS. SCIENTIST CITED FOR BRAIN RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Massachusetts scientist who helped dispel the once widely held
belief that schizophrenia came from bad mothering has won an Albert
Lasker Award, widely regarded as America's Nobel Prize, for his
lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seymour S. Kety, 84, a neuroscientist at McLean Hospital and
Harvard, is being recognized for helping to provide a biological
basis for understanding mental illness and for research on cerebral
blood flow that laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated brain
imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Kety, of Westwood, Mass., recalled in an interview that when he
became the first scientific director of the National Institute of
Mental Health in 1951, schizophrenia was primarily considered a
result of poor parenting, particularly by mothers, a notion, he
said, that ``left me cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Kety said he felt ``it was foolhardy . . . to not study the
brain in connection with mental illness, because we didn't know
enough about the brain.'' He structured the research he directed so
that basic scientific questions could be asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Kety began a landmark study of Danish adoptees
with schizophrenia that showed the importance of genetics in the
development of the disease and helped dispel the notion of the
``schizophrenogenic mother.'' He continues to pursue this research.
</P>
<P>
   Kety is one of six US scientists being recognized this year with
a Lasker Award, which will be presented in New York City Friday and
comes with a $25,000 honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   The award for basic medical research goes to Clay M. Armstrong,
Bertil Hille, and Roderick MacKinnon, who examined cells' ion
channels, critical for understanding everything from nerve impulses
to muscle contractions.
</P>
<P>
   The award for clinical medical research is being shared by David
W. Cushman and Miguel A. Ondetti, for developing drugs called ACE
inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure, heart
failure, and diabetic kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 300 scientists who have won a Lasker Award
since its creation in 1946 by philanthropists Albert and Mary
Woodard Lasker, 61 have also received Nobel Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   In honoring Kety, the Lasker Award citation said he, ``more than
any single person, brought important scientific perspective . . .
through a series of landmark studies of the biological and adoptive
families of schizophrenic adoptees.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers familiar with Kety's work agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really deserves a lot of credit,'' said Dr. Donald Goff,
director of the psychotic disorders program at Massachusetts
General Hospital, where Kety once worked. While he does not know
Kety personally, Goff said, Kety's research is famous in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Kety, senior psychobiologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont and
professor emeritus of neuroscience at Harvard Medical School, also
developed the concept of chelation to remove lead chemically from
the blood in cases of lead poisoning.

TAMPA BAY'S LAMB LEARNS THE ROPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No player on the Tampa Bay Devil Rays roster has
started fewer games this season than David Lamb, but the rookie
infielder doesn't despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not greedy,'' said Lamb, 24, a former star at Newbury Park
High. ``I realize I'm not the number-one guy here, so I just wait
my turn and do the best I can when I'm in the game. I know I will
get my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb, a Rule V selection from the Baltimore Orioles last winter,
made the Devil Rays' 25-man roster on the last day of spring
training and has been with the big club all season.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb has appeared in 52 games (including 27 starts) and is
batting .227 with one home run and 13 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the ideal situation for a young player, who might be
better served by playing every day in the minor leagues, but Lamb
wouldn't trade his seat on the end of the Devil Rays' bench for any
starting job in Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great ride and this is my dream come true,'' Lamb
said, ``but yeah, it has been a difficult role to get used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been times when I played a week straight, then had a
month off, then played a week straight again.... So it's been
different, but I've definitely learned a lot just from watching
some of the veteran players.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Rothschild recognizes the difficult role in which
Lamb has been placed, and is pleased with the rookie's progress and
his willingness to play both shortstop, his natural position, and
second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to him periodically, just to let him know what his
situation is,'' Rothschild said. ``He understands it, and he has
handled it beautifully. He is always prepared whenever he gets a
chance, and that's because he works very hard between at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always out hitting early and taking ground balls, working
on all phases of his game. For a guy with limited Triple-A
experience, he's done a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   Selected by the Orioles in the 1993 Draft out of Newbury Park,
where he also excelled as a quarterback, Lamb spent his first four
seasons bouncing between Single-A clubs. Midway through the 1997
season, he was promoted to Double-A Bowie, where he hit .331 in 73
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles intended to promote Lamb to Triple-A before the 1998
season, but didn't because of an injury to Bowie's starting
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't real happy with the way everything was going with the
Orioles,'' Lamb said. ``I felt like I was getting ... not buried,
but kind of pushed aside for some reason, because I was doing well
and I wasn't getting any hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was selected to the Double-A All-Star Game after hitting
.303 in 66 games, and finally the Orioles moved him up to Triple-A
Rochester, where he hit .298 in 48 games, including .354 in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then the season ended, and they left me off the (40-man)
roster again,'' Lamb said. ``At that point I knew I had a pretty
good chance of being a Rule V selection.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rule V draft, players may be drafted by other
organizations, but if they do not make the 25-man roster of their
new teams, they are sent back to the original organization. On Dec.
14, the Devil Rays came calling for Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in the front door one day, and the phone rang,'' Lamb
said. ``It was the Orioles, congratulating me and telling me that
I'd been added to the 25-man roster of the Devil Rays. You hope
something like that happens, and you hope somebody realizes all the
hard work you put in, but that wasn't a guarantee of a roster
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb went to spring training and battled for a spot as a utility
infielder. The competition was tough, and in the eighth inning of
the final spring training, infielder Aaron Ledesma broke his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the dugout, and I was like, `What's going to
happen now?' '' Lamb said. ``At that point I still didn't know what
they were going to do with me. But Larry and (general manager Chuck
LaMar) called me in and said, `Congratulations, you made the team,
and don't think it's because Aaron got hurt, because you played
well and you earned a spot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speechless, and all I could do was thank them for the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Lamb looks around the clubhouse and sees the players he
previously knew only by reputation. The Devil Rays, a second-year
expansion team, have a mix of young players and veterans such as
Wade Boggs, Jose Canseco and Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching these guys, and now all of a sudden I'm on
a first-name basis with them,'' Lamb said. ``I grew up collecting
their cards, now I'm playing catch with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn a lot just by watching them. You can see why they have
been in the big leagues for 15 or 16 years, just by the way they go
about their business and are professional in everything they do.''
</P>
<P>
   So this year has been watch-and-learn time for Lamb, who looks
forward to the day when he can roam the infield every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a good chance of coming in next year and
winning a spot on the team again,'' Lamb said. ``I don't plan on
ever going back down to the minors, but if it happens it happens.
It's been a good ride, and if I never play up here another day,
it's still been extremely exciting.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ With one day left in the Ryder Cup
competition, the United States is running out of time, running out
of matches and running out of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Outplaying the United States for the second consecutive day, and
winning two crucial four-ball matches in the afternoon, Europe took
a commanding 10-6 lead into Sunday's 12 singles matches at The
Country Club. Europe needs just 4 of the 12 points on Sunday to
retain the cup and to win the biennial event for the third
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, as the challengers, need 14{ points to win the
cup, meaning they need 8{ points on Sunday to avoid another
disappointing loss.
</P>
<P>
   No team has ever come back from a 5-point deficit on Sunday to
win, and considering what has transpired so far, the United States
faces a formidable task. Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia have
been brilliant for Europe, winning three matches and earning a
crucial half-point Saturday afternoon. And the Europeans have
continued their winning formula, making remarkable chip shots and
pressure putts, and securing momentum-building victories that have
inspired their teammates and deflated their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Favored to win, but frustrated by the events, the U.S. players
refused to give up, but they knew it would take a heroic effort to
avoid another defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they do, they do it one better,'' said Davis Love
III, who is in danger of playing on his third consecutive losing
team.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting Saturday's foursome matches, 2-2, and the four-ball
matches, 2-2, Europe protected the 6-2 lead it started the day
with. The most deflating loss of the afternoon for the United
States was absorbed by Tiger Woods and Steve Pate, who were beaten,
2 and 1, by Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. Montgomerie,
Europe's best player, outperformed Woods, the world's best player.
</P>
<P>
   With the match all square through 14 holes, both Montgomerie and
Lawrie stepped forward. Montgomerie won No. 15 with a sensational
16-foot birdie putt. Then at the par-3 186-yard No. 16, Lawrie hit
his tee shot to within 2 feet of the cup, leading to a birdie that
put his side 2 up with two holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But the most emotional and well-played match Saturday afternoon
was Love and Duval against Garcia and Parnevik, a roller-coaster
ride of sensational shots. It was Garcia who fired the final salvo,
with an extraordinary birdie at the par-4, 436-yard No. 18 that won
the hole and secured a crucial half-point for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Love had a 15-foot putt to win the match at No. 18, but missed,
leaving Garcia with his putt. Though Parnevik's ball was farther
from the hole, Parnevik asked Garcia to putt first. And when
Garcia's ball dropped in the hole, his body shook in celebration
and he knew that he had once again done something important and
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I like to do,'' Garcia said. ``I like playing
golf, and I like playing for my continent. I like having fun, and
if I have fun, I play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Love and Duval felt as if they had let a half-point slip away
despite their strong play. Love hit one of the competition's most
incredible shots, a 220-yard approach shot at the par-5 ninth hole
that almost went in the hole for an eagle. Duval also made an
improbable 35-foot downhill birdie putt in the match, but none of
that was enough to beat Garcia and Parnevik. And knowing his team's
dire situation, Love didn't feel that a half-point in his match was
good enough.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps, but we gave them an out, and they got out of it,''
Love said. ``David played great, but it feels like a loss to us.
And I'm sure it feels like a win to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The other afternoon four-ball match that ended even was Justin
Leonard and Hal Sutton against Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria
Olazabal. Sutton has been the American's most productive player
with 2{ points, and he saved a half-point for the United States at
No. 16 when he hit a wonderful tee shot that was almost a
hole-in-one, stopping within a foot of the cup, leading to the
birdie that evened the match for good.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez had a chance to win the match at No. 18, but his 18-foot
birdie putt stopped just inches from the cup, and the Americans
escaped with a half-point.
</P>
<P>
   The first afternoon match was the most one-sided, as Phil
Mickelson and Tom Lehman defeated Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood, 2
and 1. The Americans built a 3-up lead after 10 holes, with
Mickelson hitting an approach shot at No. 10 that nearly went in
for an eagle. The Europeans conceded the tap-in birdie to
Mickelson, and they never got closer than 2 points the rest of the
match.
</P>
<P>
   It was redemption for Mickelson, whose two missed short putts
Friday afternoon cost his team a match.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence wasn't as high as I would have liked,'' said
Mickelson, who switched putters Saturday. ``I feel like after
making a few putts today that I'm ready for singles.''
</P>
<P>
   The pageantry in the gallery made for a special atmosphere, with
fans holding American and European flags, Michael Jordan and the
former President George Bush following the action from inside the
ropes, and roars echoing through the trees with every shift in
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans remained rock solid and set the tone by
splitting the morning matches. It was not the hard-charging
comeback the United States had hoped for, but it could have been
far worse. At one point, the United States was in danger of losing
all four matches, which would have virtually ended any hope for a
United States victory. But thanks to victories by the teams of
Maggert and Sutton and Woods and Pate, the United States remained 4
points behind heading into the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. captain, Ben Crenshaw, elected to break up the team of
Maggert and Sutton Saturday afternoon, resting Maggert and
replacing him with Leonard. It was a risk, because Sutton and
Maggert had played so well together, winning two of three matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete hunch,'' Crenshaw said of his decision to
bench Maggert and to play Leonard. ``I think Justin is going to
have the feel of the goal course, and I'm banking on his putter
getting hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning it took heroics just for the United States not
to fall further behind. The Maggert-Sutton victory over Montgomerie
and Lawrie was the morning's most intense match.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, who has a history of losing his temper at key
moments, had his first Ryder Cup confrontation with hecklers at the
sixth hole. After Sutton made a 14-foot birdie, the crowd roared,
chanting ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' Montgomerie needed to make his 10-foot
birdie putt to halve the hole, and he waited about 30 seconds for
the crowd to quiet. But as he settled over his putt, someone from
the gallery yelled something. Montgomerie backed off and looked
toward the gallery. But when he finally regrouped, he made the putt
to halve the hole. And when the ball fell in the cup, he looked
toward the gallery and defiantly pumped his fist.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sutton, as they walked toward the No. 7 tee,
Montgomerie said, ``What these people are too stupid to realize is
that this only makes me more determined.''
</P>
<P>
   After the loss, Lawrie seemed upset that on several occasions,
Sutton had urged American fans to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their behavior was just ridiculous,'' Lawrie said of Sutton's
and Maggert's encouragement of the fans. ``I don't mind it when
we've both played, but to do it before the next opponent hits a
shot? If it means that much to them, then all the best to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, emotions were more intense Saturday, as the U.S. team
arrived inspired after a team meeting Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all echoed the same thing,'' Maggert said. ``I've
been on two losing Ryder Cup teams and it's no fun. A lot of my
teammates feel the same way. I know the guys on the last two Ryder
Cup teams are not ready to face that again.''

   But unless the Americans enjoy a glorious Sunday, they will face
another loss. Seven Europeans will be playing their fifth match in
five days, compared with just two Americans, so the United States
may be fresher. But as motivated and confident as the Europeans
were, that may not matter.

``But I'll be ready tomorrow.''

MICHIGAN BEATS WISCONSIN, 21-16  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON. Wis. _ They have a poor running game but somehow find a
way to grind out the yards they need. Their coach cannot decide on
a quarterback but seems to get timely plays from both of them. And
now, after outlasting Wisconsin, 21-16, Saturday, the unbeaten
Michigan Wolverines and Coach Lloyd Carr have won four games and
are in the national title picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the Michigan defense contained the big Badger, Ron Dayne,
a couple of Wolverines who many believe Carr does not like that
much made a case to keep their jobs: halfback Anthony Thomas and
quarterback Tom Brady.
</P>
<P>
   In a third-quarter drive that gobbled up 91 yards and 3 minutes
38 seconds and put Wisconsin away, Thomas and Brady took turns
keeping it alive on crucial third downs.
</P>
<P>
   From Michigan's 12-yard line, Brady rocketed a sideline pass to
Marcus Knight for 11 yards and a first down. On third-and-1 at the
32, Thomas bulled up the middle for 3 yards and a first down. And
on third-and-7 at Wisconsin's 23, Brady dropped back, pump-faked
and delivered a touch pass to DiAllo Johnson in the end zone for an
emphatic score. Brady finished 17 of 27 passing for 217 yards and 2
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty. It wasn't exciting. It really wasn't even that
close _ the freshman quarterback Brooks Bollinger scrambled 13
yards for a Wisconsin touchdown with 1:29 left to make it 21-16.
But that was it for the No. 20 Badgers (2-1).
</P>
<P>
   The No. 4 Wolverines (4-0) held Dayne to 88 yards _ all in the
first half _ in a stifling defensive performance in the teams' Big
Ten opener. In the second half Dayne had zero net yards on eight
carries and twice failed to get critical first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne came into the game 1,193 yards shy of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association career rushing record set last year
by Ricky Williams of Texas. Dayne needs to average better than 155
yards a game to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines, who have averaged a dismal 125.7 yards a game
rushing, went to the air immediately behind Brady on the opening
drive. The 6-foot-5-inch senior, who continues to battle the backup
Drew Henson for Michigan's quarterbacking job, precisely marched
the Wolverines 90 yards on a 13-play drive that drained nearly six
minutes from the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Brady was 7 of 8 passing for 67 yards on the drive and, most
impressively, was 4 for 4 on third-down plays. His offensive line,
perhaps the best in the Big Ten, kept the Badgers' defense clear of
Brady, who stood back with ample time and picked Wisconsin's
secondary apart.
</P>
<P>
   On third down and 3 on the Badgers' 8-yard line, Brady had a
full seven seconds to survey the field. He shuffled slowly up in
the pocket, then lofted a pass to the back of the end zone, where
fullback Aaron Shea had slipped by himself. The touchdown gave
Michigan a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Dayne, who had only six fumbles heading into his senior
season, put the ball on the ground at Wisconsin's 46-yard line,
Brady and the Wolverines wasted little time putting more points on
the board. Dayne, who last week fumbled on his way into the end
zone in a 17-12 loss to Cincinnati, muffed a handoff from
quarterback Scott Kavanagh that Michigan nose tackle Rob Renes
smothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Brady pitched right to Thomas, who handed the
ball to Marcus Knight, who in turn tucked it in the stomach of
David Terrell for a double reverse. Terrell cut inside a wall of
blockers and zigzagged down the field and into the end zone for a
45-yard score and a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who was held to 20 yards in the first quarter, rumbled
the Badgers awake in the second quarter. On second-and-10 at the
43, Dayne broke his first big run of the afternoon, 19 yards, to
put the Badgers into Michigan territory for the first time. Then
Kavanagh hit Chris Chambers on a sideline route at the Wolverines'
20. Two plays later, the pair seemed to have hooked up for a
touchdown, but a wide-open Chambers dropped the pass in the end
zone. So the Badgers settled for a 32-yard field goal by Vitaly
Pisetsky.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wolverines stalled with Henson quarterbacking the
second quarter, the Badgers and Dayne seemed to find their big-game
equilibrium. Wisconsin cornerback Jamar Fletcher blocked a 36-yard
field-goal attempt by Jeff Del Verne that his Badgers teammate Mike
Echols recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Dayne, who had 44 of his 68 second-quarter yards on this
drive, the Badgers bashed their way down the field. On third-and-3
from Michigan's 34-yard line, Dayne stumbled through the middle of
the line, shook off a tackle attempt by Tommy Hendricks and rolled
into the end zone. But Pisetsky's extra-point attempt, was blocked
and at halftime Wisconsin trailed, 14-9.

PILOTS-F16 _ Luke Air Force Base is under the gun to churn out more
fighter pilots at the very time when its aging fleet of F-16s is
shrinking and under duress. The base, the world's largest for F-16
training, is boosting class sizes to offset one of the worst Air
Force pilot shortages ever. In the past four years, Luke's
basic-training class increased by nearly a third, from 113 pilots
to 168. By JENNIFER BARRETT. Story will move in the ``A''

 &QL; 
ARENA _ The advertising agent for America West Arena earned at
least $5.2 million in commissions from 1992 to 1998, or about
three-quarters of a million more than Phoenix, which owns the
arena, received for the same period, city records show. What's
more, the agent, Terry Pugh of Paradise Valley, and Suns President
Jerry Colangelo formed a side deal, in violation of the arena
advertising agreement, that lasted for 28 months. By NENA BAKER.

PARKING _ As vehicles continue to expand _ Ford's newest, the
Excursion, could be used as a small bus _ and parking spots have
shrunk to compact sizes (more cars per row equal more shoppers in

MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Phoenix) They're the Osmond Brothers of the
National League. In the rock and roll world of professional sports,
they're Lawrence Welk. If the Arizona Diamondbacks were a

it'd be the Boy Scout manual. I'm wondering, Why? Guys in the real

RANGERS SHARE THE WEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's tough being a Ranger in Cowboy country, but
the AL West leaders are doing more than getting ready for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers players raised approximately $55,000 among themselves to
donate to a fund for the victims of last week's shooting at a Fort
Worth church. Both the club and owner Tom Hicks are expected to
match the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Within the organization, the Rangers are working toward becoming
more of a family. Last Monday, Hicks gave manager Johnny Oates and
GM Doug Melvin two-year contract extensions. Both already were
signed through next year, meaning the new deals will take them
through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are on their way to their third division title in
the five years Melvin and Oates have been in charge. But they have
yet to take the team past the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes: It matters little that the Yankees are
preparing to defend their World Series title by winning nine of
their past 10. Owner George Steinbrenner has shuffled his chain of
command, with GM Brian Cashman now reporting to VP of player
development Mark Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman has guided the Yankees to 219 wins in less than two full
seasons. This year they set a franchise-attendance record _ 3.07
million _ which also is tops for any team in New York history.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is running the Yankees in 2000 will be busy. Decisions
must be made on whether to re-sign David Cone, whether to pick up
the option on Paul O'Neill, whether to trade Andy Pettitte, and how
much to spend on long-term contracts for closer Mariano Rivera and
shortstop Derek Jeter. DH Chili Davis!of! is expected to retire
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of good seats left: Oakland fans must have sensed the A's
were starting to finally fade after they couldn't gain ground on
Boston in their remarkable wild-card run. In the three-game series
against the Twins that ended Wednesday, the A's drew a grim 22,905.
Total.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's attendance, while up 173,938 over last year, has been
awful in September for a team in contention. Even though the Red
Sox dropped their third straight Friday night, the A's were still
4{ back with just over a week to go. ``I don't understand it,''
said first baseman Jason Giambi. ``This is the best product in
baseball. We've got a $20 million (payroll) team that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Going broke?: The Tampa Bay Devil Rays are talking with veterans
Roberto Hernandez, first baseman Fred McGriff and catcher John
Flaherty about deferring parts of their salaries. The reason, the
Rays say, is they need the money to be players in free agency or
trading this winter. Hernandez is owed $6million for each of the
next two years. Flaherty actually can be a free agent after this
season but the Rays are actively trying to lock him up. They
already agreed to a two-year, $12 million extension with McGriff.
The reason for all this, the Rays say, is disappointing attendance
(they'll end up about 1.6 million compared to 2.4 last year). Also,
as part of their expansion agreement, the Devil Rays and
Diamondbacks don't share TV money for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Making a pitch: David Wells, who beat the Red Sox on Tuesday,
isn't buying all the talk about how the Blue Jays will have to dump
pitching to pay for Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green, who can become
free agents after next season. ``You can have all the guys you want
hitting 50 homers but you're not going to win,'' Wells said.
``You've got to have pitching and good defense.'' Wells points to
the Jays' $43 million payroll as a bargain. He also knows rookie
Roy Halladay came out of Sunday's start with a strained right
pectoral muscle. Toronto already has lost Joey Hamilton and Chris
Carpenter for the season. Halladay, a promising 8-7 with a 3.92
ERA, is now 0-3 for 10 starts dating back to his last win, July 31.

 &HT;    Judge earns renown for Branch Davidian cases
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco
has a decidedly no-nonsense image. But friends such as 170th State
District Judge Joe Johnson and attorney Noley Bice firmly insist
Smith is ``a good guy'' who can take a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson does add the disclaimer, ``Not that I would try that in
his court.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Marlin doctor, Smith, 58, tried law school at
Baylor University while waiting to get back his tests for medical
school. He forgot all about medicine and graduated in 1966 with a
law degree. A long line of achievements followed: Smith became a
partner in a law firm and received appointment as Waco's 54th State
District judge and, later, as U.S. magistrate. Topping it off, in
1984 the U.S. Senate confirmed Smith as Waco's first federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   But presiding over the Branch Davidian cases will be Smith's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Smith received national exposure in 1994 during the criminal
trial of 11 Branch Davidians accused of conspiring to murder the
ATF agents who raided their residence outside Waco. A jury cleared
the Davidians, although convicting seven of them of lesser charges.
Smith earned the wrath of some people when he upheld a prosecution
motion to reinstate the weapons charges, adding as much as 30 years
to the sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting his rulings in the upcoming wrongful-death lawsuit by
surviving Davidians may not be as easy as some may think, however.
</P>
<P>
   His history shows that it's best not to make too many snap
judgments about Smith.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Smith was a Republican in McLennan County when it
wasn't cool but also once worked at the Waco Legal Aid Clinic _ at
a time when some conservatives saw such clinics as borderline
subversive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't surprise me,'' said Bice, for whom Smith once
worked. ``If you sat down and talked to Walter, you'd find out that
he's all for people without means being represented. However, I'm
sure he wasn't a rubber stamp for everything they did.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering what Smith thinks about his time there,
you'll have to ask him. But not if you're with the media.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter who recently tried to surmount the
wall of silence around Smith found herself pondering whether she
remembered the way out of the federal courthouse or needed an
escort by security.
</P>
<P>
   People like J.C. Chatmas of Marlin, however, don't mind talking
about Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good, clean-cut kid,'' said Chatmas, who once owned
the Marlin Daily Democrat. ``Played in the band. Never got into
trouble. His grandfather was a doctor. His father, Walter Smith,
was a doctor, too. His mother was a schoolteacher. They were
leaders in Marlin, both civic and socially.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bice gleefully notes, the family also raised pigs _ with
Smith and his brother Jack doing most of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Chatmas confirms it, albeit a tad reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they raised pigs,'' Chatmas said. ``Although I don't know
if I ought to be telling that about the family of a federal judge.
I do remember they were the first ones around here to have an
air-conditioned pig sty. I used to write a one-liner column. I had
a few gibes in there about that. It was in good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   After Smith came to Waco and received his law degree, he
practiced law for a short time at the law firm of Dunnam &AMP; Dunnam.
Bill Dunnam said he hired Smith for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smart,'' Dunnam said. ``He had a damn fine legal
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunnam said Smith was active politically, eventually becoming
chairman of the McLennan County Republican Party. His activism in
1980 got Smith appointed to replace Carl Anderson as the judge in
Waco's 54th State District Court.
</P>
<P>
   It also led to Smith getting beaten two years later at the polls
by George Allen, Dunnam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he ought to run on the Democratic ticket,'' Dunnam
said. ``He said that he had told the governor (Bill Clements) that
he'd run on the Republican ticket. He had enough honor to keep his
word, although he knew he couldn't win. At the time, no Republican
had won a county-wide race.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Waco Mayor Bob Sheehy was Smith's campaign manager in
that race _ although a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew him and his family and thought he was a good judge,''
Sheehy said. ``Obviously, there weren't enough Republicans in
McLennan County to get him elected, and he needed help on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also lost a race for state representative. But his
political ties paid off again with an appointment as a federal
magistrate. After Smith served a year in the job, Sen. John Tower
of Texas nominated him to become Waco's first federal judge. Smith,
who had not yet put a gag order on himself, candidly summed up his
right stuff for the Waco Tribune-Herald: ``You have to be a strong
supporter of the senator making the recommendation; the right party
has to be in the White House; and you have to live in the area
where the judgeship is being created.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunnam remembers being questioned by the FBI on Smith's fitness
to be a judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were concerned whether he had any prejudices,'' Dunnam
said. ``I told them that he was the first lawyer in Waco to file a
lawsuit on behalf of a woman for sexual discrimination. The woman
worked at General Tire. That seemed to satisfy them.''
</P>
<P>
   After his appointment, Smith quickly became known as a stickler
for judicial decorum.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Robert M. Campbell, former associate justice of the
Texas Supreme Court, poked fun at Smith's air of formality by
addressing him at a roast as, ``Your Excellency.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiles, by and large, are left at the door to Smith's courtroom.
Men must wear a coat; women, dresses or a suit. A slew of blue
coats line the wall outside for the forgetful. Media trying on one,
however, get a shake of the head from security. Smith hasn't
forgotten that coats flew out of the courthouse when a flock of
national media descended on the federal courthouse following the
raid on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   That long memory sometimes extends to grudges. Smith once
snubbed a public official, a political foe, offering to shake his
hand at a Waco restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith can also be disarmingly cordial, said Gary Coker, the
attorney who in 1988 successfully defended David Koresh and seven
of his followers from the charge that they attempted to kill
Koresh's rival, George Roden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unfailingly polite,'' Coker said. ``I had a case before
him the other day. After everyone had left, he shed his robe and
just sat down and talked for awhile. I appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those coming across Smith's stern countenance, though, may
question friends' description of him as ``a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his wife and I and my wife happened to sit together at
the dance celebrating Waco's 150th anniversary,'' Sheehy said. ``We
liked the music enough that we were all dancing when everyone else
had gone home. I'm not talking cheek to cheek. I'm talking about
getting out there and jumping around. He's a real human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Bice said Smith likes to hunt and work with wood. He built an
addition onto his Woodway home, Bice said, joking that he had to
buy up all the redwood in McLennan County to finish it. Now, Smith
and his wife, Brenda, are making stained-glass windows for the
addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who if he gets it in his mind he wants to
do something, he'll read a lot about it and then set out to do it
on his own,'' Bice said.
</P>
<P>
   Court personnel said they are always struck by the deference
Smith shows the jurors in his courtroom. The impatience sometimes
evident in his voice when dealing with attorneys vanishes, replaced
by tones of warmth and sincerity as he carefully explains to jurors
their duties and thanks them for their service to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Smith's reverence for jurors, he's not shy about
overturning their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a jury awarded former Waco Police Sgt. Mike Nicoletti
$1.4 million after he accused former police Chief Larry Scott of
illegally transferring him after a falling out between them. Smith
threw out the award, calling it excessive. Two years later, a trial
was held for damages only. The plaintiffs weren't allowed to
present any witnesses to portray what they considered the
vindictive atmosphere of the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Cullar compared it to trying a case ``to some
degree in a vacuum.'' Nicoletti's award was slashed to $35,601.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has also tossed out awards given to employees suing the
Waco Independent School District and the Salado Independent School
District _ earning him a reputation as a pro-government judge.
</P>
<P>
   Bice doesn't think that's a fair judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe he rules based on what side you're on,'' Bice
said. ``I do think he is not as out to allow runaway damages. I
think if you proved $600,000 in medical damages, he would not
hesitate to award that to you. But he's not as sympathetic toward
awarding damages for pain and suffering. He strives to award what
the law considers fair and reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even attorneys who have clashed with Smith have called him fair
_ although some like Doug Tinker of Corpus Christi qualify their
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said before that I don't think he can escape his
rearing,'' said Tinker, who represented Davidian Brad Branch five
years ago. ``He's a very conservative man. He went into the trial
thinking the Branch Davidians tried to kill the ATF agents and
couldn't get away from it. I think from the outcome, he was
obviously disappointed in the jury's verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinker credits Smith for giving the Davidians a fair shake
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a serious question as to whether we were
entitled to a self-defense instruction as far as the murder
conspiracy charge,'' Tinker said. ``I was convinced he really
didn't have to give that instruction. It was a close question of
law. I think he was trying to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinker did criticize Smith during the Davidian criminal trial,
however, for not making government attorneys produce evidence that
the plaintiffs were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. (Bill) Johnston or Mr. (Ray) Jahn said, `We don't have
anything like that,' that was the end of it,'' Tinker said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the FBI admitting after six years that it used
incendiary devices at Mount Carmel, Smith won't be as likely to
take the government's word at the upcoming civil trial, Tinker
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who, I think, tries to be fair,'' Tinker said.
``When a man like that finds out he was misled, he can become very
angry. He takes it as a reflection on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to John Danforth, who is heading the
investigation into the FBI's actions at Mount Carmel, Smith wrote
that he hopes the civil proceedings in Waco _ which have been
postponed _ will ``help restore the public's confidence in the
government.''

   Bice said he would only bet that Smith tries to live up to his
sense of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first time before him, he kicked me right in the teeth,''
Bice said. ``It was a civil rights case. He ruled 100 percent
against me. I thought he was in the wrong then, I think he was in
the wrong today. We don't talk about it, but I know he believes in
his heart he was right. ``And we were allowed to present our case.
My only problem with Walter is that he always has the last word,
and I have to live with it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE PLACES HIS HEAD ON THE LINE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Managers say a lot of things _ it's part of their
job _ but Bobby Valentine said something Saturday that went totally
against the managers' handbook. He said that if the Mets do not get
into the playoffs, he should be fired, dismissed, sacked, canned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get into the playoffs, I shouldn't come back,''
the manager offered, essentially out of nowhere after the Mets
stumbled to a 4-2 loss to the Phillies. ``If we don't get there,
that will be an easy decision for someone.''
</P>
<P>
   This was an astonishing statement for any manager, any time, but
particularly considering the Mets' current swoon _ five straight
losses, now caught in a tie with Cincinnati for the wild-card
position, both with 92-63 records.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have is seven games,'' Valentine said. ``All we have to
do is play better than one team,'' referring to the Reds, their
only rival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even a few old crocks in the press, whose memories are
relatively intact, could not recall ever hearing a manager
volunteer that he should not be back if his team lost its edge in
the closing days. Not Charlie Dressen with the 1951 Brooklyn
Dodgers, not Gene Mauch with the 1964 Phillies, not Don Zimmer with
the 1978 Red Sox. And, for that matter, not Bobby Valentine with
the 1998 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also made out the lineup cards last year when the Mets
lost five straight at the very end of the season. If they had won
even one of those five games, they would have finished in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one year later, his team is giving every impression of
doing exactly the same thing. They got lethargic pitching from
Kenny Rogers, almost no hitting, and a few bad breaks Saturday, to
squander all of their lead over the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Valentine did everything but take out a sword from
his locker and promise it would be used in a week or so if the Mets
do not win. Valentine, who has a year left on his contract, did
give himself one modest out, however. He said he would not fall on
the symbolic sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never walked away from anything in my life and I'm not
walking away from this,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, that means he would expect to be fired by the Mets,
either by the general manager, Steve Phillips, or by the owners,
Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   He's got a good point. What message would management be sending
to the players if they retained a manager who presided over a
couple of September swoons? What would be going through their heads
next September?
</P>
<P>
   Still, managers just don't predict their own downfall. But then
again, it was Valentine who predicted, after three of his coaches
were given the chop 55 games into this season, that he himself
would be fired after the next 55 games if the Mets did not
straighten themselves out. They did, and he was not. But now he is
heading for the final week of the season, and putting his neck on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a question to be answered,'' Valentine said,
referring to his blurting out that he should be let go if the Mets
fail to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This morbid prediction caused the general manager to shake his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bobby is doing is showing his leadership,'' Phillips said
with what could be construed as a tight smile of chagrin. ``I'm
glad it's nothing I'm ever going to have to consider. We have seven
great days left in a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was asked if a manager could be theoretically blamed
after two consecutive collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Phillips said. ``Has any team ever had
collapses two years in a row?''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, none come to mind. And certainly, no manager has
the label of having suffered through two straight collapses. But
then again, no manager has left timeless quotes about his deserving
to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever heard of a manager saying that,'' said
John Franco, who, as a media-savvy New Yorker, has absorbed the
lore of a baseball century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby wants to win as much as any of us,'' Franco added.
``He's not alone. You win as a team, you lose as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura called the manager's words ``a nice gesture'' but
could not quite get a handle on what the words were supposed to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective for what?'' Ventura replied to a question. ``No,
it's us. We have to get hits. The manager can't do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine suggested that was not necessarily true. Last fall, a
less capable squad seemed to run out of gas, and Valentine
deflected second-guessing of himself, but Saturday he conceded he
had browbeaten himself because ``I thought I could have done
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he admitted he should have removed Rogers after the
pitcher walked in a third run, but instead Rogers walked in a
fourth run, too. Asked what other decisions he was questioning,
Valentine shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic,'' he said. ``We haven't had a bounce in a
week. We're due for some bounces.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets do not get the lucky bounces, there well could be
one more bounce after the season _ the manager's head plopping onto
the floor. That would be nothing new. What would be totally weird
about this beheading is that the manager himself will have called
for it, an absolute first for baseball.

 &HT;    Georgia edges victory from Central Florida
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ ``We might not be as good as everybody wants us to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Georgia coach Jim Donnan's assessment following
Saturday's game. It seemed an understatement, given the 11th-ranked
Bulldogs' harrowing 24-23 victory over Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was a four-touchdown favorite over the winless Golden
Knights, who had been out-scored 146-50 in their three previous
games. But the Bulldogs needed a missed extra point and a
controversial offensive interference call to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still 3-0. We can learn from this,'' said Donnan,
knowing how such statements are received by Georgia's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna need an armed guard to get back to the dorm,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida was in position to attempt a short, game-winning
field goal in the final seconds. But it never got to try the kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Knights had reached the Georgia 20 with 22 seconds
remaining on quarterback Vic Penn's scramble. They could have
kneeled twice and given Javier Beorlegui a 37-yard field goal
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Mike Kruczek wanted another crack at the end zone.
Penn's pass for Kenny Clark was broken up by cornerback Jeff Harris
in the left front corner of the end zone and Clark was called for
offensive pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   UCF thought the call should have gone the other way. ``I saw
face-guarding. Defensive pass interference, plain and simple,''
Kruczek said. ``And 86,000 thousand people saw the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a good call,'' Donnan said. ``Even if it was
a bad call, I thought it was a good call _ very apropos.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a thinly veiled reference to 102 yards in penalties
against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After another penalty and a sack, UCF was backed up to its 45,
too far out for a field goal. Penn's desperation pass on the last
play was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Kruczek said he went for the end zone because ``I'm not
overwhelmed with confidence in our field goal kicking.'' Beorlegui
missed the extra point that would have tied the score and had a
27-yarder blocked in the second quarter.

GIANTS STEP ON SOME TOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Arizona Diamondbacks might have won the NL
West on Friday night by winning in San Francisco, but the team
still is angry the Giants are saying the D'Backs are headed to the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Although realignment is not scheduled for several years,
baseball is planning a massive shifting of franchises to promote a
more balanced schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance of that happening for 2001,''
Giants owner Peter McGowen said. ``The (players') union, the AL and
I think the NL supports it. Everybody but Jerry Colangelo supports
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo, Arizona's managing general partner, snapped back at
McGowen, saying ``I didn't realize Peter spoke for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan said he believed realignment would entail placing the
D'Backs in the AL West, moving Texas to the AL Central and placing
Tampa Bay in a new NL South. The plan is to have four four-team
divisions in the NL and two four-team and one six-team division in
the AL.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their expansion agreement, the D'Backs and Tampa Bay
can be moved at any time in their first five seasons. Sounds like
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the best: Although Kevin Millwood's no-decision Friday
night cost him a chance to win 20, Atlanta's blossoming
right-hander is expected to be the Braves starter Oct. 5 for Game 1
in the division series. In a rotation dominated by Cy Young Award
winners, Millwood has been the club's best pitcher, going 6-0 since
Aug. 8. Millwood, 22, would have become the third-youngest Brave
this century to reach 20 wins, the youngest since Bill James went
26-7 for the 1914 ``Miracle Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Vindication: With his team just a game behind the Mets for the
wild card, Cincinnati's Greg Vaughn has more on his mind than
revenge. But because Vaughn became history's only player to be
traded after hitting 50 homers, which he did last year to help San
Diego win the National League pennant, he is enjoying the 42 homers
and 111 RBI he has this season just a little more. Though Padres
officials said that they doubted they could re-sign Vaughn, who's
eligible for free agency after this season, Vaughn admitted feeling
slighted when the two teams played earlier in the week. With 13
homers in September, Vaughn is one short of tying the Reds'
one-month record established by Hall of Famer Frank Robinson in
August, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to deal: Although he won't be as hard to move this winter
as the Dodgers' Carlos Perez will ($12 million left through 2001),
Colorado right-hander Darryl Kile will bring some baggage to the
trade market. Kile, who signed a three-year, $24 million contract
as the top free-agent pitcher two seasons ago, has $8 million left
and plenty of lousy numbers. Kile, who flourished with the Houston
Astros, has been shut down for the year with a sore shoulder after
allowing 18 runs in 16 innings in three winless starts. Kile
finished the season 8-13 with a 6.61 ERA, and an amazingly bad 109
walks and 225 hits allowed in 190.2 innings. Throw in six hit
batters, and that's 340 baserunners in 190.2 innings, 1.78
baserunners per inning. In two years with the Rockies, Kile is
21-30 with a 5.84 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Swan song?: Cubs veteran third baseman Gary Gaetti decided at
the last moment not to have surgery to repair torn cartilage in his
left knee, which had been scheduled for Wednesday. He had played in
2,498 games through Tuesday and wants to become the 40th player to
play 2,500 games. But that doesn't mean he's retiring. Gaetti
hasn't ruled out playing next year, especially if Tom Kelly will
take him back for a sentimental journey in Minnesota, where the two
helped win a World Series in 1987. Should Gaetti not play again
after this year, it would be the end of an era. He is the only
player who hits wearing a helmet without an earflap.

HIGH-STRUNG METS READY TO SNAP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Bobby Valentine's face was riven with tension
after the Mets lost by 4-2 to the Phillies Saturday _ their fifth
loss in a row _ and dropped into a tie with Cincinnati for the
National League wild-card berth. Valentine has been drawn tight as
a piano string in the last few weeks, but now the manager seized
the anxiety and twisted it into something surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't go to the playoffs,'' he said, ``I shouldn't come
back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   If you just returned from, say, a trip to a normal baseball
city, Valentine's statement brings you up to date on the state of
the Mets. They are reeling. They are tense. They are in big
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's proclamation came on the heels of another
devastating Mets loss in which their once high-powered offense eked
out only four hits, one of them John Olerud's two-run homer in the
eighth. And a four-game lead for the wild-card spot has disappeared
in five days.
</P>
<P>
   As for Valentine, he has squeezed two provisional dismissals
into one season. The first came in June after three of his coaches
were fired and immediately before his team engineered the
remarkable turnaround that has brought them so close to the
post-season. But that time, Valentine had given himself a much
longer deadline _ the same amount of time his coaches had, 55
games. Now, with just seven games remaining, three against the
dreaded Braves, Valentine threw his arms around the blame and
clutched it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he suspected that General Manager Steve Phillips and his
players would quickly dismiss his mea culpa. But whether his
sentiments were deeply felt or the latest motivational tactic, two
facts remain: a collapse now would cast a long shadow on last
season's fade-out in the final week, and the Mets are doing
everything in the unwritten baseball book to stop their runaway
tumble toward a second disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try not to worry about the guys,'' Valentine said. ``I try
to support them. They're searching for something and I haven't been
able to give it to them. I believe deep down in my bones that we're
going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes before the Mets were due to begin stretching
before the game Saturday, a few veterans had the clubhouse
attendants dismiss the visitors and lock the doors. No manager, no
coaches, no reporters. Just a few minutes of frank talk about
attitude and desire and the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The players-only meeting came two days after Valentine summoned
them together for a meeting after the Braves' three-game sweep
earlier this past week. This meeting seemed to have the same effect
as Valentine's _ none.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the players feel a little cuddlier about each other and
they won't strain so hard to project levity, but their play belies
them. With each day, no amount of group therapy seems to help. Of
course, they're scared.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost what seemed like a sturdy grip on the wild-card
slot.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves' series started last Tuesday, the Mets were just
one behind in the division and up by four games on the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets were not in the top wild-card spot _ or
when they didn't briefly hold the division lead _ was July 21, when
they trailed the Reds by three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura has been instrumental in setting the tone for this
team all season. It is he who adopted the phrase from a song by The
Doors _ ``the mojo's rising'' _ to describe what had been the
ascending season. ``L.A. Woman'' hasn't been heard in the clubhouse
for the last few games _ it's saved for victories _ and Ventura was
asked what's become of the mojo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's stunted,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   It's stopped, along with every other aspect of the Mets' game.
Even Valentine conceded that his players are tight, but if the
failure to overcome the Braves proved embarrassing for them, the
results in this series should be appalling.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are terrible _ they had won just four games this
month until the Mets arrived _ and the Mets are making them look
like the cloning of Chipper Jones and company.
</P>
<P>
   ''You find yourself spinning your wheels,'' said Mike Piazza,
who was 0 for 3 Saturday. ``It's obvious we're at that stage now.
If we're able to get one big hit or one break to get out of the
rut, we can go back to playing the way we know we can. But we're
stuck in neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Kenny Rogers has been in reverse since he tweaked his
hamstring in his last start. Since then, he has a 12.26 earned run
average in the two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Rogers _ who said his hamstring was not a problem _
simply could not find the strike zone. He gave up back to back home
runs to Mike Lieberthal and Rico Brogna in the second inning and in
the third, with two out, walked in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had held off calling on rookie Octavio Dotel, not
wanting to insert him after the third run was in and with the bases
still loaded. Afterward, he admitted he may have waited too long
because Dotel and three other relievers held the Phillies off for
the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most high-powered lineups in baseball _ seven of
their regulars have been over .300 for most of the season _ has
produced just 10 runs in their last five games. Saturday, the Mets,
one day after scoring just two runs on nine hits, were held to just
four hits, and only two runs, both of which came on an
eighth-inning Olerud home run. The winning pitcher was Robert
Person, who had never won nine games the majors before.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had plenty of chances, the best in the eighth, after
the home run. With Piazza and Ventura on, Darryl Hamilton tried a
bunt to move the runners over, only to hit into a force play that
got Piazza at third.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Benny Agbayani then hit a hard liner toward second
base that seemed headed for right field. Ventura took off for
third.
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Doster leaped high and grabbed the shot for one out,
then flipped to shortstop Desi Relaford to finish the inning-ending
double play. It has been that kind of week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's rip it all up and start from here,'' Valentine said of
the deadlock in the wild card. ``All we have to do is play better
than one team.''
</P>
<P>
   After the sixth inning, in which the Mets left the bases loaded,
the Veterans Stadium loudspeakers blared a song by Bruce
Springsteen: ``I'm Going Down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, it seems, as fast as the Mets' fortunes.

NBC   CAPTURES THE IMPROBABLE, DISAPPOINTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Money time came on the 17th. Ben Crenshaw had
a hunch and he played Justin Leonard instead of Jeff Maggert in the
four-ball matches. Johnny Miller, NBC's lead Ryder Cup analyst,
didn't like the decision but it didn't matter. It wasn't his to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's putt would have put his team 1 up with one hole to go.
NBC showed a closeup of Leonard, but he didn't make the shot and
Miller was incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it was short,'' Miller snapped. ``It's time to
get a shovel, dig a hole and get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller later softened his ire by saying Leonard faced immense
pressure. But that, too, didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the United States faced the same deficit
it started with, but it wasn't for a lack of trying and there was
no one better than NBC to capture the moments. And there were
plenty of them Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik's improbable fourth shot on the 12th. Tiger
Woods's crazy second shot on the 11th, between the trees, around
the water, to the green about 200 yards away. Hal Sutton's tee shot
on the 17th and chip shot on the 18th. All of the near-miss putts.
Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Ryder Cup play started, NBC's Dick Enberg had
already struck a pessimistic tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``No side has ever rallied from such a deficit,'' Enberg said.
``The Americans will have to make history.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. It didn't look good in the morning. At the time
Europe was up in two matches, even in a third and had whittled down
Tiger Woods and Steve Pate's lead to 1 up. Even after Sutton and
Jeff Maggert beat Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie to win only the
second match for the Americans, Enberg remained realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebration is more out of desperation,'' Enberg said.
``The other matches don't look so good.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the morning foursomes.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the story of the day was the score. But televison
viewers had the benefit of instanateous updates, unobstructed views
and commentary on match play's ``ebb and flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Enberg was good telling viewers of the back-and-forth scoring,
or as he called it, ``the shifting of the flags.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, the Americans led in all four four-ball
matches. ``Lots of red, white, and blue on the scoreboard,'' Enberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before you knew it, the Europeans were all square in two
matches, with the Americans leading 1 up in the other two.
</P>
<P>
   The score had almost reversed within 30 minutes. Miguel Angel
Jimenez scored birdies on the 4th, 5th, and 6th, highlighting the
European surge in front in three of the matches. Only Phil
Mickelson and Tom Lehman had a lead, and they eventually gave the
Americans their fifth point.
</P>
<P>
   NBC caught the rapid-fire action by combining live shots, a
sparing use of split-screens and briefly delayed tape. (Gotta run
those PGA.com commercials.) In one five-minute run, for instance,
NBC had a good shot of Mickeleson hitting a putt and high-fiving
spectators. The next shot was of Parnevik nailing a putt on the
sixth, prompting Miller to say, ``That's not what the US needed for
him to get confidence back in his putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was at his candid best throughout the day. When he
learned that US captain Crenshaw had selected Leonard to play
during the afternoon instead of Maggert, Miller was openly
displeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonard doesn't have anything going for him,'' Miller said.
``It must have been something where Maggert needed to be fresh for
the singles and didn't want to play in the afternoon. My hunch is
that Leonard needs to go home and watch it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was hard on David Duval as well. ``Maybe it was a good
idea to sit him down for the morning,'' Miller said. ``Give him
some time to work on his game.'' Colin Montgomerie didn't escape:
``He is the best player in Europe. . . but a head case in the US,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shoratge of analysis and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maltbie said that the Americans are playing as if they
have something to lose. ``It's the Europeans that have the Ryder
Cup,'' Maltbie said. ``But the Americans are playing tentative,
their putts are not being hit firmly enough, thus causing them to
constantly come up short.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Gary Koch was more direct. ``The Americans needed more
clutch putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interviews were insightful. Enberg and Miller had a
good one with Lanny Wadkins, the former Ryder Cup player and coach.
Next to Arnold Palmer, Wadkins has the most Ryder Cup appearances
of any American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that the Americans tend to take the
Europeans lightly because they don't know the accomplishments of
the Europeans,'' Wadkins said.
</P>
<P>
   In another good interview, former European team captain Bernard
Gallagher explained that he thought it was a good idea in the
pairings to ``keep playing the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher further said that ``poor play'' caused numerous
changes in the American pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray talked with Mario Lemieux, the owner of the Pittsburgh
Penguins and a scratch golfer, who related the Americans'
predicament at the begining of Saturday. When a team is behind and
starts pressing hard, Lemuieux said, it tends to make bad decisions
and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the same thing in golf,'' Lemieux said. ``You
try to force things, you tend to take more risks and make bad
decisions.''

SPLIT OVER BUCHANAN SPLINTERS REFORM PARTY CONVENTION  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn._ The national chairman-elect of the Reform Party
briefly walked out of the party's Connecticut state convention
Saturday after organizers refused to admit a wing of the party
worried about the rising influence of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of just such a debacle had caused Reform Party leaders in
New Hampshire to postpone a state convention scheduled for
Saturday, after they learned that Buchanan's forces planned to
deploy enough people to determine the outcome of elections for six
statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   The internal squabbling long preceded Buchanan's statements that
he might abandon his bid for the Republican presidential nomination
to seek the Reform Party nomination. But the passion for and
against Buchanan has drawn starker and deeper lines in a young
party that is struggling to become a fixture in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman-elect, John Gargan, has become a big star in the
party since Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota endorsed his candidacy.
But Gargan never got to the head table of Saturday's banquet, held
in the Art Deco splendor of the Polish National Home. After
organizers refused to let a group of dissidents listen to his
speech unless they paid $25 to eat, Gargan left and said he was
going to ``go get a hot dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of principle, I can't talk to half the group,''
said Gargan, who had traveled from his Cedar Key, Fla., home for
the occasion. ``This party is open to everybody, whether they have
a dollar or nothing or a thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan said he had come ``as a peacemaker.'' Explaining the
difficulty of his task, he began describing four major factions in
the national party, as if he were explaining the Middle East.
``We're learning a lot of things the hard way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Connecticut party's controlling wing dined on
sauerkraut and kielbasa in the ballroom, Gargan went downstairs to
eat with the rejects, who had come up from Fairfield County. Their
leader, Kenneth Jones, of Monroe, said he believed that his group
was being excluded because it had questioned whether Buchanan's
brigade would dilute the party's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any objection to Pat what's-his-name _
Buchanan,'' said Jones, 60, the owner of a fish-and-chips shop.
``But don't stack the deck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut party chairman, Robert Davidson, defended his
handling of the matter. Standing beneath a sign that said,
``Admission by Ticket Only!'' with his national chairman-elect in
exile downstairs, Davidson said he was just concerned about
``people trying to promote their own agenda instead of the Reform
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said he was worried about paying for the hall, although
he had already sold more than the 65 tickets required to break
even. ``There was nothing done in a closet,'' he said. ``Everyone
knew the requirements.'' Davidson then offered to postpone Gargan's
speech until after the banquet, so the dissidents could be
included. Gargan accepted and spoke three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the party wrangling to the Cold War, Gargan called in
his speech for detente. ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' he said. ``We
have a severe problem in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the division, the parliamentary rules for the
convention were approved by a 50-to-46 vote. During one debate, two
members got into a hissing match, telling each other to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the room, books by Ross Perot, the party's
founder, were being sold for 50 cents. Onstage, a banner said,
``Ross Was Right,'' and the past tense was pointed.
</P>
<P>
   The party offered delegates the chance to pose with a life-size
cardboard cutout of Perot for $4, but there were few takers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was all about Buchanan. One of his longtime supporters,
Peter Sullivan, 60, of Fairfield, was attending his first Reform
Party event. He kept a red-and-white Buchanan cap in his pocket,
until he realized this was friendly turf and he could display it
freely.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Leka, 70, of Bridgeport, said Buchanan could help turn a
fledgling party into a major one. ``He'll give us legitimacy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bowman, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from
Melbourne Beach, Fla., who is also seeking the party's presidential
nomination, said of Buchanan: ``He has a big name and big money.
That's just enough for a spectacular failed candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker was Pat Choate, who was Perot's running mate
in 1996 and Buchanan's main conduit to the party. Choate did not
mention his man's name, but provided a rationale for the party to
embrace Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues that we're not going to agree with each other
on,'' Choate said. ``But the real overarching thing that all of us
have got to focus on is real political reform.''

NICHOLAS SHOUMATOFF, 81, NATURE ENTHUSIAST AND MOUNTAIN CLIMBER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nicholas Shoumatoff, a nature enthusiast and mountain
climber who won praise for a book on Central Asia, died on Sept. 13
at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was
81 and lived in Bedford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stomach tumor, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   A butterfly subspecies, Shoumatoff's hairstreak, was named after
Shoumatoff, who served as president of the New York Entomological
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Shoumatoff, whose Russian family name is pronounced SHOO-ma-toff
in the United States, was a native New Yorker. When he was a
teen-ager, he went on entomological expeditions to Jamaica, N.Y.,
with his uncle, Andre Avinoff, director of the Carnegie Museum of
Natural History in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Shoumatoff received a bachelor's degree in 1939 in mechanical
and electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. After Navy service in World War II, he worked for years
in the pulp and paper industry and oversaw the building of mills in
more than a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
   He also climbed mountains in Central Asia and elsewhere. He and
his wife, the former Nina Adamovitch, edited ``Around the Roof of
the World'' (1995, University of Michigan Press), an anthology of
writings about Central Asia by Russian scientists and climbers.
Publishers Weekly said in praise that ``armchair travelers'' could
``enjoy an exotic ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Another book, ``The Alps: Europe's Mountain Heart,'' which
Shoumatoff wrote, is tentatively scheduled to come out in May.
</P>
<P>
   He married his wife in in 1941. She died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Nicholas Avinoff Shoumatoff, of
Bedford, and Alexander, of Keene Valley, N.Y.; a daughter, Antonia
Shoumatoff-Foster, of Wassaic, N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.

HATTEBERG CATCHING UP ON THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg is trying to make up for lost time after elbow
surgery cost him most of this season.
</P>
<P>
   After catching Saturday's 4-1 Red Sox win over the Orioles,
Hatteberg was taking extra hitting and lifting weights. When he
appeared before the media, he was sweating and a bit out of breath,
but he had a look of satisfaction. The road back was long, but
finally some rewards are being reaped.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg not only hit a solo homer, his first of the season off
Doug Linton to give the Sox a 1-0 lead in the third, he also threw
out fellow catcher Mike Figga in the third. Figga had singled to
right off Ramon Martinez and tried for second on a botched
hit-and-run with Mike Bordick at the plate. Hatteberg's throw gave
Martinez a three-batter inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that my arm is feeling stronger and stronger,'' said
Hatteberg. ``The last thing that comes is touch and finesse and
full feeling. It's getting closer to normal every day, when
everything just happens and the body goes back to what it's used to
doing. My arm feels great. It's just a matter of repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg had thrown out 3 of 23 runners before nabbing Figga,
but considering the reconstructive surgery on his elbow in May,
what he did in late September was fairly significant.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg hasn't missed a beat at the plate. He's hit safely in
nine of his last 10 games, at a .378 clip, since returning from the
60-day disabled list Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel DHing for a few days and helping me see some live
pitching on a regular basis helped my swing and my timing,'' he
said. ``It's not quite as easy as riding a bike, but it feels
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his homer, Hatteberg said he got a good changeup to hit on a
1-and-1 count, and ``I got it up in the air and hit it pretty
well.'' Hatteberg hit it into the Red Sox bullpen, 415 feet away.
In the eighth, he drove in the fourth Boston run with a single to
right on a well-hit ball that took a ``Friendly Fenway'' hop and
darted past the infield.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest job of the day was catching Martinez, whom he
caught during one of the pitcher's rehabilitation assignments in
the minors as well as a late-August simulated game at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish everybody could have seen him from where I saw him and
from where he began,'' said Hatteberg. ``He's come so far. Today
was another step along the way. That's a good lineup and he never
gave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``His velocity was better than it's been. He was outstanding.
His fastball was good, at times great. When he needed it, he hopped
it up a few miles an hour, and when you can do that you know his
arm is feeling good again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg didn't have to signal for many pitches other than
fastballs. Martinez mixed only a few changeups and even fewer
curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mixing it up some, but he threw a lot of fastballs
because his location was so good we didn't have to throw a lot of
changeups or breaking pitches,'' said Hatteberg. ``It's a big bonus
if he keeps throwing it like he did. If he can do this in the
playoffs, he can help us a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did today was he was able to throw a big pitch to
avoid a big inning. The guy has confidence in himself. He can draw
from his past experience in those situations. It was fun to catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was fun for the Red Sox to watch Hatteberg hit, catch, and
throw the way he did in the past.

STATS TAKE AIR OUT OF KICKERS' ARGUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two weekends of play, you were supposed to understand why
former Jets kicker Nick Lowery, a normally mild-mannered Dartmouth
graduate, threatened to slap a Patriot ballboy silly a couple of
years back for refusing to hand Lowery ``the other'' football
before an important kick.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other'' football, of course, was the loaded one. It was
the one that had been heated in a dryer or stashed next to a
hot-air blower on the sidelines or slammed and cuffed against a
concrete wall for 30 minutes or kneaded like a cramped muscle or
microwaved a few times. Or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   It was the one that kickers all over the NFL kicked, especially
when they were playing at home. It was the hot ball or, more
correctly, the long ball. What it wasn't, according to the league's
guardian of the game, George Young, was the ball everyone else was
playing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're asking is that the kickers kick with a regulation
NFL football,'' said the former Giants general manager and present
NFL senior vice president of football operations, explaining this
year's rule change. ``When they complain like they have been, what
are they saying? That they've been cheating all along?''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, yes, but don't tell anybody. As more and more kickoffs
sailed into _ and in some cases through _ the end zone, fewer and
fewer were being returned. Same with punts, which more and more
were sailing higher and deeper and taking away one of the game's
most exciting plays.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the line of scrimmage for kickoffs was moved back to
the 30-yard line and the kicking tee was reduced in height, but
when that didn't make much of a dent in the problem, the league's
Competition Committee began looking into what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   When they did, they heard complaints about footballs being
pumped up until they nearly exploded, then deflated and re-pumped.
They heard stories about footballs being put inside a convection
oven and microwaved to soften the leather. They heard about
footballs bouncing around inside a dryer on game day, heating up so
they would expand, and then being deflated and softened.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time this was not considered a major problem. But
things got out of hand. Often the search for a loophole ends up
with a noose, and the place mentioned most often as the hangman's
corner was Minnesota, where punter/kickoff specialist Mitch Berger
had allegedly become the Dr. Frankenstein of kicking science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kicking a new ball hurts your foot,'' said Patriots punter Lee
Johnson. ``It just doesn't go as far. Kickers would do anything to
try and soften the ball. I've heard of guys beating on them with
weights before a game or microwaving them, but in Minnesota it got
ridiculous. Look at Mitch's touchback ratio.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Berger blasted 40 kickoffs for touchbacks, an
average of 2 1/2 per game. That was an NFL record for touchbacks
since the kickoff was moved back to the 30, breaking John Hall's
mark by 11.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the pristine ball, Berger has only four
touchbacks in two games, which would give him 32 for the year. That
comes despite his protests of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic theory is they don't want us to do our jobs as well
as we do them,'' groused Berger's teammate, field goal kicker Gary
Anderson. ``A quarterback is going to throw one ball but as soon as
it comes time to punt or kick a field goal, they're going to whip a
different ball out there so we can't kick it as well. It's like
telling a tennis player with a really good serve, `We're going to
give you a soft ball so you can't serve as hard.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who was perfect as a field goal kicker last season
until he missed a key attempt in the NFC championship game, makes a
spirited defense of doctored footballs, but the reality is actually
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the 36 game balls would arrive at the stadium on
Friday, and the quarterbacks and kickers would be free to work with
them for two days to get the sheen off and make them less slippery.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctoring _ or softening _ of the balls by some kickers
got so ridiculous, according to several old NFL hands, that
quarterbacks complained that they ended up with a ball that was
fatter than a pumpkin and softer than a bad tomato. In the NFL,
when the quarterback complains, people listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the quarterbacks to be comfortable with the balls we
use in a game,'' said Young. ``And we want everyone to be on a
level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an anti-kicker rule. You have to have the same
rules for all. They don't like to hear it but the fact is some of
them were cheating and now it's coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the purge of the ``other'' ball. Now the game balls
remain fresh and unopened until the officials get them on Sunday.
They work off the waxy film, mark the balls with a ``K,'' and keep
them under lock and key until game time.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the new balls was supposed to be devastating, if
you believed the kickers. Some speculated that kickoffs would be
down 10-15 yards and teams would be starting drives regularly at
their 35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine with most offensive coordinators, but it wasn't
appealing to the kickers' sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rule will definitely detract from touchbacks,'' said
Baltimore kicker Matt Stover over the summer. ``The brand-new ball
goes a shorter distance, hands down. You don't get as much
compression on the ball or as much control.''
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition season, statistics about length of kickoffs
and punts and return yardage were meaningless because teams were
using so many different kickers and special teams players. But now
the real kickers are kicking, and the kickers' fears have not been
realized. At least not unless your name is Mitch Berger.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the average NFL kickoff return was 22.3 yards. The
average punt return was 10 yards. The average punt was 43.2 yards
gross. This season, the average kickoff return is 21.8 yards. The
average punt return is 8.1 yards. The average punt is sailing 42.4
yards gross.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, returns are down. But what of kickoff distance?
According to the Elias Sports Bureau in New York, there has been
only a minimal change in where teams start their first drive, and
actually an increase in touchbacks (although not in Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average drive after a kickoff began at the
26.3-yard line. This year, it is beginning at the 26.6-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   As for touchbacks, 16.3 percent of kickoffs resulted in
touchbacks last year. This year, that is up slightly to 17.2
percent. The only caveat, according to Elias, is that two games is
not a significant sampling, and kicking is always better in
September and October than November and December, when the air is
colder and the conditions often wetter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is what Young felt would happen all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this to level the playing field, not to lengthen
returns,'' Young said. ``You don't want one or two teams having a
significant advantage over everyone else because of the balls, and
in the opinion of some of the players, they were rigging the balls.
They don't have a right to doctor the balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not mad at the kickers. People try to get an edge. We
try to bring it back when one side gets too much of an edge. I felt
all along it would work itself out. Under this rule the kickers who
kick well will do fine. The bad ones will struggle. They kept
saying there wouldn't be any more 50-yard field goals too. Who are
they kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, there have already been eight field goals
of 50 yards or longer. All were kicked with a pristine,
NFL-sanctioned, microwave-free football. But that doesn't mean
kickers didn't find something to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, they're all whispering that the number of
missed field goals is up because of the slick new balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until the weather gets bad,'' Green Bay kicker Ryan
Longwell said.
</P>
<P>
   What Longwell didn't know was that field goal accuracy also was
up slightly over last season.
</P>
<P>
   George Young was not surprised to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Two feet are better than one
</P>
<P>
   The importance of field position after the kickoff couldn't be
clearer than it is in Jacksonville, where head coach Tom Coughlin
continues to employ two placekickers, Mike Hollis for field goals
and Steve Lindsey for kickoffs. In the exhibition season, Lindsey
put 11 of his 18 kickoffs into the end zone. In the seasons's first
two weeks, he put 8 of 15 there, with five ending up as touchbacks
. . . It appears that ex-Colts quarterback Art Schlichter has the
gambling bug about as bad as can be. Only a week after being
released early from an Indiana prison, where he had served nearly
two years on theft, forgery, and fraud charges in connection with
an $800,000 gambling debt, he was charged with using a prison pay
phone to bet on football and hockey games with a Las Vegas
bookmaker last November. Schlichter, who denies the charges, goes
on trial Nov. 17. While in prison, Schlichter, the former Ohio
State All-American, earned two degrees from Indiana University and
reportedly was working to turn his life around. He was suspended by
the NFL in 1983 after admitting he had been threatened by
bookmakers over a $150,000 gambling debt . . . San Diego's decision
not to put quarterback Ryan Leaf on injured reserve was not simply
a cave-in to the petulant Leaf, who threatened to demand a trade if
he was not on the active roster despite his shoulder injury. Fact
is, the Chargers expect him to begin soft-tossing next week and
full throwing under close supervision in about two weeks. He could
be activated by Nov. 7, the season's halfway point, although coach
Mike Riley has given him no assurances he will be on the field. To
keep Leaf involved, Riley has Leaf giving the signals from the
sidelines to the quarterback after he gets the play called from the
press box . . . According to Broncos publicists, former Denver
quarterback John Elway directed 18 fourth-quarter comebacks in his
first seven NFL seasons. Drew Bledsoe has directed 14, with 14
games to go in his seventh season . . . When Cleveland head coach
Chris Palmer was told about the rise of young Michael Bishop in New
England and the call of some fans and media members to get him into
the lineup, the ex-Patriot quarterback coach was incredulous.
``What? Drew hasn't won enough games for them?'' Palmer said . . .
Two conflicting streaks will be on the line Sunday when the
Chargers play the Colts. San Diego has not allowed a 100-yard
rusher since Nov. 30, 1997, a stretch of 20 games dating back to
the afternoon Terrell Davis rushed for 178 yards. Conversely,
Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James will try to become the
first man in NFL history to rush for more than 100 yards in each of
his first three games . . . Meanwhile, a limping and sore Ricky
Williams is getting little sympathy from Saints coach Mike Ditka.
Williams is playing with a bad ankle and now a hyperextended elbow,
but when Ditka was asked about Williams's health, he said, ``I
dislocated a shoulder and I played the next week. And it got
dislocated the next week and I played the next week with it and it
got dislocated again. Then I played the next week and it got
dislocated again. Then I got tired of it dislocating, so I put a
brace on it and I played the rest of the season and caught the
highest amount of passes I've ever ever caught in football. But
then, I'm Iron Mike.'' You gotta love that guy . . . The Buccaneers
have allowed a 100-yard rusher only 12 times since Tony Dungy
became head coach in 1996. They're 1-11 in those games, so when
Dungy says they have to stop the run, he's not kidding . . .
Speaking of the Bucs' defense, it is the first since 1986 to not
allow an offensive touchdown in the first two games of a season.
The last team to do it? The Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Raves for a Raven
</P>
<P>
   Remember Qadry Ismail? If you don't, that's not surprising. The
younger brother of Rocket Ismail went the last two years without
catching a single pass in the NFL, but just when it seemed he had
disappeared, he has roared back to be one of the few bright spots
for the Ravens. Ismail leads the Ravens after two games with eight
catches for 99 yards and a score. Those are not big numbers, but
when your line the previous two years was 0-0-0, any number is a
big number. ``These last few years were sort of a wilderness
experience,'' said Ismail. To his credit, he also blames his fall
on himself, claiming that while he was the third receiver in
Minnesota, he consistently refused to listen to the advice of Cris
Carter, one of the game's best and hardest-working receivers. Soon
he had gone from Minnesota to Green Bay to Miami to New Orleans to
the waiver wire to a new awakening that may pay off under his
former coach in Minnesota, new Baltimore head man Brian Billick . .
. Although TV ratings are soaring, problems persist around the NFL.
The league can't get anyone interested in paying to put a team in
Los Angeles; only a corporate ticket splurge prevented a blackout
in Jacksonville; the Raiders have not sold out a home game in two
years (19,000 were left by Thursday night for the home opener with
Chicago); and in San Diego, the city has already spent $1.7 million
to buy unsold tickets to two exhibition games and as well as the
home opener under an agreement that guarantees the team sellouts in
its remodeled stadium. Last year, 25 percent of all NFL games were
blacked out locally because of a lack of sellouts. Part of the
problem is the decision to put teams in towns like Jacksonville,
which has a 73,000-seat stadium but the second-smallest market in
the league, a metropolitan population of barely 1 million. Even
owner Wayne Weaver conceded, ``It appears we're going to have some
blackouts.'' And that's for a team that's 2-0 and facing division
rival Tennessee. The odd thing is, the only reason home games began
being televised in the early 1970s was that Washington politicians
couldn't get tickets to Redskins games and also couldn't see them
on TV. So they enacted a law requiring that sold-out home games be
televised, and now fans have grown so used to it that they're
forgetting the tickets have to be sold first . . . The Arizona
Cardinals opened the season in Philadelphia, while the Arizona
Diamondbacks were hosting the Phillies. Last Sunday, the Cardinals
played the Dolphins in Miami while the Diamondbacks hosted the
Florida Marlins. The Cardinals host the 49ers, while the
Diamondbacks are in San Francisco to play the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   49ers may get shifty
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are contemplating some offensive line shifts after
quarterback Steve Young was hit 21 times last Sunday, including
five times for sacks. Derrick Deese may move from guard to right
tackle and Jeremy Newberry may be headed to the bench. Young has
been sacked nine times in two games . . . If you need another
reason to write off the chances of the Jets this season, consider
this. In his last 66 drives in the NFL, Rick Mirer has led his
teams to one touchdown. He was 1 for 52 with Chicago, didn't play
for Green Bay last year, and is 0 for 14 as a Jet. Anyone with
Scott Zolak's home number, send it to Bill Parcells . . . Ever the
master psychologist, Parcells went ballistic after his team's
lackluster effort in a 17-3 loss to Buffalo last week, but then he
came back and let the Jets practice in shorts and without pads all
week. His thinking? If they lay another egg, they can't complain
that they were overworked . . . Speaking of the Jets,
representatives of team, the Giants, and the MLS MetroStars met
with officials of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority
Friday to talk about installing grass in the Meadowlands full time
next year. Having lost Vinny Testaverde and All-Pro receiver Wayne
Chrebet to turf injuries without being touched, the Jets think it's
a little late . . . Once again, a new broom is sweeping clean. This
time it's in Green Bay, where new head coach Ray Rhodes has rid the
roster of 29 players Mike Holmgren left for him. He has 16 rookies
or first-year players . . . Here's two ends of the coaching
paranoia scale. Pete Carroll had workers tape brown shipping paper
over the windows of the media work room at Foxboro Stadium last
week so no one could watch his team's walk-through sessions. Out in
San Diego, Riley allowed a reporter from the San Diego
Union-Tribune to sit in on coaches' meetings (with the exception of
Saturday night) as the Chargers prepared for their season opener
with Cincinnati last week. The reporter was allowed in from the
time the first coach arrived at 6 a.m. until the last left around
9:30 p.m. each night. The Chargers won, 34-7 . . . Holmgren had
himself a rude awakening last Sunday in Chicago. With three of his
daughters living in Chicago and a fourth in Milwaukee, the
Seahawks' head coach looked into renting them a skybox for his
team's game with the Bears. He was told it would cost $5,000 plus
food costs. Although Holmgren makes $4 million a year, he used to
be a school teacher in San Francisco and still remembers the value
of a dollar. He got his daughters seats in the stands instead. The
Bears claim that when Ditka's Saints come to town, he'll have
friends in a box. And he'll pay the same fee.

BRAVES' ELECTRICITY SOMEHOW SHORT-CIRCUITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine the God of 20th Century Baseball created a
franchise with the player talent, front-office brains and finances
to win 90 games season after season for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose he plopped that team down in the decade in which the
playoff and World Series showcases stretched to nearly a month,
baseball television coverage rose to the saturation point, and the
fascination with sports personalities reached insane levels.
</P>
<P>
   That team couldn't help winning a place among the most revered _
if not beloved _ of our time, could it?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah? Tell that to the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won 90 games in every full season since their
worst-to-first leap in 1991, are closing in on a
major-league-record, eighth-consecutive division title, and have
tied the National League standard for pennants in a six-year period
with four between 1991 and '96. None of which is a big secret.
</P>
<P>
   Yet _ I have no way of proving this _ the Braves seem to inspire
a sort of respectful boredom in the majority of fans. The Braves'
uninterrupted success is almost taken for granted while nine-day
wonders like the '98 Padres and playoff newcomers like this year's
Diamondbacks spark more fascination.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that if you took a fan survey, the Braves could
lose a ``Team of the '90s'' vote to the New York Yankees, who have
won two World Series to Atlanta's one, even though New York didn't
get over .500 for the '90s until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine's ``chicks dig the
long ball'' commercials make fun of the Braves' shortage of sex
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that if Heather Locklear and the average baseball
fan don't give the Braves the attention they deserve, it's not in
spite of the expanded playoff platform, nightly TV exposure and
star-driven marketing. It's because of those phenomena of modern
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs? They've grown _ from one first-place team going
straight to the World Series, to two division winners meeting in
the league championship series for the right to go to the World
Series, and now to three division winners and a wild card playing
off for the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1968, only one in 10 teams played beyond the
regular season. Now it's one in four. You don't have to be a
first-place team _ or even a very good team, as the 84-78 Astros of
1997 demonstrated _ to make the playoffs. The achievement has been
watered down.
</P>
<P>
   What's overlooked, as reporters walk past the Braves to get to
fresher subjects like the 1997 Marlins, is that Atlanta has won the
most games in the league every year starting in 1992 (not counting
strike-shortened 1994). Even in the old days of one division, the
Braves would have made the postseason for seven straight years. The
Yankees never did that.
</P>
<P>
   Television? Having every game on the Turner superstation has
cultivated some new Braves fans around the nation. It also has left
the team overexposed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the Braves were a dreadful club, usually
lucky to stay out of last place in the NL West. But when they made
the occasional appearance on the NBC Game of the Week, you watched
because it was a rare chance to see Hank Aaron, Ralph Garr and
maybe Phil Niekro.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to see players you'd only read about was something
special; they were mysterious and fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, with every Braves game on TV, and highlights
regurgitated all night on ESPN and Fox, there's no urgency to watch
any of it. You can always watch tomorrow. Of course the Braves are
boring. They're too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Personalities? The first Braves World Series team of the decade
was led by Terry Pendleton, Ron Gant and Otis Nixon with the bat
and Glavine, Steve Avery, Juan Berenguer and Alejandro Pena on the
mound. Of them, only Glavine is still with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have been sustained by a remarkably steady personnel
turnover _ Greg Maddux (free agent) joining the team in 1993, Ryan
Klesko (farm system) in '94, Chipper Jones (farm system) in '95,
Denny Neagle (trade) in '96, Andruw Jones (farm system) in '97,
Andres Galarraga (free agent), John Rocker (farm system) and Kevin
Millwood (farm system) in '98, Brian Jordan (free agent) and Mike
Remlinger (trade) this season.
</P>
<P>
   But there's not a scoreboard-busting Mark McGwire or
intimidating Randy Johnson in that group. The Braves' sure Hall of
Famer, Maddux, is a technician, not a showman. Know anybody who
roots for the ground ball to second when Maddux faces McGwire?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they bore the typical fan because they really are boring.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to appreciate what the Braves have done in the '90s
is to look at what has become of their playoff opponents. They've
faced 10 different teams in the NL playoffs (the Pirates twice).
</P>
<P>
   Of those, nine have since had a sub-.500 season, six sinking
into the ``loser'' ranks the very next season after playing the
Braves. Eight have yet to make the playoffs again and five have
since had at least one last-place season. Six have since changed
managers and four have since changed owners.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six teams that defeated the Braves in the playoffs or
World Series, only the Yankees and Padres have avoided finishing
last in their divisions at least once since then. But give the
Padres time; they beat the Braves just last year.
</P>
<P>
   While other teams struggle to put together two back-to-back
playoff appearances, the Braves get ready for _ ho hum _ their
eighth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The decade belongs to them. But it's too bad they didn't come
along earlier, when they might have been better appreciated.

ADVANTAGE GOES TO BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Advantage, Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, coach Tom O'Brien vented his displeasure
about what he perceived to be four ``disadvantaged games'' the Big
East schedule-makers had forced upon the Eagles. O'Brien was
particularly upset that BC had to play three of its first five
conference games against opponents who had an extra week off to
prepare for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, it was apparent that Rutgers could have had a
month off to prepare and it wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   What disadvantage?
</P>
<P>
   In almost every statistical category, BC held a distinct
advantage in its 27-7 victory before a crowd of 27,330 at Rutgers
Stadium. The Eagles improved to 3-0 overall and 1-0 in conference
with a balanced attack that netted 427 yards total offense (243
rushing, 184 passing) and a solid defensive effort that held the
Scarlet Knights (0-3, 0-1) to 307 yards and rang up three
interceptions, including two by by sophomore cornerback Jonathan
Ordway.
</P>
<P>
   For Rutgers, it was just the latest calamity. Last week, the
Scarlet Knights were forced indoors because of Hurricane Floyd and
lost practice time. On Tuesday, coach Terry Shea suspended five
players, including leading rusher Jacki Crooks, for violating team
rules when they missed a practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long we heard that this was a big game for Rutgers
and I challenged the team to make sure we matched their
enthusiasm,'' said O'Brien. ``You have to give Rutgers a lot of
credit because of the hurricane and practice time and getting
organized with all the facilities and everything. Then they suspend
a couple of players and they did a great job and came out and
played extremely hard, but our kids did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior running back Cedric Washington redeemed himself after a
subpar effort in last week's 14-10 victory at Navy by rushing 21
times for 147 yards and a pair of touchdowns (8 and 12 yards).
Meanwhile, junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck continued to show
improvement, completing 17 of 22 passes for 168 yards, including a
21-yard TD pass to DuJuan Daniels that capped an impressive 74-yard
drive (three plays, 1:01).
</P>
<P>
   After BC expanded a 10-0 halftime lead to 13-0 on John Matich's
second field goal of the game, a 35-yarder, Syracuse junior
quarterback Mike McMahon capped a four-play, 72-yard march with a
56-yard TD pass to Errol Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles went them one better, needing one fewer play and 11
fewer seconds to cover almost the same distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always encouraging when you can answer the bell like
that,'' said Hasselbeck.
</P>
<P>
   And it sounded the death knell for the Scarlet Knights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to salute them for coming right down the field and
scoring right after we scored,'' said Rutgers running back Dennis
Thomas. ``That right there was the knife in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing remarkable poise in the pocket, Hasselbeck hit fullback
Ryan Burch with a 15-yard pass, then connected with wideout Dedrick
Dewalt for a huge 38-yard gain to the 21. Hasselbeck capped the
drive with a scoring toss to Daniels, who lunged into the end zone
to make his second TD catch in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt so much more relaxed going into this game than I
did the Baylor game,'' said Hasselbeck. ``I felt like I had better
rhythm and better command of the offense and it always helps when
you're running the ball well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for BC: a home game Saturday against Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, BC's coaching staff will be concerned about the team
losing focus and suffering a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says this was a big game for the Jersey guys, because
they played against some of these guys in high school,'' Hasselbeck
said. ``But for me, this is my chance to play against guys I played
against in high school and guys I know really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're from the area, this is kind of the battle of Boston,
I guess, so I'm not going to need a kick in the butt to get ready
for those guys. I'm as excited to play them as anybody.''

FUTURE BRIGHTENS FOR NEMECHEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, the feel-good story of the NASCAR Winston Cup
season.
</P>
<P>
   And Joe Nemechek, outgoing driver of the Felix Sabates-owned No.
42 BellSouth Chevrolet Monte Carlo, was only too happy to put his
signature on it by winning the Dura Lube/Kmart 300 last weekend at
New Hampshire International Speedway. In his 180th start, Nemechek
authored quite a tome in winning the first Winston Cup race of his
career at NHIS, the same 1-mile oval where he recorded his second
Busch Grand National victory in 1992 _ in a stirring last-lap duel
with Dale Earnhardt, no less _ and where he made his Winston Cup
debut the following year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a bittersweet moment for the Lakeland, Fla.,
native who will celebrate his 36th birthday Sunday when he competes
in the MBNA Gold 400 at Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Nemechek's younger brother, John, died from
injuries sustained in a crash at a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
race at Homestead, Fla. Then, last month, Nemechek lost his ride
with Team Sabco as he and Sabates agreed to part ways at the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still looking for a job for the year 2000,'' said
Nemechek, who finished ahead of runner-up Tony Stewart, the runaway
leader for Rookie of the Year honors who the week before recorded
his first career victory at Richmond, Va. ``I don't know what I'm
going to be doing. Hopefully, this will definitely help. I'm
talking to a few people out there. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that Nemechek was the leading candidate to land
the No. 28 ride at Robert Yates Racing, but that opportunity
evaporated when Yates hired veteran driver Ricky Rudd to replace
Kenny Irwin. With his victory at NHIS, Nemechek could be among the
candidates for A.J. Foyt's team or that of CART owner Cal Welles,
whose sponsorship deal with Tide led to the demise of Rudd's own
operation, Rudd Performance Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Nemechek were to win Sunday's race at Dover, it
would make him a hotter commodity than Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? Felix may come back and start hammering me,''
Nemechek said jokingly. ``I don't know. It's kind of a unique deal.
(Crew chief) Tony Glover and Felix, they've got a heck of an
organization. We just struggled (posting seven top 10 finishes and
one top five in the previous two seasons). Now to have it all come
together, it's kind of disappointing. Who knows what's going to
happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where I end I up, I've got to be in a good quality
ride. If I can't make a step up, I don't know what I'm going to do.
I'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover believes Nemechek won't wait long for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be a driven force to be able to do this, and I
think the things that have happened in the last month have maybe
woken up a sleeping giant,'' said Glover. ``You're going to see a
lot more of Joe Nemechek the balance of '99, and I can assure you,
you'll see a lot of him in years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting reports
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham tried to dispel rampant rumors about his imminent
departure as Jeff Gordon's crew chief when he told John Kernan of
ESPN's ``RPM 2Night'' that he was not leaving Hendrick Motorsports.
Rumors swirled at NHIS last week that Evernham had called his last
race for Gordon because of perceived friction between Evernham and
John Hendrick, the brother of ailing team owner Rick Hendrick. But
Evernham told ESPN, ``There is no friction at all between me, Rick
Hendrick, and Jeff Gordon. We are giving each other our full and
100 percent support. The team is going to Dover this weekend to try
to win another race for Jeff Gordon and Rick Hendrick.'' Evernham,
however, was not in Gordon's pit during Friday's pole
qualifications at Dover, and CNN-SI reported Friday that Evernham
will soon be replaced by mechanic Brian Whitesell . . . Indy Racing
League driver Greg Ray has it all figured out. He knows his magic
number to clinch his first IRL title heading into Sunday's
Vegas.com 500 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the penultimate race of
the season. Ray leads Scott Goodyear by 44 points, 246-202, and
will clinch his first IRL title and the Pep Boys Million bonus if
he has a lead of 56 points after Sunday. ``If I finish 12 points
ahead of Scott, we mathematically win,'' said Ray, who vaulted
ahead of Goodyear Aug. 29 after his victory at Pikes Peak, Colo.,
his third win in four races. ``But you shouldn't count points. You
need to just concentrate and stay focused on the race. If you look
at the last couple of years, mathematically a couple of drivers
could have won the championship but they didn't have very good luck
at the end. So you never know what may happen.'' . . . Willy T.
Ribbs, a two-time veteran of the Indianapolis 500, will make his
IRL debut as driver of a McCormack Motorsports entry. Ribbs will
make history by becoming the first African-American driver to
compete in an IRL race . . . What at first appeared to be the IRL's
gain wound up being its loss when promoters of the Medic Drug Grand
Prix of Cleveland pulled the plug on CART June 29 and opted to go
with IRL. However, when IRL officials announced plans to stage a
race on an oval track at the Burke Lakefront Airport, Cleveland
Mayor Michael R. White withheld his support, citing concerns about
gaining approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for
construction of an oval. Last week, White announced that IMG
Motorsports, the race promoter, had reached a three-year agreement,
thus restoring Cleveland to CART's 2000 schedule. The IRL,
meanwhile, dropped its plans for Cleveland. ``I'm very pleased that
the parties went back to the table and inked this deal,'' White
said. ``This is great news for the city of Cleveland, CART and
racing's most loyal fans.'' . . . CART driver Bryan Herta will try
to give car owner Bobby Rahal his second victory in as many races
in Sunday's Texaco Grand Prix of Houston. Two weeks ago, Herta won
at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, Calif., for the second
consecutive year. He teamed with third-place teammate Max Papis to
give Team Rahal its first ever double-podium finish. Herta's
victory, however, was marred by the death of Penske rookie Gonzalo
Rodriguez, 27, who died of massive head and neck injuries suffered
when his car veered off the course, crossed a gravel pit, slammed
through a tire barrier, and was catapulted into the air before
landing upside-down on a rocky hillside. ``I want to remember
Gonzalo,'' Herta said. ``We did the best thing we could to honor
him. and that was to go out and do the kind of racing he loved.''
In the winner's circle, Herta, runner-up Roberto Moreno, and Papis
opted not to spray champagne in celebration; instead they raised
their bottles in Rodriguez's honor.

RAMON AND RED SOX RETURN TO FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has gone well beyond answering whether he can still pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is this: Will Ramon Martinez catapult the Red
Sox into the World Series, in a potential pitching rotation
anchored by Pedro the Younger and elevated further by the presence
of Bret Saberhagen and lefthander Kent Mercker, the only other Sox
players besides Ramon who own World Series rings?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel pretty darn good, as far as your chances in
October,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said after Martinez, backed
by home runs by Scott Hatteberg, Brian Daubach, and Butch Huskey,
won his first big league game in more than 15 months by beating the
Baltimore Orioles, 4-1, Saturday before another Yawkey Way sellout
(No. 36) of 32,107.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all guys who have been through the wars before, too,''
said Kerrigan. ``They're all different pitchers, and all have
different deliveries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon the Elder, who at the start of the month lasted just three
innings against Kansas City in what looked like a one-and-out
chance to prove himself, was restored to the rotation only because
Pat Rapp had to fly home for the birth of his son Reid Patrick, who
arrived prematurely. Now, it appears that barring a sudden
breakdown in his surgically repaired right shoulder, Martinez has
made himself indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see how it plays out, OK?'' Kerrigan said, cautioning
that the postseason rotation has not been set, even as the Red Sox'
magic number for clinching a wild-card spot was reduced to four,
pending the outcome of the A's game in Texas Saturday night. ``We
still have eight games to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, Kerrigan was as excited as Martinez, who
emotionally is the polar opposite of his excitable-boy younger
brother but thrust his fist overhead as he came off the mound after
finishing the seventh, his last inning of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of moments that I thought I would not pitch
this year,'' said Martinez, who underwent surgery to repair his
rotator cuff a year ago last June 30 and was deemed expendable by
the Dodgers, the team for whom he had won 123 games in his big
league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something to me, in my mind, that I was going out
there deeper into a game, and that we had a chance to win, and I
did my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who threw 98 pitches, allowed the Orioles only four
hits and did not walk a batter. He was at his best in the fourth
inning, when he faced bully-bat Albert Belle with runners on first
and third and no outs and induced Belle to tap into a
pitcher-to-second-to-first double play. A run scored on the play,
but Martinez caught Derrick May looking at a called strike to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the seventh, after B.J. Surhoff led off with a double
and took third on Belle's liner to right, Martinez induced May to
foul to Hatteberg on the first pitch, then retired Jeff Conine on a
one-hopper to Daubach at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you saw him in those situations,'' Kerrigan said,
``that's his M.O. He's known for making great clutch pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez returned to the dugout for the high-fives from his
appreciative teammates, Kerrigan passed along this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was just like the old Dodger days, when I'd be
sitting in the opposing dugout watching him kick our butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always had to get him early. If you didn't get him in the
first or second inning, he'd whip off 18 or 20 in a row. If you
didn't get him early, it was lights out.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as Martinez waited between wins, Hatteberg tarried
between home runs. Giving regular catcher Jason Varitek a rare day
off, Hatteberg homered into the Boston bullpen to give the Sox a
1-0 lead in the third. Hatteberg, who missed more than three months
after elbow surgery, hadn't homered since Sept. 9, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For Daubach, it only seemed that long. The Belleville Basher had
become the Belleville Blusher during a slump that has lasted more
than five weeks, a span in which he is hitting .125 (10 for 80)
with just three RBIs in 26 games. But he hit a 2-and-0 delivery
from Doug Linton into the screen in left-center, his first since
Aug. 14 and 20th of the season, joining Ted Williams and Fred Lynn
as the only lefthanded-hitting Sox rookies to hit 20 or more home
runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty fair company for a guy who supported himself by
selling sporting goods during a decade-long odyssey through the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got one hit,'' said Daubach, who also drew a walk off
lefthanded reliever Doug Johns in the eighth and scored Boston's
final run on Hatteberg's single. ``That doesn't mean I'm out of my
slump, but it's a a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach said it helped that Jimy Williams gave him most of the
last week off, though some would have called his rest a benching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very important to this team,'' said Williams, who
was unafraid to pinch hit Daubach (who whiffed) in Friday night's
1-0 loss, then gave him his first start in 10 days. ``In recent
days he hasn't played, in recent times, but I believe in the kid, I
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey, who launched his 22d home run, seventh with Boston, to
give the Sox a 3-1 lead in the seventh, spoke with the zeal of a
believer when talking about the back-to-back performances by
Saberhagen and Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a confidence-booster,'' Huskey said. ``You
know that any time these guys can pitch a great game for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing for us is to score some runs behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   They scored enough, which made October loom even closer. Game 7
of the World Series is scheduled for Oct. 31. Anyone else wondering
if come Halloween, the Sox will be trick-or-treating in their
uniforms?

REVOLUTION FEELING THE BURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Revolution's 1-0 loss to Dallas Friday night
gave the impression of a team either unable or unwilling to follow
a game plan. More accurately, this was a group of players
uncomfortable with any philosophy of play except directness.
</P>
<P>
   The result was as predictable as the Revolution's offense.
Dallas simply absorbed pressure, then found a couple of holes in
the defense and exploited them. The pattern was similar to when the
Revolution visited Dallas June 25; they were playing very well, but
the Burn adjusted and won, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Revolution must hope for a Miami loss against Columbus
Sunday, then try to overtake the Fusion in the final two games
(against the MetroStars next Sunday and at D.C. United Oct. 9) for
the final Eastern Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario is possible, since the Revolution have not been
suffering hugely demoralizing defeats, despite a 1-13-1 record in
the second half of the season. But there are signs that players are
losing faith in both themselves and their system of play. More
disturbing, the Revolution's ability to read the game has not
improved in three months. There is no balance between
power/strength and guile, pacing, subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   This realization seemed to greatly upset assistant coach
Giuseppe Galderisi, who has been probably the most credible and
supportive member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Galderisi, replacing suspended Walter Zenga, seemed most
disturbed by the Revolution's unwillingness to be patient, which
stemmed from an inability to understand the circumstances of the
game. Galderisi thought the Revolution needed to stick to their
plan, to keep the game wide, away from the clogged midfield. They
needed to sometimes pull back, alter the pace, catch Dallas off
guard. But this team has not collectively understood how to do that
in nearly four seasons, and it was not about to apply any past
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   There were some basic soccer tenets at work. If you are facing a
hot goalkeeper, you might never score against him, but if you let
things degenerate into chaos, you will never gain anything. No
matter who the opponent, there are always vulnerabilities.
Sometimes you must probe for them, though, and they might not
become apparent until late in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution preferred to hammer at Dallas, constantly and
predictably pounding the ball into the penalty area and running
hard to catch up to it. Their frustration became apparent after
Oscar Pareja's 70th-minute goal, and they became even more
predictable, playing into the hands of the Burn.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan had an excellent game, but the
Revolution could not figure out how to make his life difficult.
They played into Jordan's strength near the goal on corners and
crosses, instead of pulling the ball out and trying to catch him
off his line or with a difficult angle to cover. And once the
Revolution fell behind, they began rushing things even more, which
is acceptable if done without panic. A team can increase its speed
of play, but must retain its composure or risk appearing foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game we should have won,'' striker Giovanni
Savarese said. ``But it was a great night for the goalkeeper. Once
we got behind, we needed a goal and everybody went crazy trying to
score. But after that goal, they closed the spaces in the field and
made it more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will get a break from Miami (Sunday) and we will
still have a chance to qualify for the playoffs. There is no
question we have the talent on this team and on the coaching staff.
The question is, when we step on the field, will we do what we are
supposed to do?''

IT'S A RUSH JOB FOR MCGINEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ He knows they're waiting on him, but Willie
McGinest has been waiting on himself far longer. Waiting for two
years. Waiting for 28 years. Waiting to explode on the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Once that was a young boy's dream, one he shared with his
father, Big Willie, who dreamed it bigger than his son did. Dreamed
it when he would leash his son to the family dogs and take the boy
of 10 out to run the streets after a day of football practice, out
to run for his life.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie McGinest stopped running, the father kept going
knowing what would happen next. The dogs would keep going, too,
chasing the master of the house, dragging a small boy behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me I could keep up or get dragged,'' McGinest
said. ``You learn to keep up. He'd never had the chances I had in
sports but he could see my potential and he wanted me to reach
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the boy kept getting up to run some more, half sprinting,
half being pulled along, until he was finally ahead of the pack.
All-State in football and basketball at Long Beach Polytechnic in
Southern California. All-Pac-10 and Playboy All-America at USC. No.
1 draft choice of the New England Patriots. All-Rookie team.
All-Pro two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Always running.
</P>
<P>
   Until he couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't move right. Couldn't move left. Couldn't move forward.
Couldn't have moved if the dogs had come back to drag him through
the dust.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd thing, not being able to move when you've been
moving all your life. Odd, but not funny.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating. But not funny.
</P>
<P>
   Not one bit funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it hurt me not to play?'' McGinest said when asked to
recall the last two seasons, when a screaming groin muscle caused
him to miss 13 games _ nearly a full season. So many games people
began to wonder whether the dogs had gotten to him this time,
sending him down so often he would never get up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it hurt me?'' he said again, a quizzical smile on his
face. ``I was wearing it every day on my face, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he was.
</P>
<P>
   Anger. Worry. Frustration. All etched on the face of a young man
who one day was living his father's dream and the next was living
his own nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in that situation, you can't help but put pressure
on yourself,'' said Chris Slade, McGinest's friend and quarterback
sackmate. ``You try not to get caught up in it but he's a very
competitive guy. Of course it hurt to go from the Pro Bowl to not
being able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurt though it might, that is the direction McGinest's life took
not long after his 9 1/2-sack season in 1996, the season he helped
lead the Patriots to Super Bowl XXXI, the second half of a two-year
blitz in which he registered 20 sacks and made clear he could do
some damage when things were right.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was rosy then, nothing but open road to Hawaii in
February ahead of him. And then, just when he thought he was
running free, his knee, his hamstring, and finally his groin began
to argue with him about life in the NFL. One after another they
conspired against him, dragging him down the way the dogs had all
those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as they did, McGinest kept remembering the lesson of the
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Went down.
</P>
<P>
   Got up.
</P>
<P>
   Went down.
</P>
<P>
   Got up.
</P>
<P>
   Went down for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Got up, but wasn't the same now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been here, he's only played in about half the
games,'' said Patriots defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell. ``In
some of those games he was just a shell of what he is now. He's
always given really good effort but at times he dropped out of
sight due to his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a prototypical speed pass rusher. He has really rare
quickness and he really plays hard. But how well can you play when
you can't move?''
</P>
<P>
   Not too well and not too often. Not often enough or well enough
to justify to some the five-year, $25 million contract he signed
two years ago, a contract that sometimes had to seem as heavy as
some of the offensive linemen who hang on him whenever he's
fighting his way to the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Finally tiring of this cycle of injury, rehabilitation, and
reinjury, McGinest talked with Shaquille O'Neal after last season
had degenerated into another lost year with a balky groin that kept
him in street clothes for seven of the Patriots' 16 games. The
Lakers' center had come back from similar problems and he gave
McGinest the same advice Horace Greeley gave the country's young
men a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go West, young man,'' O'Neal said, although in this case it
was west-northwest to Vancouver, British Columbia. To an athletic
medicine man named Alex McKechnie.
</P>
<P>
   McKechnie, a physical therapist who specializes in lower-body
injuries, worked with McGinest to strengthen his inner thighs and
his stomach muscles, and when pain persisted, McGinest had team
doctor Bert Zarins perform a ``small procedure,'' as they like to
call surgery in the NFL, to relieve some of the pressure on the
groin muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to stretching and abdominal exercises and hope.
Hope that 1999 would be different.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into the year it has been, but two games are just the
start of the race. Although McGinest already has been named AFC
Defensive Player of the Week once (for his two sacks, one pressure,
forced fumble, and fumble recovery for a touchdown against the
Jets), he knows better than most that the dogs have just begun to
run.
</P>
<P>
   He always could keep up with Big Willie at the start. Same way
the past two years with the Patriots. But can he keep running all
season anymore?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel quick, but it's too early to tell how it will go,''
McGinest said. ``It's only two games. I was on fire the first game
and I played pretty good in the second against a guy (Colts
quarterback Peyton Manning) who isn't going to get sacked ever,
even if you come scot-free. He just won't have it. We'll see how it
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   When McGinest is healthy and getting after the quarterback with
his speed rushes, things go pretty well for the Patriots' defense.
He is, when he's right and running, a disruptive force who can
change a game because he can destroy a quarterback's faith and an
offense's timing.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest knows this. Knows it because he has been that kind of
player all his life, all the way back to Pop Warner football when
playing the game seemed a lot less threatening than going for a run
with his father and the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overwhelmed to have a couple of sacks,'' McGinest
said. ``When I'm healthy, it's nothing new to me to make plays.
It's just hard to make plays on one leg. This is a violent sport.
People get hurt. I understand that. I just want to play 16 games
and be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, McGinest continues the regimen of exercises
McKechnie taught him. To help, McKechnie sent a video to Patriots
strength coach Johnny Parker so he could monitor McGinest, who from
time to time still talks with McKechnie. But mostly he's on his own
now, doing the work when no one is watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I came back too soon and got hurt again and then
came back too soon again and the problem became chronic,'' McGinest
said. ``But not being out there on the field when I'm supposed to
be one of the people the team is counting on didn't make me feel
good. So I tried. People don't know the work I've done. That's why
the last two years I've been totally frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely he has and just as surely few people understood how hard
he was working to avoid that, although anyone who looks at him
shirtless understands this is a man to whom body fat is a foreign
concept.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is a new season. Two weeks old and counting. A season
that has started out well for everyone because McGinest has started
out on two good legs. If he can continue that way, without the dogs
of the NFL dragging him down again, Sidwell believes he knows what
will result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around some good outside pass rushers now (having
coached Ricky Jackson and Pat Swilling, two of the best in history,
in New Orleans),'' Sidwell said. ``With his quickness, Willie's the
kind of guy who can be very disruptive to an offense. He's a guy
we're counting on.''
</P>
<P>
   They're all waiting on McGinest this year. Waiting for him to
explode. His opponents as well as his teammates. Waiting to see if
he can get up and run again.
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest is waiting too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just happy to be out there,'' he said. ``Happy
to just play hard. I just want to stay silent and play violent.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, it won't be silent around him for long.

IT'S NOT REALLY A DEAD END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm crying ``Uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   I surrender. Put all of us out of our misery.
</P>
<P>
   Just sign Byron Dafoe. Sign him and put an end to this tap
dance, waltz, tango, game of chicken, or whatever you want to call
it.
</P>
<P>
   He's going to get somewhere close to $10.5 million over three
years, the middle point between the Bruins' offer and his demand,
so could we please just get it over with?
</P>
<P>
   The regular season opens Saturday. The Bruins' schedule through
the first 11 games is extremely difficult, with eight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   With the Eastern Conference destined to be a tighter-than-tight
race, a poor start could doom the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   When president/general manager Harry Sinden told a handful of
reporters Wednesday night in Worcester that the negotiating with
Dafoe was over, that there was nothing else to talk about, it was,
to quote Yogi Berra, deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a year ago, on Sept. 30 to be exact, and in the
very same place _ the Centrum press box _ that assistant general
manager Mike O'Connell said he didn't see any way the Bruins could
come to terms with center Jason Allison. One day later, after
marathon negotiations, Allison agreed to terms.
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios have played out nearly identically. We offer our
exhibits (see accompanying quotes).
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe is sticking around town for now, rather than head back to
Southern California, crossing his fingers that something will get
done.
</P>
<P>
   Something should, and now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Sinden is an entertaining quote as well as a
shrewd businessman. Remember when talks broke down in 1992 with
then-Canadian Olympian Joe Juneau, who was threatening to play in
Switzerland? Sinden said he should learn how to yodel. As we all
now know, Juneau came to terms.
</P>
<P>
   To a point, it's funny, interesting, and an expected yearly
ritual. And let's face it, a fair amount of criticism leveled at
Sinden regarding his fiscal practices is unfair and ill-informed.
However, the Bruins have had a revolving door of goaltenders
(mostly disasters) since the tandem of Reggie Lemelin and Andy
Moog. I'd list them all but then I wouldn't have room for anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Let's concede that Dafoe made a mistake in not going to
arbitration. He does. Perhaps he was too trusting back in June when
he thought the Bruins were coming in high with their initial offer
_ only to find out it was their only offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments O'Connell made about letting us know that when
the offer was made, that's so far from the truth,'' said Dafoe.
``Do you think, if he would have told me that, I would've said,
`OK, I can make you move'? No. That was never said, that was never
an option, and if it was, I would've gone to arbitration. No
question. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. That
was not said. It was an initial offer and a good starting ground. I
did not know that was it. Yeah, so if I look back and I'd have
known that, sure, I wish I could've gone to arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   File that under the equivalent of ``a goal through the five-hole
from center ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can make mistakes, and Dafoe and his agent made the wrong
call there. However, the longer this drags on, everybody pays. No
one has talked about the toll it will take on coach Pat Burns or
the young players on the team or the veterans like Ray Bourque, for
whom this will likely be the last chance at the Stanley Cup. And
Lord knows the fans have suffered enough.
</P>
<P>
   You've got a talented, personable young goalie who can stop the
puck. We've seen more than our share lately of those who can't.
It's time to do the right thing. Pull the plug on this, please. I
just can't watch anymore.
</P>
<P>
   You must be kidding
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Ottawa grows more absurd by the day. You have
to wonder whether the agent for Alexei Yashin, the malcontent
holdout who has refused to honor the final year of his contract,
gives his interviews backed by a laugh track. Mark Gandler's
comments are getting to be more and more of a joke. His latest
nonsensical charge is that the Senators won't renegotiate with
Yashin because they're ``bigots.'' Gandler is asserting that the
team, which includes a great many Europeans, is anti-Russian and
because they refuse to renegotiate (read: give him whatever he
wants), they're ``stoning Alexei to death.'' Are you kidding me?
The kid is due to be paid $3.6 million in US funds to play a game,
and that's the equivalent of stoning him to death? If I were an
agent, I'd be embarrassed to be in the same profession as this guy
. . . Former Bruin prospect Ben Clymer, who was declared an
unrestricted free agent Sept. 10 after not being able to come to
terms with Boston, was invited to the Lightning's training camp. In
his first practice, the defenseman took six stitches in his cheek
as a result of being clipped by a stick . . . The situation in
Phoenix appears identical to what we have in Boston. Goalie Nikolai
Khabibulin rejected a three-year, $9 million contract and late last
week the club took the offer off the table. Khabibulin, who made
$1.25 million last season, is seeking something in the
$5-million-a-year range. That's a big chunk of change for a guy
who's never won a playoff series . . . Guess how much it cost the
Capitals to acquire former Bruins backup goalie Craig Billington
from the Avalanche? One dollar. That's right. Colorado was looking
to pare its roster, so the Capitals wound up with a reliable backup
and good citizen. Starter Olaf Kolzig said he's looking forward to
working with Billington, who is a supportive influence and spent
the last three seasons as the No. 2 behind Patrick Roy. ``My
understanding is, if you can get along with Patrick Roy, I think
you can pretty much get along with anybody,'' said Capitals coach
Ron Wilson. ``I think Craig's going to be just what the doctor
ordered.'' . . . Veteran Bob Errey, who won two Stanley Cups with
the Penguins in 1991 and '92, was let go by the club last week, one
day after his 35th birthday. Errey, who went in without a contract,
had a good training camp, but there were too many left wings ahead
of him . . . Plenty of speculation on who will become the next
captain of the Canadiens. One candidate is former Canucks and
Islanders captain Trevor Linden. Linden said Saku Koivu would make
a good choice. Another possibility is Shayne Corson, said to be a
favorite of teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Dogged pursuit
</P>
<P>
   Detroit defenseman Uwe Krupp could be in some hot water over
allegations that he competed in dog-sled races while supposedly
sidelined with a back injury. A man named Cecil Houghton, who is
the dean of the sport in Michigan, said he saw Krupp racing six
Siberian huskies at a race in January. ``I thought, `What are you
doing out here?' '' said Houghton. ``I almost called the Red Wings
and said, `Hey, get out here and get a look at your invalid.' ''
Krupp is listed as a driver in results from four other races
between Jan. 2-Feb. 28. He signed a four-year contract worth $16.4
million and played only 22 games last year before his back injury.
He's currently under suspension by the club because he refused to
grant the Red Wings access to his medical records. The team finally
got them but Krupp remains suspended pending their review . . . Yet
another veteran has retired because of post-concussion problems.
Following in the unfortunate footsteps of Pat Lafontaine and Jeff
Beukeboom, Tampa Bay center Brian Bradley called it quits at 34.
Bradley, an intense competitor, said he still suffers from
headaches on a daily basis. ``I really appreciate the time spent in
the NHL and wish I could continue playing,'' said Bradley. With all
the technology out there, you'd think some manufacturer could come
up with a helmet that would better protect players . . . One of the
bigger names still without a deal is former Boston University
standout Mike Grier, who remains home in the Boston area instead of
with the Edmonton Oilers. Grier made $400,000 in Canadian funds
last year and reportedly is seeking about $800,000 US, much more
than the team is willing to pay . . . Ron Tugnutt may not be the
starting netminder for Ottawa, as he has a sore left knee. If he
can't go, Patrick Lalime will get the start in the season opener
Saturday in Philadelphia . . . Former Bruins first-round pick Kevyn
Adams, who could never come to terms with Boston on a contract,
appears to have gotten the message about what he has to do to make
it in the NHL. Adams, who made progress in St. John's last year and
was called up to play seven playoff games for Toronto, worked out
hard over the summer and bulked up. Toronto GM/coach Pat Quinn has
been impressed with Adams in camp. ``He certainly has a high
ranking in the grading we've been doing,'' said Quinn . . . Six
days to opening night.

VINATIERI KICKS INTO GEAR EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Kickers normally are the little guys, with the
lockers closest to the door, whom nobody pays much attention to
unless they miss a big field goal. They're separated from the rest
of the team during practice, doing kicking drills with the special
teams coach and dribbling balls with their feet. Then, they go play
golf. Nice life.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Patriots' two wins have come in large part because
of Drew Bledsoe's superb play, they wouldn't have been possible if
Adam Vinatieri hadn't nailed two game-winning field goals. Who
knows what Sunday night will bring against the New York Giants?
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri hasn't been called upon to kick a 58-yarder, as he did
in the final exhibition game against Carolina. His big kicks have
been from 23 yards, with three seconds remaining against the Jets,
and from 26 yards, with 35 seconds left against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   They are considered virtual chip shots, but you must consider
the pressure of causing a loss with a miss.
</P>
<P>
   In his three-plus seasons in the league, Vinatieri has kicked
six winning field goals, two in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Might this season's early heroics indicate the type of season it
will be for the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' said Vinatieri. ``There are a lot of good
teams out there. We've been playing well enough to win but we
haven't hit on all cylinders. Hopefully we'll win by more, but it
may be we have close games and so you have to be prepared for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri certainly has done that. While negotiating a
three-year contract in the offseason, he worked on improving the
length of his kickoffs, which were weak a year ago because he never
fully recovered from a groin pull. He started training camp off
slowly, and for a while punter Lee Johnson was the front-runner for
the kickoff job.
</P>
<P>
   But against Carolina, Vinatieri started to blossom, his kicks
going an extra 5-8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into camp, we both knew whoever helped the team out the
most should do it,'' Vinatieri said. ``We even heard they might use
both of us, just to keep the competition going a little more. It's
something they might do to mess up return teams or whatever. It was
good competition but whatever was good for the team, we'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was getting used to the new footballs, which the NFL
will not allow to be doctored anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of concentrating a lot more _ since the balls
are a little harder _ on driving it more, getting good contact and
better follow-through and making sure I drive through the ball and
land on my kicking foot,'' said Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he wasn't getting the distance last season because
of the groin pull, and thus there were some long runbacks that
forced him to make nine tackles, some of which saved touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more follow through, the more penetration through the
ball, I think you get the better distance,'' said Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri has had to get used to a new holder, Johnson, after he
had developed a bond with Tom Tupa, now departed to the Jets. It
sounds like a small thing, but good kicking is all rhythm and
comfort. One thing goes wrong _ a bad snap, a bad hold _ and the
kick is botched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tupa and Lee are very comparable. Both have good hands. They
hold very similar,'' said Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri has settled on a comfortable routine. During the week
he kicks 300-400 balls, mostly on Wednesday and Thursday, and then
he tapers off Friday. He said there is such a thing as kicking too
much, just as a pitcher might throw too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older guys don't kick much at all during the
week,'' said Vinatieri. ``My legs are still fresh and I want to
develop and I want to feel good coming into a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri doesn't spend as much time on his golf game as
Tennessee Titans kicker Al Del Greco, who is considered the top
golfer in the NFL. But he has those aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I want to be the best kicker,'' he said with a
smile, ``but in 10 years, with a little more experience, maybe I'll
be as good as Del Greco and Tupa on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Whigham is expecting a big night on special teams against
the Giants. ``It's definitely been an emphasis,'' said Whigham . .
. With Kevin Faulk (ankle) unable to play, Tebucky Jones and Lamont
Warren will handle kick-return duty, and if that doesn't work, Troy
Brown will get the call.

RUTH RAY HUNT, 82, DALLAS PHILANTHROPIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Ray Hunt, who was married to oil baron H.L. Hunt, died
Saturday at her Dallas home after an illness. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt was the second wife of H.L. Hunt, who was believed to
have been one of the richest men in the world when he died in 1974.
They married in 1957, two years after the death of H.L. Hunt's
first wife, Lyda Bunker Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The family asked that the nature of her illness not be
disclosed, said Jim Oberwetter, a family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt, praised as a philanthropist, had a circle of friends
that included social high-steppers, a president and needy children
who came to ``Granny Ruth'' for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will simply say that Ruth Hunt is one of the loveliest human
beings I have ever encountered,'' former President Bush once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the family said Mrs. Hunt ``was a
practical jokester ... incorrigible poet and a gracious
entertainer, opening wide not only her doors, but also her heart.''
</P>
<P>
   George Cunyus, a family friend, said Mrs. Hunt was ``the heart
and spirit of Hunt Oil Company, through which she always honored
the accomplishments and memory of her late husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family said Mrs. Hunt often went to hospitals unannounced to
visit sick employees of the oil company and their families. Dallas
businessman Ray Hunt said of his mother: ``When we were teen-agers,
Mom would come rushing home late for dinner, after an afternoon
serving as a volunteer `candy striper' at Baylor Hospital, where
she cared for patients who were totally unaware of her social
prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt, who grew up in Idabel, Okla., was ``deeply religious,
spending a portion of each day in prayer and Bible study,'' the
family said.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients of her gifts include a community center in Idabel,
the Boy Scouts of America, the H.L. and Ruth Ray Hunt Heart Center
at Baylor University Medical Center, the Ruth Ray Hunt Cancer
Learning Center and the Ruth Ray Hunt Center at the Cooper
Institute for Aerobics Research.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hunt raised a son and three daughters. ``Our mother
embodied a love that was larger than life,'' daughter Helen LaKelly
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her sister, Swann Lake Buckels; brother James
Ray of Idabel, Okla.; her children, Ray, June, Helen and Swanee
Hunt; 17 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   By his first wife, H.L. Hunt had six children: H.L. Hunt III,
Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt, Caroline Hunt
Schoellkopf, Margaret Hunt Hill and Lamar Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Monday at First
Baptist Church in Dallas. Visitation will be from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Sunday at Sparkman/Hillcrest Funeral Home, 7403 Northwest Highway
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made
to the Ruth Ray Hunt Scholarship Fund, Criswell College, 4010
Gaston Ave. in Dallas, or Baylor Hospital, House Calls Program,
4004 Worth St. in Dallas.

RAMON SHOWS HE'S STILL A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's all right to say it. The Red Sox have a winner in
righthander Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people were sure about that March 11 when Ramon and the
Red Sox agreed to a two-year contract, what with Martinez coming
off surgery on his right shoulder. But he is back with the poise
and grace that once made him a 20-game winner for the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Martinez didn't work any miracles at Fenway Park Saturday.
But he won a major league game for the first time in 15 months, and
that's all that counts now.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning nobody expected Ramon, 31, to have a fraction
of the impact of his younger brother Pedro, a Cy Young winner in
1997 for Montreal and the Red Sox' star this season. The low-key
Ramon marched to his own drummer, making almost every stop in the
Red Sox system in an attempt to resume a career cut short by
surgery last year. It hasn't been easy. There's still no telling
for sure whether Saturday's 4-1 victory is the beginning of the
comeback trail or a pit stop not far from the end.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, as the Red Sox try to nail down a playoff berth,
there are just good feelings that will last until his next outing.
He has earned a spot in the new six-man rotation, and it may be
hard to unseat him come the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to watch,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who
has kept on top of Ramon's recovery since spring training. ``For a
little while I was having flashbacks of the old Dodger days when we
used to see him pitch like that from opposing dugouts. He prepares
himself. He's as dedicated to conditioning as much as any pitcher
I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, not many of the 32,107 at Fenway Park
had much idea of what Kerrigan was talking about. In 10 seasons
with the Dodgers, Ramon had compiled a 123-77 record and was
considered the ace of the staff, going 20-6 in 1990. He was a
two-time All-Star and had postseason experience in 1995 and '96.
Yet he was jettisoned by Los Angeles after the 1998 season for a
familiar reason. He suffered a torn rotator cuff in June after a
5-0 stretch and wound up needing surgery. The Dodgers had an option
on his services but lacked the patience to keep him around. In
December, he became a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered by many a gamble to sign, but with a sample of
the Martinez spirit already in the house, the Red Sox offered him a
two-year contract. Today they have no regrets. And neither does
Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our experience, that about 70 percent of the
pitchers who have this injury come back and pitch effectively,''
said Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette. ``There was a bit of a
gamble. But his work habits were good. He was in good shape prior
to the surgery and he won 60 percent of his games. He was
determined to come back. All those things sort of worked out in our
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had not won at any level since a 7-4 victory last June
3 over St. Louis for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The road back went through almost every Red Sox minor league
port _ Lowell, Sarasota, Gulf Coast, and Pawtucket. Martinez made
10 rehabilitation starts in all. He finally made it to Boston Sept.
2, but lasted just three innings of a 4-2 loss. In his second start
Martinez was better, lasting 4 2/3 innings. Boston won, 14-3, but
Ramon did not get the decision. No matter. He had made such an
improvement that the Sox didn't hesitate to put him in what has now
become a six-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept trying and believing in himself that he was going
to be able to come back this year and help our team,'' said manager
Jimy Williams. ``We had a workout in Oakland earlier in the month.
The determination was there. He wanted to show that he was still
working hard and if we needed him to pitch we were going to be
ready. That's what really showed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the (Pat) Rapp situation (who had to be with his wife,
who was having a difficult pregnancy), we needed a starter and in
my mind because of all the work, the man, his work ethic, and
everything else about him, I said give him the ball. He has come a
long way from basically from that first start.''
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, Martinez had a presence on the mound, an air of
confidence. Saturday it all came together again. He threw 98
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of moments in which I thought I wasn't going
to pitch this year,'' said Martinez. ``I felt and touched a sore
shoulder, and I said to myself I might not be able to make it. But
I kept working. I never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the first game I pitched, there was a lot of questions.
There is a lot of excitement and a lot expectations. I lost, but
that game allowed me to see how (it was going to be) when I came
back and pitched and how I was going to react. After the second
start, I had more confidence. Today was much better. I knew we had
the pressure that we had to win. We'd lost three straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez showed something Saturday. He is not overpowering
like Pedro, striking out only three. Ramon's curveball is not a
strikeout pitch, but one designed to throw hitters off balance.
Ramon's delivery unwinds like a tall tree in a windstorm. The
hitter never knows which way it's blowing. Saturday, he threw eight
curves, 15 changeups, and 75 fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can go over 90 easy,'' said Ramon. ``But I don't have
a good feeling on the curveball yet. A lot of sinkers and straight
fastballs and changeups. I'm not worried about the postseason
roster. There are a lot of guys who've been here all year long. I
still have to do my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to take advantage of whatever chance that I
have.''

MCHALE REFLECTS ON FORTUNE AND FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin McHale goes into the Hall of Fame Friday. It will be
another reminder of what we had _ and what we're missing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Larry Bird's night. We had to be reminded of
how great he was _ and how he was coming off a season in which he
had been named Coach of the Year. This year, it will be a
McHale-fest; he's the only entrant being inducted as a player, and
you can be sure it will be Party Central at the Marriott. (McHale
is planning on being in the area for a week; Bird flew in and out
in a day last year.) And yes, we'll also note that the Timberwolves
will have the expensive tables and that McHale is calling the
basketball shots in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But McHale is going in for the way he played. At least, that's
how most of us see it. The way he sees it, however, is that he's
going in as much as for where he played, and whom he played with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years removed,'' he said ``and I still feel that some
players are in the Hall of Fame because they were great players. A
lot of players, and I'm one of them, are in the Hall of Fame
because you played on great teams. It's something you share with
the guys you played with.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale rattled off the names of those guys, from Tiny Archibald
to Dee Brown and many, many in between. (We didn't hear Darren
Daye, though.) There should a decent Celtics contingent on hand for
the ceremony. Bill Walton has promised to attend, as have Scott
Wedman and Jerry Sichting. McHale isn't sure about Danny Ainge or
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with so many guys I really enjoyed _ and all for
different reasons. That was the best part about it,'' he said. ``We
not only had tremendous teams, we had tremendous personalities and
tremendous character, which helped us win. We had characters who
had character and when it was time to play, they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they're not there in person, they'll be there in
spirit. You sit back and remember what you were able to accomplish
as a team, and the recognition I got from being on that team far
supersedes anything I did individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. McHale doesn't think he'd be headed to Springfield
if the Utah Jazz had taken him in the 1980 draft, as then-coach Tom
Nissalke wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utah? What fun would that be? I'd score more points, but
nobody remembers how many points you scored. They remember how much
you won,'' he said. ``That wouldn't have been anything. It would
not have been nearly as rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale has done a commendable job building the Timberwolves,
although he couldn't keep Stephon Marbury and didn't want any part
of an Elden Campbell/Eddie Jones offer for Tom Gugliotta. But you
just remember how dismal that team was when he stepped in, and
where it is now, and, well, you might wonder: Why can't we get guys
like this to run the Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the thought hasn't crossed McHale's mind. It has.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have been (an opportunity). But there was never
any offer, or anything else like that,'' he said. ``There was
nothing there for me to do. Had they offered, I might have stayed.
Boston was great to me and I loved being out there. But you don't
know until it happens and I kind of knew I'd have a television job
and work with the Timberwolves. So, I came back.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't regretted the move. But he paused when he thought
about the brain drain in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back, it's too bad after everything that happened,
what with Larry and Danny (leaving). There were a lot of guys who
knew basketball and didn't stick around and work in the
organization,'' he said. ``I love M.L. (Carr), he was a terrific
teammate. But his job was to have the team play really bad, get
some high draft picks, and take the heat for the organization. And
he did. That's a no-win situation. If you're going to do that, you
better have a hell of an understanding with the owner. No one could
have won with the team he was coaching, I don't care who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel a draft?
</P>
<P>
   Kris Clack, whom the Celtics aren't even bothering to bring to
training camp, was taken third overall by Dennis Johnson's La
Crosse Bobcats in last week's CBA draft. DJ was thought to have
said he couldn't believe Clack was available at No. 3. Derek Hood
of Arkansas, who went undrafted in the NBA, was the overall No. 1
pick. Three New Englanders who were undrafted by NBA teams _ Jamel
Thomas of Providence, Ricky Moore of UConn and Antonio
Reynolds-Dean of URI _ also were taken. In addition, three players
selected in the first round of the NBA draft were picked: Dion
Glover, Leon Smith, and Devean George . . . Minnesota coach Flip
Saunders, a longtime friend of McHale, won't be around to witness
his boss/buddy's induction. The T-Wolves open training camp that
weekend (they start early because they play twice in Japan) and,
well, someone has to be there for the fourth estate. But on that
same night, Saunders is being inducted into his high school Hall of
Fame. He was named the top Class A player in Ohio after averaging
32 points a game at Cuyahoga Heights High School. Alas, he'll be
inducted in absentia . . . Corliss Williamson may come to terms
soon with Sacramento, which leaves Shandon Anderson as probably the
most desirable/available free agent without portfolio. (We're
excluding the likes of John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek.) Utah owner
Larry Miller is wisely rejecting Anderson's rather outlandish
demands ($7 million per year) and is offering twice what Anderson
could get from either Houston or Indiana, his two presumed points
of interest. Miller also won't do a sign-and-trade, which further
limits Anderson's options. Anderson now has introduced the
``lifestyle'' issue, which, of course, is standard fare in Utah.
There are a number of players (LaPhonso Ellis, Sam Perkins, Derek
Harper, Rony Seikaly, Bison Dele) who, for one reason or another,
balked at signing with the Jazz. But that didn't stop Olden
Polynice, did it? . . . Among the other ``names'' still looking for
work, according to the NBA, are Sherman Douglas, Joe Kleine, Tyrone
Corbin, Chucky Brown, Mark West, Eric Riley and Ron Harper. Douglas
has drawn a lot of interest but is still looking for more money.
(He could get $1.1 million as a 10-year veteran.) Doesn't he
realize he got his big contract eight years ago? . . . The NBA
movers and shakers arrived in Vancouver this week, perfect timing
to comment on the sale of the Grizzlies to spurned Nuggets wannabe
honcho Bill Laurie. The league knows Laurie from his near-purchase
of the Nuggets and he has that most valued criterion: deep (as in
Wal-Mart) pockets. He also just bought the St. Louis Blues and the
Kiel Center and, well, you can see where this is going. It's been
31 years since the Hawks left St. Louis for Atlanta, or about as
long as it's been since the Hawks won a meaningful (as in
best-of-seven) playoff series (that would be 1969-70, their first
year in Atlanta). The Grizzlies' expansion agreement says that the
earliest Laurie could apply to relocate is May 15, 2000, meaning
there will be at least two more years of hoops in Vancouver barring
a rules change. Commissioner David Stern was asked if he could
offer any encouragement to Grizzlies fans and said, ``It is my goal
to see the Vancouver Grizzlies succeed and stay in Vancouver.'' Any
relocation would have to be approved by a majority vote of the
owners. Laurie's purchase of the Grizzlies, as well as the purchase
of the Nuggets by Donald Sturm, likely will get the owners'
imprimatur at a Board of Governors meeting in late October . . . A
jury has managed to be seated for a civil trial in California over
an automobile accident involving Latrell Sprewell. The judge said
that prospective jurors were questioned intensely to eliminate
anyone who may have ``hero worship'' or ``bad feelings'' for
Sprewell. How did they manage to find anyone? . . . NBA
generalissimo Rod Thorn went over the new rules changes at the
league meetings and said that, basically, the referees are being
told to enforce the old rules. But Thorn also made it clear that
the new rules _ designed to stop the Anthony Mason trend _ aren't
the only changes needed. Although he didn't say it, Thorn and most
everyone else know the real villains in this offensive drought are
the coaches. ``Of the 29 teams, 25 of the offenses are basically
the same,'' Thorn said, ``and I dare say that the majority of teams
don't have a secondary fast break in their playbook anymore.''
Secondary? Most of them don't have a primary fast break. ``We're
hoping this will get offenses to do some different things. We want
to see some different looks and attacks.'' Let's hope it works. We
may even see some 100-point games again.

DAUBACH GETTING OVER THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Brian Daubach ripped his 20th home run of the year to put
him in some pretty elite company. And yes, that homer provided the
winning run as the Red Sox broke a three-game losing streak with
Saturday's 4-1 win over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that the homer was into the net in left-center, an
opposite-field job, was a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   But, Daubach warned, one hit does not break a slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great today,'' Daubach said. ``But I only got one hit.
It's a start. I'm not out of my slump, for sure. But it felt good
to help the team again for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I really helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach has struggled mightily at the plate the last five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was hotter than hot in the middle of August. After that, he
was not.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's home run was his first since Aug. 14, a day he went 5
for 5 against Seattle. Two nights later, his bases-loaded double in
the ninth scored three runs and beat Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the American League Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Daubach had had two hits in 31 at-bats in
entering Saturday's game, and his average had dipped to .292.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was also his first start in 10 days. The last time he
was in the starting lineup, Daubach struck out four times against
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   He had a good pinch-hit at-bat Friday night, despite the fact
that he struck out. He fouled off pitch after pitch from Scott
Kamieniecki before being called out when the third base umpire said
he had gone around on a 1-and-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he struck out twice, but he also worked a full-count
walk in the bottom of the eighth and eventually scored with the
fourth Red Sox run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always a hit, sometimes it's a walk, or a ground ball
to the other side,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``This kid's
worked real hard all year long. He's a fighter, he'll fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you find out what a person's really made of when
they maybe aren't going so good. He hasn't stopped. He hasn't
changed anything he's been doing just because he hasn't been
playing. If anything, he's worked harder. I tip my cap to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach became just the third Red Sox lefthanded hitter to reach
the 20-homer mark in his rookie season. The others? Fellas by the
name of Ted Williams and Fred Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget, those 20 home runs and 71 runs batted in are
from a 27-year-old who had no major league homers and three RBIs in
15 big league at-bats entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   The bench time in the last week or so helped him rest and relax
a bit, Daubach said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ahead in the count against Doug Linton didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a 2-and-0 count, finally,'' he said. ``Usually, I've
been behind all the time lately. I got a pitch I could handle. I
got a good pitch to hit and I didn't try to kill it, I just made
good contact.''
</P>
<P>
   That the homer went into the net in left-center may be a good
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hit the ball to left-center,'' Daubach said.
``Especially in Fenway it helps being a lefthander and going the
other way. When I'm swinging good, I hit the ball the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, I haven't even been hitting the ball. I've been
striking out way too often. Hopefully, I'll turn that around.''
</P>
<P>
   The time is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only got a week left to start swinging the bat so I can
be in there come the postseason, if we're fortunate enough to get
that far,'' Daubach said.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the better he's swinging the bat, the better the
chances that the Sox will be successful in the playoffs.

REMATCH IS ONLY WAY FOR DE LA HOYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya patterned much of his career after Sugar Ray
Leonard, the gold medal-winning star of the 1976 Olympics who went
on to parlay matinee-idol looks and fearsome hooks into one of the
greatest careers in boxing history, both fistically and
financially. That blueprint still applies this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, Leonard was faced with much the same
situation De La Hoya finds himself in today. Beaten by Roberto
Duran in a close welterweight title fight, Leonard was embarrassed
and adrift but still the bigger draw, with or without a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the businessman, Leonard used his financial power to lure
Duran back into the ring only five months later by overpaying him.
He then embarrassed a fat and sassy champion with his boxing skill,
forcing Duran to quit in disgust in the eighth round when he was
unable to hit Leonard and saw that things were only going to get
worse. That was the night Duran uttered his now infamous, ``No
mas!,'' a remark he will carry with him to his grave despite his
greatness in the ring on so many other nights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly two decades later, it is De La Hoya without a title
he feels he still deserves. He lost the World Boxing Council
portion of the 147-pound championship to Felix Trinidad in a
controversial majority decision last weekend in Las Vegas, and like
Leonard before him, De La Hoya was his own worst enemy that night,
but in a far different way.
</P>
<P>
   While Leonard abandoned his boxing skills to brawl with Duran in
an attempt to prove his machismo and thus played into Duran's
strength, De La Hoya built up what he thought was an insurmountable
lead by using his strong jab and superior hand and foot speed, then
went into a shell with three rounds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing not to fight, De La Hoya simply ran, conceding those
rounds to the plodding, ineffective, but resolute Trinidad.
Unbeknownst to De La Hoya, he was also giving away his title
because two of the judges handed over just enough of the early
rounds to turn the tide by the slightest of margins _ a single
point on one card and two on another.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, De La Hoya pleaded his case desperately at the
postfight press conference, claiming, ``I thought I had it in the
bag. How can you land 100 more punches (by CompuBox statistics) and
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Most at Mandalay Bay Events Center gave De La Hoya seven or
eight rounds, which should have been enough for him to win a
decision, but his nonaggression pact with his cornermen in the
final three rounds made the fight closer than it should have been
and hence left room for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After that disaster, the question is: Where does he go from
here?
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the new Staples Center in Los Angeles on Dec. 9, as
originally planned. De La Hoya had been penciled in to fight there,
perhaps for his fifth world title at 154 pounds, but only days
after he was defeated for the first time, De La Hoya told promoter
Bob Arum the only fight he wants is a rematch with Trinidad within
six months. That is the same plan Leonard followed, and it is a
wise one.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and his promoter, Don King, were cackling all the way
back to San Juan, claiming they would demand purse parity or better
for a rematch. But King, at least, knows the real score. There is
no place his man can get anywhere near the money he would get from
a De La Hoya rematch, and after earning $10.5 million (less King's
$2 million promotional fee), it will be nearly impossible to
convince him to go back to fighting for a million here and a
half-million there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the thought of a parity deal with King made Arum look like a
man who has just bitten into an apple and found half a worm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't got to be no negotiations,'' King said. ``Just take my
name and put it where Arum's is on the contract and put Arum's name
where mine is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be the day,'' Arum snapped back, knowing that would
give Trinidad double his purse when it would still be his fighter,
not King's, driving ticket and pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito (Trinidad) got the decision but it didn't make him a
star,'' cautioned Lou DiBella, HBO Sports senior vice president for
programming. ``The money for Tito Trinidad is still Oscar De La
Hoya. Oscar walked in a star and he walked out a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but not as bright a one as when the night began. It was
most certainly De La Hoya's star power that drove pay-per-view
sales to a record 1.25 million, a high for a nonheavyweight fight
and a number so huge that there was immediate talk of an even
bigger sale for the rematch. But he is a fallen champion now, and
there is a psychological weight that must be lifted, as Leonard
well knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the loser, this will be a disaster,'' Leonard had said
before the fight. ``No one can understand how bad he'll feel.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya now understands, and he has decided, wisely, not to
argue with Trinidad or King over money. According to sources,
within days of the loss, he privately told Arum he would accept
purse parity for a rematch. That would probably pay each man around
$15 million, a hefty payday under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya realizes that winning the titles back from Trinidad
is more important than maximizing his earning potential, regardless
of the fact that his drawing power was probably only slightly
damaged. It is important, because to be a champion, you must wear a
champion's belt, and to be a superstar in boxing, you must avenge
defeat and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, on the other hand, is a businessman who was already
talking of De La Hoya moving to 154 pounds and fighting WBC
champion Francisco Castillejo for a meaningless title while
forgetting about Trinidad for the moment. His theory is that
Trinidad and King would soon see there is no other fight for them
that can compare with a De La Hoya rematch, and they would have to
negotiate a more reasonable share of the rematch's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Arum is probably right, but a lot of things can happen in
boxing, and fights not made when the time is right often don't get
made at all. More importantly, De La Hoya is already a
multimillionaire. Splitting the take of a rematch 50-50 will not
affect his lifestyle in the slightest, so this need not be about
money for him.
</P>
<P>
   As Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis showed when they quickly
agreed to a 50-50 split to set up a rematch after their
aesthetically displeasing draw, De La Hoya needs Trinidad for
psychic reasons as much as Trinidad needs De La Hoya for fiscal
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Holyfield understood the same thing Leonard understood
and, for the moment at least, De La Hoya seems to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Had De La Hoya won, there would be no need for a rematch because
once again it would have been the same scenario Leonard followed
nearly 20 years ago with Duran and Thomas Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard defeated Hearns in as good a welterweight fight as
there had been in 25 years, there was no rematch for eight years _
even though Hearns yearned for one _ because it was risky business
for Leonard. It was a risk he didn't need to take.
</P>
<P>
   When you lose _ no matter how questionable the decision _ the
risk is different. You must risk it all to get back the invincible
champion's aura because that is something money can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   All De La Hoya has to put on the line to get what he needs,
then, is the same thing Leonard put down in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Money.
</P>
<P>
   When you've already made $100 million, that's not a risk. It's
the cost of being in the superstar business.
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   Here's a story, told by a source close to him, that illustrates
why Mike Tyson is in the dire financial straits he is, despite
having made more than $200 million in purses. Tyson spied a new
special-order Bentley on the way to the gym one day and immediately
wanted it. But because he owes the Internal Revenue Service $12.5
million and counting and various other creditors millions more for
having advanced him money to pay off past debts, he had no cash or
borrowing power. So, the story goes, he traded the dealer several
cars worth more than $1 million for one worth $250,000. ``That's
the way the guy is,'' the source said. ``He's like a child.
Everything is instant gratification. When he wants something, he
doesn't think of the price.'' . . . Newly crowned World Boxing
Organization heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko (25-0) makes his
first defense against American Ed Mahone (21-0-2) Oct. 9 in
Oberhausen, Germany. Both Klitschko and Mahone have won all their
fights by knockout . . . Lewis is already training for the
Holyfield fight in the Poconos. His manager, Frank Maloney, claims
he is going to run for mayor of London next year as an independent.
He says he'll announce his candidacy following the Lewis-Holyfield
rematch . . . Lewis's assistant trainer, Harold Knight, said
following De La Hoya-Trinidad that one thing was obvious: ``The
general public wants fighters to act like sharks. When they see
blood, they should go in for the kill. Holyfield will come out to
knock out or be knocked out. It will be the latter.'' . . .
International Boxing Federation junior middleweight champion
Fernando Vargas takes on mandatory challenger Winky Wright Dec. 4
in Las Vegas while his rival, World Boxing Association champion
David Reid, fights later in December. HBO may put them on
back-to-back weekends to begin drumming up interest in a 2000
showdown of the former Olympic teammates . . . Popular Arturo Gatti
returns to the ring on ESPN2 Dec. 10. No opponent has been
selected, but who cares when Gatti fights? . . . Pernell Whitaker
will fight his farewell bout in January in his hometown of Virginia
Beach, Va., but the fear among his handlers is that if he looks
good he'll want to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight contender Kirk Johnson (27-0-1, 19 KOs) will go into
his Oct. 7 fight against Rodolfo Martin (21-7) without trainer
Teddy Atlas. The two reportedly had a nasty falling-out that ended
in a gym battle between the two that left both hurting and Atlas
looking for a new heavyweight to train . . . Amid st continued
rumors Rumors continue that the Roy Jones-Graciano Rocchigiani
light heavyweight title fight scheduled for Nov. 6 will not come
off Nov. 6 as scheduled, and Jones failed to did not show up in
Manhattan Thursday for a planned press conference to announce the
fight. Worried organizers said it was merely a delay and will be
rescheduled this week, but HBO executives conceded admitted for the
first time that there may be a problem convincing Jones to fight
for what will ultimately be chump change . . . Although her male
opponent has pulled out, Margaret McGregor of Bremerton, Wash.,
still believes she'll become the first woman professional boxer to
fight a man on Oct. 9. Promoter Tom O'Malley said saw that Hector
Morales pulled out this week last week because he became
``increasingly uncomfortable'' with the publicity the bout had
attracted. Now Morales's trainer, Loi Chow, says he'll put his 3-0
record on the line if the Washington State Boxing Commission
approves the bout. Isn't this going a little too far, even for
boxing?

 (Edits, updates throughout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ There was a trace of electricity in the air
Saturday morning as the 33d Ryder Cup matches resumed with the
European side in command, 6-2, after Friday's opening matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks broke quickly from the gate, but the brief dousing of
the course, which delayed things a bit, seemed to cool them off and
the morning foursomes ended with each side earning 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   It left the Europeans with an 8-4 advantage, the same as they
enjoyed after the rain-delayed second day two years ago at
Valderrama, Spain, where they ended up celebrating a 14 1/2-13 1/2
victory that kept the Cup in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the team of Phil Mickelson-Tom Lehman building a
3-hole through No. 10 on their way to taking Lee Westwood and
Darren Clarke for a point in the afternoon, the narrowest the US
side could close the gap was 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the guys to look up on the board and see us go 1 up, 2 up,
and 3 up, they could say, `let's keep on going,' '' said Lehman.
``I think for the rest of the team to see the lead group doing some
damage was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, but it wasn't quite enough to lift the troops completely
out of the doldrums. Momentum definitely slipped away when Tiger
Woods missed from 6 feet on the 17th, allowing the irrepressible
Colin Montgomerie and British Open champion Paul Lawrie to chalk up
a huge point over him and Steve Pate, America's other winning
combination in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, who had missed makeable birdie putts on 15 and
17, sank the one that counted most on 18. His birdie from just
outside 6 feet enabled him and Jesper Parnevik to halve their match
with Davis Love-David Duval and remain undefeated for the weekend
with 3 1/2 points.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's team matches ended with Miguel Angel Jimenez
watching his potential winning putt die on edge of the cup on 18,
which locked up a halve for him and fellow Spaniard Jose Maria
Olazabal with Hal Sutton-Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   So, with all said and done, the day ended as it began _ with the
Europeans up by 4 points. They led, 10 1/2-5 1/2, entering singles
matches two years ago at Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   There were some brilliant shots over the closing holes Saturday.
Sutton, who had been absent from Ryder Cup play for 12 years,
nearly holed his tee shot on 16, and the Spanish Armada once again
ruled supreme: Garcia and Parnevik went 3-0-1 in four matches.
Jimenez, who was an assistant captain two years ago, completed a
1-0-3 trip, and Olazabal, whose career was in jeopardy just a
little over two years ago with a serious foot problem, has been
2-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Pate started their morning (alternate-shot) match with
four straight birdies and would have gone 4 up had Dubliner Padraig
Harrington not rolled in a birdie putt to halve a hole. The
visitors then proceded to win the sixth, eighth, and 11th to pull
all square. This was the way it went until Woods rolled in a putt
for an eagle and a 1-up edge on the par-5 14th.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th, the most notorious hole at the Country Club for
swinging momentum, proved key again when Harrington's approach shot
to the severe slope in back of the pin refused to spin back to the
hole. ``I got robbed,'' said Harrington. ``I couldn't believe it
when the ball stopped on the slope. It was obvious it would have
been stone dead if it had rolled back.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18th wasn't pretty, but Woods lagged his putt to the lip for
a conceded par and the 1-up victory that left the Europeans with an
8-4 lead entering the afternoon fourball competition.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, the US picked it up early and led all four matches.
Montgomerie put a temporary end to that, holing a birdie putt on
the third with partner Paul Lawrie at his side to square things
with Woods and Pate.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question Montgomerie is the inspirational
father-figure on the European side. He was at the heart of the
victory two years ago, and ``his contribution this week has been
enormous,'' said team captain Mark James. ``He's someone the
players look to, someone my assistants confide in. That was a huge
point he had. It's nothing I didn't expect from Colin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to maintain our lead,'' said James, who played on
seven teams and made a run at making it an eighth this year. ``We
achieved our objective to play some good golf today, and to win
points they had to play well. They know what they are up against,
and we know what we are up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of relying on big guns. I have a feeling
that some players are playing slightly better than others and are
slightly more capable of shooting lower. It's a very narrow margin,
and I'm going with those players because they are doing a good job.
To change tactics would be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The team of Jim Furyk and Mark O'Meara, who are generally
regarded has having two of world's best short games, failed to
register a birdie in their 3-and-2 foursomes setback to Westwood
and Clarke. ``It's disappointing,'' said O'Meara, who sat out the
first two matches and didn't play in the afternoon. ``We didn't
play poorly, but we didn't make any putts. They birdied the two Par
5s (9, 14), where we had good drives and didn't make any birdies.
That was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And the overall difference between the teams still stands at 4.
</P>
<P>
   The great unknowns entering Sunday's singles matches are the
three players James hasn't played: Andrew Coltart of Scotland, who
was one of his two captain's selections; Jean Van de Velde, who let
the British Open slip away on the 72d hole; and Jarmo Sandelin of
Sweden. ``They've been tremendously supportive,'' said James.
``It's a shame they've been left out. I came here with the
objective of getting the most points I could out of this team. I'd
probably do it again the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing that sunday Sandelin will meet Mickelson in the
third match; Van de Velde will go up against Love in the fourth;
and Coltart will face Woods in the fifth match. The US trails by 4
points, and the Euros need to win just four matches to tie, 14-14,
and retain the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, who advanced to the quarterfinals of the US Juniors at
The Country Club 31 years ago, left his interview with optimism.
``I'm a great believer in fate,'' he said, ``and I have a good
feeling about this.''
</P>
<P>
   He has to hope his leaders get off to a quick start and make the
event fun. ``I think our players have enough confidence,'' said
Crenshaw, ``and they know what to do. I had a talk with the team
last night, and there was a lot of confidence we can do it if we
just play our game.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Europeans are putting into cups the size
of paint cans. Our Guys are aiming at thimbles.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is the best golfer in the Nike world, but he is the
Roger Clemens of Ryder Cups, winning only twice in nine starts
(2-6-1). The ``I'' of the Tiger seems in conflict with team
matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, according to their captain, are ``somewhat
chuffed,'' which we think means ``pleased.'' Our Guys are gagging
on their wallets, their rankings, and some of their comments.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun went down over The Country Club there was a bad
moon rising and the Ryder Cup scoreboard read, Europeans 10, Our
Guys 6. Play resumes this morning, and unless the Yanks stage an
unprecedented rally (they need 8 1/2 of 12 remaining points), the
Europeans will put the Cup back on the Corcorde and take it across
the pond sometime monday. In some corners (of America), a European
victory will go down as the greatest upset in golf history.
</P>
<P>
   There was little Saturday to alleviate American fallout from
Friday's European rout. US wonderboys Woods, David Duval, and
Justin Leonard continued to struggle against the likes ot
19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia and the ever-maddening Colin
Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Monty will be No. 10 batter in Mark James's lineup Sunday
(facing Payne Stewart). The wide-body leader loves nothing better
than beating Woods, which he (along with teammate Paul Lawrie) did
in Saturday's best-ball match.
</P>
<P>
   Monty was somewhat riled by the local crowd and said, ``The
first two days were smellier. For me, I take the jeering as a
compliment because I am a threat, and I take that as a compliment.
. . . That's the best thing we can do _ silence the crowd by
outplaying them. . . . They need pumping up because they're losing
and they're losing badly.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Start with Woods, who had a good excuse when he was
a Ryder rookie in Spain two years ago but has dropped three of four
matches in Brookline. He was playing well coming into the
tournament, but the Ryder Cup is becoming his personal nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit it beautifully all week and I've putted well, too,''
said Woods, who plays the well-rested Andrew Coltart Sunday.
``Unfortunately, it's just not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He battled his putter today, no question he did,''
acknowledged US captain Ben Crenshaw. ``We've got to get that
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Leonard, a one-time British Open champ who is
winless (0-3-4) in seven career Ryder matches. The US had a good
thing going with the Hal Sutton-Jeff Maggert duo (two wins), but
Crenshaw elected to rest Maggert for the afternoon session and
replaced him with Leonard, who struggled mightily. Leonard gets
Jose Maria Olazabal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's David ``the Ryder Cup is an exhibition'' Duval.
The No. 2 player in the world, Duval was on the bench in the
morning but played in the nightcap and, teamed with Davis Love,
managed to halve a match against Europe's awesome tandem of Garcia
and Jesper Parnevik. Credit Duval with 1 point of a possible 6 thus
far, while Garcia and Parnevik have rung up 7 of 8 possible points.
Sunday Duval faces the white-hot Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a business luncheon Friday, the great Arnold Palmer
_ a veteran of nine Ryder Cup teams _ said, ``Maybe our guys are
too businesslike about what's happening. Maybe they're taking it
too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks following the morning pairing of Stewart and Leonard
against Garcia and Parnevik might have come to the same conclusion.
Garcia and Parnevik are of different generations (Sergio is 19,
Jesper 34) and speak different languages, but they enjoyed one
another while the grim-faced Americans barely spoke. Messrs. Woods,
Duval, and Leonard walk the course like they're en route to an
appointment with their dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Love appeared to have the Swede and Spaniard beaten in
the four-ball, but Garcia won the 18th hole and the US had to
settle for half a point. It was devestating, emotionally and
competitively.
</P>
<P>
   Love said, ``No matter what we do, it seems like they do us one
better. It seems like a loss to us, and I'm sure it seems like a
win to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like captain Tom Kite after the loss at Valderrama two
years ago, Crenshaw said, ``I've never been so proud of a bunch of
guys in my life. They played their hearts out and will continue to
play their hearts out.''
</P>
<P>
   Droll Euro captain Mark James, who says he keeps his troops
fresh by feeding them chocolate, has used his roster much like K.C.
Jones did the 1985 Celtics: He's played only nine of his 12
players. Scotland's Coltart, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin, and France's
Jean Van de Velde have not yet played. It's unprecedented for a
captain to keep three players on the bench Friday and Saturday, but
the Euros don't care about sparing players' feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday, the US has more rested players (seven
Europeans have played every match) and a reputation for dominance
in singles match play. Two years ago at Valderrama, the Americans
were hopelessly behind going into the final day but made things
close winning 8 of 12 one-on-ones. They'll need more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw ended his press conference by saying: ``I'm a big
believer in fate. I have a good feeling about this.''

KICKER, DEFENSE BAIL OUT TEXAS A&AMP;M AGAINST SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Whit Canning 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ R.C. Slocum's most effective strategic
ploy last week probably occurred Wednesday, when he informed junior
placekicker Terence Kitchens that he was being put on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came into the office the next day, I told him he had
earned it and deserved it, and that's why I was doing it,'' Slocum
said. ``And I said, `Now don't go into the tank on me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens kicked three field goals _ including a 62-yarder that
ties the third-best in A&AMP;M history _ and the Wrecking Crew defense
did the rest, as the fifth-ranked Aggies (3-0) cruised past
Southern Mississippi, 23-6, despite failing to score an offensive
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with punter Shane Lechler, who helped create 20 points,
Kitchens staked A&AMP;M to a 9-0 halftime lead and the Golden Eagles
(2-2) were finished off by interception returns of 41 yards by Jay
Brooks _ for a 16-0 third-quarter lead _ and 26 by Michael Jameson
to clinch it in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 299 yards, the A&AMP;M offense could never put the ball in
the end zone. It was a day of immense futility for the Eagles, who
had accumulated 62 total yards when backup Cable Davis threw a
54-yard touchdown pass to Todd Pinkston 46 seconds deep in the
fourth quarter. USM, which nearly knocked off Nebraska last week,
rarely threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just up against a very good defense today,'' Slocum
said, ``but so were they. That looked like vintage Wrecking Crew
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who came in averaging 354 yards per game, managed
only 18 yards on the ground and 111 through the air, on a 10-of-29
day with four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But through the first 30 minutes, the big story was Kitchens,
who kicked field goals at the end of two stalled drives and then _
on the final play of the half _ lined up 62 yards away, with
Lechler holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach Slocum looked at me on the sideline, I held my
finger up in the air to let him know I wanted to try it,'' Kitchens
said. ``I knew how long it was, because they had just marked off a
\R17-yard\S penalty, and I looked to see where the spot was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kicked it well. Being put on scholarship this was a
tremendous thrill, because my parents have worked very hard to put
me through school, and this helps. Then I was able to help us win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an awesome week.''
</P>
<P>
   Lechler, who gave A&AMP;M new life on the opening field-goal drive
with a 22-yard sprint for a first down after fumbling a punt snap,
said he knew Kitchens had nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, he scrapes the grass a little,'' he said. ``You hear
the scrape and then a `pop' when he hits it. This time, I didn't
hear the scrape ... just a big pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Lechler wasn't exactly idle himself, pinning the Eagles deep in
their territory with punts of 66 and 62 yards and, finally, a
47-yarder that was killed at the 3. These kicks led to a field goal
and the interception returns by Brooks and Jameson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a good scheme, and they're a great defense _ and my
numbers were Ug-ly,'' A&AMP;M running back Dante Hall (23 yards on 16
carries) said. ``I think, frankly, their defensive line dominated
our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we won, and that's what matters. The defense saved us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another day at the office, said linebacker Jason Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're supposed to do,'' he said. ``That's what the
Wrecking Crew is all about.''

PAIRING STRATEGY FAVORS THE EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits, updates throughout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It is a difference of opinion as striking as
the Vardon grip vs. the interlock. Neither is wrong, both can work.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw has chosen to use all 12 of his players in the
first two days of the 33d Ryder Cup Matches at The Country Club,
sticking with a philosophy that is typical for a United States
captain. European captain Mark James, on the other hand, has ridden
nine horses, and won't introduce the remaining three members of his
team until Sunday's singles matches. (Their names are Jarmo
Sandelin, Jean Van de Velde, and Andrew Coltart, in case you have
forgotten Thursday's opening ceremonies.)
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised by the differences in strategy,
because it's been the way the Ryder Cup has unfolded in recent
years. The US captain always has had the luxury of a deep, rich
talent pool, so dominant he could sit out key players, get everyone
in the lineup, and still win.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the European captain, so James did what Seve Ballesteros,
Bernard Gallacher, and Tony Jacklin did before him _ he saddled his
big horses and rode them hard. That's been the European way since
``The Fab Five'' of Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam, Bernhard Langer, Nick
Faldo, and Sandy Lyle arrived on the scene in the mid-1980s. They
embraced the Ryder Cup, made it a big deal, and challenged their
successors to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend seven Europeans will play five matches each. It was
more than a gamble by James; it was the only choice he had. His
team boarded the Concorde last Monday with one game plan _ use
eight or nine players, get as big a lead as possible through two
days, and try to hang on in singles.
</P>
<P>
   James's only real decision was whether to play Jose Maria
Olazabal, a choice the Spaniard made for him by asking out of the
alternate shot foursomes matches. (Padraig Harrington moved in.)
Colin Montgomerie, Paul Lawrie, Darren Clarke, Lee Westwood, Jesper
Parnevik, Sergio Garcia, and Miguel Angel Jimenez all said, ``Give
us matching shirts, please, and point us to the first tee.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they were advised of what Jeff Maggert said (``It's a lot
to ask to play five matches'') perhaps they would laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert had shined for three matches with Hal Sutton, but did
not play four-ball, a move that raised eyebrows. Ben Crenshaw said
the move, putting Justin Leonard in with Sutton, was ``a hunch,''
and critics can argue whether it was a good move, just as there
will be wolves coming down on James if his team falls apart Sunday.
Securing at least four points seems a simple task, but consider
this _ since 1987, 25 Ryder Cup competitors have played five
matches and their singles record is 8-13-4.
</P>
<P>
   Not a huge confidence factor, but the Europeans are a strong lot
and they know what challenge lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really tired Friday night,'' said Jesper Parnevik,
``but, for some reason, I don't know why, I had adrenaline
(Saturday). I felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Singles has never been the European strong point (Oak Hill, 1995
excluded). James _ and the Americans _ know this.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether fatigue and/or rust will be factors.
Call it wishful thinking, but the Americans think they could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely do,'' said Tom Lehman, who said Coltart,
Sandelin, and Van de Velde face huge tasks. ``Three players haven't
played, and that's a benefit (for the US), yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very tough to come all the way over, prepare to
play, then for two days sit and watch. I imagine it would be pretty
tough,'' said Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the bottom line, which is the score. Europe 10,
the US 6, and Lehman finds it hard to criticize James. ``If that's
what it takes to win, I would, too,'' he said.

IN SPITE OF TV, DODGERS KEEP PACKING 'EM IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When they celebrate Fan Appreciation Day this
afternoon at Dodger Stadium, everyone should win the sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Arizona Diamondbacks clinched the National League
West on Friday, it is even more impressive that the Los Angeles
Dodgers also reached their magic number of 3 million fans the same
night.
</P>
<P>
   It is a number that is more important to the organization than
Jackie Robinson's 42. The Dodgers set that lofty attendance goal in
1978 and have gone over 13 times since. The Colorado Rockies blew
by them several years ago by drawing 4 million, back when Coors
Field was new and the team was good.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rockies are bad and Coors has been a ghost town the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. To the Dodgers, three million fans represent success,
even if the wins and losses suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, many of them found in Raul Mondesi's tirade
last month, it is amazing that the Dodger crowds kept coming all
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a unique relationship between the team and this
city. Even with the unveiling of the new Staples Center in a few
weeks, there are plenty of seats available for opening-night games
with the Kings and Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, whom many think are L.A.'s team, will draw well, but
it wasn't too long ago they were playing to less-than-capacity
crowds at the Forum. NFL? Yawn. USC football? The Trojans play UCLA
at home, but Notre Dame is on the road. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   At Chavez Ravine, there is something special. How else to
explain it since the Dodgers went an entire season without getting
on a roll, never winning more than five straight.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring price of Dodger Dogs became front-page news. The
scoreboard blared ``DE-VO, DE-VO'' as though he were actually more
than an aging center fielder with a crick in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bad marriage, but it survived. Is there any better
definition for unconditional love than the crowds that showed up to
watch Carlos Perez go 0-7 this season at Dodger Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   One-time Dodgers GM Buzzy Bavasi once said, ``Twenty thousand
fans would show up just to see why the lights are on.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fox might want to take credit for adding youthful music and
pyrotechnics between innings. But they paid $311 million for a team
that needs yet another overhaul because the stands are full and the
potential is limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Fox does deserve a bow for doing something most people in the
entertainment industry figured would make reaching 3 million in
attendance as extinct as a well-pitched game.
</P>
<P>
   They put them all on television.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we are no longer in the era when former owner Walter
O'Malley only televised the nine road games from Candlestick Park.
TV is big money. But it also is viewed as a drain on the live gate.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the Dodgers used to entice fans by televising
the first game of a homestand. Vin Scully would say, ``Hope to see
you out at the ballpark,'' like he was planning to escort you to
your seat.
</P>
<P>
   It worked because there still is no substitute for a warm July
night at Dodger Stadium, whether Eric Young is in the lineup or
not. Fans get ripped here for leaving in the seventh inning. But
this is not Philadelphia, where they booed Mike Schmidt on his way
to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   And in case you haven't noticed during all those games on cable,
fans everywhere are leaving in the seventh. Even at a baseball
shrine like Wrigley Field, the place empties after Sammy Sosa bats.
It doesn't matter if the game is still on the line.
</P>
<P>
   So after the game today, when they are giving away vacations to
Paris or Rome, the Dodgers will smile. They know their fans will
always come back.

RAINBOW WARRIORS TURN ROAD WARRIORS IN VICTORY AGAINST SMU

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Hawaii, which came to the Cotton Bowl with a 15-game
road losing streak and hadn't won a Western Athletic Conference
game away from Aloha Stadium in seven years, ended both skids
yesterday with a 20-0 victory against SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't exactly have a history of winning on the road,''
Hawaii coach June Jones said after the conference opener. ``Right
now any road win for us is a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Warriors, whose last shutout victory came five years
ago against Southeast Missouri, forced three turnovers and
outgained the Mustangs, 394-231. SMU (0-3) also cost themselves
pointswith two penalties that negated touchdowns, anda fumble into
the end zone that ended a drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned the ball over and had too many penalties,'' SMU
coach Mike Cavan said. ``That's something we've been doing all year
and we just continue to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii took a 7-0 lead on its second possession and needed just
two plays to go 81 yards for the score. Rainbow Warriors
quarterback Dan Robinson, who threw for 304 yards, found receivers
open behind the Mustangs' defense on consecutive plays, the second
resulting in a 38-yard touchdown pass to Channon Harris.
</P>
<P>
   SMU had a chance to answer late in the second when it reached
Hawaii's 5-yard line. But on third-and-2, freshman Kris Briggs
fumbled into the Hawaii end zone and Nate Jackson recovered,
returning it to the Hawaii 20. Eight plays later, Eric Hannum hit a
career-long 50 yard field goal as the half expired for a 10-0
Hawaii lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs' mistakes continued, beginning with the first play
of the second half. Rodnick Phillips appeared to have scored on a
70-yard run, but the play was nullified by an illegal block, and
SMU was eventually forced to punt.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing series, SMU's Tracy Hart intercepted a Robinson
pass and returned it 30 yards for a score only to have it called
back on an offsides penalty against the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Hawaii went on to seal the victory with a 42-yard
field goal by Hannum and a 13-yard scoring pass from Robinson to
Craig Stutzmann. Hawaii's defense held SMU to 81 yards rushing,
helping the Rainbow Warriors to preserve their first road shutout
since 1983, which came against UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since we won a road game,'' said Hawaii
linebacker Jeff Ulbrich, who recorded 16 tackles. ``It's nice to
break a seven-year losing streak.''

   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Space shuttle Columbia on Saturday made its
third return to Air Force Plant 42, where it was rolled out in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Bolted piggyback atop a NASA Boeing 747, Columbia made two
passes over parts of Palmdale and Lancaster before coming in for a
smooth touchdown at 10:19 a.m., following a two-day flight from
Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put on quite a show,'' Boeing spokeswoman Lynne Van Trieste
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's oldest orbiter is back in Palmdale for
approximately $70 million worth of inspections, maintenance and
modifications, which will keep more than 350 Boeing technicians and
engineers employed for about 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran of 26 flights into space, Columbia will be largely
disassembled inside the huge assembly building where all five
shuttles - including the ill-fated Challenger - were put together
in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will examine structural components for fatigue,
corrosion or broken rivets or welds. They also will inspect more
than 100 miles of wiring, following the discovery of a wiring
problem during the STS-93 mission, and apply abrasion protection
where necessary, Boeing and NASA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia won't look much different when it comes out, but it
will have undergone nearly 80 modifications. The modifications
include better protection for its radiators against space debris,
upgrades to its thermal protection, weight reductions and a
multifunction electronic display system or ``glass cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``glass cockpit,'' similar to those used in the latest
airliners, consists of touch-screen electronic panels to replace
the orbiter's 1970s video screens and mechanical gauges. Last year,
Atlantis became the first shuttle to get the new displays.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia will also get additional wire harnesses and connectors
that will let Kennedy workers install a docking device if NASA
officials decide to use it to supply the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's next flight is scheduled for December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia had originally been expected to reach Palmdale on
Friday afternoon. But the shuttle instead spent Friday night at
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri after its departure from
Florida was delayed by bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   To work on Columbia, Boeing recalled more than 150 workers who
had been laid off following the completion of inspections and
modifications in September 1998 to Atlantis. Boeing was able to
keep on more employees than usual between shuttles by transferring
in work from other plants, Van Trieste said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger with Boeing has been a really good thing for us,''
Van Trieste said.

THE NBA SHOT, AND TIMEOUT, HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a great moment in sports becomes one of the 100 greatest
moments in sports because it somehow changes the landscape, the
playing field or the rules, then Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals has
a momentous legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the NBA hadn't changed its rules regarding calling
timeouts after the Boston Celtics 128-126 victory against the
Phoenix Suns, this triple-overtime, last-second-shot laden,
marathon of a game can make a claim to being the best NBA Finals
game ever played.
</P>
<P>
   The game evoked feelings never before seen in the mecca known as
Boston Garden, and that included more than Garfield Heard's shot
with less than a second left in double overtime that forced the
third extra frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when it went in, I really felt something,'' Heard
said of the 20-foot turnaround jumper at the time. ``I don't know
what it was. But I felt something.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot ``Heard 'Round the World,'' as it has been called,
culminated a frenzy of activity. That the Suns defeated the
defending champion Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference
finals and reached the championship round despite a 42-40
regular-season record already had made for momentous drama.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on this June 4 night, Phoenix recovered from a 22-point
deficit against a Boston squad that featured Dave Cowens, John
Havlicek and Paul Silas, each of them NBA all-defensive team
selections in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Still, victory for the Celtics seemed all but assured when they
took a 109-106 lead with 15 seconds to play in the second overtime.
But Dick Van Arsdale hit a baseline jumper and Paul Westphal,
traded from Boston to Phoenix for Charlie Scott before the season,
came up with the next big play.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing inbounds pass, Westphal stole the ball. His steal
led to a Curtis Perry jumper and a 110-109 lead with four seconds
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Havlicek, however, dribbled the length of the floor and banked
in a jumper as time seemingly ran out. Celtics fans rushed the
floor to celebrate a 3-2 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   But referee Richie Powers put one second back on the clock.
Having to inbound from under their own basket seemed to assure the
Suns were all but set down. What's more, Phoenix had no timeouts to
call, and a timeout would have enabled them to inbound the ball at
halfcourt, at least, according to NBA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal called one anyway. Phoenix was hit with a technical and
a free throw made it 112-110. But the Suns got the ball at
halfcourt. What led to Heard's heroics at that moment is still a
question for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a lob to the basket, and I was supposed
to try and tip it in,'' Heard said. ``That was the designed play,
though I've heard about 15 others since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Nelson was playing me, and he wouldn't let me go back
door. Curtis \RPerry\S just threw the ball into me. I just turned
and shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And made it.
</P>
<P>
   Triple overtime added its own exclamation point of drama. Former
top draft pick Glenn McDonald, who played little during the game,
scored six points in the final five minutes to lead Boston to
victory. The Celtics went on to win the best-of-seven series, 4-2,
McDonald went on to Milwaukee the following season and played just
nine more games in his NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   And the NBA went on to change the timeout rules. A team can no
longer call a timeout if it is out of timeouts, not even in
exchange for a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals is not remembered only
for a mere technical-ity. ``Tomorrow: The golden girls of the 1996
Summer Olympics''

TAMPA BAY BEATS YANKEES, 2-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A massive homemade calendar takes up about a third of
the wall space in the office of Yankees Manager Joe Torre, and in
those boxes where the scheduled starting pitchers are usually
listed for the week ahead in blue ink, there are blank spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and his coaching staff are in the process of aligning the
rotation for last week of the regular season and for the playoffs,
which begin next week. All the relevant information is in Torre's
hands after David Cone's solid six innings in a 2-1 loss to Tampa
Bay Saturday. It was the Devil Rays' first victory at Yankee
Stadium; they had been 0-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have assured themselves of at least a wild-card
berth, and with their magic number for clinching the American
League East at four, it appears that only time stands between the
Yankees and their third division title in four seasons. They came
from behind on Friday night and went on to beat Tampa Bay in extra
innings, and they were a millimeter from tying Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez, the Devil Rays' closer, had not blown a save
since June 30 before he faltered on Friday, and he jogged back to
the mound Saturday to try again. Jorge Posada led off the bottom of
the ninth inning, Hernandez _ whose fastball has been clocked at
100 miles an hour _ zipped a pitch over the middle of the plate,
and Posada smashed it.
</P>
<P>
   As Posada moved up the first-base line, he watched the Devil
Rays' center fielder, Dave Martinez, charge toward the fence in
left field, running, turning, until Martinez's back was facing the
infield. Posada's ball thumped near the very top of the padded
wall, bounced upward and fell to the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the Yankees in their bullpen beyond the
left-center-field fence began screaming that the ball had struck a
support bar behind the fence _ that would make it a home run _
rather than the top of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen coach, Tony Cloninger, called the Yankees' dugout to
say what they had seen, and Torre moved swiftly onto the field to
argue as Posada stood at second base.
</P>
<P>
   But television replays showed that in fact, the ball hit the
very edge of the wall, leaving a divot in the padding. If Posada's
drive had gone any farther, it almost certainly would have skipped
off and over the wall for a game-tying home run. ``Everyone thought
it was a home run,'' Cloninger said, ``but the camera shows it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Soriano ran for Posada and advanced to third on a
groundout, and Chili Davis pinch-hit for Scott Brosius and fouled
off the first-pitch fastball from Hernandez; Davis' at-bats lately
have hinged on whether he gets ahead in the count.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez went on to strike out Davis on three pitches, and
Chuck Knoblauch hit a fly to left, screaming furiously as he ran up
the line and watched the ball land in Terrell Lowery's glove for
the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, the losing pitcher, was in the clubhouse by then. He has
not been credited with a victory since Aug. 8, sometimes because of
his inconsistency, and on other occasions because he has been
unfortunate. The Yankees have scored one or two runs in seven of
his last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struggled to find his command early in Saturday's game _
his slider and splitter were hanging and he got away with several
potentially disastrous pitches, perhaps because he was facing the
weak-hitting Devil Rays. But Cone slowed his pace, recovered and
pitched effectively in his last four innings. ``I found a pretty
good rhythm,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out eight, walked two and gave up two runs, and Torre
said he was pleased. Torre and the pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre,
began discussing the Yankees' playoff rotation Saturday, and they
have more good options than any other team headed for the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre faces several tough decisions as well. A few weeks
ago, he mentioned Cone as a possible starter for Game 1 of the
playoffs. Now Torre appears to be leaning toward starting Cone in
either Game 3 or Game 4. Cone may not be winning as much as he did
in the first half, but the Yankees have had success when he starts
_ winning 19 of his 30 outings, as Cone noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Joe has slotted me in for Game 3,'' Cone said,
referring to the first round of last year's playoffs and the World
Series in 1996 and 1998. ``I wouldn't be surprised if that's the
case again _ or maybe even lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, Torre mentioned before the game that he
had three starters who are capable of pitching Game 1, three
starters who are pitching well. Presumably, Torre was referring to
Orlando Hernandez (16-9), Andy Pettitte (14-11) and Roger Clemens
(14-9). Pettitte most likely will pitch Game 1 or Game 2 in Yankee
Stadium, because the Yankees will probably play Texas in the
Division Series and Pettitte has not pitched well in the Rangers'
park.
</P>
<P>
   The Game 1 starter also will have the responsibility of pitching
the fifth game if the three-of-five-game series plays out fully.
Since the trade deadline, when Torre and General Manager Brian
Cashman lobbied to keep Pettitte, the left-hander has been the
team's most consistent pitcher, going 7-3 with a 2.70 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez lasted a third of an inning in Seattle in early
August, but over his last nine starts, El Duque is 4-2 with a 3.46
e.r.a. Clemens, too, has shown marked improvement that has not
always translated into victories and losses. After allowing 138
hits and 60 walks in his first 1261/3 innings _ 1.6 base runners
per inning _ Clemens has surrendered 43 hits and 25 walks in his
last 551/3 innings, or 1.2 base runners per inning, with a 3.58
e.r.a.
</P>
<P>
   Torre almost always goes back to what he trusts, and he will
always trust Hernandez following his pivotal victory in Game 4 of
the Championship Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that when Torre sorts through his rotation, Hernandez
will start Game 1, Pettitte Game 2, Clemens and Cone in Games 3 and
4. Decisions, decisions. &QL;

THE GOVERNMENT'S CURIOUS CASE AGAINST BIG TOBACCO  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The administration's decision to sue the
tobacco industry for tens of billions of dollars is based on
economic theory that is as mendacious as it is specious.
</P>
<P>
   The action is based on claims that tobacco producers impose
medical costs on society by selling goods that damage the public
health. Therefore, the theory goes, the public has a right to
relief because of the economic burden tobacco use creates for
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   This claim sounds plausible, which explains why so many tobacco
foes have embraced it without question. It is part of the
anti-tobacco crusade mantra, and has become a cornerstone of
government's efforts to add legal booty to the tax-revenue stream
from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all the available evidence points the other way. When
tobacco's critics make such assertions, they lack convincing
research to buttress such claims.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is substantial support for the
contention that both the tobacco industry and smokers more than pay
the costs of dealing with smoking-related illnesses. The work of
Harvard Law School economist Kim Viscusi stands out, but is only
part of the considerable body of research done by credible
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For those disposed to a fair-minded approach, this view should
be at least as plausible as the claim that nonsmoking taxpayers are
unfairly saddled with smokers' medical bills. It's difficult to
imagine either an industry or a consumer group more taxed than
tobacco producers and their customers. Philip Morris chief
executive Geoffrey Bible put the situation into perspective in
remarks at this year's stockholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excise taxes on cigarettes alone,'' he said, ``contribute more
than $13 billion a year to federal, state and local governments
(and) that's before the industry shells out some 40 percent of it
profits in corporate income taxes....At Philip Morris, we are so
heavily and so unfairly taxed that we were the largest single
(U.S.) taxpayer last year. We have also been among the largest
corporate sources of funds in many states....If the rest of the
country's top 150 companies paid as much to the federal government
as we do, (it) could just about eliminate the personal income
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the equation is the morbidity factor. While
tobacco producers and consumers produce more than enough tax
revenue to pay for their medical care, their habit meanwhile
contributes to their early demise and thus saves the public money.
As recently as June, the Congressional Research Service, a federal
agency, issued a report concluding that premature deaths by smokers
actually saved the U.S. $29 billion annually in pension and
health-care outlays.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Justice Department litigators
deal with this sort of inconvenient data when attempting to prove
the administration's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Factual niceties aside, though, what's most curious about this
initiative from an economic perspective is how it risks killing a
goose that lays such huge golden eggs. Given that tobacco is an
incredibly lucrative source of revenue year in and year out, what's
the point of trying to further weaken its viability as an industry
with another potentially crippling lawsuit?

PLAYFUL PUP LEARNS TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Brittany pup, Cyrus _ 16 weeks old
tomorrow _ is finding his place in our family.
</P>
<P>
   He's the son of Holly's Bear, and a grandson of that fine old
hunter, Rufus, who sleeps now in an abandoned fence row at the edge
of a quail meadow, the grave marked by a carefully laid stack of
lichened stones.
</P>
<P>
   The talents of the paternal line, and also those of the mother,
Maggie, appear to have been transmitted in full measure. At age 8
weeks, the day after he came home, Cyrus pointed quite stylishly
the first quail wing put before him.
</P>
<P>
   For his sire, Bear, fatherhood has taken some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week before he could bear even to look at the wretched
creature, and two more before he'd permit the youngster to
approach. Mostly he sat in the far corner of the yard, wishing he'd
known beforehand the penalty for a spring romance.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last few days I have seen a change. He has touched
noses with Cyrus and even let the feisty pup torment him a bit,
although his tolerance for that is short and he soon withdraws
again.
</P>
<P>
   Bear's heart is softening, but clearly he's worried about where
such permissiveness might lead.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pete _ Bear's brother and thus the pup's uncle _ is
wonderfully indulgent. Cyrus devils him endlessly. If Pete picks up
a stick to carry around the yard, a favorite activity, Cy scampers
along beside him, trying to seize the other end.
</P>
<P>
   If the long-suffering uncle decides to rest on the step outside
the breakfast room door, the pup clamps his needle-toothed jaws on
his leg or throat or ear. Sometimes I hear Pete groan a bit, but
mostly I think it brings back memories of his own puppyhood.
</P>
<P>
   Those two romp together endlessly and except for the difference
in size you almost could imagine them littermates.
</P>
<P>
   The older dogs and I are summer soft. We'll need to work at
getting fit. So on a recent chilly morning _ one that held fine
promise of the season's turning _ we made an outing past the city's
edge for some exercise together.
</P>
<P>
   At first Cyrus would have been glad enough to play, if either of
the others had had a mind to. But then he saw how they lifted their
noses to decipher any messages that might come to them on the crisp
air.
</P>
<P>
   And he saw how they plunged boldly into the thickest cover, and
how, when they'd been out of sight for several moments, they came
out of the brush and weeds to show themselves and check the
position of the man.
</P>
<P>
   The pup observed all this, and it spoke to some part of him that
wasn't puppyish at all _ some memory as old as the memory of his
kind. And in only minutes, his manner entirely changed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tagging along he was out ahead with father and uncle,
still patterning himself on them, but making independent excursions
of his own, reading the breeze for himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's certain that he'll be hunting in November _ not expertly
yet, but well enough to show his promise. He'll be in his sixth
month then. If a dog's year makes seven human ones, that means
he'll still be a tot of only 3.
</P>
<P>
   You've read about, or possibly even known, those amazing
youngsters who dazzle their elders by playing the violin, composing
symphonies or mastering the game of chess.
</P>
<P>
   No dog of mine has ever been gifted in quite that way. But as
luck would have it, I've never had one that wasn't a prodigy at the
work he was born to do.

AS YEN RISES, FISCAL POWERS DEBATE MERITS OF INTERVENING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
(SUBS for new top)  By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Japan on Saturday yielded to international pressure
and agreed to take some extraordinary steps to reverse the recent
and surprising climb of the Japanese yen against the dollar, which
has rattled Wall Street in recent days and threatened Japan's
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   After an all-day meeting here, the finance ministers of the
Group of 7 largest industrial countries issued a joint communique
saying the Japanese authorities had, in effect, agreed to even
deeper deficit spending and to begin printing yen to prompt
inflation. Interest rates in Japan are already virtually zero, so
the move represents a last-ditch effort to keep the yen's rise from
making the country's exports more expensive around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In return the United States and other major nations issued a
vague threat that they might jointly intervene in the markets to
weaken the yen and strengthen the dollar, a warning sign to
currency traders who have been dumping the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan actually begins trying to spur inflation _ in hopes of
weakening the yen and encouraging its own consumers to stop saving
and start buying _ it would be an enormous change of strategy.
Hyperinflation in the years before World War II still weighs
heavily on the country, and since 1945 Japan has been strongly
conservative, keeping inflation to an absolute minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of the statement Saturday was deliberately
ambiguous, an effort to keep investors guessing and prevent them
from betting against the dollar. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers Saturday night pointed to a paragraph that he said was
``very carefully worded,'' which referred to Japan's agreement to
``provide ample liquidity until deflationary concerns are
dispelled.'' But he said he would not ``interpret that remark,''
nor would he say whether the United States would finally join Japan
in intervening in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyawaza, was asked Saturday
night if the United States and other countries had agreed to
intervene. He declined to offer a specific answer _ finance
ministers never do _ but said, ``You could feel and see for
yourself that full recognition of the situation has been gained.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the finance ministers and central bank chiefs did
not carry the high drama of their session a year ago, when Russia's
currency had collapsed and markets around the world appeared on the
precipice of disaster. Asia has since begun a slow recovery, and
even Japan has showed signs of pulling out of a recession that
began more than seven years ago. In fact, the renewed interest of
investors in putting their money into Japan is one reason the yen
has risen by more than 15 percent against the dollar since
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   But big currency moves can also cause big problems. It was the
steady rise of the dollar from 1995 to 1997 that indirectly helped
start the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday night, the United States had indicated no
willingness to join Japan in meddling with the currency markets by
pouring in yen, and trying to reduce the currency's value against
the dollar. Instead, the United States has been pushing Japan to
lower its interest rates even further _ no easy trick here _ and to
force it to keep spending heavily on new roads and other projects
to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly independent Bank of Japan declined to lower
interest rates earlier in the week, outraging Japanese politicians.
And Tokyo is now running up such huge deficits that it threatens to
get itself into the same kind of fiscal problem the United States
fell into in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff on how to respond to the problem has become the
first big test for Summers, a former Harvard economist who became
Treasury secretary in July. ``This will be an interesting moment to
see how much Larry learned about timing, about how to keep the
markets guessing, and about how to keep the Japanese guessing,'' a
senior administration official said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Planning _ or feigning _ currency interventions is a bit like
threatening military strikes. Governments want to keep the markets
guessing a bit about the timing and size of the attack, in hopes
that just the fear of intervention will be enough to change the
market's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the yen was not the only problem on the agenda.
Russian officials were invited to sit in on the end of the Group of
7 meeting, chiefly to receive a warning that the wealthy nations
will not be willing to extend further aid unless Russia agrees to
regular, far more intrusive audits into how it uses loans from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional hearings this past week focused attention on the
widespread corruption in Russia, though so far there is no evidence
that the fund's money was diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's communique said Russia's central bank must take
steps to improve its ``internal controls and initiate quarterly
audits'' before getting any future IMF funds.

 [HEAD  IMAGE OF THE FBI IS BEING DESTROYED 2TAKES -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A half-century before black smoke rose above the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas, little boys sent fan mail to J. Edgar
Hoover. He led the good guys at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Hoover,'' wrote Mickey from New York. ``Please help
me and my friends start an FBI club. We need guns, bombs and other
things to surprise the crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's image today, as U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley describes
it, would surprise Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the top there's been a rush to judgment on high-profile
cases,'' said the Iowa Republican, one of Capitol Hill's critics of
the bureau. ``And that's destroying the image of the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is under fire from former allies: Washington
politicians, Hollywood filmmakers, the far right. Grassley, like
Mickey, grew up at a time when the ``Junior G-Man'' craze was
embraced. Most Americans didn't know how the bureau really worked.
Decades would pass before Hoover's penchant for heavy handedness,
surveillance and cover-up would surface.
</P>
<P>
   FBI observers say the agency's troubles of late, including
evidence of a Waco cover-up, add fresh scars to a face that people
once thought was unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   Reckless sharpshooting at Ruby Ridge? Whistle-blowing at the
crime lab? Confessing to firing incendiary tear-gas canisters at
Waco after years of denials?
</P>
<P>
   Author and historian Richard Gid Powers said the agency's image
problems were mounting at an unlikely time.
</P>
<P>
   Since Louis J. Freeh became FBI director several months after
the 1993 siege at Waco, ``the primary in-house training has been in
the area of ethics,'' said Powers. ``They've developed a
zero-tolerance policy for lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freeh is very serious about changing the culture,'' he said.
``And yet, you have all these stories coming out. It's got to be
demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest story hit Thursday, adding to the public's confusion
about the FBI's investigation into China's theft of American
nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI last week derailed its three-year investigation of an
alleged Chinese spy, Wen Ho Lee, who had been dismissed from his
job at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A new inquiry will look at
more than 500 potential suspects at scores of nuclear research
sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Was Lee off the hook? Government officials told the Los Angeles
Times the inquiry was stalled for lack of evidence but the Justice
Department wasn't ruling out prosecuting Lee.
</P>
<P>
   With such embarrassments, some experts fear the FBI's efforts to
recruit agents could stall. The bureau's traditional immunity from
Congress' budget ax could end, informants may be less willing to
work with the FBI and juries might even think twice about
convicting suspects arrested by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   None of that has happened. But recent political attacks on the
bureau's credibility could bring it about, said retired Special
Agent Buck Revell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're teetering on it now,'' Revell said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, FBI spokeswoman Anita Dickens said the agency was
attracting the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get roughly 1,000 applications a day from people wanting to
be agents,'' she said. ``People still believe we are the premier
law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any organization is going to be criticized. My personal belief
is that the country is more cynical than it used to be. Among the
FBI's low points of the decade: In 1992 _ the year before Freeh
took over _ federal agents squared off with tax resisters at Ruby
Ridge, Idaho. During an 11-day standoff at Randy Weaver's ranch, an
FBI sniper shot and killed Weaver's wife. The marksman said he hit
the wrong target.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a white separatist, collected $3 million in a wrongful
death suit. A judge dismissed criminal charges against the sniper.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco disaster occurred the following April, after members of
David Koresh's armed camp killed four agents of the federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The FBI's plan to overtake the
compound ended in a blaze, which the bureau says was set by the
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh shot himself, and more than six dozen of his followers
died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing patriot groups and firearms enthusiasts point to Waco
and Ruby Ridge as proof that federal authorities are determined to
encroach on citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has heard it before, but from a different crowd. In the
1960s the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr._ a target of FBI surveillance
_ joined others on the political left in denouncing the bureau's
lack of concern for the civil rights of blacks and anti-war
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this opposition from the right _ that's new,'' said
University of Wisconsin law professor Frank Tuerkheimer, a former
U.S. attorney. ``The very conservatives who ordinarily are pro-law
enforcement have become anti-government. And the FBI is
government.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents investigating the 1996 Olympics bombing in Atlanta at
first suspected security guard Richard Jewell. They planned to
trick him into talking.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming to be making a training film, agents questioned him
until director Freeh intervened, ordering them to read Jewell his
Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and U.S. Justice Department officials later exonerated
Jewell and apologized. Still, his name had leaked nationwide as the
key suspect in the blast. And the real culprit hasn't yet been
found.
</P>
<P>
   Also unsolved is the 1996 explosion of TWA Flight 800, in which
230 persons died. While Treasury Department investigators pointed
to a possible flaw in the aircraft's fuel tank, the FBI refused to
rule out sabotage. Grassley called the FBI's investigation ``a
model of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's inspector general in 1997 issued a
scathing report on ``inexcusable'' practices at the bureau's crime
lab. Some testing led to ``conclusions that incriminated the
defendants without a scientific basis,'' the report said. The roof
leaked and researchers stored evidence haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, an FBI task force followed the false leads of an
imprisoned convict who had implicated himself in the murders of
three sightseers at Yosemite National Park. A fourth slaying
occurred in late July. A motel handyman named Cary Stayner, whom
authorities had questioned earlier, confessed to all four killings
and now faces trial.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and other Justice officials
have been publicly contrite and insist they'll get to the bottom of
any problems within the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Their supporters point out the bureau's successes of the 1990s:
the conviction of mob boss John Gotti; the capture of Theodore
Kaczynski, the Unabomber; the peaceful resolution of the Montana
``freemen'' standoff in 1995; linking terrorist financier Osama bin
Laden to the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

 [HEAD  IMAGE OF THE FBI IS BEING DESTROYED 2NDTAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the World Trade Center bombing, the bureau corralled the
Muslim perpetrators before they could blow up the Lincoln Tunnel
and the United Nations building.
</P>
<P>
   If the FBI's image is hurting, the budget doesn't show it. Under
President Clinton the FBI's allocation has jumped 25 percent, to
about $3 billion now, while other agencies have watched funds
evaporate. The bureau's detractors in Congress, which approves the
spending, know that crime-fighting remains a popular campaign
issue, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grassley says he thinks the rank-and-file agents are honest
and doing a tough, commendable job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen closely to the Republicans, and nobody's really
taking on the FBI per se,'' said Tuerkheimer. ``They're taking on
the attorney general'' to get to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the FBI's problems extend beyond partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that institutions have cultures,'' said
Robert Unger, author of The Union Station Massacre: The Original
Sin of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. ``The culture of the FBI has been
developing since Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger's 1997 examination of the shootout at Union Station
suggested the bureau covered up mistakes that were 64 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Records from the 1933 investigation convinced Unger that Hoover,
in his zeal to propel his bureau to national prominence, relied on
slim evidence and ``dead wrong, flat-out lies'' in blaming
gangsters for the deaths of four lawmen. The Kansas City author
determined that most of the killing was done by the officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent ABC News poll, 57 percent of Americans said they
thought the FBI had been ``intentionally trying to cover up its
actions at Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 percent said the agency made ``an honest mistake'' when
it denied using potentially flammable tear gas canisters. The rest
voiced no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts about the FBI's credibility present a situation that
mobsters, drug traffickers and their lawyers have tried to create
for decades. Their task of convincing jurors to be wary of the
bureau may get easier if its image continues to fray, said ex-agent
Revell.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers across the country already have tried entering
into evidence news clippings of FBI blunders to sway juries into
thinking that their clients, too, were wrongly targeted. None of
these defense tactics has led to an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jones, attorney for convicted Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy McVeigh, tried but failed to convince his jury that
slipshod FBI work _ particularly at the crime lab _ allowed the
real killers to get away.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests the FBI will survive. For example, Clarence
Kelley helped restore accountability and honesty to the FBI after
Hoover's death, Powers said. Kelley, a former Kansas City police
chief, headed the bureau from 1973 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Today, FBI public relations officers still present a positive
image, but have relaxed when it comes to Hollywood's portrayal of
the bureau, many observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster's character in ``The Silence of the Lambs'' may
have been frightened while hunting a killer, but the number of
women recruits at the FBI soared after the film's release. The
bureaucrats portrayed in ``The X-Files'' and ``The Rock'' may have
been

<P>
   &UR; THE STORY OF AMERICAN FREEDOM &LR;  By Eric Foner. Norton, $15.95. A
historian argues that freedom is not a fixed set of principles but
a ``complex of values'' that have evolved over time as various
excluded groups have struggled for liberty. ``The book's strongest
claim to distinction lies ... in its succinct, information-packed,
wonderfully readable account of the twists and turns in
20th-century American history,'' Pauline Maier wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE POISONWOOD BIBLE &LR;  By Barbara Kingsolver. Harper Perennial,
$14. The story of a fanatical Baptist clergyman who uproots his
Georgia family and sets them down in the Belgian Congo in 1959 is
narrated by his wife and four daughters, each of whom abandons one
faith and discovers another as their lives unravel in the jungle.
This novel, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review, also has much to say
about America and its homegrown brand of missionary zeal. ``For all
its portraiture of place'' the narrative is ``shaped by keen-eyed
women contemplating themselves and one another and a village whose
familiarity it takes a tragedy to discover,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CINDERELLA &AMP; COMPANY: Backstage at the Opera With Cecilia
Bartoli &LR;  By Manuela Hoelterhoff. Vintage, $14. This profile of the
Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli is also a withering look at
modern opera: the industry's youth-obsessed star-making machinery,
the intense egomania and raging insecurities, the brutal sniping.
The result ``is a naughtily witty tell-almost-all book,'' Terry
Teachout wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPERA, OR THE UNDOING OF WOMEN &LR; , by Catherine Clement
(University of Minnesota, $17.95), is a scholarly critique by a
European feminist who argues that opera is one long tale of male
domination in which victimized women characters are consigned to a
``sung death.'' In 1989 the reviewer Paul Robinson called this ``a
highly original interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VOYAGE OF THE NARWHAL &LR;  By Andrea Barrett. Norton, $14. A
British naturalist embarks on a voyage of self-discovery when he
boards a vessel searching for clues to the mysterious disappearance
of Sir John Franklin's Arctic expedition of 1845. Last year the
reviewer Annette Kobak called this novel a ``marvelous
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOO COOL &LR;  By Duff Brenna. Plume, $12.95. In this raw novel
about teen-age desperadoes in Colorado, a 16-year-old misfit named
Triple E escapes from reform school and gets stranded with his
girlfriend in a heavy snowstorm. The result is ``an unfaltering,
unflinching, piercing look into a tormented youthful heart,''
Richard Bernstein wrote in 1998 in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NURTURE ASSUMPTION: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do &LR; 
By Judith Rich Harris. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. Melding
research from many fields, a former writer of textbooks on
developmental psychology makes the provocative case that children
are shaped more by their own temperament and peers than by the
input of their parents. No matter which side of the argument
readers come down on, ``Harris writes beautifully, in a tone both
persuasive and conversational,'' Carol Tavris wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LUNCH-BOX CHRONICLES: Notes From the Parenting
Underground &LR; , by Marion Winik (Vintage, $12), is a frontline report
on child rearing by a commentator for National Public Radio. ``Take
Erma Bombeck, add the obsessions of a single mother ... and you
have Marion Winik, as companionable a writer as a crazed parent
ever found,'' Andrea Cooper wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MALINA &LR;  By Ingeborg Bachmann. Holmes &AMP; Meier, $15.95. A
Viennese woman plagued by violent dreams navigates difficult
relationships with two men, one of whom forces her to confront the
pain of her childhood. ``This courageous and important novel,''
originally published in German in 1971, ``is equal to the best of
Virginia Woolf and Samuel Beckett,'' Peter Filkins wrote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY YEAR OFF &LR;  By Robert McCrum. Broadway, $13. The author was 42
and the editor in chief of a major London publishing house when he
suffered a paralyzing stroke. This ``lucid, heartfelt'' account of
his arduous recovery ``is a testament to the parallel trials and
the courage of the family members of stroke victims,'' Abraham
Verghese wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MACKEREL BY MOONLIGHT &LR;  By William F. Weld. Pocket Star, $6.99.
This mystery novel by the former Massachusetts governor is about an
assistant U.S. attorney from Brooklyn whose shadowy past resurfaces
after he opts for a job in a white-shoe Boston law firm and a life
in politics. Last year the reviewer Donald E. Westlake admired the
``deft and devious story-telling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIRST &LR;  By Ken Kalfus. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.
Many of these stories are brief and jarring fantasies, including
one in which Marco Polo describes a series of indoor retail malls
to the emperor Kublai Khan. ``The displaced figures in `Thirst'
drift through worlds that are at once astonishing and familiar,''
Ron Carlson wrote last year.

KC HEAD OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD DIES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The longtime president and chief executive
officer of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri died
Friday after a battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood officials recently dedicated the
organization's office as the Patricia Catlin Brous Midtown Center
for Reproductive Services. Brous and her husband, Tom, also
celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Brous, 55, was born in Miami Beach, Fla., but was raised and
spent most of her life in the Kansas City area, said Brous' son,
Joel. She began volunteering for Planned Parenthood in 1974, then
served on its board of directors and became the organization's
development director.
</P>
<P>
   Brous took over as the organization's president and CEO in 1990,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was a huge, huge believer in self-determination, and
what she believed in pervaded her entire life,'' Joel Brous, 28,
said. ``What was really special and her guiding force is that she
respected everyone's personal choices. She really touched people in
all different walks of life, because she was such a hard worker and
so tenacious in making sure people could make informed choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Brous also served as past president of the Junior League of
Kansas City and was on the board of the Historical Kansas City
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Brous was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and son, she is survived by a
daughter, Anna Catlin Brous, a daughter-in-law, Carrie, her mother,
Dorothy H. Catlin, and siblings, Philancy C. Hedges, Christopher S.
Catlin and Joel O. Catlin, and mother-in-law, Augusta G. Brous.
</P>
<P>
   A celebration of Brous' life will be Tuesday.

MILLS STRUGGLING AT THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three weeks ago Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Alan
Mills was hoping to keep his ERA under three. That goal was
revamped. Now, he wants to make sure his ERA doesn't jump above
four before the season runs out next Sunday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which everything's gone wrong, add the recent
struggles of Mills to the list of Dodgers' concerns heading into
what could be a tumultuous offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, the right-hander signed to a three-year contract last
season, has experienced control problems of late. While the Dodgers
believe he is in a typical funk that plagues nearly every pitcher
at one point in a season, they want to see him break out of it. In
his past four outings he's allowed six runs and walked four in 32/3
innings. It's pushed his ERA from 3.27 to 3.90.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm healthy, what I'm going through right now, I'm
going to let it take care of itself,'' Mills said. ``I just need to
make adjustments. It's just a period where I have to get through it
and try not to make it last too long. You'd like to end on a good
note so you can at least go home with something positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Home at the Ravine: By watching most of the Dodgers' starters,
it was hard to tell Chavez Ravine is a pitcher's ballpark. But even
with home runs flying out at a record rate _ the Dodgers had
allowed 97 before Saturday, breaking the 1970 mark of 82 _
right-hander Kevin Brown proved it was more because of pitching
than atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who's 18 wins tie for the second most in his career, went
9-3 with a 1.95 ERA in 16 home starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some places the mound fits you and you feel comfortable,''
said Brown, who was 1-1 with a 2.70 ERA at Dodger Stadium before
this year. ``Maybe eating home-cooked meals. I don't know how to
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crackerjack lineup: With little to do for the next week, Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson was reminiscing about his playing days with
the Baltimore Orioles under Earl Weaver, who liked to switch around
lineups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling the newspaper (reporters) that looking at
the lineup every day is like a box of cracker jacks,'' Johnson
said. ``You don't know what's you're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield's two-run homer in the
fourth inning was his 30th of the season. It's the third time in
his career he's hit 30, and the first since 1996.... Right fielder
Raul Mondesi entered the game with 90 RBI, tied for his career
best. He's already established a career high for homers (31) and
stolen bases (33).
