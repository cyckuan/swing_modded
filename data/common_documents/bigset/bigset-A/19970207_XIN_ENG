<HEADLINE> Britain Aims to Become Top World Tourism Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain is striving to become the
world's number one holiday making paradise, attracting millions
more tourists who will fuel an economic and employment boom across
the country.
</P>
<P>
After unveiling the government report named Success Through
Partnership earlier today, British Heritage Secretary Virgina
Bottomley said: "We want to make Britain the number one
destination, not just for domestic tourism but for Europeans and
the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"We want to extend the season and develop areas away from
places such as London, Oxford and Stratford. And there is no limit
in sight to the increase in visitors we accommodate," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain earns more than 37 billion pounds
(about 60 billion U.S. dollars) each year from its tourism
industry and its total economic impact is estimated to more than
twice of that.

<HEADLINE> France Says to Share U.S. Position on Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it shares
the position taken by the United States on Zaire, after Washington
Wednesday warned Zaire's neighbors to stay out of the fighting
between Zairean government forces and Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We share the worry of Washington. Any participation by the
armies of these countries in the fightings in eastern Zaire would
create in effect a situation of a very big graveness," said
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman, Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
"We persist in thinking that the territorial integrity and the
intangibility of the frontiers of Zaire should be respected. It is
the future of the African continent which is concerned," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels today captured the strategic town of Punia, 300
kilometers southeast of Kisangani in central Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has forced the fleeing of 40,000 Rwandan Hutu
refugees and the personnel of the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) from a refugee camp in Shabunda, 200
kilometers south of Punia.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted UNHCR officials in
Kisangani as saying that the refugees fled the camp of Shabunda on
Wednesday, after rumors spread that the Tutsi rebels had captured
Katshunga, 45 kilometers northeast of Shabunda.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry also announced that Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni will visit France next week, most
probably Tuesday, and that the U.N. special envoy for the Great
Lakes region, Algerian diplomat Mohamed Sahnoun, will be in Paris
later this week.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Says No on NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that Turkey will not support the enlargement
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) because the
European Union (EU) does not admit Turkey into the regional
alliance.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a press statement issued following his
meeting with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who arrived
here Wednesday for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said, "Although we are for the enlargement of the NATO
in principle, we think that it is important for this issue to be
evaluated within the general framework of European new formation."
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey should take its place in a European family
picture in the EU summit scheduled to be held in Amsterdam in June.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Solana, Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan reiterated the views that the expansion of the NATO and
Turkey's entry into the EU were linked.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller warned that
Turkey might block plans for the NATO expansion if her country's
plea for EU accession was stalled.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is considering the membership
applications by up to 10 possible candidates, but Turkey is not
among them.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made a full membership application to the EU in
April 1987.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- On Lunar New Year's Eve,
crowds of merrymakers are flocking to Victoria Park for the annual
fair, while many others are flying to tourist destinations on the
Chinese mainland and in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Victoria Park Fair is the largest of the territory's 13
fairs with some 600 stands offering a variety of items ranging
from balloons to cartoon ball pens.
</P>
<P>
Souvenirs featuring the handover, such as the Flag and the
Emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) are
available at several stalls, reminding people that it is the last
lunar new year before Hong Kong returns to the motherland on July
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
And there is a stall different from others by selling self-made
street name-plates, in both Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
"These name-plates might disappear from Hong Kong's streets as
they bear Hong Kong's colonial past. It's interesting to collect
them," said the stall owner.
</P>
<P>
A mixture of fragrance led people to the floral market of the
fair, where peach blossoms, gladioli, orchids, roses, snowdrops,
violets and narcissus are in full blossom.
</P>
<P>
The Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the
most important festival for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A few days before the Year of the Ox, which symbolizes
hardworking and robustness, the house is thoroughly cleaned and
new Spring couplets and paper door gods replace old ones.
</P>
<P>
All streets are flooded with a rich assortment of blossoms, and
flower-loving people usually stop at one stand or another to
choose a bunch of their favorites.
</P>
<P>
Shops and supermarkets are much more crowded than ever, with
customers queuing before cash desks.
</P>
<P>
It is really a time for rejoicing and family reunion. The
Immigration Department predicted that a record high number of 3
million people will travel across the Lo Wu checkpoint during a
20-day period straddling the New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Lunar New Year's Eve, in particular, is expected to see up to
135,000 people entering the Chinese mainland for the festival.
</P>
<P>
At Kai Tak Airport, which is bracing itself for a rush of
travelers taking advantage of the holidays, the handling capacity
is also stretched to the limit.
</P>
<P>
This translates into an average of 30 extra flights a day in
the two weeks to February 16, pushing the daily flight number to
more than 430.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Department estimated that 260,000 people
will fly out between today and Sunday -- most visiting the Chinese
mainland and other Asian destinations.

<HEADLINE> African States Urge to Boost Environment Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from Mauritius,
Zimbabwe and Uganda today called for an enchanced role of the
weakening U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP), which they said has
made many achievements in global environment protection.
</P>
<P>
"UNEP should become the effective leading agency for the
environment," said Mauritian Environmental Minister Rajesh
Bhagwan at the two-week 19th session of the UNEP Governing
Council starting on January 27.
</P>
<P>
UNEP, the sole U.N. environmental body, is now under strong
attacks and facing the most serious money crisis due to sharp cut
of donations by some key western donors.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other western countries charge UNEP
has been wasteful, inefficient and done little since the 1992
Earth Summit and thus need urgent and drastical reforms on its
power-structure and work priorities.
</P>
<P>
Bhagwan argued that UNEP has made positive contributions in
many fields such as the Industry and Environment Program, the
Environmental Law Program and the Cleaner Production Program.
</P>
<P>
"The achievement of UNEP in the field of environmental law is
one positive message that we can take to the Special Session of
the General Assembly" set for June, he said.
</P>
<P>
"UNEP stands unique as our best option for providing
coordination, scientific research, capacity building and the
formulations of sound environmental policies," Zimbabwean
Environmental Minister C. Chimutengwende noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ugandan Environmental Minister Matia Isoke said his
country appreciates "the outstanding work done by UNEP which has
helped to set and shape the global environmental agenda."
</P>
<P>
"Through UNEP's efforts, environmental issues have been
identified, analysed and continually brought into sharp focus,"
he added
</P>
<P>
On the structural reform of UNEP, all the three African
nations strongly urged to broaden the power of the Committee of
Permanent Representatives (CPR), an international subsidiary body
of the UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to create a new international mechanism of
the Council. The CPR can assume this role," the Mauritian
minister said, while asking for greater role of small island
states inside the UNEP leadership.
</P>
<P>
The United States said Wednesday there is "need to establish a
small executive committee, fully representative of UNEP...to
provide direction and guidance."
</P>
<P>
In response, the Zimbabwean delegate said "the creation of an
executive organ as an international body will compound the
problems instead of solving them."
</P>
<P>
"We perceive that the proposal is aimed at depriving the
majority of members especially developing countries from full
participating in the decision-making of UNEP," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPR "should be broadened and strengthened" and hence made
more democratic, said the Ugandan minister.
</P>
<P>
The biennial session, attended by delegates from over 100
countries and regarded as the most important one that will decide
on the very fate of UNEP after 25 years of its existence, is to
end Friday. enditem

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts Urged to Curb Weed Spreading in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The invasion of Lake Victoria
by the now infamous hyacinth is a regional problem which should
be solved through joint efforts by the three riparian countries
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, said a news release here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Kenyan Minister of Research,
Technical Training and Technology Hussein Mohammed who was
speaking to reporters today in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The water hyacinth weed was first noticed in the Kenyan lakes,
specifically Naivasha and Victoria early 1980's, but did not seem
to pose a significant problem until 1990's, according to the
release.
</P>
<P>
"At the very early stages of deliberations, Lake Victoria was
treated as a special case due to the fact that its shores touch
on the three east African states," Mohammed noted.
</P>
<P>
For long term control of the water hyacinth, the three
riparian states have to have a common stand on the matter and
biological method is considered more sustainable, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The decision Kenya has made to use biological control is based
on the fact that it has successfully controlled another water
weed in Lake Naivasha, namely Sallvinia Molesta, by using a
beetle of Cytobargus species.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Agricultural Research institute and International
Institute of Biological Control have discovered that Neochetina
beetles are natural enemies of the water hyacinth, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country has already released the beetles in
36 sites of the Lake Victoria and is encouraged by the success of
the operation.
</P>
<P>
In the next six months, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute
envisages that more beetles will be released in Lake Victoria to
build up to well over 150 release sites, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
He further disclosed that Kenya is collaborating with Uganda
and Tanzania in this war against the weed which affects them all.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE Initiates First Joint Attempt to Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) initiated here today the first
joint attempt to protect environment in Europe by saving energy.
</P>
<P>
"Energy conservation is beginning to play an increasingly
important role in western European countries, where the potential
for reducing energy-related emissions by conventional 'add-on'
approaches has to a large extent been exhausted," said Kaj
Barlund, Director of the Environment and Human Settlements
Division of the UN/ECE.
</P>
<P>
Barlund noted, "In western Europe, up to 25 percent of sulfur
emissions can be cut through energy-saving measures and changes in
the fuel mix. In central and eastern European countries including
the former Soviet Union, this figure would be around 50 percent."
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE Committee on Environmental Policy decided recently
in Geneva to prepare a White Paper and Guidelines on European
Energy Conservation. The White Paper will draw on the best
experience available in the region in enhancing energy
conservation and on results of case studies to be undertaken in a
number of eastern European economies in transition. It will
outline saving potentials and policy options including
environmental assessments. The Guidelines will assist member
governments to formulate national strategies and policy aims to
promote international cooperation to achieve a high level in
energy efficiency in all European countries by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper and the Guidelines on European Energy
Conservation will be submitted to the Fourth Ministerial
Conference "Environment in Europe" to be held in Aarhus, Denmark
in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The UN/ECE initiative is the first major international
energy-related exercise to be pursued jointly by governmentally
designated energy and environment experts foreseen to be a long
term cross-sectoral effort, according to a UN/ECE press release.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is being strongly supported by the government of
Denmark which has taken the lead with the UN/ECE in coordinating
the experts. Broad participation will include the UN/ECE Committee
on Energy through the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project and
cooperation with other relevant international programs. The
International Energy Agency in Paris and the secretariats of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and of the
Energy Charter Treaty will be actively involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
The new concerted action on European Energy Conservation is
essential because the energy sector is the main source of
greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change and other
harmful pollutants, UN/ECE said in the press release. Fuel
combustion produces emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
volatile organic compounds, and particles including dust, as well
as metals and radio nuclides. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides
cause acid rain and spoil natural ecosystems over long distances.
Together with particulate matter they contribute to poor local air
quality. Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds also
contribute to smog threats to human health and plant life.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were
shot dead and 10 others wounded this afternoon after policemen
clashed with protesters in Johannesburg's Eldorado Park in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
A young boy and a girl were among the four victims shot at an
automobile service station in Eldorado Park circle road, the
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The shooting started when policemen arrived at the service
station where protesters had been looting shops and trying to set
the station alight with a petrol bomb, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At least one policeman was shot in the back by automatic rifle
fire and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes which began in the morning, the police used
tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd manning
barricades in the Eldorado Park area.
</P>
<P>
The crowd was taking part in a boycott to highlight the
grievances of Eldorado Park residents who have had their water
and electricity services suspended for non-payment, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Protesters claimed that water and electricity had been cut by
local authorities as they could not afford the amount of charge
for services.
</P>
<P>
The ratepayers have vowed to continue their stayaway and
protests until their demands for a flat rate are met.

<HEADLINE> Europe to Better Organize Customs Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Customs authorities in Europe
must be better organized than the criminals, European Union(EU)
Customs Commissioner Mario Monti said here today when opening a
conference on improving Europe's customs transit system to counter
organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Conference has brought together transit operators,
customs administrations and business representatives from 31
European countries.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent criminals undermining the customs transit system we
must exchange intelligence, cooperate effectively and learn to
talk to each other," insisted the EU Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
After months of discussion and analysis, boosted by the work
carried out by the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry on
transit fraud, today's Conference marks the end of consultations
on reforms.
</P>
<P>
"From now on we have to steadily undertake the thoroughgoing
reform necessary to restore faith in the transit system, and to
reinforce the security of our customs in general," said Mr Monti.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commissioner, the European Commission has
already singled out different options to resolve the problems, and
the operational phase will start soon.

<HEADLINE> US President Presents Budget Plan for Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
sent to the Congress today a federal budget which includes plans
to cut the taxes and balance the budget by 2002.
</P>
<P>
For the 1998 fiscal year which begins October 1, Clinton
proposes a spending of 1.6874 trillion U.S. dollars, up 3.5
percent from the projected spending of 1.63 trillion this year.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the total spending will go to entitlement
programs such as social security, Medicare and Medicaid. National
defense budget accounts for 15 percent and non-defense spending
for government departments and agencies is 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new budget projects that the government revenues will be
1.5668 trillion dollars, 4 percent more than the projected income
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government deficit, which posted a fourth-straight
decline to 107.3 billion in 1996 and rise to 125.6 billion this
year, will be 120.6 billion dollars in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
Balancing the budget after three decades of red ink is the top
priority of Clinton's second term and he portrayed his plan to
reach the goal by 2002 in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The biggest part of savings in Clinton's plan -- 100 billion
dollars over five years -- would come from Medicare, the big
government program that provides health care to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Under the his spending blueprint, nearly two-thirds of the 388
billion dollars in deficit savings Clinton envisions will not
occur until 2001 and 2002, after he has left office.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Congress to help me finish the job and balance the
budget by 2002 -- giving the American people the balanced budget
they deserve," President Clinton said in his budget message.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president also proposed a tax-cut plan in the budget
which will reduce taxes by 98 billion dollars in next five years.
</P>
<P>
The budget would honor Clinton's campaign promise to offer a
500-dollar tax credit for children 12 or younger, a 1,500-dollar
tax credit to pay for the first two years of college and tax
deductions covering up to 10,000 dollars in education expenses for
many families.
</P>
<P>
The lost in revenue would be partially offset by 76 billion
dollars in proposed tax increases, mainly on corporations,
investors and airline travelers.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans in the U.S. Congress have already let it be
known it will insist on tax cuts that double Clinton's tax-cut
plans.
</P>
<P>
The release of the president's massive five-volume set of
budget documents was the first move in what is likely to be months
of hard bargaining between the White House and the U.S. Congress.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Guards Clash With Greek Cypriots in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- There was a clash between the
Turkish soldiers stationed in northern Cyprus and armed Greek
Cypriots today on the border area on the divided Cyprus, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A statement from northern Cyprus authorities said at small
hours Thursday, the patrol guards of northern Cyprus spotted two
armed Greek Cypriots in an attempt to lower the flag of northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Three other armed men opened fire to give cover to the two and
the patrol guards returned the fire. The armed men managed to
escape, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the Greek Cypriot government reportedly denied such an
incident.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that buffer zone on the eastern
Mediterranean island and the territories of northern Cyprus were
violated, stressing that this was an organized attack against the
flag.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, Turkish Cypriot troops killed a Greek Cypriot
protester as he was climbing up to tear down the Turkish flag on
the edge of the northern Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after the funeral of another Greek
Cypriot, Tassos Issac, 24, who was beaten to death on August 11 in
clashes between the Greek Cypriot demonstrators and Turkish troops
in the 180-kilometer buffer zone controlled by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that northern Cyprus had called for the
U.N. Peace Forces to take more effective measures to stop the
violation of the buffer zone and "provocative incidents" in
direction of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern Cyprus
to protect the Turkish Cypriots in the northern part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the Turkish troops
landed on island following a coup supported by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas declared independence in
the northern part as "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in
1983, but it is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Slovak Foreign Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today met his visiting Slovak counterpart Pavol Hamzik
and the two sides discussed the enlargement of EU and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Hamzik arrived here Wednesday on a two-day official visit at
the invitation of Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Greek Minister assured Hamzik of
Greece's support for Slovakia's application to join the European
Union as well as other European and Atlantic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Hamzik told the press after the meeting that the enlargement of
the EU and NATO was a matter of political and economic stability
for Europe as a whole, underlining that all European countries
should work towards consolidating this stability.
</P>
<P>
On his country's bid to join NATO, Hamzik noted that all
European countries should enjoy the same level of security.
Slovakia, he added, was in favor of "a new architecture" for
European security which would cover all European states and
prevent the creation of new partition lines.
</P>
<P>
He said discussions on NATO enlargement should be oriented in
this direction, without leaving out "important countries" such as
Ukraine and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos reiterated Greece's position in favor of the
accession to NATO of all countries wishing to join, but only after
"a detailed discussion on the future operation and role of the
defense organization".
</P>
<P>
"We must not let justifiable suspicion be created in Russia
that a broad rallying of European countries is being created in
which it is not included. Russian concern must be taken into
consideration and addressed," Pangalos said.

<HEADLINE> German Key Interest Rates Stay Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank Bundesbank
today left its main lending rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The discount rate remained at 2.5 percent and the Lombard rate
stayed at 4.5 percent. The two rates were last cut by half a
percentage point in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Lombard rate is the ceiling at which the Bundesbank lends
to commercial banks, while the discount rate generally is the
lower rate it makes available to meet bank liquidity needs.
</P>
<P>
The third key rate, the security repurchase offer, also stayed

<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States has criticized
the human rights record in Ghana, blaming it for the failure to
launch an enquiry into the deaths of four demonstrators during a
protest against government tax policy in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
In an 18-page annual report, the U.S. State Department said
"there was credible evidence that the minister of youth and
sports had organized and armed the counter-demonstrators who were
responsible for the killings."
</P>
<P>
"Inadequate resources and a system vulnerable to political
influence compromised the integrity of the overburdened judicial
system," the U.S. said, according to a news report reaching
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also expressed concern over "prolonged pretrial
detentions", the report said, but it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
And there has been no official reaction to the criticism from
the Ghanaian government.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Opposition Urges UN to Send Troops to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi opposition
Democratic Movement (FRODEBU) today requested the United Nations
Security Council to dispatch its troops to Burundi to restrain
the military government from further harassment of the masses.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of FRODEBU Sawanya Jean Minani told a press
conference here that the military government under Major Pierre
Buyoya is now bent on intimidating the innocent Hutu people in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Major Buyoya belongs to the minority Tutsi tribe which for
years has been in control of the army which is reported to be
marauding around the country looking for the Hutus.
</P>
<P>
All political parties were banned last year when Major Buyoya
took over the state machinery, FRODEBU and other opposition
bodies are fighting against the military government which now
faces economic sanctions to force it to return to democratic
governance.
</P>
<P>
The FRODEBU Chairman claimed that the military regime now
abducts the Hutus and sends them to the rural areas where it
keeps them without food or water to be screened in the TV
stations to show to the world "how the masses suffer from the
sanctions".
</P>
<P>
The problem could be solved with the UN forces intervention to
save the poor in Burundi, he said.
</P>
<P>
He further said the military regime has expelled all the Hutu
students from the University of Burundi and retained the Tutsis
who on top of the regular courses undergo military training "for
the coming war against the insurgents -- the Hutus", Sawanya
said.
</P>
<P>
He requested the countries in the Great Lakes zone to observe
strictly the sanctions while other measures against the military
government in Burundi are underway.

<HEADLINE> UK Wind-Generated Electricity Output Doubled in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain has doubled its
wind-generated electricity output in 1996 and is planning to
dramatically increase wind energy supply in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) announced earlier
today that the country's 34 wind farms doubled their output to 505
million kilowatt hours over the year past, making Britain the
fourth largest user of wind power in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As there are great potential wind resources due to be developed
in Britain, the BWEA's long-term target is to supply 10 percent of
the national electricity output by 2025.
</P>
<P>
BWEA Chairman Peter Edwards was quoted as saying today that his
association was currently engaged in 152 new projects.
</P>
<P>
"Delivering (wind) electricity into local network saves on the
costs of high voltage transmission and avoids electrical losses,
bringing both economic and environmental benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that wind energy is widely seen as one of the
cleanest and safest commercial methods of generating electricity
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Warns Against Malaria, Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare today issued warnings on possible outbreaks of
cholera and malaria.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said 42 deaths and 2,172 cases of cholera had
been reported in neighboring Zambia by the end of January and
that there is a definite threat to Zimbabwe due to extensive
cross-border travel and communication.
</P>
<P>
''Cholera normally occurs during the peak rainy season, so it
is essential that we in Zimbabwe are prepared to detect early and
control any outbreak,'' the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is a deadly diarrhoea disease caused by eating food or
drinking water contaminated by the cholera germ. The patient
loses body fluids and if these are not promptly replaced, the
person becomes weak and dies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry advised Zimbabweans to drink water from
bore-holess, protected wells and springs and eat thoroughly cooked
food served while hot.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Zimbabwe is particularly prone to malaria
outbreak between February and May and that there is need for
people to take precautions.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu-Arafat Summit Rescheduled on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will
meet on Sunday evening at Erez on the border between Israel and
Gaza Strip, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The summit was originally scheduled to be held today, but
postponed following Tuesday's helicopter tragedy. Netanyahu also
canceled a planned visit to Amman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to discuss, among other things,
release of thousands of the so-called Palestinian security
prisoners, opening of "safe passages" between the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and security arrangements for Palestinian air and sea
ports in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Hebron signed last month
left theses issues and some other problems open, saying that
negotiations will begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has complained that the
Israeli authorities has deliberately tried to delay the
implementation of the Hebron pact. Netanyahu and Arafat met in
Davos, Switzerland, Sunday and decided to have further discussions
at another summit Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement of the Prime Minister's Office
today, Netanyahu has also canceled his visit to the Netherlands
set for next week. The trip was postponed so that the prime
minister will be able to attend memorial ceremonies for the
victims of the mid air helicopter collision, in which 73 soldiers
and airmen were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office did not say whether Netanyahu will
change his planned visit to Washington or not. The date has been
set on February 13.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief: Turkey May Not Veto NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana today said he is hopeful that Turkey would not veto the
planned NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from his 24-hour visit to Ankara, Solana
told reporters at airport that "I think it has been very positive
to understand the position of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Turkish leaders reiterated their position
to link the expansion of the NATO with Turkey's entry into the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it might block plans for the NATO
expansion if its plea for EU accession is stalled. The European
Commission is considering the membership applications by up to 10
possible candidates, but Turkey is not among them.
</P>
<P>
Solana said "I think we will be able to calm that concern."
</P>
<P>
In what was regarded as an attempt to allay Turkey's concern,
Solana said NATO would include Turkey in military operations by
the Western European Union, the EU's military body.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued following his meeting with Solana,
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey will not
support the enlargement of the NATO because the EU does not admit
Turkey into the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said, "Although we are for the enlargement of the NATO
in principle, we think that it is important for this issue to be
evaluated within the general framework of European new formation."
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey should take its place in a European
family picture in the EU summit scheduled to be held in
Amsterdam in June.

UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Proceeds from the sale
of Iraqi oil under an "oil-for-food" deal now total 343 million
U.S. dollars, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said today.

CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An official of a leading Sudanese
opposition party said today that there is no chance for dialog or
conciliation with the Sudanese government and "struggle will
continue."
</P>
<P>
Farouk Abudeissa, official spokesman of the Sudanese National
Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Cairo, said that the government calls
for negotiations with the opposition but at the same time
threatens with the trial of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made no definite initiative
to settle the current conflicts between the government and
oppositions in the African state, Egypt's MENA news agency quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan has reportedly
told Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir that the UAE was
willing to send an envoy to mediate on the conflict in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
However, Sudan said that it has never officially accepted any
peace initiative or invitation from any country to hold a dialog
with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammed Taha said that
there is actually an open and continued dialog between the
government and the opposition to seek a formula of understanding
to protect the countries interests.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of northern and southern opposition forces have
been attacking Sudanese government troops along the eastern
border of the country since mid-January in what they called a
bid to pressure the government and pave the way for a popular
uprising. The Sudanese government also claimed clashes on
borders with Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda of sponsoring
opposition attacks against the government along the border areas
in recent weeks. But the three neighbors have denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Leader Praises Economic Growth in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- President of the World Bank
James D. Wolfensohn said today that the economic news from Africa
is good with many countries racking up a second consecutive year
of growth.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving on a nine-day trip to four African countries, he
said many countries south of the Sahara Desert posted growth
figures of more than 5 percent above the rate of population growth
in 1996 and some economists project figures as high as 8 percent
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
This occurred despite the high number of wars on the continent,
which scares off some investors and has created an "unfortunate"
climate where less than 2 percent of private international capital
flow goes to Africa, Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the sub-Saharan countries "are opening up more,
doing their best to create the conditions to get foreign
investment to come in."
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn admitted that the economic growth in the area
"remains fragile."
</P>
<P>
"We need to assist our African friends with their efforts to
increase the kind of growth that makes a real dent in poverty and
establishes a strong social base," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is the World Bank's top priority and we want to
strengthen our partnerships in the region," he said, adding that
the World Bank is "anxious to increase the amount of money we
invest" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is financing 500 projects in Africa now worth 9
billion dollars and has 55 more planned for 1997 in fields
including health care, education, agriculture and water resources
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn will visit Senegal, Ghana, Mozambique and South
Africa and have talk with leaders of the countries about the types
of policy reforms that have made the turnaround possible.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomat: Israel Keen on Promoting Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyke said today Israel is keen on achieving progress in the
Middle East peace process, resuming negotiations with Syria and
promoting ties with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat made the remarks following talks with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa here. Also present at the
meeting was U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker, Egypt's MENA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel is eager to enhance Egyptian-Israeli ties and push
forward the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track, after
the implementation of the executive protocol of the Hebron deal
which is a step forward in the peace process, Indyke said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt played a pioneer role in reaching such a just and
comprehensive solution which would lead to maintaining stability
in the Middle East, he said. Egypt and Israel signed a peace
treaty in 1979 but the bilateral ties have remained cool.
</P>
<P>
When asked about a new U.S. formula for pushing forward the
negotiations on the Syrian track, the ambassador said Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington
next week to have talks with President Bill Clinton on the
Palestinian and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
According to Indyke, the new formula which the U.S. tries to
find out for resuming Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations takes into
consideration the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The formula also includes the Syrian demand to resume talks
from where they halted a year ago, he told the Arabic paper
"al-Hayat" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"What has been achieved by the Syrians and Israelis could be a
good ground on which the talks can be based," he continued, adding
that the Israeli government reiterates that it does not ignore
what has been achieveed but it is not ready to commit to any
pledges made by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Indyke's remarks are considered as the very first sign on
resuming Syrian-Israeli talks from the point where they suspended.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the London-based newspaper quoted diplomatic
sources as saying that the Europeans and Americans are working for
a formula securing the elements which both the Syrians and
Israelis need.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross will meet with
EU Envoy to the Middle East Miguel Moratinos soon in Washington to
discuss the elements of this formula, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's Likud government has refused to return the Golan
Heights Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war to Syria for
peace, as agreed by previous Labor government.

Mobutu has been out of Zaire for one month, spending most of

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Protests Against US Envoy's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today called in Richard Jones, the U.S. ambassador to
Lebanon, protesting against his remarks in which he expressed
sympathy for Israeli soldiers killed in an air disaster.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister's move came in response to a public
outcry over Jones' statement Wednesday, in which he said the
73 Israeli soldiers killed in the collision of two helicopters
were only doing their duty and should not be blamed for
their government's policy.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Jones made the statement at the Baabda
Presidential Palace after meeting with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi also angered the country's politicians and the public in
general.
</P>
<P>
The two giant U.S.-made military helicopters, which were
apparently loaded with weapons and ammunition, collided in
northern Israel in Tuesday evening's darkness, led to the death
of all the Israeli soldiers on board.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that the two helicopters were on a rotation
deployment, transferring fresh troops into an Israeli-occupied zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The foreign relations committee of Lebanon's Parliament
demanded Thursday that a firm official complaint be delivered to
Jones and that he be made to apologize in public to the
Lebanese people and to the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Beirut Foreign Ministry said that
the foreign minister handed a protest note to the U.S. diplomat
at the request of the parliamentary foreign relations committee.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 75-minute meeting in the Foreign Ministry,
the U.S. envoy argued that his remarks in the Baabda Palace
Wednesday "should be understood in a humanitarian term."
</P>
<P>
He said he felt sorry because his statement was
"misunderstood," noting that "the United States is a peace-loving
country and expresses regret for losses of lives in every corner
of the world, no matter whether in south Lebanon or northern
Israel."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat underlined that his country's policy in
every region of the world is to "stand on the side of
peace, and we are working hardly for peace, not only in the
region, but also in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The United States was hoping that one day the peace would
be achieved in the region and there would not any more
bloodshed on both sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border, Jones
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he delivered a letter to the Lebanese
foreign minister from Madeleine Albright, the new U.S. secretary
of state, on the occasion she took office.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Albright expressed a "desire to cooperate"
with the Lebanese foreign minister in order to reach
peace, the U.S. envoy said, declining to give more details.
</P>
<P>
Jones called on Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri earlier
today, and conveyed to him a message from U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the occassion of Eid Fitr, the Muslim festival
marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Urges Settlement of Islands Dispute with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today called for the settlement of a long-running
dispute with Russia over the Northern Territories, or Kuril
Islands.
</P>
<P>
At today's national conference in Tokyo marking the annual
"Northern Territories Day", Hashimoto said the Northern
Territories dispute should be settled under the Tokyo Declaration,
signed in 1993 during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Under the declaration, the two countries agreed to respect
history and reality and to reach a peace accord as soon as
possible on the basis of the principles of laws and justice.
</P>
<P>
The islands, respectively Kunashiri, Etorofu, Habomai and
Shikotan, are known as the Northern Territories in Japan and the
Southern Kurils in Russia.
</P>
<P>
They were under Japanese control until September 1945 when they
were seized by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been chilly ever
since, as the Soviet Union, and then Russia, have repeatedly
turned down Japan's consistent demands for the return of the
islands.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto stressed that the full normalization of
Japanese-Russian relations is not only of great benefit to the two
countries themselves but also to the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to make persistent efforts to find an early
solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister said he hoped to establish stable
relations with Russia under truly mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has signaled recently that it would consider taking part
in joint economic development of the islands, which are famous for
their fishing resources.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Advances to 124 Yen Level in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar continued its
rise against the yen in Tokyo today, hitting the 124 yen level for
the first time since February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's advance against the yen was attributed to a fall
in Tokyo stocks dragged down by a plunge in construction shares
caused by a rumor regarding the failure of general contractor
Tobishima Corp..
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 124.18-22 yen at 5 p.m., up from
123.80-83 yen at 9 a.m., after trading between 123.52 yen and
124.30 yen.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the dollar's appreciation against
the yen will continue for some time as the U.S. government, with
an eye on propping up the New York stock market, is not
likely to change its current policy for a strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the meeting of the G-7 Finance Ministers and
directors of central banks Saturday is not expected to adopt a
resolution to arrest the rise in the dollar's value.
</P>
<P>
On today's stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 17,867.04, down 171.39 points, or 0.95
percent, from Thursday's close.
</P>

on the First Section of the Tokyo Exchange, fell 8.38 points or
0.62 percent to 1,341.50.

DAMASCUS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Abdul-
Halim Khaddam met here today with visiting Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri to discuss the latest developments in the
region, according to diplomatic sources here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that they also talked about the current Arab
and international diplomatic drives to activate the Mideast peace
process and to coordinate stances on peace negotiations along
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam briefed Hariri on the outcome of his recent tour to
some Arab countries to expound Syrian views on the peace
process. He stressed the necessity of reaching a unified stance
with regard to dealing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the repercussions of the recent collision
of two Israeli helicopters in northern Israel, in which more than
70 soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, negotiations along the Syrian track were
frozen one year ago without achieving substantial progress, due
to basic difference between Syrian and Israeli positions.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon insist that any settlement should take place
on the two tracks at the same time, while certain proposals
call for a settlement with Lebanon away from the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that foremost among the topics discussed
between Khaddam and Hariri were the issue of Syrian- Lebanese
coordination in facing the upcoming phase of developments in the
peace process, the outcome of Syria's Arab and international
moves, the deteriorating situation in south Lebanon and the
preparatory work for the coming Syrian-Lebanese summit meetings.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Kaddoumi, Head of the
Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), left Cairo this morning for Tunisia after a two-day visit
to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement, Kaddoumi said that he had discussed
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa ways and means to
activate common Arab action.
</P>
<P>
The two men also discussed prospects of the issues to be
negotiated with Israel in order to bring about true and essential
achievements in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi and Moussa reaffirmed the necessity of enhancing Arab
solidarity to strengthen Arab negotiation position in face of the
Israeli government intransigence and to overcome the obstacles
threatening to destroy the peace march altogether.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi and Moussa reviewed preparations for the
final stage negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israels. They dealt with the issues of refugees,
Jerusalem, settlements and the Palestinian people's right to self
determination.

<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister disclosed after the meeting that
the Israelis should be prepared for the final stage of
negotiations and appreciate the utmost importance of negotiations
over Jerusalem to reach an acceptable solution.

and the sale of housing units to Jewish settlers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UEFA Withdraws Backing for German World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA has withdrawn on Friday its support for Germany's bid to host
the 2006 World Cup, saying England could go ahead with its bid.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after three hours of talks between English
Football Association (FA) and UEFA officials.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said the organization
would listen to presentations from both England and Germany on
their rival bids in April.
</P>
<P>
FA, which reacted with outrage last week after UEFA expressed
its support for Germany's bid, said they were satisfied with the
compromise agreement.
</P>
<P>
UEFA also suggested that FA drop out of the race, insisting
that it wants only one candidate per continent in order to avoid
the bitterness that marked the campaign for the 2002 World Cup
between Asian rivals South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
World soccer's governing body FIFA said this week that even if
UEFA endorses Germany's bid, there is nothing to stop England from
submitting its own candidacy.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will decide the venue in June of the year 2000, with the
deadline for submission of bids in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pledges To Quicken Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that the helicopter tragedy and all
the fallen have prompted him to speed up peace process, the
state-run Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the pledge this morning when he was speaking
to a fallen soldier's family at a funeral ceremony. He said
he would do all he could to bring peace and security to
the north part of the country and the entire state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
A total of 73 soldiers and airmen were killed Tuesday evening
when two Yasur 2000 helicopters transporting forces to the
Israeli occupied "security zone" collided in the air near the
Israeli-Lebanese border. It was the worst air disaster in the
history of the Israel Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The incident came after a debate over the human cost of
continuing presence in the "security zone," and calls for a
unilateral withdrawal. Observers believe the tragedy may
strengthen most Israelis' doubt about its worth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Netanyahu told his cabinet that an order will be
given at the beginning next week to free all Palestinian women
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will meet with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at
Erez on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip Sunday
evening to discuss some urgent issues. The two leaders were
to have met Thursday. But the meeting was postponed due to
the helicopter disaster.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Denies Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides today denied that there had been a shooting incident
between Greek Cypriots and Turkish troops on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Larnaca airport before his departure on an official
visit to India, Clerides said, "we should not give serious
consideration" to Thursday's alleged shooting incident in the
Louroutzina area, 20 kilometers southeast of Nicosia, adding that
investigations will show that nothing had occurred.
</P>
<P>
A statement from northern Cyprus authorities said at small
hours Thursday, the patrol guards of northern Cyprus spotted two
armed Greek Cypriots in an attempt to lower the flag of northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Three other armed men opened fire to give cover to the two and
the patrol guards returned the fire. The armed men managed to
escape, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides denied Thursday
Turkish reports that Greek Cypriots were involved in the alleged
shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that this time the incident was not real, but an
imaginary one," said the spokesman, adding that information
regarding an incident had perhaps been given out to international
news agencies in order to create what he described as "false news
and propaganda".
</P>
<P>
 on his visit to India, the Cypriot President said he will
exchange views in India with his counterpart, the Prime Minister
and other officials on international issues, including the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the two countries will sign a number of
agreements on maritime, culture and other fields, according to
the President.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup supported by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Around 35,000 Turkish troops have been stationed in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots, who unilaterally
declared in 1983 a breakaway state "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus", which is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Russia Eyes Giant Projects of Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to establish
projects in the New Delta and Tushki areas in southern Egypt,
according to the Egyptian Gazette today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassador to Moscow Reda Shehata told the National
Democratic Party Economic and Financial Affairs Committee
Wednesday that next month Egypt and Russia will sign an agreement
for attracting Russian investors to establish projects in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Russian companies have much experience in establishing projects
in Egypt since the construction of the High Dam, which was built
during 1960-1970 with the financial and technical assistance of
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Besides the deal on investment projects in the underdeveloped
Egyptian land, another agreement will be signed to encourage
companies to increase their exports to Russia and promote trade
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the agreements next month, businessmen
from both countries will sign trade contracts and discuss joint
investments during a symposium on Egyptian-Russian investment
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, Shehata noted that the volume of trade between them
does not match their long economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral Trade is less than 470 million U.S. dollars, while
accounting for a mere 0.36 percent of Russia's total trade with
the world which reached 130 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He called for enormous efforts to reopen the Russian markets as
Egyptian exports to Russia plummet every year.

JINAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
played host to 530,000 overseas tourists in 1996, who brought to

programs, such as the International Confucius Festival, the
International Kite Show in the city of Weifang, known as the "Home
of Kites," and an Internation Beer Festival in the scenic port
city of Qiaodao.
</P>
<P>
The province has invested a total of 2.3 billion yuan (280
million US dollars) in the construction of its tourism
infrastructure. Altogether, 98 tourism projects have been
completed in Shandong's 12 holiday resorts, with 57 others still
under construction.

WUHAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Work on the salvage of the
"Chungshan" Cruiser, which has been sleeping on the bed of the
Yangtze River for 59 years, is continuing on the first day in the
Year of the Ox, which falls today.
</P>
<P>
The Cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen who is known as father
of the Chinese Democratic Revolution, rose to water surface on
January 28.
</P>
<P>
Over 180 workers busy working on the ship, eighter clearing the
deck or moving sand from the ship and welding portholes, at the
salvage site in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The 62.1-meter-long and 8.9-meter-wide cruiser was built in
Japan in 1913. It has been connected with a famous historical
event -- the Cruiser Chungshan Incident -- when Chiang Kai-shek
betrayed the revolution, created the incident and launched a
surprise attack on the Chinese Communist Party March 20, 1926.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser was already some four meters above water level,
with its most parts visible.
</P>
<P>
Guanghui, who was in charged of the salvage, said that the ship
suffered no big damage, although there was a five-square-meter
shell crater on the fore-deck. It will be sent to the Hubei
Shipyard around February 15 for an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
Li Zongqi, general manager of the Yangtze River Shipping Group,

<P>
HANGZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Jinxin Group donated

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate to Have Hearing on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate will
conduct a hearing on the peace situation and the on-going
investigation into the killing of a Catholic bishop in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople announced here today
that it is necessary for the senate to look into the growing
religious tension in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see this situation in Jolo to deteriorate to
the level of a Bosnia-Herzegovina with thousand of lives imperiled
by religious and ethnic tensions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ople said the senate has been set to summon Nur
Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, to
take part in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Benjamin de Jesus, a peace mediator between the Muslims
and the Christians in Jolo, Sulu Province in Mindanao, was killed
Tuesday by alleged Muslim extremists.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos declared on Friday that the peace process
in Mindanao would not be affected by the assassination, vowing to
have the killers apprehended, prosecuted and punished by law.
</P>
<P>
Police today arrested two suspects for the killing, easing up
some of the tensions created in Mindanao, where the Moro National
Liberation Front led by Misuari ended a 24-year-old war with
government troops last September.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear, however, whether Misuari will attend the
senate hearing, in view of the fact that he has evaded past
summons by just sending representatives to previous hearings.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Concerned Over Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian senior government
official here today expressed uncertainty over the future of
small scale farmers following the government's withdrawal from
participating in the agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Edith Nawakwi said
she can foresee Zambia having no food for the 1997/98 season
because over 600,000 small scale farmers are not likely to
receive any fertilizer as major private suppliers have preferred
to supply commercial farmers only.
</P>
<P>
She told a South African fertilizer company that it is sad
that there is no money allocated for the farmers in the yellow
book, making it very difficult for her to address the fate of
small scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
She said that many small scale farmers have complained that
the government's withdrawal from agriculture business will create
an army of laborers as they will start looking to commercial
farmers to earn their living.
</P>
<P>
While conceding that Zambia has made a mistake in this
respect, Nawakwi urged the participants of the agriculture sector
investment program consultative meeting to seriously find
solutions for small scale farmers before the agriculture industry
completely comes to a stand still.
</P>
<P>
In its current economic liberalization, the Zambian government
does not interfere directly in agriculture but leaves it to be
promoted by market demand.
</P>
<P>
In the present farming season, there are many reports that the
small scale farmers can not afford to get fertilizer which is
very important to their production.

<HEADLINE> Rape Cases Rise in Philippines in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Rape incidents in the
Philippines rose by 9 percent in 1996 to a record of 2,553 cases,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ernesto Herrera was quoted as saying the increase was
significantly higher than the 5.4-percent average annual growth
from 1990 to 1995 and this should be a cause for alarm for police
as well as lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to the senator, 13,114 rape cases were reported to
police from 1990 to 1995 and last year's figure was 40 percent
higher than the 1,814 cases documented in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the actual number of rape cases could
be "much higher considering that only one in every 100 crimes is
being reported to authorities" in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Herrera said he had appealed to his colleagues in the congress
to expedite the passage of a new anti-rape measure which has been
stalled at the bicameral conference committee for three months.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate enactment of the measure is imperative if we are
to stem the rash of rape incidents across the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tough anti-rape legislation being finalized by the two
houses of the congress will expand the definition of rape and
enable the government to prosecute rapists in court even in the
absence of a complaint from the victim.
</P>
<P>
Herrera, meanwhile, urged lawmakers to further strengthen
existing laws against sexual abuse of women and daughters by
prohibiting the "sick practice" of allowing rapists to marry their
victims and by making criminally liable those mothers who tolerate
the rape of their own daughters.

SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 37 hospitals in
China's largest city have volunteered to offer free medical

The city's first charity hospital has gone into operation,

poor old people in the city.
</P>
<P>
Each clinic has an annual operation fee of 5,000 yuan (about
602 US dollars), and usually accepts donations and support from
society and other medical organizations. There are one or two
doctors on staff at each.
</P>
<P>
Gu Rongqiu, an old woman who has lain ill in bed for years,

<HEADLINE> World Environment Leaders Agree on Boosting UNEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- World environment ministers
today urged the Special Session of the U.N. General Assembly set
for June to boost the role of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP)
as "the leading global environmental authority."
</P>
<P>
Although census achieved on the need of reforming the UNEP
power structure and giving it adequate money, the ministers
failed to reach agreement on any concrete reform plans or on the
target sum of the UNEP budget, both dominating the UNEP 19th
plenary session.
</P>
<P>
"A strong, effective and revitalized UNEP is essential to
assist the international community" to reverse the worsening
trend of the global environment, they said in the "Nairobi
Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP" issued after their
three-day talks.
</P>
<P>
UNEP has been apparently weakened during recent years
following sharp cut of contributions from its western donors,
which has resulted in the most serious money crisis in its 25
years of existence.
</P>
<P>
UNEP should be given "adequate, stable and predictable"
funding so as to "serve as the world forum" for the ministers on
global environmental affairs, they noted on the final day of the
two-week 19th Special Session of the UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the commitment to the implementation of the
Rio Declaration, also called Agenda 21, which was made in the
1992 Rio Earth Summit with an aim to set up a new and equitable
global partnership by boosting international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the commitment, rich nations should offer new and
additional money aid and transfer of environmentally sound
technologies to the developing countries in favorable and
concessional terms so as for them to carry out Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
However, so far advanced countries have failed to honor their
five-year-old pledges.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed deep concern on the continuing
degradation of the global environment in the declaration.

NINGBO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese usually prepare a
lot of food and drink for Spring Festival, the lunar new, but the
coastal city of Ningbo, in Zhejiang Province, is adding a special
touch -- celebrating Spring Festival with a talent fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair has attracted more than 7,000 people from nearly 300
colleges and universities across the country, 1,600 more than last
year.
</P>
<P>
Talent fairs have been held in Ningbo since 1990, and 20,000
job-hunters have visited them in that time, with 12,000 of them
getting good results. The city attracted 15,000 professionals,
including college grads, in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
A new plaza opened on January 1, 1997 to house the city's
talent service center. It holds talent fairs, training courses,
and has housing, making it the largest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ningbo not only invites job hunters, but trains professional
people as well. It provided 24 training courses last year on
computer science, how to take the state civil service exam, and
other professional information. More than 42,000 people took the
courses, and 340 people got further training abroad last year.

HARBIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, has been giving priority to
its tertiary industry over the past several years to balance its
industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
The city used to be one of the country's most important
traditional industry bases, with machinery as its backbone.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, the city invested 24.2 billion
yuan of fixed assets into the tertiary industry, with an annual
growth rate of 51 percent, and output value of tertiary industry
now accounts for 52.4 percent of GDP in 1995, compared to 38
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The city has also developed a series of preferential policies
to draw foreign investment to the city's infrastructure and
tertiary industry. About 60 percent of the foreign investment in
the past six years has been used to develop the service trade.
</P>
<P>
The city's transportation, telecommunications, finance and
information sectors have developed rapidly, and tourism has become
the city's fastest growing sector of tertiary industry.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Cocoa Output Projected to Drop 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's cocoa production during the
current planting season is expected to drop by about five percent as
an even greater portion of the commodity is being turned down in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the International Cocoa
Organization, total cocoa production in Nigeria is projected to
decline to 140,000 tons during the 1996-97 farming season, compared to
147,000 tons in the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
The organization also projected a drop in the output of the
world's leading producers. The production is put at one million
tons for Cote d'Ivoire, down from 1.2 million tons; 330,000 tons
for Ghana, down by some 70,000 tons; 195,000 tons for Brazil,
down from 230,000 tons; and 120,000 tons for Cameroun, down from
130,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa is a major non-oil export and also expected to contribute
substantially to the government's projected earnings of 161 billion
Naira (2.01 billion U.S. Dollars) from the non-oil sector this year.
</P>
<P>
But industry officials have alerted that revenue from the commodity
might drop drastically as poor quality cocoa produced in the country
could hardly find its way into the export market.
</P>
<P>
The loss from export of poor quality cocoa is expected to reach an
average of 18 million U.S. dollars a year, representing a loss of 10
percent in annual revenue from the product, according to the Ministry
of Commerce and Tourism.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is apparently irritated by the proposal of
holding a summit of five big powers -- the United States, Russia,
France, Britain and Germany -- this spring in Paris to discuss
relations between NATO and Moscow. U.S. officials said that
Washington had not been informed and consulted about the proposal,
which was envisaged by Germany, presented by France and backed by
Russia.
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey will veto NATO's eastward expansion plan at the
Madrid summit in July, if the European Union does not include
Ankara in its enlargement plan, said Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- By meeting three opposition leaders of Serbia in Paris
Thursday and making a comment on the situation in Algeria last
week, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette seemed to have
broken his diplomatic rule of ``non-interference'' in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
-- The wave of reactions among NATO countries to the idea of
holding a five-power summit on NATO-Russia relations in Paris
shows differences within the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, initiated by Germany and formally presented by
France, was rejected by Washington and met with reserve from
smaller NATO countries such as Belgium and Italy.

<HEADLINE> S. African to Stick to Current Monetary Policy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government's commitment of a phased "prudent and gradual" policy
of abolishing the remaining exchange controls remains unchanged,
President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to a joint session of the National
Assembly and the National Council of the Provinces in Cape Town,
Mandela said his government will stick to the monetary policy,
especially the exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's speech officially ended recent widespread
speculations in the local monetary market that the lifting of the
exchange controls was one of several important announcements by
the President when he opened the 1997 session of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
These speculations helped fuel the local currency Rand's
strong performance of hitting a six-month high of 4.4570 bid
against the US Dollar on Thursday, just following a four-month
high of 4.50 one day before in the market.
</P>
<P>
The rumor of exchange controls abolition, despite of the
denial by the Finance Ministry and the South African Reserve
Bank, central bank of the country, is one of the main factors
triggering the Rand's 30 percent depreciation last year.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's biggest
industrial and commercial city, saw a big increase in foreign
trade revenue in 1996, with industrial and commercial tax
totalling 9.56 billion yuan, an increase of 22.78 percent over the
previous year.
</P>

The total added-value tax and consumer tax reached 5.17 billion
yuan and personal income tax hit 1.02 billion yuan, up 26.34

Experts attributed the rise of foreign trade revenue to an
increase of car industry output and sales of telecommunication
electronics and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in tax management is another reason for the fast

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Alleges Plan by Groups to Disrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government said it has
uncovered alleged fresh plans that pro-democracy groups will use
university students to destabilize the country, particularly to
distrupt the party-based local government elections slated for
next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the alleged plan revealed by Special Duties Minister Wole
Oyelese on Thursday, the students are to embark on protest over the
introduction of tuition fees, which the Education Ministry has denied.
</P>
<P>
The students are to use the protest to attack government functions
and their institutions, the minister said, quoted by local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Ibadan, a major city in southwestern
Nigeria where the renowned University of Ibadan is located, the
minister named the groups involved in the scheme as the National
Liberation Council of Nigeria (NALICON), Movement for the
Survival of Ogoni People, (MOSOP), the National Democratic
Coalition (NADECO) and the United Democracy Association (UDA).
</P>
<P>
NALICON, led by self exiled writer Wole Soyinka, is particularly
cited as the brain behind the plan.
</P>
<P>
The minister alleged that the plan was hatched at Igolo in Benin
Republic on January 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the United States of harboring saboteurs and
sponsoring agents of destabilization.
</P>
<P>
"If America fails to see the evil in the dastardly plans hatched at
the Benin Republic, she would have no moral justification to preach
human rights, except America wants us to believe that the patriotic
people of this country have no right to peaceful existence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister advised students to embrace dialogue rather than
violence, saying "dialogue is only possible and meaningful before the
commission of a crime."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to parents to control their wards to shelve any
act of violence.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections to Be Held After 30 Years in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freetown, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Local Government
Minister David Quee said Friday local elections will be held in
six months time if the necessary funds are available.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first democratic local government elections to
take place in the west African state for over three decades.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament, Quee said the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), ''will be encouraged to take part.''
</P>
<P>
''Our fledgling democracy can only be meaningful if elections
are conducted at local level,'' Quee added.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that ''the elections will be based on a direct
vote and not the proportional representation'' under which the
February 1996 parliamentary elections were held.
</P>
<P>
West african diplomats here said despite Quee's statement,
the electoral commission, which supervises elections, is currently
strapped for cash. the elections will need about 8 million
dollars, one diplomat told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Presidential and parliamentary elections were funded by the
European Union at the cost of 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A move by the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party asking other
political parties to nominate officials for the 12 district
councils and the Freetown City Council was ''outrightly
rejected'' last week by other parties.
</P>
<P>
''The arrangement is an attempt to derail democracy,'' one
party leader said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Tian'anmen Square's Night Scene on Eve of Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the Chinese
capital have found a new way to spend the eve of the traditional
Spring Festival, or Chinese lunar New Year: going to the
Tian'anmen Square to watch lanterns.
</P>
<P>
Long before the Spring Festival, Beijing press had a reportage
of new lanterns hung over the Tian'anmen Square, the world's
largest square in central Beijing, which lit up the night up to
the eve of Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The square on Thursday night permeated in a sea of lights.
Flashlights, neons, and large red lanterns in and around the
square, along with beaming lights from all nearby major
architectures made it flashing bright as during the daytime.
</P>
<P>
On the square, bathed in the light were flower beds and a large
banner in Chinese character "Have a happy Spring Festival", as
well as a huge painting of late Chairman Mao Zedong hung on the
Tian'anmen rostrum facing the square, featuring the founder of new
China looking forward with geniality and confidence in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
Municipal authorities claimed that the square was at least 30
percent brighter than usual last night.
</P>
<P>
Many Beijing residents, with their families and in groups of
two or three, converged onto the square to enjoy the beautiful
night scene. Most of these residents used to stay home and watch
the New Year's Eve entertainment presented by the China Central
Television every year.
</P>
<P>
The square was permeated with a jubilant atmosphere, with
adults posing for photos and children playing and chasing each other.
Cui Jinniao, a labor official from an outlining suburban county,
noted he and his wife came to the square for an unusual Spring
Festival eve.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has changed, and people all look happy since they no
longer have to worry about food and other daily necessities," he
commented.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance of the Museum of Chinese History on the eastern
flank of the Square, a local resident surnamed Wu and his family
of three were taking pictures in front of the countdown board for
the return of Hong Kong, which read "145 days".
</P>
<P>
"As a geologist, I love all the more every inch of our
territory. How great it will be when Hong Kong, a `lost child' of
our country, returns to the embrace of the motherland," acclaimed
Wu.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations on the square reached the height when midnight
bell tolled. People greeted the arrival of the lunar Year of Ox
with cheers, which even overwhelmed the 108 chimes of the ancient
bell.

<HEADLINE> ''Monkey Boy'' Grows Up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- ''Monkey boy '' Robert Mayanja
Mugabi, who was found 12 years ago in northern Uganda, has grown up,
reported the local daily The New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Robert was found by soldiers of the Ugandan National
Resistance Army (now government army) in September 1985 in a
forest in Luweero in September 1985 at the age of 4. With bent
and underdeveloped limbs, he was unable to talk.
</P>
<P>
He, who is said to be mothered by monkeys, is no longer the little
boy who was something of a freak show 12 years ago. He is an
upright standing person with neat clothes who tries to take care of
himself as best as he can.
</P>
<P>
At present, when he wants to go to the toilet he lets doctors know.
He can remove of his T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
He knows when meal times are, and when it is time to bathe or
got to bed. He knows his own bedroom. He can feed and dress up with
assistance.
</P>
<P>
He has feelings and has particular likes and dislikes.
He likes water very much and spends a lot of his time in the paddling
pool. He also likes music . He usually lies close to the cassette
player with his eyes closed listening very attentively.
</P>
<P>
However, when he was found in 1985, he was described as being
unable to stand or walk properly, and reportedly defecated and
urinated wherever he sat or slept. His legs were underdeveloped while
his arms were overdeveloped. At that time it was speculated that he
had been living with a colony of monkeys.
</P>
<P>
But he is still not capable of bathing or dressing himself.
</P>
<P>
He will have to spend the rest of his life in a rehabilitation
centre for children with learning disabilities, because he is
unable to talk or do a lot with his hands.
</P>
<P>
Kiruta, a doctor in the centre, was quoted as saying if the
problem with Robert had been spotted at an early age, something
could have been done to improve the situation. enditem

percent with effect from February 21, Administrative Officer of the

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Deal With Economic Issues in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is expected to pledge faster implementation of the
government's macro-economic strategy in his address in the
Parliament today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's 45-minute address to the new-look Parliament, which
include the newly-sworn-in representatives of the National
Council of the Provinces, will be televised live nationwide, said
sources here.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will deal broadly with economic issues in his speech, but
he will leave further details of how the government intends to
implement the macro-economic strategy, including privatisation and
relaxation of exchange controls, to be worked out by cabinet ministers
in March, said the source.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman, however, denied on Thursday Mandela would
announce the abolition of the remaining exchange controls, saying the
government would stick to its "prudent and gradual" approach in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
While on government progress, Mandela is expected to reaffirm the
African National Congress's 85th anniversary statement issued on
January 8 this year, in which the president said sweeping gains had
been made in non-racial reconciliation, political stability,
nation-building and the consolidation of democracy.
</P>
<P>
On the service delivery, such as housing program where progress
has been slow, Mandela is also expected to say that housing
construction is now starting to come on stream this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Eat out at Restaurants at New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More families in Shanghai,
China's largest city, no longer cook and have dinner at home but
prefer eating out in restaurants at the eve of Spring Festival, or
Chinese lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The evening dinner at the lunar New Year's eve, the most
important feast for the Chinese people throughout a year, was
symbolic of family reunion.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally people stay at home the night before the New
Year's Day, and have dinner with their family members and close
relatives only.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, however, approximately six percent of the
three million families in Shanghai had the meal in local
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,000 locals from 300 households had their New
Year's Eve dinner in the New World Restaurant on the Nanjing Road,
one of China's busiest commercial streets in downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In a large and spacious hall of 5,000 sq m of the restaurant
bedecked with 200 hung red lanterns, 80 almond-yellow flags, and a
600-m suspended red ribbon of silk, all symbolized joyfulness and
good luck. A band of musicians played melodies for the diners with
traditional string-pluck instruments.
</P>
<P>
"Celebrate the New Year in this way is new to me," said Grannie
Mei A'bao, 104, who came to the restaurant with her 12-member
family. "The mood won't be so lively if we eat at home."
</P>
<P>
The Xinhualou Restaurant Group, formed by a number of brand and
reputed local restaurants, offered a total of 1,200 dinners during
this festival period, which were all ordered within three days.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weize, general manager of the restaurant group, said that
with the improvement of people's livelihood, it has become a
hot-sought custom among Shanghai city residents.
</P>
<P>
"We feel contented and relaxed in the restaurant," said Wu
Yuelian, a lecturer from a university. "It is really unnecessary
to busy yourself with cooking for New Year's Eve dinner after a
whole year of hard work."
</P>
<P>
In response to the new fad, local vegetable fairs and
supermarkets also offer dishes readily prepared for the New Year's
Eve dinner, which only require brief cooking before they are
served on the table.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Military Urges End to Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's military today urged a
quick solution to the political crisis triggered by the ouster of
President Adbala Bucaram by Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"A solution cannot be awaited for too long," armed forces chief
Gen. Paco Moncayo said after a closed-door meeting with Bucaram,
who became president last July, and senior military officials at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Moncayo stressed that the Ecuadoran military was "absolutely
apolitical," but said it could serve as a potential mediator in
the conflict between opposing political factions.
</P>
<P>
The general also said that the military would not move to
fill the powerful void left by Bucaram's ouster.
</P>
<P>
After Bucaram was ousted by a 44-34 vote in Congress, Congress
President Fabian Alarcon was sworn in as interim president until
new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement issued by the armed forces earlier today
said Vice President Rosalia Arteaga was taking over as president,
thus rejecting Congress' choice. She had earlier accused Alarcon
of engineering a congressional coup.
</P>
<P>
That means that there are now three people claiming to be
president, since Bucaram has refused to accept his dismissal and
has appealed to the armed forces for support.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old president, who was dismissed on the grounds of
mental incompetence, is ensconced in the presidential palace which
is surrounded by armed troops.
</P>
<P>
Early today thousands of Ecuadorans demanding Bucaram leave
office immediately clashed with the troops who fired tear gas at
the crowds. Several people were injured, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read on national television Thursday by
Bucaram's press secretary, Bucaram denounced Congress' move to
sack him as "anti-democratic and in violation of constitutional
norms." It said Bucaram had "no intention to leave the
presidential palace."
</P>
<P>
The political crisis erupted on the second day of a 48-hour
nationwide strike called by unions to oppose harsh economic
austerity measures imposed by Bucaram early last month.
</P>
<P>
The measures included electricity and gas rate hikes totaling
more than 200 percent and a 60 percent rise in bus fares.
</P>
<P>
Before congress moved to dismiss him, Bucaram warned in a
national address, that he would take "all powers necessary" if the
constitutional order was threatened.
</P>
<P>
"The government makes clear that in the case of an attempt to
break with constitutional order, I will assume all of the powers
available to protect the legitimacy of the popular will and the
national judicial order," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Appoints New Agriculture Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Seifu Ketema was appointed
as the minister of agriculture of Ethiopia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seifu will replace Teketel Forsido, who was appointed
as the minister of agriculture in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's Ethiopian Herald quoted Prime Minister Meles Zenawi as
saying at the parliament that the reason for the replacement of
Teketel was that in spite of his tireless efforts and loyalty, his
ability was not commensurate with the expanding demands of the
job.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Teketel will be reassigned to where he could render
better services.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Seifu was General Manager of the
Biodiversity Institute before the new appointment.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia reaped two consecutive bumper harvests in 1995 and
1996. The nation has 500,000 tons of surplus produce this year,
as compared to the acute food grain shortage two years ago.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ban on S. African Ostrich Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has lifted
its ban on South Africa's export of ostrich meat and live ostriches to
its member states, said sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed by the EU in November last year after the
outbreak of Congo fever at an ostrich abattoir at Oudsthoorn, Western
Cape Province, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Congo fever is an infectious disease which causes body organs to
worsen with massive internal and external bleeding.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Commission's Standing Veterinary Committee
recently decided that ostrich imports from South Africa would only be
allowed under certain guarantees.
</P>
<P>
These included certification by the South African authority
that the ostriches are isolated in tick and rodent free
surrounding for at least two weeks before being slaughtered, and
that they were tick-free.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of live ostriches would only be allowed if
they were kept under similar conditions for at least three weeks prior
to export. enditem

KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 drug shops in Pallisa
District, eastern Uganda, have been closed and more than 100
bottles of substandard quinine mixture impounded.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said, this follows a recent
crackdown by the National Drug Authority (NDA) on illegal drug
sellers and sale of expired and substandard drugs throughout the

The report quoted Silver Mudenya, Pallisa District Drug
Inspector, as saying that the untrained personnel often gave

<HEADLINE> Iran Regards US Presence in Gulf as Great Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani has warned of a great danger posed by "illegitimate
presence of the United States in the Persian Gulf," local media
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani stated that "Iran is pursuing a policy of peace,
stability and coexistence among the community of nations across
the world."
</P>
<P>
"Iran has proved beyond speck of doubt that it is the
staunch supporter of peace in the region and among the
neighboring countries," he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Iran considered the illegitimate presence of the United
States in the region as a great danger," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that it is a matter of great significance to
the Iranian nation that the continued conspiracies of the
enemies, particularly that of the United States, has failed to
stop Iran's development and progress.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement Thursday night in a meeting with
ambassadors, charge d'affaires and other foreign representatives
in Tehran to commemorate the eve of Eid Fitr festival and the
18th anniversary of triumph of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's statement is clearly
referring to some western reports that the United States is
making a special program to wage military strike against 19
Iranian targets, including training camps and nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accused Iran of involvement in the bombing of its
military base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia last June, which killed 19
American soldiers. Iran has denied the charge, saying it is
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president said last month that Iran will
powerfully respond to any possible U.S. military measure and
reveal to the world the real power of Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has harbored deep malice
toward Iran following the victory of the Islamic revolution in
1979.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover Key Step in Activating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A gene that plays a key
role in activating the immune system -- and perhaps also in
spurring on the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS
-- has been discovered and cloned by Israeli researchers,
according to an announcement of the Weizmann Institute of
Science.
</P>
<P>
Their findings were reported in the February issue of
Nature published this week.
</P>
<P>
The gene, called NIK, helps remove a molecular "brake" that
keeps the immune response in check. Its discovery could lead
to the development of drugs to regulate the immune system in
a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
Drugs that block NIK's effects might be designed to inhibit
unwanted immune responses in autoimmune diseases such as juvenile
diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. Conversely, drugs that enhance
NIK's effects might be designed to augment immunity in immune
deficiency diseases.
</P>
<P>
"NIK activation is a crucial first step in triggering the
immune response," said Prof. David Wallach of the Membrane
Research and biophysics Department of Weizmann Institute, who
conducted the study with doctoral students Nikolai Malinin, Mark
Boldin and Andrei Kovalenko.
</P>
<P>
Wallach noted that many groups of scientists had been looking
for this vital initial step.
</P>
<P>
"Our finding holds potential for the design of future
medications to block or enhance the effects of NIK, depending
on the kind of disease, although we still need to clarify
the exact reactions that this molecule sets off," he said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of NIK may also throw light on the progress
of the HIV virus, he said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Uganda
on Thursday urged concerned parties to hold more talks on the
conflict in the Great Lakes region in a bid to seek a lasting
peace for the region, said sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by South African Foreign Affairs Minister
Alfred Nzo and his Ugandan counterpart Eriya Kategaya during their
talks on Thursday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya is currently in South Africa for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a joint statement issued after the talks, the two
ministers agreed to support African initiatives to seek a peaceful
solution to the crisis and called for the ending of unhelpful external
involvement in it.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between Zairean army and its Tutsi rebels in
eastern Zaire has caused an exodus of about one million Hutu
refugees in the region.
</P>
<P>
African leaders held two regional summit in Nairobi, Kenya
last year to discuss the crisis, hoping to find a lasting
solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and
Cameroun, at a meeting in Pretoria last month, called on all the
African countries and organizations to refrain from military
involvement in the crisis in the regions. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Soldiers Clash With Anti-Bucaram Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Ecuadorans who
demanded ousted President Abdala Bucaram leave office immediately
clashed with soldiers early today outside government headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The troops, whom Bucaram appealed to for support after Congress
decided on Thursday to dismiss him, fired tear gas at the crowds
and several people were injured, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was dismissed by parliament on the grounds
of mental incompetence, is ensconced in the presidential palace
which is surrounded by armed troops.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, elected in July, was ousted by a 44-34 vote in
Congress on Thursday. Congress President Fabian Alarcon was then
sworn in as interim president until new elections are held.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement issued by the armed forces Friday said
Vice President Rosalia Arteaga was taking over as president, thus
rejecting Congress' choice. She had earlier accused Alarcon of
engineering a congressional coup.
</P>
<P>
That means that there are now three people claiming to be
president, since Bucaram has refused to accept his dismissal and
has appealed to the armed forces for support.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read on national television Thursday by
Bucaram's press secretary, Bucaram denounced Congress' move to
impeach him as "anti-democratic and in violation of constitutional
norms." It said Bucaram had "no intention to leave the
presidential palace."
</P>
<P>
But it is unclear who the military, a key force in the country,
are supporting. In the same statement which announced Rosalia
Arteaga's claim to the presidency, the Armed Forces Expanded
Council of Generals and Admirals said they were "apolitical" or
neutral in the crisis and asked the country's politicians to find
a solution.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis erupted on the second day of a 48-hour
nationwide strike called by unions to oppose harsh economic
austerity measures imposed by Bucaram early last month.
</P>
<P>
The measures included electricity and gas rate hikes totaling
more than 200 percent and a 60 percent rise in bus fares.
</P>
<P>
Before congress moved to dismiss him, Bucaram warned in a
national address, that he would take "all powers necessary" if the
constitutional order was threatened.
</P>
<P>
"The government makes clear that in the case of an attempt to
break with constitutional order, I will assume all of the powers
available to protect the legitimacy of the popular will and the
national judicial order," he said.

Ngulube and his Namibian counterpart Stan Webster met recently to
discuss ways to strengthen bilateral trade links.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorans Troops Clash With Anti-Bucaram Protestors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran soldiers today fired
tear gas at thousands of protesters who were demanding ousted
President Abdala Bucaram to leave office immediately outside the
government headquaters.
</P>
<P>
Several people were injured in the clash, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram appealed to the military for support on Thursday after
the congress voted to oust him on grounds of mental incompetence.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued to the military high command, which was read
on national television by Bucaram's press secretary, said Bucaram
remained the country's only democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced the congress' move to impeach him as
"anti-democratic and in violation of constitutional norms." It
said Bucaram had "no intention to leave the presidential palace."
</P>
<P>
There has been no statement from the army high command yet, but
troops in combat gear reinforced positions around the presidential
palace soon after the statement was read.
</P>
<P>
The ousting of Bucaram, passed by a 44-34 vote at the congress,
came on the second day of a 48-hour nationwide strike called by
unions to oppose harsh economic austerity measures adopted by the
government early last month.
</P>
<P>
The measures included electricity and gas rate hikes totaling
more than 200 percent and a 60 percent rise in bus fares.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, the congress immediately named its leader
Fabian Alarcon as interim president pending new presidential
elections within a year.
</P>
<P>
Before congress moved to dismiss him, Bucaram warned that he
would take "all powers" necessary if the constitutional order was
threatened.
</P>
<P>
"The government makes clear that in the case of an attempt to
break with constitutional order, I will assume all of the powers
available to protect the legitimacy of the popular will and the
national judicial order," he said in an address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Rosalia Arteaga on Wednesday accused Alarcon of
engineering a congressional coup.

<HEADLINE> Extravagant Wedding Rejected by Women in Urumqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More and more brides-to-be are
opting for a simple wedding ceremony held during the traditional
Spring Festival -- the traditional favored season for nuptials,
which will start tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
In a show of support against extravagant weddings, more than
400 female officials of various ethnic groups have gathered over
the past several days in downtown Urumqi, the capital city of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to sign a
petition of protest.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this kind of activities will help to establish a more
rational and civilized wedding custom in society," said Miss
Reziwa, an official of Uygur-ethnic group from the autonomous
regional publishing house.
</P>
<P>
She held that extravagance, waste and elaborate formalities
that have been popular at wedding ceremonies of young people are
now out of sync with the modern times in China.
</P>
<P>
It is customary in the people of ethnic Uygur minorities that
wedding gifts are presented at two separate times, first, on a day
two or three weeks before the wedding, when some 7,000 yuan-worth
(620 US dollars) of clothes, rice, sheep and cash are sent to the
family of the bride.
</P>
<P>
On the day after the wedding, approximately 10,000 yuan-worth
(1,250 US dollars) of clothes, shoes and jewelry are given to the
bride.
</P>
<P>
For people in the ethnic Kazak minority people, wedding gifts
are offered on six separate occasions, with total costs as high as
more than 30,000 yuan (3,610 US dollars). In some areas, a wedding
may last three days or even for a longer period of time.

<HEADLINE> Extravagant Wedding Rejected by Women in Urumqi  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that a wedding in Urumqi can cost as much as
20,000 to 40,000 yuan (2,500 to 5,000 US dollars) -- ten times of
the nation's average per capita income figure.
</P>
<P>
"Following this custom, weddings have been a great financial
burden for both young people and their families, many of whom are
heavily in debt," a local official said. "Some young lovers are
eloping to escape from the huge wedding expenditure."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a campaign to change wedding-day
extravagance into simplicity is now being launched throughout the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
In late January, a group wedding ceremony in Xinjiang was held
on suburban Urumqi outskirts, during which 18 new couples shared
their great day by skiing hand-in-hand -- a simple but meaningful
gesture of commitment.
</P>
<P>
In another group wedding held for young people from various
ethnic groups, new couples celebrated by giving each other flowers
or performing dances.
</P>
<P>
"Extravagance is no good for the anyone, and I believe that it
will be rejected by an increasing number of young people as
socialist ethical and cultural development has been progressed in
the society," said a bride who chose to celebrate her wedding in
one of the group ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 58 group wedding ceremonies have so
far been held in Urumqi over the past several years, uniting
approximately 4,000 new couples from different ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections in Nepal Postponed for Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, Kathmandu 7 (Xinhua) -- Elections for officials of
local administration bodies at the village, municipality and
district levels in Nepal have been put off for at least two
months, a senior government official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Local Development Minister Kamal Thapa told a press conference
here Thursday that the government has decided to extend the tenure
of local officials, who were elected in the last local elections
in 1992, till the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's Constitution, the current five-year tenure of the
office bearers of local bodies would expire in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
However, the government could extend the terms of local bodies
for up to one year in special circumstances in accordance with an
existing law.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said that the decision to extend the tenure of local
bodies was based on the consideration to introduce some
decentralization laws before the local elections.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a bill on the decentralization laws, expected
to give more autonomy and power to local bodies, would be passed
by the winter session of Parliament starting from early next
month.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the local elections would conclude
under these new laws by mid-May, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also argued that it is not possible to hold local elections
for the time being because of the heavy snowfall in different
parts of the country, especially in 22 districts of northern
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Thursday denounced the government's
decision to postpone the local elections.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, whose
Nepali Congress (NC) party leads the three-party ruling coalition,
the opposition threatened that it would not participate in any
talks with the government on the local elections.

COLOMBO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 300 Sri Lankans have been
detained in Malaysia, Foreign Ministry sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Sri Lanka's mission in Kuala Lumpur
Thursday informed the ministry of the detention of 90 Sri Lankans.

The sources noted that Malaysia does not permit employment of
Sri Lankan workers. It allows workers only from Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
However, the employment agencies here continue to advertise
jobs in Malaysia and charging Rs 100,000 (1,750 U.S. dollars) from
each applicant to send them across by boat.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, a penalty of 3,500 U.S. dollar is imposed on

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Send Season's Greetings to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Wang Runjiu, a farmer in a
village near Liaoyang city in northeast China's Liaoning province,
hardly expected a government official to show up for the the
Chinese new year Festival, and certainly not one with food and
money.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival is the most important festival of the year for
the Chinese nation, and traditionally they visit relatives and
friends and bring gifts.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of this year's festival, which falls on today, Wang
had a special guest in Desheng village of Longchang town -- Zhai
Enhui, the director of the standing committee of the People's
Congress of Liaoyang, who brought a bag of 25 kg of wheat flour,
10 kg of cooking oil, a basket of oranges and apples, and two
hundred yuan.
</P>
<P>
"I've never met with such a thing before," Wang commented,
"such a high-ranking official bringing gifts to common folk."
</P>
<P>
It may have been the first time for Wang, but it was not for
Zhai. Government officials from Liaoyang started to help those
farmers in need three years ago, and more than 1,000 poor rural
families became "relatives" of officials this year. The officials
visited new friends and dropped in on old ones with gifts, too.
</P>
<P>
Wang was not the only farmer who was moved by this gesture. In
Shengli village, Wu Chunze, deputy-director of the people's
congress of Liaoyang city, discussed ways of making more money
with a local farmer, 50-year-old Lu Xingtao at the latter's home.
</P>
<P>
"With help from Wu, I'm sure we'll be better of soon," Lu said,
explaining that he and his wife have decided to borrow some money
to open a bean curd workshop after the Spring Festival.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Proposes "Open Skies" for Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has proposed liberalizing Thailand's aviation
industry to allow carriers from all nations to land at Bangkok's
Don Muang International Airport.
</P>
<P>
He said "open skies" were necessary to develop the country's
tourism and ultimately narrow the country's current account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Bangkok Post earlier this week, he
said he hoped to turn the country into a "shopper's paradise".
</P>
<P>
Currently over 70 foreign airlines use the Bangkok airport.
</P>
<P>
Thailand earned about 9 billion U.S. dollars from tourism,
which is a major foreign exchange earner for the country in recent
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 7 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lanka Navy Thursday sank
a boat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) off the
northwestern coast in the Mannar district, according to military
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the boat was reportedly carrying
reinforcements and supplies to the rebels who are resisting a
military thrust in the area.
</P>
<P>
The government troops carrying out the "Edibala" (fearless
force) operation since last Tuesday have advanced 18 kilometers
into the LTTE territory in Northern province.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the troops have destroyed three abandoned
LTTE bases in the jungles.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the advancing troops met with only little
resistance from the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the Sri Lankan government
for a separate state in the north and east of the country since
1983.

<HEADLINE> Romania Devalues National Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania's National Central
Bank today lowered the exchange rate of the country's currency,
the leu, to 6069 to the U.S. dollar, to make it closer to its
market value.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the leu would be further devalued to 6183 to the
dollar on February 10.
</P>
<P>
Before today's adjustment, the gap between the official rate
for the leu and the market rate was as much as 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leu has fallen steadily since the fourth quarter of last
year. Its reference rate fell from 4035 to the dollar on December
30, 1996 to 5016 on January 17. It stood at 6100 to the dollar on
the black market on February 6.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a local newspaper on January 18, Mugur
Isarescu, director of the central bank, said that it was normal to
lower the leu's rate in order to speed up the country's economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
The Adevarul (Truth) newspaper said in a commentary on January
23 that the significant fall of the leu would make it more
difficult to import much needed energy, industrial materials and
equipment. It also said higher import prices would increase the
cost of industrial and agricultural production and prompt price
hikes and inflation.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Toughen Up Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The interbank rate shot up to
22 percent Thursday as the Bank of Thailand tried to slow
speculative currency borrowing by adopting a tougher stance on
lending to financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said the central
bank would temporarily toughen up on bond-repurchase lending and
check if their borrowing is for speculative purposes.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's Exchange Equalization Fund set the mid-rate
of baht and dollar trading at 25.90 baht a dollar Thursday, up one
satang from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Demand for money for the lunar new year was partly behind the
jump in the interbank rate, which reflects demand for the baht on
the money markets. The rate was further pushed up by the cost to
purchase dollars and preparations by banks and finance firms to
put together liquidity asset reserves.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai Thursday once again stressed that the baht would not
be devalued and that the central bank would continue to defend the
baht.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Opens Up Insurance, Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian Great Hural,
the congress of the country, has amended its laws to launch a
house privatization drive and to allow private businessmen to
enter the country's social insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The 110-day Great Hural conference, which ended today, opened
the door from February 1 for farmers, herdsmen and private
businessmen, to enter the social insurance system which formerly
only covered people listed on government payrolls.
</P>
<P>
The revised laws also allows for the privatization of
State-owned houses, free of charge, to citizens who are using them.
</P>
<P>
The revised laws met criticism from several social groups soon
after they were announced. It was claimed they were not equally
applicable to people in different classes of the society, and
helped increase polarization between the poor and the rich.
</P>
<P>
But the government explained that the new laws were drafted to
meet the demands of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55 laws and 52 sets of regulations involving
politics, economics and social sectors were passed on the marathon
conference, started on September 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The conference failed to pass a law on land privatization,
which aroused heated disputes, and will be discussed at the spring
conference of the Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Union Party, which won the election last
June, is quickening its drive to a market-oriented economy.

<HEADLINE> Sufficient Supply of Locally-Produced Vegetable in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, an arid and frigid area in northwest China, is now
basically self-sufficient in its vegetable supply thanks to a
massive drive to build vegetable farms there.
</P>
<P>
To date, 90 percent of the fresh vegetable sold on the market
in Xinjiang were produced at local vegetable farms, so that the
autonomous region would no longer rely on imports from other parts
of China.
</P>
<P>
As the region has a long winter that lasts as long as half a
year, local residents had to live on Chinese cabbage, potatoes and
radishes for the entire winter.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, governments at various levels in
Xinjiang have allocated 860 million yuan (103.6 million US
dollars)to build some 100 vegetable production bases.
</P>
<P>
Last year, green houses with a total area of approximately
5,540 ha. were completed, turning out 340,000 tons of vegetables
in 50 varieties.
</P>
<P>
The acreage planted with vegetables in Xinjiang is expected to
reach 82,700 ha this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More residents in the Chinese
capital plan to select travelling abroad as the best way to spend
their honeymoon or holidays, including New Year's Day and the
Spring Festival, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
For February this year, membership in tour groups heading for
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macao are all sold
out, Zhou Huifang, an official with China International Travel
Service (CITS), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the rapid economic development and the rise in living
standards, Zhou said, Chinese people began to change their
traditional way of spending Spring Festival, that is, gathering
for a family reunion dinner in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
"Spring Festival provides people with leisure time to travel,
especially since the country adopted a 40-hour work week on May 1,
1995," Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
More young people like to select the holidays to hold weddings,
partly for the jubilant atmosphere and partly for the several
days' vacation.
</P>
<P>
CITS-organized tour groups took more than 6,000 Chinese abroad
last year. The other five Beijing-based Grade-A travel agencies
also provided tours abroad for another 6,000 Chinese people, China
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the wedding tour, which has been registered as a formal
tour product with the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, CITS is also preparing a special tour product for the
elderly.

</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and his visiting
Australian counterpart Alexander Downer signed a joint declaration
on the ties between the two countries in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The joint council is designed to "facilitate greater
cooperation in economic, investment, scientific, technological and

the Asia-Pacific area," said Downer, who is here for a six-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that today's meeting marked a new beginning in
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our two nations share a general line on international

<HEADLINE> Drive Launched to Help Women out of Poverty, Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF) has planned a series of activities to help women
out of poverty and eliminate illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF's eventual goal is to help Chinese women contribute
more to national development and enjoy equal rights with men in
political and other fields, today's China Daily cites a ACWF
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
This non-governmental organization has set forth a target to
help one million women escape poverty in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 278,000 women were able to shake off poverty
thanks to various aid-the-poor activities conducted by the
federation last year, it reports.
</P>
<P>
It has also mobilized 10.2 million women to participate in a
project providing training in advanced agricultural techniques
which will help them improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qizao, vice-president of the federation, was quoted as
saying that the federation's branches in some of the provinces and
autonomous regions in northern and western China recently trained
20,000 women in rural areas to grow new trains of soybeans, maize,
wheat, rice and cotton.
</P>
<P>
After training, they have become advocates and demonstrators of
new hybrid seeds and growing techniques in these areas. A total
9.24 million households across the country have been chosen to
demonstrate the use of scientific techniques in agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Huang's organization has helped Chinese women establish 22
national green bases that can contribute to environmental
protection and local economic development. The biggest, located in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, boasts hectares of jujube
trees planted in the reclaimed barren hills.
</P>
<P>
This green move of the ACWF has been nominated by the National
Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) as a candidate for this
year's Globe 500 award from the United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Baotou, an earthquake-wreaked
city in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made
great strides reconstructing its local economy.
</P>
<P>
The quake last May, which registered 6.4 on the Richter scale,
left 500,000 people homeless, and caused five billion yuan worth
of damage, destroying 67 percent of Baotou's residential
housing. Some 1,200 enterprises were shut down, a local official
reported.
</P>
<P>
The city has reversed its bad luck since the catastrophe. Tens
of thousands of homeless have been moved into new housing, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial output value has gone up to 20.4 billion
yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) and its agricultural output also hit
a record 1.22 billion yuan (147 million US dollars), the official
said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, local authorities have raised 2.3
billion yuan (277 million US dollars) to rebuild and renovate
residential homes, allowing more quake victims to more from
shelters into new houses.
</P>
<P>
The construction of 1.4 million square meters of housing, more
than half the total planned, has so far been completed in urban

<HEADLINE> Millrose Games in Financial Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, February 6 (Xinhua) -- One of the American indoor
athletics circuit Millrose Games is beset by financial problems
that will leave Friday's competition without most of the sport's
marquee names.
</P>
<P>
Three-time Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee and
two-time Olympic 100-meter champion Gail Devers withdrew Wednesday
after the organizers were unable to raise the 30,000 U.S. dollars
to 35,000 Dollars promised to each of the world's top female
athletes.
</P>
<P>
The national governing body, USA Track and Field, is
experiencing severe financial problems, and informed Millrose
director Howard Schmertz last week it would be unable to pay
Joyner-Kersee and Devers, leaving Gwen Torrence as the favorite in
the women's 60-meter dash.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reported Thursday that Schmertz was able to raise
some of the money from Chase, the sponsor of the meet, but Bob
Kersee, manager for the two athletes and the husband of Jackie,
chose to keep his athletes home because of his dissatisfaction
with USA Track and Field.

PANAMA CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Ricardo Alberto Arias confirmed today that official negotiations
are underway with the United States Government to create a
Multilateral Center Against Drugs.
</P>
<P>
Arias announced that Panamanian representative Jorge Ritter met

of the anti-drug center under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he would continue his talks with
Negroponte about the general plan for the center. But there was
no agreement yet, "not even in general terms."

William Hughes, U.S. ambassador to Panama, stressed that the
United States would withdraw before December 31 of 1999, but he

<HEADLINE> Trade Union Official Visit Workers in Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Trade Union and government
officials went to local units nationwide to salute workers in need
and help them celebrate the Spring Festival holiday.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Trade Union (ACFTU) sent 11
delegations to 29 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions, especially those hit by natural disasters or burdened
with large numbers of unprofitable firms, today's China Daily
cited an trade union official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials have kept in close touch with
laid-off workers and their families, helping them solve
difficulties in daily life or look for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that more than 50,000 officials have such ties
with 18,000 money-losing State-owned firms and 476,000 poorer
workers' families.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai's textile industry, 1,145 officials each have
regularly called on poor workers' families during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, 23 provincial-level trade unions,
more than 200 at prefectural or city-level and 1,200 at the
county-level had set up special funds to relieve poorer workers,
the newspaper cited Zhang Dinghua, vice-chairman of the ACFTU, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The ACFTU has allocated 15.5 million yuan (1.87 US dollars) in
relief funds for this purpose, in addition to the efforts of the
trade unions at all levels.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 trade unions had established lists of workers
and retirees having serious financial difficulties by the end of
last month, it reports.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 12,000 co-operative shops, which sell retail goods at
lower prices to employees, have been set up for 10 million
workers, it says.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 200 employment agencies were opened by the
trade unions to train one million laid-off workers, helping
150,000 find new jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Fertilizer
Industry Agency of Ethiopia will supply farmers with 320,000 tons
of fertilizer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mengesha Bekele, general manager of the agency, said here
today that the demand for this year's fertilizer has increased by
50,000 tons compared with that of last year.
</P>
<P>
He added that his agency is ready to supply fertilizer to
farmers at 431 sales centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer consumption in Ethiopia increases year by year. The
government plans to supply 360,000 tons of fertilizer in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Fertilizer Industry Agency said though
the demand for the supply of fertilizer grows every year, the use
of the input was minimal as compared to some other African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa consumed on an average 65
kilograms of fertilizer per hectare while Ethiopia's utilization
of fertilizer is below that standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Only two years after
launching a five-year plan to attain self-sufficiency in grain
production, Ethiopia has reached its target, Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his mid-budget year report to parliament, Meles described
the achievement as a miracle, noting that many people had thought
Ethiopia would need 20 years to achieve self-sufficiency in food
supply.
</P>
<P>
More than that, Ethiopia has also managed to produce
500,000-1,000,000 tons of surplus grain for export, said the
prime minister, adding that the nation's agricultural output has
increased by 50 percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia reaped the second consecutive bumper harvest in
1996/97 with an output of 11.7 million tons of crops, 2 million
tons more than that of previous year's good harvest.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with Frankfurt and Paris extending Wednesday's
gains to close at new record highs and London finishing in the
negative ground.

The FTSE 100 index in London ended the session 15.6 points
weaker at 4,265.9 in the absence of a fresh lead from Wall Street.

bodies has raised interest rates was tempered by the lack of a
hoped-for cut in the German repo rate.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended the day slightly ahead,
supported by the dollar and higher-than-expected jobless figures,
with the DAX-30 index 6.14 points higher to close at a new record
of 3,104.14.
</P>
<P>
However, share prices were little moved by the decision of the
Bundesbank to leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse had opened sharply lower today after Wall
Street's overnight decline before reversing the losses and ending
17.18 points up at 2,558.43, breaching the record closing high of
2,541.25 set on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended down
15.6 points at 4,265.9. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed up 6.14
points at 3,104.14. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished up 17.18
