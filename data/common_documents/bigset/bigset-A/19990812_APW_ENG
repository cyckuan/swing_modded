<HEADLINE> BOT Closes Early on Power Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A power outage in a section of downtown Chicago  
Thursday caused the Chicago Board of Trade to shut down early and 
left the federal courthouse and many businesses without 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage occurred when two transmission cables under a street  
failed, and the power company did not know when it would be able to 
restore power. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of commuters left early for the day, causing rush hour  
to arrive hours early. Extra buses were called in to handle the 
crush, and generators were set up in Union Station, which handles 
Amtrak and suburban commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McCoy, vice president of Commonwealth Edison, said cables  
leading from two big transformers failed Wednesday night and 
Thursday morning at a substation just south of the downtown area. 
That outage put about 2,300 customers west of downtown out of 
service for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd took another 670 business customers off line Thursday  
afternoon to keep the one remaining transformer at the substation 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	CBOT officials made the decision to close the markets at 1 p.m.  
CDT after speaking to ComEd CEO John Rowe, said board spokesman 
Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's chief executive officer, Thomas R. Donovan, wanted  
to ensure an orderly shutdown, avoiding the potential chaos if 
power failed with as many as 5,000 traders on the floor, Gallaway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disruption of trading,'' Gallaway said.  
``The last minutes of trading are often some of the busiest trading 
of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Trade's agricultural markets normally close at 1:15  
p.m. and the financial markets normally close at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Another financial market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange,  
halted trading temporarily, resuming around 2:15 p.m. after 
switching over to backup generators. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Mollitor, a Board of Trade commodities broker, said things  
got chaotic as traders tried to get last-second orders through and 
then rushed out the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels a little bit like a little kid getting out of school  
early because of a storm. I guess this is practice for Y2K,'' 
Mollitor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage also darkened the federal office building and  
prompted the evacuation of several highrise office buildings, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were blamed on the failures of two power  
transmission cables, which left 2,300 customers in the heart of 
downtown Chicago in the dark. The cables are at a power substation 
just south of downtown that has been having problems since a 
transformer failed last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange remained open.

	Discipline Urged in Nuke Spy Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, citing a  
``total breakdown in the system,'' today recommended disciplinary 
action against a senior official and two other employees of the Los 
Alamos nuclear laboratory because of failures in the China 
espionage investigation. Richardson did not identify the three. He 
said their ``responsibilities were clear and they failed to meet 
their responsibilities'' in the investigation of alleged spying by 
a Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee.

	L.A. Suspect Charged With Murder  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas today  
revealed a detailed account of the murder of postal worker Joseph 
Santos Ileto shortly after county prosecutors filed new state 
charges against Buford O. Furrow Jr., accused in that killing and a 
bloody attack on a Jewish center. Furrow, a white supremacist, told 
the FBI that he killed a Filipino-American postal worker because he 
was nonwhite and worked for the federal government, authorities 
said today.

	Clinton Pushes for Cleaner Fuel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton set a goal today to reduce  
global warming over the next decade by increasing U.S. use of 
technology that converts plants and trees into fuel, chemicals and 
electricity. The president issued an executive order establishing a 
council to coordinate the federal government's effort to develop a 
biomass research program, and setting a goal of tripling use of 
bioenergy and bioproducts by 2010. Biomass energy is currently 
about 3 percent of the total U.S. energy supply. It uses trees, 
crops and waste from agriculture or forestry to make energy that 
can then be used as fuel for cars or power factories.

<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- A U.S.-built military base in  
Honduras contains cramped metal cells apparently used to torture 
and kill political prisoners, a top Honduran official said today. 
The cells -- along with dozens of possible grave sites -- were 
discovered this week at El Aguacate air base in eastern Honduras, 
which the United States built for Nicaraguan Contra rebels in 1983. 
It was also used by Honduran army troops.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Facing criticism that Russia hasn't acted quickly  
enough to quash an Islamic rebellion in the south, President Boris 
Yeltsin promised today that the militants would be wiped out 
steadily but ``without haste.'' Russian lawmakers warned that the 
hostilities in Dagestan resemble those at the onset of Russia's 
botched war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya in 1994-96. 
Russian aircraft again fired on the rebels today, and more troops 
and weapons were sent to southern Russia. The militants maintained 
their hold on several villages.

	Life Found 2.7 Bil. Years Old  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying Australian rocks have  
found evidence that primitive forms of life existed 2.7 billion 
years ago -- a billion years earlier than had been previously shown. 
``This age should provide a new calibration point for molecular 
clocks and the universal tree of life,'' researcher Jochen J. 
Brocks and his fellow Australian researchers report tomorrow in the 
journal Science. The finding pushes back evidence of life to the 
Archean era, the period from the beginning of Earth to about 2.5 
billion years ago.

	FAA Plans To Reduce Delays

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being hammered by airline executives for  
flight delays this summer, the Federal Aviation Administration has 
developed a plan to help reduce such inconveniences. The agency, in 
a letter to the airlines, said it will soon have its command center 
start coordinating traffic flows in bad weather, eliminating 
conflicts between local centers spread across the country. The 
agency has also pledged to develop a policy in which airplanes held 
on the ground because of bad weather will be given a specific 
projected departure time. Airline passengers should start changes 
within the next several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Vanguard Founder Bogle To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard Group and  
the public face behind the nation's second-largest family of U.S. 
mutual funds, will resign by year's end from Vanguard's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard said today that Bogle must step down under a policy  
that requires board members to resign in December of the year in 
which they reach 70. Bogle turned 70 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But a report today in The Wall Street Journal said there was a  
dispute over whether the retirement policy was mandatory and also 
said there were policy differences between Bogle and his successor, 
John Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle founded Vanguard in 1975 and now is senior chairman of the  
firm that manages nearly $500 billion in investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund analysts said the transition between leaders is  
expected to be smooth because Vanguard's day-to-day operations have 
been run by Brennan, a protege of Bogle and the chairman and chief 
executive since 1996. Brennan is 45. 
</P>
<P>
	``Transition isn't the issue because Brennan has been running  
the show their for several years,'' said Dan Wiener, editor of The 
Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter. ``The 
real loss is that of the Vanguard icon. Bogle is the last of the 
mutual fund icons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiener said Bogle ``personified Vanguard.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Many of Vanguard's investors trust Bogle to look out for their  
best interests because he's the guy who started the whole thing,'' 
Wiener said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, on the other hand, while well known in the mutual fund  
world, is relatively unknown among consumers, according to Wiener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that Bogle had  
differences with Brennan over Brennan's support for an expansion 
into the discount brokerage business. Bogle has complained that the 
discount business encourages a gambling mentality among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle also told the Journal that he felt the board's  
retirement-age policy was not mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., was formed in the wake of  
differences between the senior managers of Wellington Management, 
an investment firm founded in 1928. Vanguard is widely regarded as 
the fastest growing mutual fund company, with assets second only to 
Fidelity Investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press uses Vanguard to manage its retirement  
investment plans.

<HEADLINE> Eichmann Papers Found in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Adolf Eichmann's apparent first attempt at a  
prison memoir has been found in files brought to Germany decades 
ago after the Nazi war criminal's trial in Israel, a German Nazi 
hunter said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Willi Dressen, who heads the agency coordinating  
efforts to track down Nazi crimes, came across the 127 handwritten 
pages two days ago after a German newspaper asked him whether his 
agency had a copy of the 1,300-page memoir Eichmann wrote while in 
an Israeli prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that, but I found something else,'' he said in a  
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The pages titled ``My Memoirs'' were located in prosecution  
files brought to Germany after the Holocaust mastermind's 1962 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently they fell into oblivion,'' Dressen said.  
</P>
<P>
	The subject of Eichmann's memoirs came under public scrutiny  
Tuesday when Israel announced plans to release the 1,300-page 
version for publication by German scholars. 
</P>
<P>
	The manuscript has been locked in Israel's national archives for  
decades. Israel decided to get it published after one of Eichmann's 
son's, Dieter, claimed the manuscript as family property. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressen said that in the 127 pages in Ludwigsburg, where his  
agency is based, Eichmann uses bombastic language and tries to 
justify Nazi crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be very interesting for psychologists,''  
Dressen said. ``But there are no new facts that will require us to 
rewrite history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressen said all of his agency's Eichmann files are open for  
historical research, but not to the general public. He said his 
agency has no plans to publish the 127-page manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
	The pages Dressen found apparently were written earlier than the  
version stored in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Notations on the pages say they were handed over to Israeli  
police on June 16, 1960. That was a month after Israel's then-prime 
minister, David Ben-Gurion, announced Eichmann was in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichmann escaped to South America after World War II, but was  
kidnapped in Argentina in 1960 by Israeli agents. 
</P>
<P>
	At his 1961-62 trial, he maintained that he was a midlevel  
official who was only carrying out Adolf Hitler's orders. That view 
is repeated in the longer memoir, according to two Israeli 
historians who are among a handful of people to have read it.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Take Measure of Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley is walking around a  
wrap-around porch on a steamy summer night, hoping to convert the 
curious and Clinton-weary Democrats to his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaning toward Bill Bradley,'' says Lars Fatland, a  
36-year-old teacher watching the former Hall of Fame basketball 
player wipe his sweaty brow at a neighbor's house. ``But I'm not 
altogether sure why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator is drawing increasingly large  
crowds, stocked with people like Fatland. They tend to be liberal 
or independent, new to Democratic politics, awed by Bradley's 
celebrity, fuzzy about the former senator's political record, not 
committed to either candidate -- and worried that Gore can't shake 
President Clinton's shadow to beat the Republican nominee in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitalizing on that anxiety may be Bradley's best hope of  
upsetting Gore, who is still the favorite of the party's most 
influential voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley is doing what you have to do when you're a challenger  
-- reaching out to those who would otherwise not consider themselves 
activists or who don't have very focused interests,'' said Iowa 
Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatland fits the mold.  
</P>
<P>
	He supported Jesse Jackson, a liberal candidate, in the 1988  
Iowa caucuses but hasn't been active in recent campaigns. He may be 
a bigger fan of sports than politics. He is more curious than 
knowledgeable about Bradley. And he thinks the vice president is 
damaged goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think highly of Gore,'' said Fatland, who teaches children  
with discipline problems. ``But I want to make sure we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the same methodical determination that made him a Hall of  
Fame basketball player, the 6-foot-5 Bradley is loping through the 
early voting states -- quietly offering himself as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	He promises to be tougher on guns, more supportive of a woman's  
right to abortion, an enemy of dirty money in politics, a champion 
for poor children and, above all, a man Americans can trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The last reference, a staple in every campaign speech, strikes a  
tone with Democrats trying to determine whether Clinton's 
sex-and-lies scandal should undercut their support of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the people filling seats at Bradley campaign stops, the most  
active Democratic voters generally worry about his ability to be 
elected president. The independent and casual voters seem to object 
to Clinton and Gore in more personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Willadsen, a 46-year-old accountant from Ames, surveyed a  
standing-room-only crowd of 300 Democrats on Thursday. ``A lot of 
these people would vote for Clinton again, given another choice, 
but are disappointed by the choices he made,'' said Willadsen, who 
attended Iowa's caucuses in 1992 for Clinton, but said he falls in 
and out of active party politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Gore will pay the price for Clinton in the general  
election,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Yager, 42, an English professor at Iowa State University,  
shuffled her feet along a red-brick patio in a long line to hear 
Bradley speak. She had expected to back Gore, but the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal is making her consider a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore stood by Clinton through the smarmiest thing in the  
world,'' she said, squinching her face in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent-minded voter, Yager recently attended a rally for  
Republican candidate George W. Bush out of curiosity. She plans to 
be a caucus delegate for the first time, but doesn't know enough 
about Bradley yet to commit to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into his speech, she said: ``I want to like what I  
hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's low-key, folksy style seems to wear well with crowd  
members, most of whom arrived with low or no expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Al Gore,'' said Hamilton Cravens, 61, a history  
professor. ``But this Bradley guy has more pizzazz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growing crowds and good reviews are giving Bradley  
summertime momentum. But he will find it more difficult to turn out 
supporters on a wintry day in 2000, said Iowa governor Vilsack. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is relying on his Internet site and follow-up work by  
his staff to get people involved in his campaign. In an interview 
Thursday between campaign stops, the former lawmaker said he didn't 
know if an underdog had ever won the Democratic primary by 
expanding the party's base. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to me it's not whether it's been done before. The question  
is how it can be done now, and why,'' he said. ``Why it can be done 
is as important as how. Why it can be done is people yearn to once 
again have a politics that's responsive and accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack, who has helped Gore without endorsing him, said Bradley  
can make the race tight -- but winning Iowa will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need strong institutional support to win,'' Vilsack said.  
``Gore's got it.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Tired of Talking About Sanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Coach Bobby Ross and the rest of  
the Detroit Lions are tired of questions about Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even talk about Barry anymore,'' wide receiver  
Johnnie Morton said Thursday of the star running back, who 
announced his retirement two weeks ago. ``It's kind of getting 
blown out of proportion. It seems as if he's seen in a supermarket, 
everyone writes about it, and then we're asked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's retired, just let him be.''  
</P>
<P>
	Added quarterback Charlie Batch: ``We can't stop a season just  
because he stopped playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ross, he brushed away questions even before they were  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to comment on it,'' the coach said. ``I'm not  
going to talk about it. You're wasting your time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders reportedly returned Wednesday night from a European  
vacation that has occupied him since abruptly announcing his 
retirement July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his retirement, Sanders said his desire to quit  
football outweighed his desire to play -- even for the 1,458 yards 
he needs to break Walter Payton's career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' father has said he would try to arrange a meeting  
between his son and Lions Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. But 
as late as Wednesday, the elder Sanders has said he hasn't heard 
from his son in weeks and was awaiting a call from him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press reported Friday that the Lions have begun  
the process of reclaiming the unearned portion of the $11 million 
signing bonus Sanders received when he signed a six-year contract 
in 1997. The Lions are seeking a $7.3 million repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief operating officer Chuck Schmidt said Thursday that the  
Lions had discussed the payback procedure with Sanders' agents, 
David Ware of Atlanta and Lamont Smith of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early in the week, and then we said we were going to touch  
back with them in a week,'' Schmidt said. ``We didn't set a 
timetable, but we left it open that we're going to talk to each 
other fairly soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left Thursday with Ware were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Lions security director Allen Hughes, a family friend, has been  
staying with Wiliam Sanders in Wichita. The elder Sanders has said 
Hughes stay there was more pleasure than business. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he never pressured the elder Sanders to try to get  
his son to come back to the team. He didn't have to -- Sanders 
already had promised his friend even before the visit that he would 
do anything he could to help. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hughes said he came to visit the Sanders family in  
response to a long-standing invitation -- not at the Lions' urging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he said. ``I  
came here to relax and have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders has avoided all contact with the Lions' front  
office and coaching staff since the final game of last season. Ross 
tried to contact him through 13 telephone calls or handwritten 
letters, but Sanders never responded. 
</P>
<P>
	In talking about Friday's opening exhibition with Atlanta, Ross  
never mentioned the team's chances without Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he alluded briefly to Atlanta's All-Pro running back, Jamal  
Anderson who ended his contract holdout Wednesday and returned to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During the team's drills Thursday, there were unavoidable  
reminders of Sanders' absence. Many fans wore No. 20 jerseys. Near 
the team's practice field, a public-address system blared last 
season's highlights of Sanders, touted by the announcer as ``the 
standard by which all other running backs are measured.''

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former Lutheran minister is about to become  
the first married priest in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be official until ordination, but the Vatican, acting  
under special pastoral provisions, has given the archdiocese 
permission to welcome Lawrence Blake into the ranks of its 500 
priests. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake, now a church administrator in Chanhassen, has worked in  
several parishes since he and his wife, Diane, converted to 
Catholicism in 1993. He's a graduate of Luther Seminary in St. Paul 
and is nearing a theology degree from St. Paul Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	Blake, 47, of Victoria, will be allowed to perform such  
sacraments as baptism, marriage and communion. He joins more than 
70 married men nationwide, most of them former Episcopalians, who 
converted to Catholicism and became priests. 
</P>
<P>
	His ordination probably will take place before Christmas, said  
the Rev. Kevin McDonough, vicar general of Archdiocese of St. Paul 
and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to pinch myself a couple of times to make sure it was  
real,'' Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to become a priest because of his heightened awareness  
of the importance of the Eucharist -- the presence of the body and 
blood of Christ in the bread and wine of communion -- celebrated in 
each Mass. McDonough said such devotion was probably the main 
reason the Vatican agreed to the archdiocese's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Podvin of Roseville, a priest in the archdiocese until  
he married in 1984, said Blake's situation ``was a very clear 
movement on the part of the church toward allowing men who are 
married and have families to be part of the church. And that only 
can enrich the church.''

 *Retreat for pastors of burned churches    	
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Pastors rebuilding from the ashes of arson  
fires will have a chance to receive advice and support at a 
national retreat at the Christian Theological Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime a house of worship burns, whether it's an accident or  
not, it's a traumatic experience,'' said Edward L. Wheeler, 
president of the seminary in Indianapolis. ``Anytime it's arson, 
psychologically it's devastating, because the first question is, 
`Why would anybody do this?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, keeping up a congregation's morale after a  
fire and leading efforts to rebuild are often physically and 
emotionally draining. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was founded in 1996 by the New York-based National  
Council of Churches in response to a number of church burnings 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	During the retreats in November and April, pastors can attend  
classes and chapel services and will have time for reflection, 
relaxation and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping they can share with each other, learn from each  
other to eliminate their isolation,'' Wheeler said.

 *Campus Crusade: Wives should 'submit'    	
</P>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Campus Crusade for Christ, one of the  
world's largest interdenominational ministries, has joined the 
Southern Baptist Convention in declaring that ``a wife is to submit 
herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups say the wife is spiritually equal but ``has the  
God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his 
helper in managing the household and nurturing the next 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campus Crusade issued its policy statement at a recent biennial  
staff conference attended by 6,900 employees, students and family 
members. The Southern Baptist Convention issued its statement last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both declare that children are a blessing ``from the moment of  
conception'' and that sex should be confined to marriage. They 
define marriage as heterosexual and lifelong, and the family as 
persons related ``by marriage, blood or adoption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campus Crusade expanded its policy to say that couples show  
their love by listening to, valuing and honoring each other ``and 
always seeking to bring benefit, not harm, to one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campus Crusade, led by Bill Bright and based in Orlando, Fla.,  
operates 50 evangelistic ministries with 20,500 staff members and 
663,000 volunteers worldwide.

 *Locals barred from Navy chapel    	
</P>
<P>
	CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) -- Virginia's two senators have asked the  
Navy to review an order that some local Roman Catholics say 
discriminates against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. R.W. Jerome, commander of a small naval security  
installation in Chesapeake, recently barred civilians from 
worshipping at the base chapel. Jerome also limited the number of 
Catholic services at the chapel and revoked permission for the 
Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization, to meet on 
base, where a chapter had been founded under his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	The chapel is outside the gates of the base, and local Catholics  
had considered it something like a parish. Many complained to Sens. 
John Warner and Charles Robb about the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, a Republican, and Robb, a Democrat, have sent separate  
letters to Rear Adm. Norbert Ryan Jr. of the Pentagon's Legislative 
Affairs Office. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy representative said the legislative affairs office would  
respond but gave no timetable.

 *NRB opposes low-power FM stations    	
</P>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- National Religious Broadcasters, which  
represents 1,275 radio and TV stations with an evangelical format, 
is urging the Federal Communications Commission to scuttle a 
proposal to add low-power FM radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some religious groups are interested in starting new low-power  
stations. However, ``while it would be advantageous to have more 
stations transmitting the gospel message, we must protect existing 
stations first,'' NRB president Brandt Gustavson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade association contends that the FCC proposal would end  
protection against frequency interference and would overcrowd the 
airwaves.

<HEADLINE> Rookie's Stay With Vikings Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Despite Reggie White's advice that he  
could sack both sin and quarterbacks, Dimitrius Underwood won't be 
juggling faith and football for the Minnesota Vikings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said Wednesday that Underwood doesn't want to play, so  
the Vikings cut ties with the first-round draft pick who went AWOL 
after his first pro practice on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced a financial settlement late Wednesday night  
in which Underwood's approximately $543,000 in bonus funds, most of 
which were frozen at his bank upon his disappearance, would be 
returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens, Underwood will be waived.  
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood is claimed, his new team would be responsible for  
his $475,000 base salary for 1999. But the Vikings would take the 
salary cap hit for Underwood's $1.725 million signing bonus this 
season, rather than a prorated one-fifth slice of it. 
</P>
<P>
	If Underwood isn't picked up by another team, the Vikings' cap  
number this year would be only $345,000, the 20 percent cut of his 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed to keep financial terms of Underwood's  
settlement confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vikings wish Dimitrius Underwood well in his future  
endeavors and will have no further comment regarding this 
subject,'' a statement from the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the rookie pass rusher blamed his mysterious  
disappearance on inner turmoil over sports and religion coexisting 
in his life, but said after a conversation Monday with White that 
he wanted to return to the Vikings if coach Dennis Green would have 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood flew from Philadelphia to Minneapolis and met with  
Green on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday morning, the Vikings issued a terse statement  
that read: ``Dimitrius told Coach Green that he has no desire to 
play football and has decided not to play for the Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Underwood's future in Minnesota has been cleared up,  
several questions remain. Why did Underwood change his mind about 
his desire to return to the Vikings? Did Green actually talk him 
out of it? 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, who sat in on the meeting  
between client and coach, didn't return phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Green reiterated that the Vikings were never worried about -- nor  
distracted by -- a rookie who walked out on them without a word. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to focus on one player. We wouldn't want to  
focus on that one player even if it was Randy Moss,'' Green said. 
``Our football team wants to focus on the entire team. We're not a 
team that operates on one player or one coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, quarterback Randall Cunningham said that doesn't mean the  
Vikings don't care about Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just pray that whatever he does, God leads him and he does  
it from his heart,'' Cunningham said. ``I don't know what he's 
going through in his life. I know that he needs a lot of godly 
people in his life and if he needs me, I'll definitely be there for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Underwood sought spiritual guidance from White, the  
NFL's career sacks leader who retired from the Green Bay Packers 
last winter, he never pursued fellowship with players on his own 
team who are noted for balancing faith and football, such as 
Cunningham or Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever talked to him,'' Cunningham said.  
``I've only seen him probably once or twice. We'd like to see the 
best for him, but as long as he's in God's arms, he's going to be 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White encouraged Underwood to meet with Green and explain  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th pick in the NFL draft out of Michigan State,  
left the Vikings without explanation one day after signing a 
five-year, $5.3 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologetically told his agent the next day that he'd had to  
tend to a family crisis and was on his way back to the team. But 
once again, he didn't return and didn't call the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter from the Star Tribune of Minneapolis finally tracked  
him down over the weekend in a Philadelphia hotel lobby, where 
Underwood said he'd been torn between his faith in God and a career 
in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
	After speaking at length with White, Underwood said he'd decided  
to return to the Vikings, who had already begun exploring ways to 
part company with him rather than fine him $5,000 per missed day 
and give him another chance.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling To Miss Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia ace Curt Schilling did not  
throw Thursday and was scratched from his next start in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling has not started since last Saturday against Arizona,  
when he allowed seven earned runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings 
of the Phillies' 8-2 loss. The 32-year-old right-hander is 
suffering from biceps tendinitis, mild bursitis and -- the latest 
ailment -- muscle spasms in his neck and shoulder blades. 
</P>
<P>
	His anticipated bullpen session was canceled Wednesday when he  
felt muscle spasms, and team doctor Michael Ciccotti advised him to 
push it back to Saturday in hopes of making his next start Tuesday 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am feeling better,'' Schilling said. ``But until it clears  
up, I won't be able to test my arm. I'm following the advice of the 
doctor, trainers and (pitching coach) Galen Cisco. Hopefully I can 
throw at some point this weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Phillies' standpoint, that is an understatement.  
Schilling's ability to shake off this string of injuries and finish 
the season has everything to do with their chances in the NL 
playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ciccotti said an MRI and a trip to the disabled  
list were considerations if Schilling's next throwing session did 
not go well. It is not to that point yet, partly because Ciccotti's 
examinations have showed nothing structurally wrong with 
Schilling's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling had a cortisone shot Sunday to ease his tendinitis and  
bursitis, and X-rays showed that no bone spurs had formed. 
Schilling had a torn labrum repaired and a bone spur removed in 
major shoulder surgery in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was in everyone's best interest for him not to  
throw on the side today,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said. 
``We'll bump his start back to Tuesday. That way, he'll have the 
weekend to try to iron things out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling led the league with 300 strikeouts, 268 2-3 innings  
and 15 complete games last season. He's dropped to fifth in the NL 
in strikeouts this season, fading in his bid to join Nolan Ryan as 
the only pitchers to strike out 300 batters in three consecutive 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He is second in the majors to Randy Johnson with eight complete  
games, throwing five straight early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Chad Ogea will start Saturday in Schilling's place  
in a big series against a team that is ahead of the Phillies in the 
NL wild-card standings.

<HEADLINE> Houston Battles Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Police officers who stop people because of their  
skin color may find themselves out of a job under a new city 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a national push to end racial profiling, Mayor Lee Brown  
and Police Chief C.O. Bradford unveiled a plan Wednesday to study 
whether any of the city's 5,000 police officers are stopping 
drivers because of their race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never want to hear any of our citizens say they were stopped  
solely because of driving while black,'' said Brown, the city's 
first black mayor. ``What we're announcing is a proactive step, a 
safeguard to find out if racial profiling is occurring here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, is just of one  
several metropolitan cities -- including San Diego and San Jose, 
Calif. -- to attack racial profiling, which has gained national 
attention in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, President Clinton issued an executive order calling for  
federal law-enforcement agencies to collect race and gender data in 
all stops and arrests. State lawmakers around the nation have 
scrambled to pass similar legislation, but so far only North 
Carolina has enacted laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's new program, which will begin immediately, requires  
officers to enter information on the race, age and gender of all 
people they stop or arrest into their patrol car computers. The 
reports will be placed in a database for review by Bradford, police 
managers and the department's Internal Affairs Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Any confirmed incidents of racial profiling could result in a  
guilty officer's dismissal or even criminal charges, Bradford said. 
Several patrolmen's associations and civil rights groups applauded 
the new policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted to hear it,'' said Jay Jacobson, executive  
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. ``That's a 
good beginning and a good example in the nation's fourth-largest 
city. Maybe it will catch on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Johnnie Cochran, speaking at the National Urban League's  
annual conference Wednesday in Houston, said racial profiling is 
pervasive in American society. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's walking while black, jogging while black ... indeed, it's  
living while black,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed in Sluggish Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Thursday in mild foreign  
exchange activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0669, up  
from $1.0657 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 115.62 
Japanese yen, up from 115.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Sluggish currency markets took their lead from the lack of  
direction seen in the U.S. stock markets, which meandered for most 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gargano, manager of foreign exchange at First Union  
National Bank, Charlotte, N.C., said more activity in the euro is 
expected Friday after Germany reports its retail sales results for 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5012 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5029, and 1.4862 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4871. The British 
pound rose to $1.6119 from $1.6108. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8332 German 
marks, down from 1.8349; and 6.1501 French francs, down from 
6.1538.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Sedin Twins Stay in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks will  
have to do without the highly-touted twin-brother combo of Daniel 
and Henrik Sedin, who announced Thursday that they will remain in 
Sweden this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Burke, Canucks president and general manager, was informed  
of the decision by their agent Mike Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``The twins were honest about their desire to stay in Sweden  
from the start, and this is news our club expected,'' said Burke. 
``It was important for them to follow through on their commitments 
with MoDo (of the Swedish Elite League) for a number of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think they'll be improved players with one more year of  
experience. The other factor in their decision was school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said the 18-year-old Sedin brothers have yet to decide  
whether to attend the Canucks training camp next month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Burke who made a number of draft-day trades to obtain the  
second and third picks that enabled the Canucks to select the twins 
last June. Prior to the draft, the Sedins -- voted co-MVPs of the 
Swedish Elite League last season -- had expressed a strong desire to 
play for the same NHL team.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Martin Heard on Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Taped jailhouse phone conversations between a  
convicted drug dealer and Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin show 
Martin agreed to write checks to pay the dealer's lawyer, an IRS 
agent testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Robarge, an Internal Revenue Service agent, said he  
listened for weeks to taped calls Rickey Brownlee made from the 
Federal Detention Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Robarge testified that Brownlee needed a legitimate person to  
pay his attorney's fees. So, it was agreed that Martin would write 
the check and receive cash from Brownlee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard excerpts from 1998 phone calls between Brownlee and  
Sam Wilson. Martin was on some of the tapes as part of a 
third-party conference call, which Robarge said is not allowed on 
prison phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the calls between Brownlee and Wilson, they talk about  
the need to find someone to write a check for legal fees. Brownlee 
would provide the actual cash behind the check. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee: ``Just find him, he'll do it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson: ``Who, Tony?''  
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee: ``Yeah, Yeah.''  
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is charged with five counts of money laundering. He  
allegedly leased three cars in his name on behalf of Brownlee, who 
paid him back with cash. Martin also is accused of writing two 
checks to Brownlee's lawyer in exchange for a cash reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Martin wrote a $25,000 check in February 1998  
for Brownlee's lawyer and a $175,000 check a month later. He placed 
a stop payment on the second check after federal investigators 
subpoenaed his financial records, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tape indicated Martin paid back $100,000 to Brownlee  
after he stopped payment on the check. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee, 42, spent seven years in prison for 1980s drug  
convictions. Known on the streets as the ``Mayor of Opa-locka,'' he 
faces five counts of possessing heroin or cocaine with the intent 
to distribute and one count of conspiracy to possess and 
distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	In another tape, Martin told Brownlee that the man -- Brownlee's  
attorney -- needed a retainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin: ``The man told me he need it by Monday, whatever ... I  
got no money in my account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin told Brownlee that he was waiting on a check that was  
supposed to be coming from the San Diego Chargers in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't got no money in my account,'' Martin told Brownlee on  
the tape again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, you got to have that money somewhere,'' Brownlee replied.  
</P>
<P>
	In another tape, Martin says he has no problem with it -- which  
Robarge said meant Martin would write a check for legal fees and 
receive the money from Brownlee as a swap. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-examination of Robarge will begin Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Fire Manager Phil Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Nearly eight years ago, Phil Garner and Sal  
Bando joined the Milwaukee Brewers together. It appears they will 
leave that way, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner was fired as the Brewers' manager Wednesday night and  
will be replaced by hitting coach Jim Lefebvre on an interim basis, 
The Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, general manager Bando will resign, the Milwaukee  
Journal Sentinel and WTMJ-TV reported Thursday, citing unidentified 
sources. Bando hired Garner, his former teammate, shortly after 
becoming the Brewers' GM in October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee is currently enduring its seventh straight losing  
season, falling to 52-60 after an 8-5 defeat by Colorado on 
Wednesday. The only manager to survive more consecutive losing 
campaigns than Garner is Connie Mack, who did it twice with the 
Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Cox of Atlanta, Cleveland's Mike Hargrove and Tom Kelly of  
Minnesota are the only managers who have been with their teams 
longer than Garner, who is both the winningest and losingest 
manager in Brewers history. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, the only member of Garner's staff with managing  
experience, was to be appointed interim manager today, a source 
familiar with the hiring told the AP on the condition of anonymity. 
Lefebvre, who managed the Seattle Mariners and the Chicago Cubs 
from 1989-93, was signed as manager only through the remainder of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who don't play today, start a road trip Friday at  
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, whose family controls the team,  
said he had no knowledge of any departures and referred questions 
to his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, who succeeded him as club 
president. Selig-Prieb, Bando and Garner could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre was hired as the Brewers' batting coach last August  
during a shakeup of the team's coaching staff. Lefebvre, Garner and 
the rest of Milwaukee's coaches are under contract only through the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that ended Wednesday  
with the loss to Colorado. Milwaukee reached .500 five times this 
season, but failed each time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner told reporters after Wednesday's game that he hadn't  
heard anything about being fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know a thing,'' he said. ``I just called my wife.  
There's nothing on our messages at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando signed a three-year contract extension last October  
despite the team's lack of improvement. Milwaukee was 92-70 during 
the pair's first year in 1992, but hasn't finished above .500 since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando's biggest free-agent gambles of the last offseason have  
been enormous busts. Pitcher Jim Abbott was ineffective and retired 
from baseball last month, while infielder Sean Berry is hitting 
.232 and has been benched for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre has ample experience managing mediocre clubs. He had a  
395-414 record as manager of the Seattle Mariners from 1989-91 and 
the Cubs the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Selig sent a letter to all teams saying he  
had to be notified of all managerial openings, that minorities must 
be considered before positions are filled and that he wanted an 
advance list of all candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner has managed more games than anyone in Brewers history,  
compiling a 563-617 record. He was hired in October 1991 with no 
previous managing experience, and was runner-up for the AL Manager 
of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Brewers haven't finished with a winning record since,  
and this season's promising start has given way to disappointment 
as the team began to slide in July. Milwaukee is 10-16 since the 
All-Star break and has fallen from third place to fifth in the NL 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the ballclub respects me,'' Garner said. ``I think the  
players have done very, very well under the speculation of what 
might happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garner had a 15-year playing career as an infielder for Oakland,  
Pittsburgh, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He retired in 
1988 and spent three years on Houston manager Art Howe's coaching 
staff before succeeding Tom Trebelhorn in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Given relatively little talent to use, he presided over nearly  
eight seasons of mediocrity in Milwaukee. However, with his 
outgoing personality and soft Texas drawl, Garner was a favorite 
among Brewers fans, and he was active in charity concerns off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner is still well-respected in baseball and likely will be a  
strong candidate for another managerial job next season. Bando 
co-owns a successful venture capital company in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando played 16 seasons with the Athletics and the Brewers as a  
third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Park, the Brewers' new stadium still under construction,  
was scheduled to open next spring, but a crane accident last month 
that killed three workers has put the opening date in doubt.

	Reno Affirms Gun Control Commitment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today renewed the  
Clinton administration's commitment to stiffer gun control, and 
then went further. ``I believe we must seriously explore the 
possibility of requiring the licensing of all handguns,'' she said. 
Her comments come after yesterday's shootings at a Jewish community 
center in Los Angeles. Buford O. Furrow, 37, has reportedly 
admitted wounding five and killing a postal worker in the attack. 
Meanwhile, President Clinton is expected to discuss the attack with 
a delegation of American Jewish leaders at the White House this 
afternoon.

	Big Crops Predicted Despite Drought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the heat and drought that have plagued  
parts of the country this summer, farmers will harvest bin-busting 
crops of corn, soybeans and rice, the Agriculture Department said 
today. The department said it expects a modest increase in prices 
for some commodities because of tightening world supplies or rising 
exports. The higher prices could save the government as much as $1 
billion in crop subsidies, but many farmers still wouldn't recover 
their cost of production.

	Russia Plans Push Against Rebels  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets and helicopters attacked  
Islamic rebels in southern Russia for a sixth day today, and a 
general said a ``massive operation'' would be launched soon. The 
Russian forces have been using their superior firepower to hammer 
away at the militants in the Caucasus Mountain region of Dagestan. 
But ground troops have been reluctant to fight the separatist 
rebels, who are holding several villages. Acting Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin, who was appointed to the job Monday, has promised 
swift action, saying the insurgents will be crushed within two 
weeks.

<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Seeking to avoid further escalation  
of tensions with India, Pakistan has increased border patrols with 
F-16 fighters to prevent Indian intrusions. Pakistani Foreign 
Minister Sartaj Aziz said today the aircraft were deployed at 
Pakistan's southern border with India. Meanwhile, the nuclear 
rivals remained on high alert after two days of air clashes. 
Tensions soared Tuesday when an Indian jet downed a Pakistani naval 
patrol plane. Pakistan responded the next day, firing a missile at 
Indian fighters and helicopters.

	Wiretapping Bill Approved in Japan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Parliament today gave Japanese police new powers to  
use wiretaps against organized crime. The vote gives Japanese 
police surveillance powers similar to those enjoyed by 
investigators in other countries. The provision is to take effect 
within a year. The wiretapping law is similar to those in other 
countries. But many Japanese, remembering secret police brutality 
during World War II and crackdowns on radical students and labor 
unions in the 1950s and 1960s, have long been reluctant to hand 
police greater powers.

	Japan Tries Cutting Smoking, Drinking  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese government panel today proposed a  
campaign to cut the nation's tobacco consumption in half by 2010, a 
Health Ministry official said. The plan is part of a 10-year 
national project to improve the nation's health, ministry official 
Hiroshi Saito said. The panel also said the recommended limit for 
individual alcohol consumption should be reduced to 5.4 ounces a 
day from 16.2 ounces. In Japan, heavy drinking is common and 35 
percent of the adult population smokes.

home. Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 
New York, checked out a house near Scarsdale that carries a $1.7 
million price tag and annual taxes of $25,000. She must move to the

<HEADLINE> North Korea Lashes Out at Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- North Korea on Thursday threatened to ``make  
Japan pay a high price'' for what it described as a century of 
hostilities, and repeated its insistence that it has the right to 
test-fire rockets at will. 
</P>
<P>
	Ri Gi-pom, a counselor at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing,  
said North Korea wants Japan to apologize and make reparations for 
colonizing Korea early this century and killing about 1 million 
people, enslaving millions more and forcing 200,000 Korean women to 
work as sex slaves for the military. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea also blames Japan for backing the United States and  
rival South Korea during the 1950-1953 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	If Japan does not make amends, North Korea will retaliate,  
``make Japan pay a high price for the bloodshed'' and ``give vent 
to its century-old wrath,'' Ri said, reading a government statement 
timed in advance of North Korea's national day on Sunday. The 
holiday marks Korea's liberation from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ri declined to specify what kind of retaliation he meant.  
</P>
<P>
	He also said North Korea planned to launch a rocket as ``a  
matter of sovereignty'' and ``when it is necessary.'' He would not 
elaborate or pinpoint a date. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea is reportedly preparing to test-fire a new  
long-range missile with the capacity to reach Alaska or Hawaii. The 
United States, Japan and South Korea have told the North to call 
off the firing or face economic and diplomatic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between North Korea and Japan have deteriorated since  
North Korea sent a rocket sailing over Japan and into the Pacific 
Ocean a year ago. The test demonstrated that Japan is well within 
reach of North Korean missiles.

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Oakland Athletics are the best home team in baseball this  
season -- except, of course, when they play the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees beat the Athletics 5-3 at Oakland on Wednesday  
night. It marked the second time this season that the Yankees won 
two of three at the A's stadium, where Oakland is a major 
league-best 41-19. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the Yankees won with the help of a three-run homer in  
the seventh and a key single in the ninth by Bernie Williams, who 
has 20 RBIs in his last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was too much Bernie Williams for us. That three-run  
homer was what really hurt us, and he also came through in the 
ninth,'' A's manager Art Howe said. ``It was a heck of a game, but 
the wrong team won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other AL games, it was Boston 9, Kansas City 3; Seattle 11,  
Chicago 2; Baltimore 4, Tampa Bay 2; Toronto 6, Minnesota 3; Texas 
8, Detroit 2; and Cleveland 4, California 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' homer in the seventh helped the Yankees wipe out a 2-0  
deficit. After Oakland tied the score in the bottom of the inning 
on a wild pitch by Alan Watson, New York won it with a two-run 
ninth highlighted by Tino Martinez's tie-breaking RBI single of the 
right-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's single off Doug Jones (3-4) came after Williams  
singled and Chili Davis walked. Ricky Ledee followed Martinez's 
decisive hit with a run-scoring double as the Yankees improved 
their road record to 34-22, second-best in the AL behind 
Cleveland's 35-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson (2-1) got four outs for the victory. Mariano Rivera  
pitched the ninth for his 32nd save as the Yankees won for the 
seventh time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi had a sacrifice fly in the first and Ben Grieve hit  
his 19th homer for the A's in the second as Oakland took a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Red Sox 9, Royals 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Bret Saberhagen, back in the ballpark where he won two Cy Young  
Awards, allowed four hits in eight innings to lead Boston to 
victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen (9-4) struck out three and didn't walk a batter for  
the 10th time in 17 starts. Saberhagen, 110-78 for the Royals from 
1984-91, gave up a solo home run in the second to Mike Sweeney, who 
extended his hitting streak to 23 games, and another solo homer in 
the eighth to Tim Spehr. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Huskey and Mike Stanley homered for the Red Sox. Jose  
Rosado (7-9) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Mariners 11, White Sox 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, Alex Rodriguez homered and drove in five runs as the  
Mariners beat Chicago for a three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who went 3-for-4, has 28 homers, all since he was  
activated from the disabled list May 14. He hit an RBI single in 
the first, a two-run single in the fourth and a two-run homer in 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgar Martinez and Raul Ibanez hit also hit two-run homers for  
Seattle, which handed Chicago its seventh straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners starter Paul Abbott (3-0) allowed two runs and three  
hits in five innings. Jaime Navarro (7-10) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Orioles 4, Devil Rays 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Mike Mussina stopped his three-game losing streak and B.J.  
Surhoff and Albert Belle hit consecutive homers as Baltimore won at 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina (14-7) rebounded from losing three consecutive starts  
for the first time in his career. Mussina gave up two runs and nine 
hits in 7 2-3 innings, striking out seven and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
	Surhoff and Belle hit solo homers in the fifth inning. Tampa Bay  
starter Rolando Arrojo (2-8) went six innings, allowing three runs 
and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Blue Jays 6, Twins 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carpenter pitched a complete game for his sixth straight  
win, and Carlos Delgado hit his 35th homer as Toronto won at 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter (9-5) allowed only six singles and a two-run homer in  
the ninth inning. The right-hander struck out a season-high nine 
and walked none for his fourth complete game of the season and 
sixth of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter hasn't lost in 10 starts since May 28, when he was  
beaten 10-6 by the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Milton (4-9) took the loss despite striking out a  
career-high 12. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Rangers 8, Tigers 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Rick Helling pitched a six-hitter for his second complete game  
of the season and Tom Goodwin drove in three runs as Texas beat 
visiting Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling (9-7) won his third straight decision, striking out  
eight and walking two in the seventh complete game of his career. 
Texas is 20-6 since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro and Roberto Kelly homered for the Rangers, who  
have won four straight against the Tigers and are 22-5 against the 
AL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Blair (1-9), making his first start since May 26  
following 19 straight relief appearances, allowed seven runs and 
nine hits in 5 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Indians 4, Angels 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Manny Ramirez hit his 30th homer and Roberto Alomar added his  
20th as Cleveland won at Anaheim to complete a three-game sweep and 
send the Angels to their sixth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, who hit 45 homers last year, connected off Lou Pote in  
the eighth for his second homer in two nights and raised his major 
league-leading RBIs total to 116. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Burba (9-7) allowed one run and seven hits in six innings.  
Steve Sparks (5-9) lost for the fifth time in his last six

<HEADLINE> Gore Wants Tougher Hate Crime Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called for both  
tougher hate crime laws and new gun controls Thursday in the wake 
of a deadly shooting at a Jewish center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also issued a veiled message ``to all those who would seek  
to lead this nation,'' a slap at a GOP presidential field where 
candidates have generally resisted the measures he pushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really amazes me how some people can pretend that hate  
crimes are not different from all other crimes,'' said Gore. ``Hate 
crimes wound all of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his proposals ``would help prevent these tragedies from  
happening in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came as Buford O. Furrow Jr. was charged in the  
latest deadly shooting episode. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all the painful gun violence we have seen in America, I  
say to all those who would seek to lead this nation `stop trying to 
pass special protections for the gun manufacturers.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not spell out details of his hate crime or gun  
proposals. But on the gun issue, he said he wants to make it harder 
for felons and children to obtain guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments came during a speech in which Gore fleshed out  
education proposals he said would be central to his campaign for 
the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans criticized Gore for referring to the community  
center shooting in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's truly sad to see the vice president use this horrible act  
of violence in a cynical attempt to help his struggling campaign,'' 
said Mike Collins, spokesman for the Republican National Committee. 
</P>

	In his package. Gore said he would offer incentives to states  
which raise the compulsory education age to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``As president I will urge every state in America to require  
students to stay in school until the age of 18 or until they 
graduate from high school,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Gore's plan would provide grants and other incentives  
for states which put in place dropout prevention programs that have 
an impact on keeping youngsters in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more the opportunity gap in America has become an  
education gap,'' said Gore. He placed no pricetag on the proposal, 
which was part of a larger education package he unveiled during a 
campaign swing through Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for tax credits of up to $6,000 per worker for  
companies which put in place worker retraining programs, doubling 
the current level.

<HEADLINE> Priest Promoted Despite Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest was promoted to  
church pastor weeks after church officials learned he had fathered 
a child with a married woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The priest, the Rev. Joseph Gallenstein, has since received a  
three-month leave of absence at his own request. A statement issued 
by the Diocese of Covington said Gallenstein intends to remain a 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Tom Sacksteder, a diocesan spokesman, said Gallenstein,  
who is in his early 40s, will work in the diocese when he returns 
but said he did not know where. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacksteder said the diocese had no comment on why it allowed  
Gallenstein to become pastor after it learned he had fathered a 
child. Catholic priests are required to be celibate. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not a matter for the press. It is an internal matter  
for the church,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diocesan officials learned in late March or early April that  
Gallenstein had fathered the child, the diocese said. It did not 
release any information about the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallenstein acknowledged his paternity and addressed the  
personal and spiritual issues involved, according to the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallenstein, whose leave of absence began July 26, was an  
associate pastor at St. Paul Church in Florence since June 1995 
before he was elevated to pastor last month. He was ordained in May 
1990.

<HEADLINE> Norway May Sell Part of Statoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The Norwegian state-owned oil company  
Statoil's board is expected to recommend a partial privatization of 
the company in a report to be delivered Friday to Oil Minister Anne 
Enger Lahnstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The board met last week to discuss its views on the future  
structure of the Norwegian oil industry. But board chairman Ole 
Lund would not disclose the report's conclusions until it has been 
passed to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In February the Norwegian parliament is slated to come to a  
decision regarding the future of the country's oil and gas 
industry, based on a white paper from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian media say a recommendation of partial privatization of  
Statoil appears to be likely, noting that chief executive Harald 
Norvik has expressed support for reducing the state's ownership, as 
have some members of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is also expected to review the different forms that a  
commercialization of SDOE, which controls the Norwegian state's 
offshore oil and gas interests, could take, as well as the 
possibility of merging SDOE and Statoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a merger would create one of the world's largest oil  
groups, valued at somewhere between 500 billion and 600 billion 
kroner ($6.5 billion to $7.8 billion), with oil and gas reserves 
amounting to 17 billion barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	The three groups that are larger are Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco and  
Royal Dutch Shell, each controlling 20 billion barrels of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the oil ministry, Sissel Edvardsen, confirmed  
last week that the government is considering a possible merger of 
Statoil and SDOE, but she stressed that such a move is only one of 
several options being studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Other alternatives include transferring parts of SDOE to other  
companies, such as state-controlled Norsk Hydro, which recently 
acquired part of privately-owned Saga Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
	SDOE was created by the government in the 1980's to fend off a  
potentially overwhelming Statoil dominance in the Norwegian economy 
and on the continental shelf. SDOE owns 40 percent of Norway's 
petroleum reserves, and is managed by Statoil on the government's 
behalf.

<HEADLINE> CNN, CNBC Battle on Floor of NYSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange is the latest  
surrogate battleground for the feuding business news teams at CNN 
and CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after CNN announced it would produce a daily show  
from Wall Street's epicenter, CNBC said it would do the same thing 
-- and was getting there first. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC's ``Business Center'' will uproot from its New Jersey  
studio starting Monday for a new desk at the stock exchange. The 
6:30 p.m. financial wrap-up show, starting 2 1/2 hours after the 
exchange shuts down for the day, competes with CNN's higher-rated 
``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go to the source of what we're reporting on for the  
final word of the day,'' said Bill Bolster, CNBC president. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime this fall, CNN will premiere ``Street Sweep,'' a new  
business show broadcast from the stock exchange daily starting at 
3:59 p.m. ET, or one minute before the closing bell for trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moneyline'' will continue to be broadcast from its New York  
studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition between the two networks has been particularly  
intense this summer. While CNBC is the leading business network, 
``Moneyline'' consistently outrates ``Business Center'' and is 
extraordinarly attractive to advertisers. CNBC expanded ``Business 
Center'' to an hour after popular ``Moneyline'' host Lou Dobbs quit 
and cut into its rival's audience, but CNN has kept in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange first allowed live TV reports from  
the trading floor in 1995, requiring networks to use robotic 
cameras to minimize congestion. Twenty-two television stations are 
accredited to report there, said Robert Zito, stock exchange 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the exchange is making space for desks so CNN and CNBC can  
deliver full shows there, although ongoing live shows won't be 
allowed during the midst of trading. The networks will pay a 
nominal production fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we want to do is tell them to go away,'' Zito  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are reports CNBC is spending more than $1 million to  
quickly make the ``Business Center'' shift. Bolster said he 
wouldn't dispute the figure, but didn't know the exact amount. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC wasn't necessarily racing to be first on the floor, but was  
watching its competitor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had always been our strategic plan,'' Bolster said. ``When  
Lou Dobbs left, we saw that opportunity and we just accelerated the 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN believes ``Street Sweep'' will be able to take better  
advantage of its location because more people will be at the stock 
exchange as the bell sounds. It's better than being there a few 
hours later ``when the janitors are sweeping up,'' said Steve Korn, 
vice chairman of the CNN News Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're at the head of the pack and leading the  
race,'' Korn said. ``We're not looking behind us. We're looking 
ahead.''

<HEADLINE> China Accuses Falun Gong Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's state media stepped up attacks on the  
founder of a banned meditation group Thursday, accusing him of 
planning and directing a large protest outside the Chinese 
leadership's Beijing headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a possible sign that authorities may put other group leaders  
on trial, state-run television also singled out several Falun Gong 
organizers for their involvement in the silent, daylong protest by 
more than 10,000 followers seeking legal recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Hongzhi, the group's New York-based founder, has denied  
organizing the April protest. China has issued an arrest warrant 
for him, although the United States has said it will not extradite 
Li because the two countries have no extradition treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	State television, in a lengthy expose in its nationwide evening  
news show, described the April protest as the ``most serious 
political incident'' to hit China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square 
pro-democracy protests that the government crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was designed ``to put pressure on the party and the  
government and try to disrupt the whole nation,'' the television 
report said. ``Li Hongzhi was the planner and commander,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also named and showed other leading members of the  
group. Although it did not say whether charges were being 
considered, it said sect organizers held meetings to plan the 
protest and carried out Li's directives. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those named was Ji Liewu, who ``took part in planning,  
organizing, and directing the whole process,'' the report said. 
Also frequently mentioned were Wang Zhiwen and Li Chang, who are 
believed to be under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong draws from Buddhism, Taoism and qigong, a traditional  
martial arts and health practice. Many of its followers are 
middle-aged or older people, including some Communist officials and 
their family members.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 1.59  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were held to a minuscule gain  
today and broader indicators retreated. A surge in interest rates 
following a disappointing Treasury bond auction deflated a bid to 
extend yesterday's broad stock market rally. The Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 1.59 at 10,789.39. The Dow rose as much 
as 113 points earlier. Broader indicators gave up early gains to 
finish lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.77 to 1,298.16 and 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 15.49 to 2,549.49.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Financial figures at the close Thursday:  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans snapped up cars and light trucks  
last month at a brisk clip that helped push overall retail sales up 
by a bigger-than-expected 0.7 percent. The Commerce Department 
reported today that total retail sales, which represent about a 
third of the nation's economic output, rose last month to a 
seasonally adjusted $248.7 billion. Sales were 9.1 percent higher 
than July of last year. Many economists continue to believe the 
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again on Aug. 24, to keep 
the economy from overheating and hold inflation under control. The 
Fed nudged interest rates a quarter of a point on June 30. 

</P>
<P>
	Big Crops Projected Despite Drought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While farmers' fields parch in the East, much  
of America's heartland has had sufficient rain and that means 
bumper crops and little help for depressed commodity prices. This 
year's soybean crop is shaping up to be the biggest on record, and 
the corn harvest would be the third largest, the Agriculture 
Department reported Wednesday. Big crops of cotton and rice are 
expected across the South. Because of tighter world supplies and 
improved exports, USDA expects a modest increase in prices for some 
commodities -- 20 cents a bushel for soybeans and 5 cents a bushel 
for corn -- from what was forecast a month ago.

	BET Launches Web Site for Blacks  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of the leading black cable TV network  
is launching an ambitious Web site aimed at luring more black 
Americans online, a move to narrow the ``digital divide'' that has 
left use of the Internet among blacks well below whites. BET.com, 
which will be launched in November by BET Holdings, is getting $35 
million in backing from Microsoft Corp. and three major media 
companies, as well as cooperation from the NAACP and the United 
Negro College Fund. BET Holdings will control a majority of the new 
venture, and the rest will be held by Microsoft, Rupert Murdoch's 
News Corp., USA Networks Inc., and AT&AMP;T's Liberty Media Corp.

	Military Engine Plant Leaving Fla.

<P>
	EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Jet engine maker Pratt &AMP; Whitney  
will move its military engine operations from Florida to 
Connecticut and relocate other operations, cutting about 1,500 
jobs. In addition to moving the military business from West Palm 
Beach, Fla., to its headquarters here, Pratt, a subsidiary of 
United Technologies Corp., said today that it would move its 
manufacturing operation from North Haven, Conn., to the East 
Hartford plant. Pratt has been hit hard by the decline in demand 
for its military engines, including powerplants for the F-15 and 
F-16 fighters.''

	Liberty Mutual To Cut 1,500 Jobs

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Liberty Mutual Group plans to cut 1,500 jobs and  
reduce expenses by more than $150 million by the first quarter in 
2000 as it realigns its commercial insurance operation. Liberty 
Mutual president and chief executive officer Edmund F. Kelly blamed 
the cuts on industrywide stagnation. The reorganization will create 
a single account business unit from the Wausau Insurance Companies, 
which Liberty owns, and Liberty Mutual.

	Vanguard Founder To Retire in Dec.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John C. Bogle, the public face of the nation's  
second-largest family of U.S. mutual funds, will resign by year's 
end from the board of Vanguard Group. Vanguard said today that its 
founder must step down under a policy that requires board members 
to resign in December of the year in which they reach 70. Bogle 
turned 70 in May. Vanguard dismissed the contention that 
controversy surrounds Bogle's retirement. Vanguard spokesman John 
Demming said Vanguard has a ``long-standing policy'' established by 
the board regarding the retirement policies of its board members.

	BOT Closes Early on Power Outage  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade closed an hour early  
today after a power outage affecting the downtown Loop area 
threatened to expand. CBOT chief executive officer Thomas R. 
Donovan made the decision to close the markets at 2 p.m. after 
speaking to Commonwealth Edison CEO John Rowe, a CBOT spokesman 
said. The problems were blamed on the failures of two power 
transmission cables, which left 2,300 customers in the heart of 
downtown Chicago in the dark. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
remained open.

	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese government panel today proposed a  
campaign to cut the nation's tobacco consumption in half by 2010, a 
Health Ministry official said. The Council on Public Health 
unveiled the plan as part of a 10-year national project to improve 
the nation's health, dubbed ``Healthy Japan 21,'' ministry official 
Hiroshi Saito said. The ministry will begin implementing the 
project next year, and the council currently is setting numerical 
goals in nine categories, including tobacco and alcohol.

	Code Cracker Worries Cryptographers  
</P>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- A developer of one of the most  
widespread computer encryption systems said today he has designed a 
computer that could crack open a file encoded using the most common 
form of data encryption in only a few days. If built -- at a cost of 
about $2 million -- such a computer could jeopardize the privacy of 
the bulk of electronic commerce as practiced today, according to 
cryptographers at the conference where the design was shown. Most 
highly sensitive military and banking data are protected by 
stronger encryption keys beyond its reach. The commonly used weaker 
keys, though, would become ``easy to break for large 
organizations,'' said cryptographer Adi Shamir of the Weizmann 
Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.

<HEADLINE> Groups Seek To Oust Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With his long thinning hair, faded  
T-shirt and jeans, Bogoljub Arsenijevic is a remnant of the 
flower-power generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Serb, until recently an unknown fresco painter,  
is spearheading an unprecedented effort to topple President 
Slobodan Milosevic through violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an illusion that we can get rid of him without  
violence,'' said Arsenijevic, who led about 200 followers last 
month in a rock-throwing charge on a government building in the 
town of Valjevo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic has left a bloody trail throughout his 10 years in  
power. And in blood he will leave,'' Arsenijevic said, speaking 
from a hide-out where he has holed up to try to elude arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Arsenijevic and his supporters were beaten back within hours of  
their July 12 attempt to seize control of Valjevo's Town Hall. But 
their action has sparked a rethinking of the peaceful, and so far 
unsuccessful, struggle by opposition parties to end Milosevic's 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opposition parties have been trying to unseat Milosevic for  
years. And look where we are now,'' Arsenijevic said. ``The past 
decade has been the darkest in Serbian history ... and he is still 
in power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mainstream opposition parties have organized daily protest  
rallies throughout Serbia, drawing enthusiastic crowds that vary 
from several hundred to several thousand supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But in at least four larger towns, informal action groups have  
brought thousands of angry, ordinary Serbs into the streets to 
voice their dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack in Valjevo was preceded by a leaflet campaign in  
which Arsenijevic urged people to gather for a protest in the city 
center. About 10,000 showed up and, at his urging, several hundred 
grabbed rocks and sticks for the attack on Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	They were quickly pushed back by security forces and Arsenijevic  
went into hiding. But hundreds continue to gather each evening in 
Valjevo to protest the Milosevic regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southern town of Leskovac, thousands of demonstrators  
responded to the call of a local TV station technician, who 
interrupted programming last month to urge protests against an 
allegedly corrupt local governor. Since then, demonstrations have 
been held there for 34 consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, heroes of our political whirlwind are no  
longer charismatic party leaders but ordinary people, almost 
outsiders ... until recently totally anonymous,'' a commentary in 
the respected NIN weekly said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Vesna Pesic, a leader of the main opposition parties' coalition,  
Alliance for Change, acknowledged the new phenomenon, but warned 
that only an ``organized push'' like the current peaceful protests 
by the mainstream opposition can unseat Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have to realize that elections are the only decent way  
out of this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elections are not due before 2001 and Milosevic has shown no  
sign of stepping down or agreeing to an early ballot as his 
opponents demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In all presidential and parliamentary elections since 1990 --  
when the formerly communist country reintroduced a multiparty 
system -- Milosevic has managed to outwit his rivals, mainly by 
controlling the dominant state-run media or, as some critics and 
independent observers maintain, by vote-rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, several opposition parties joined forces and won  
municipal elections in nearly all Serbian cities. Milosevic 
annulled the results, triggering months of intense protests, which 
eventually forced him to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposition later weakened because of rivalries among its  
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The memories of brutal police beatings of anti-Milosevic  
protesters, nearly three years ago, are still fresh. The worst 
clashes were in Belgrade, where Milosevic sent heavy reinforcements 
to crush the dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Arsenijevic mused, protests should ``escalate  
evenly'' throughout the country, ``maybe all in single day in order 
to stretch thin (Milosevic's) forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this may sound like a dream, but when I called for the  
protest in rally in Valjevo, many people told me it was impossible. 
Then thousands showed up,'' he said. ``Rebellion in Serbia has 
started.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls finally made their long-awaited  
first move of the offseason Thursday, sending Brent Barry to the 
Seattle SuperSonics for guards James Cotton and Hersey Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat curious move on the part of the Bulls, who  
signed Barry to a six-year, $27 million contract last January as 
one of the first pieces of their rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brent did a fine job for us, but we felt we needed a veteran  
like Hersey to work with our younger guys,'' general manager Jerry 
Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, 6-foot-6 and 27 years old, averaged 11.1 points, 3.9  
rebounds and 3.1 assists in 37 games last season. He is the second 
shooting guard picked up by the Sonics in recent days, joining free 
agent acquisition Vernon Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle remains in the market for a small forward to replace the  
departed Detlef Schrempf, who signed with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to trade Hersey we needed to receive someone very  
special in return,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We think 
Brent's athleticism, versatility and youth will fit perfectly with 
the new direction of our team. We hate to see Hersey and James go, 
but this opportunity was too good to pass up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, 32, is an 11-year veteran who had been with the Sonics  
for four seasons. He lost his starting spot last season and had 
career-low averages of 10.3 points and 2.5 assists. It was no 
secret in recent weeks that the Sonics were trying to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton, 23, played just 10 games last season because of a  
strained hamstring and averaged 2.5 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen a whole lot of him, but we've liked what we  
have seen,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, a Chicago native who attended Bradley Univerity in  
Peoria, Ill. and led the nation in scoring his senior season, has 
two years remaining on a contract that will pay him nearly $4.2 
million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls still have as much as $18 million in salary cap room,  
although Krause seems determined to save much of it for next summer 
when Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Latrell Sprewell are among the 
possible free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago was rebuffed in its attempt to sign Portland free agent  
Jermaine O'Neal, and Krause said there are few, if any, players 
left on the market who fit his team's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously what we're doing, it's a situation where we'll be  
looking to do things down the road,'' Krause said. ``We had 
interest and talked to a few players, and we're still talking. But 
we feel that with the way our club is developing, there aren't many 
players we feel like committing to long-term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry was Chicago's third-leading scorer last season behind Toni  
Kukoc and Ron Harper. Kukoc is entering the final year of his 
contract, while Harper is a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Challenges Gore on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
challenged Vice President Al Gore Thursday to clarify his position 
on federally funding abortions for poor women in light of 
conflicting statements by Gore's staff this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is time for him to answer what his position is,''  
Bradley said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press. 
``On this issue in particular you've got to say what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane tried to clarify Gore's position  
when asked Thursday about the vice president's position on federal 
funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehane said Gore's position has been to support the current  
federal law -- ``federal funding of abortion in situations involving 
incest, rape and when the life of the mother is endangered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was later asked if Gore favored Medicaid funding for poor  
women's abortions without the restrictions in the current law. 
``The vice president supports federal funding for abortions, 
period,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley campaign, however, released a series of statements  
by Gore, both as a congressman and senator, showing he was opposed 
to federal funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have consistently opposed federal funding of abortion,''  
Gore said in a newspaper story in 1984. ``I believe the government 
should not participate in the taking of what is arguably a human 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Gore's change of positions since he was in Congress -- as  
Bradley's campaign alleged -- Lehane said that the important issue 
is only his current position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue shouldn't be what his position was a decade ago,''  
Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates say Gore has shifted to favoring no restrictions on  
federal funding for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed the issue himself at a campaign stop in Iowa, but  
without giving any details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support federal funding, if that's what you're asking,''  
Gore said in response to a question shouted by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley challenge was prompted by a story in Sunday's Des  
Moines Register in which a Gore spokesman said the vice president 
was against federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, 
incest, or the need to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Roger Salazar retracted that statement Thursday and  
said he had inaccurately depicted Gore's position, and that the 
vice president opposes restrictions on abortion funding. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides say President Clinton, during the 1992  
campaign, said he would not veto any bill that allowed for the 
Medicaid funding of abortions, and they said he has not addressed 
that exact question since. 
</P>
<P>
	National Abortion Rights Action League president Kate Michelman  
said Gore's position on federal funding for abortion has 
``evolved'' over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that she is confident that Gore's position mirrors  
her group's, and that he is in favor of Medicaid funding for poor 
women's abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence that the Vice President does support  
Medicaid funding for abortion for poor women,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelman said regardless of differences between the two  
Democrats, they are still far better choices than any of the 
Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue here,'' Michelman said, ``is that Gore and Bradley  
both would protect the right of a woman to choose.''

	Today is Friday, Aug. 13, the 225th day of 1999. There are 140  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	One hundred years ago, on Aug. 13, 1899, movie director Alfred  
Hitchcock was born in London. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1521, Spanish conqueror Hernando Cortez captured present-day  
Mexico City from the Aztec Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1624, French King Louis XIII named Cardinal Richelieu his  
first minister. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1704, the Battle of Blenheim was fought during the War of the  
Spanish Succession, resulting in a victory for English and Austrian 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1846, the American flag was raised for the first time in Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1932, Adolf Hitler rejected the post of vice chancellor of  
Germany, saying he was prepared to hold out ``for all or nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, the satirical comic strip ``Li'l Abner,'' created by Al  
Capp, made its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Walt Disney's animated feature ``Bambi'' premiered at  
Radio City Music Hall in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, the first two-way telephone conversation by satellite  
took place with the help of Echo One. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Berlin was divided when East Germany sealed off the  
border between the city's eastern and western sectors to stem the 
flight of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, baseball Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle died at a Dallas  
hospital of liver cancer; he was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The space shuttle Columbia returned from a secret  
military mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: In his weekly radio address, President Clinton  
put Congress on notice that he wouldn't give up an assault weapons 
ban as the price to revive a crime bill stalled on Capitol Hill. 
NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner died at age 59. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: President Clinton led the nation in mourning 12  
Americans killed in a pair of U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. 
Standing before black hearses carrying 10 of the bodies, the 
president pledged to seek justice ``for these evil acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Television evangelist Rex Humbard is 80.  
Cuban President Fidel Castro is 73. Actor Pat Harrington is 70. 
Singer Don Ho is 69. Former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders is 
66. Blues singer-musician Son Seals is 57. Actor Kevin Tighe is 55. 
Actress Gretchen Corbett is 52. Opera singer Kathleen Battle is 51. 
Singer Dan Fogelberg is 48. Actor Danny Bonaduce is 40. Actress 
Quinn Cummings is 32. Country singer Andy Griggs is 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Thought for Today: ``A woman, I always say, should be like a  
good suspense movie: The more left to the imagination, the more 
excitement there is. This should be her aim -- to create suspense, 
to let a man discover things about her without her having to tell 
him.'' -- Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980).

	L.A. Suspect May Face Death Penalty  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white supremacist charged with shooting  
five people at a Jewish community center told investigators he also 
killed a Filipino-American postal worker because he was not white 
and worked for the federal government, a prosecutor said today. The 
account, based on an alleged confession by Buford O. Furrow Jr., 
came after Los Angeles County prosecutors charged him with murder 
and five counts of attempted murder -- all filed as hate crimes. 
Federal prosecutors already had charged Furrow in the postman's 
slaying. The murder charges could bring the death penalty.

	Power Outage Hits Downtown Chicago  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Confusion descended on downtown today when a  
series of mechanical problems darkened hundreds of office 
buildings, snarled traffic and skidded the Chicago Board of Trade 
to a halt. Thousands of commuters left early for the day when power 
was lost, pushing the rush hour forward by hours. Police struggled 
to keep cars moving through darkened intersections. Extra buses 
were called in to handle the crush and generators were set up in 
Union Station, which handles Amtrak and suburban commuter trains. 

</P>
<P>
	Nuke Spy Case Discipline Sought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, citing a  
``total breakdown in the system,'' today recommended disciplinary 
action against a senior official and two other employees of the Los 
Alamos nuclear laboratory because of failures in the China 
espionage investigation. An internal investigation found ``systemic 
problems in the Energy Department's management of 
counterintelligence matters.'' But no action was taken against any 
department headquarters officials. Nor were any former senior DOE 
officials singled out by name for criticism. 

</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin Vows To End Islamic Uprising  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin, facing criticism that  
Russia hasn't acted quickly enough to quash an Islamic rebellion in 
the south, promised Thursday that the militants would be wiped out 
steadily but ``without haste.'' Yeltsin's acting prime minister, 
Vladimir Putin, was chastised by members of Russia's upper house of 
parliament, who said Russia should act more resolutely to stamp out 
the rebels who invaded several villages in the Caucasus region of 
Dagestan last week. 

</P>
<P>
	Ex-Army Chief Criticizes Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia has reached ``a virtual  
dead end'' under President Slobodan Milosevic, his former army 
chief said Thursday and pledged to work to oust him. The former 
army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, was sacked by Milosevic last 
November after he opposed the president's defiant policies toward 
the West. Perisic said he is forming the Movement for Democratic 
Serbia, whose prime goal would be to remove Milosevic. Showing no 
sign he's willing to step down peacefully, Milosevic tightened his 
ranks by reshuffling his government and naming several 
ultranationalists as Cabinet ministers. 

</P>
<P>
	Barak Seeks To Speed Up Peacemaking  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak made a new  
pitch Thursday for speeding up peacemaking with the Palestinians, 
telling Secretary of State Madeleine Albright through an envoy that 
haggling over interim measures wasted time. Precious time would be 
spent better by opening negotiations on a final settlement, Barak 
said through Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, the envoy told Israeli 
reporters afterward. 

</P>
<P>
	`Spanish-Only' in Texas Town  
</P>
<P>
	EL CENIZO, Texas (AP) -- A community on the Mexican border has  
declared itself a ``safe haven'' for undocumented immigrants and 
passed an ordinance making Spanish the town's official language. 
Any city worker who helps the U.S. Border Patrol uncover 
undocumented immigrants will be fired, Mayor Rafael Rodriguez said. 
El Cenizo, incorporated in 1989, is an impoverished town with a 
high population of first-generation immigrants, both documented and 
undocumented. It sits alongside the Rio Grande about 10 miles south 
of Laredo.

Nikkei Stock Average shed 91.80 points to 17,332.17 in early 
trading. On Wall Street, the Dow gained 1.59 points to 10,789.39 at 
Thursday's close.

	Tigers Defeat Rangers 3-1  
</P>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Aaron Sele struck out a career-high 13,  
the most by a Rangers pitcher in seven years, but Tony Clark 
homered as the Detroit Tigers beat Texas 3-1 tonight. Dave Mlicki 
(7-10) allowed four hits in 5 2-3 innings. He helped Detroit end 
its five-game losing streak against Texas. Reliever Francisco 
Cordero struck out four straight Rangers in the sixth and seventh, 
and Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his 18th save.

</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini said  
this morning that 79 were injured yesterday when a tornado tore 
through the heart of the city. About a dozen were in serious to 
critical condition, she said. ``It's been a tragedy for us, but 
we've been very, very lucky -- it could have been much worse,'' the 
mayor said. Corradini said crews had worked through the night

	Shooting Suspect Had Neo-Nazi Ties  
</P>
<P>
	NISQUALLY, Wash. (AP) -- People in this rural area outside  
Olympia where Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. grew up describe him as a 
bespectacled, beefy kid who was teased about his allergies. 
Authorities say the overweight kid grew up to become an overwrought 
adult who once predicted a deadly outburst. Furrow turned himself

	Japan OKs New Wiretapping Bill  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Parliament today gave Japanese police new powers to  
use wiretaps against organized crime. The vote gives Japanese 
police surveillance powers similar to those enjoyed by 
investigators in other countries. The provision is to take effect 
within a year. The wiretapping law is similar to those in other 
countries. But many Japanese, remembering secret police brutality 
during World War II and crackdowns on radical students and labor 
unions in the 1950s and 1960s, have long been reluctant to hand 
police greater powers.

	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese government panel today proposed a

Health Ministry official said. The plan is part of a 10-year 
national project to improve the nation's health, ministry official 
Hiroshi Saito said. The panel also said the recommended limit for 
individual alcohol consumption should be reduced to 5.4 ounces a 
day from 16.2 ounces. In Japan, heavy drinking is common and 35 
percent of the adult population smokes.

	VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Weeping friends and relatives  
today reburied dozens of men, women and children killed and dumped 
in mass graves during the Serb crackdown on Kosovo Albanians. This 
southwestern Kosovo village was an apparent target of revenge 
killings and other atrocities as the Serb campaign against Kosovo's 
Albanians peaked earlier this year. Human rights investigators 
believe about 10,000 ethnic Albanians died in the crackdown, which 
ended after the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia led President 
Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces from the province and let 
in NATO-led peacekeepers.

murder and attempted murder in the killing of a postal worker and 
the shooting at a Jewish community center Tuesday near Los Angeles. 
Furrow told the FBI that he killed a Filipino-American postal

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying Australian rocks have

``This age should provide a new calibration point for molecular 
clocks and the universal tree of life,'' researcher Jochen J. 
Brocks and his fellow Australian researchers report tomorrow in the

Archean era, the period from the beginning of Earth to about 2.5

apparent first draft of his prison memoir released today. The 127 
handwritten pages, with the heading ``My Memoirs,'' were discovered

victims of slave labor to sue multinational corporations in state 
courts. ``I want them to apologize. I want them to say to the 
world, 'We're sorry for what we did,''' said Tenney, a retired

<HEADLINE> Rockies Pitcher Astacio Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado Rockies pitcher Pedro  
Astacio was arrested Thursday when he turned himself in to police 
following an alleged altercation with his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio, acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 18, 1997,  
for infielder Eric Young, faced charges of third-degree assault and 
domestic violence, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Joe Carns said a 911 call came in at 10:57 p.m.  
Wednesday. A woman said her estranged husband had been arguing with 
her and she advised him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said he struck her in the face,'' Carns said.  
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, later identified as Astacio, had left his suburban  
house by the time officers arrived, but turned himself in about 4 
p.m. Thursday. He was taken to the Arapahoe County Jail for booking 
and to arrange bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the case would be handled by the county  
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies had no formal statement on the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	Astacio is 12-9 with a 4.88 ERA and leads the team in victories.  
He ranks fourth in the NL with 149 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio pitched the entire 1998 season in the Rockies rotation  
without missing an assignment, and set a personal best with 34 
starts and topped 200 innings for the third straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ninth in the NL with a career-best and club-record 170  
strikeouts and became one of only three pitchers in Rockies history 
to win 13 games in a season.

<HEADLINE> Report: Inmates Use Phones for Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A significant number of federal inmates use  
prison telephones to arrange murders, traffic in drugs or commit 
fraud, and the Bureau of Prisons has failed to curb the abuse, an 
inspector general concluded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inmate abuse of prison telephones appears to be widespread,''  
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich concluded. 
Despite learning of the problem in 1976, the Bureau of Prisons 
``has taken only limited and insufficient corrective efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We found various cases in which inmates retained full  
telephone privileges even after they were convicted of a crime 
involving the use of prison telephones,'' Bromwich's report said, 
adding that the Bureau of Prisons must ``take immediate and 
meaningful actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich proposed limiting telephone privileges for all inmates,  
having guards monitor more calls and imposing harsher discipline on 
abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau of Prisons spokesman Todd Craig said the report had  
``some good suggestions'' that are being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we have taken steps to address problems, and a majority of  
inmates do not abuse the system,'' he said. Federal prisons allow 
calls to ``help inmates maintain family ties so they have a job and 
a home when they get out and don't have to return to crime,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone privileges have expanded dramatically since the 1970s  
when inmates were permitted only one call every three months and it 
was placed by guards. Now most federal inmates can make as many 
calls as they can pay for or get outsiders to accept charges for. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of U.S. attorneys found 117 federal prosecutions  
involving prison phone use in recent years, including 11 for murder 
or attempted murder arranged by inmates over prison phones, 
Bromwich reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten inmates were prosecuted for plotting to threaten witnesses  
and 12 for trying to influence witnesses. Another 25 cases 
prosecuted inmates for fraud, often involving credit cards. One 
inmate directed a fraudulent employment matching service scheme 
that involved $1.6 million. Another swindled trucking companies out 
of more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	BOP's Craig noted that 40 of the 117 federal inmates prosecuted  
were housed in state or local prisons at the time of their phone 
abuse. He said the 77 cases growing out of phone use in federal 
prisons represent one one-hundredth of one percent of the 400,000 
inmates who moved through federal prisons during the three years 
the inspector general audited them. 
</P>
<P>
	In one egregious case, Baltimore drug dealer Anthony Jones used  
phones at the prison in Allenwood, Pa., to order associates outside 
to murder two grand jury witnesses against him. One was killed and 
the other shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Jones was convicted of murder and attempted murder  
and sentenced to life in prison for that in May 1998, he retained 
full phone privileges and his calls were not monitored, Bromwich 
found. Jones' access was not restricted until Bromwich's 
investigators asked about it in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``BOP's limited attempts to monitor inmate calls are virtually  
useless in preventing inmates from committing crimes,'' Bromwich 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards monitor only 3.5 percent of tens of thousands of  
prisoners' calls made each day, Bromwich found. All calls except 
prearranged ones to an inmate's attorney are recorded, but they are 
rarely reviewed later. 
</P>
<P>
	In visits to nine prisons, Bromwich's investigators found  
excessive phone use by 15 inmates, who each spent more than 66 
hours a month on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Notorious Washington, D.C., drug dealer Rayful Edmond told  
investigators he arranged drug deals on the phone almost every day 
from the penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., and held conference calls 
to Colombia, South America. Edmond said he knew most calls weren't 
monitored and expected only a short restriction of phone privileges 
if caught. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bromwich did say that 74 percent of inmates used the phone  
less than 5 hours a month. Most prisons have two pay phones per 150 
inmates who have to line up for them after their 7 hours of work 
each day, Craig said.

<HEADLINE>  Rockets Mum on Pippen Trade Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich refused  
comment Thursday on reports that forward Scottie Pippen has 
demanded a trade that would reunite him with Los Angeles Lakers 
coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about trades,'' Tomjanovich said after the team  
summoned reporters for a news conference. ``I do my things 
privately with my players, and these things basically stay 
private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton, told the Houston Chronicle on  
Wednesday that the Rockets were looking into the forward's request 
for a trade to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the Lakers has been talked about,'' Sexton said.  
``There have been discussions with the two clubs. They told us that 
the Rockets have some distance between the offer and what the 
Rockets would be willing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexton did not return a call Thursday from The Associated Press.  
Lakers officials refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich called the reports about Pippen, 33, just another  
obstacle as he tries to rebuild the aging Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This job I've found has a lot of obstacles in it, and this is  
just another one,'' he said. ``I just try to stay positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Pippen had any interest in remaining with the Rockets,  
Tomjanovich refused to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys would have to ask him that,'' the coach said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's time in Houston hasn't been as successful as the  
Rockets hoped when they acquired him in a sign-and-trade agreement 
with the Bulls last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen complained about his role in the Rockets offense while  
averaging 14.5 points per game, the lowest since his rookie year. 
He hit a career-low 43.2 percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	He has four years remaining on his Houston contract.  
</P>
<P>
	Sexton said his client has nothing against the Rockets but would  
like to be reunited with the former Bulls coach he -- along with 
Michael Jordan -- helped to win six NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Phil Jackson have an extremely close relationship from  
11 years working together day in and day out,'' Sexton said. 
``Scottie is an attractive piece of the puzzle for a lot of teams, 
but it probably would not be an issue if Phil Jackson was not 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading Pippen wouldn't be easy. Any deal would require  
adjustments to offset the $14,795,000 he counts against the salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen reportedly told Robert Barr, the Rockets' senior  
executive vice president for basketball affairs, to seek a trade 
with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, who had been with the team for 16 years, resigned  
Wednesday, saying he needs a break from basketball and wants to 
spend more time with his family. Barr also has refused comment on 
Pippen's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite disappointing offensive numbers for 1999, Pippen  
averaged 6.5 rebounds and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first 
team.

<HEADLINE>  Brewers Fire Manager Phil Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Phil Garner was fired as manager of the  
Milwaukee Brewers today in the midst of the team's seventh straight 
losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre replaced him on an interim basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to call it justified,'' Garner said. ``We didn't play  
up to my expectations or their expectations. In this situation, I 
think it's deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Sal Bando was reassigned in the start of a total  
overhaul of the perennial losers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that we weren't getting it done,'' said team  
president Wendy Selig-Prieb, the daughter of baseball commissioner 
Bud Selig. ``We're all frustrated. We're all disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando hired Garner, his former teammate, shortly after becoming  
the Brewers' GM in October 1991. Bando said last Friday he proposed 
firing Garner and removing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``They way we kind of disappeared the last two weeks, I could  
see the team chemistry wasn't there,'' Bando said. ``We needed to 
make a change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee dropped to 52-60 after an 8-5 defeat by Colorado on  
Wednesday and has the second-lowest attendance in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	The only manager who survived more consecutive losing seasons  
with one team than Garner is Connie Mack, who did it twice with the 
Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil has been a class act though all our troubles,''  
Selig-Prieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Cox of Atlanta, Cleveland's Mike Hargrove and Tom Kelly of  
Minnesota are the only managers who have been with their teams 
longer than Garner, both the winningest and losingest manager in 
Brewers history. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she will hire a general manager and the GM will  
hire the next manager. Selig-Prieb did not set any timetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a new GM is found, Selig-Prieb and assistant GM Fred  
Stanley will be responsible for the Brewers' baseball decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't made a decision at the All-Star break,'' she said  
when asked about the timing of today's moves. ``We want to focus on 
the last six weeks of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre was the only member of Garner's coaching staff with  
previous managerial experience. Lefebvre has ample experience with 
mediocre clubs, compiling a 395-414 record as manager of the 
Seattle Mariners from 1989-91 and the Chicago Cubs the following 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, hired as the Brewers' batting coach last August during  
a shakeup of the coaching staff, was signed as manager only through 
the rest of the season and doesn't consider himself a candidate for 
the fulltime job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here for seven weeks, and I'm going to do  
everything that I possibly can,'' he said. ``You all know the 
interim manager is usually the first one to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee, which didn't play today, starts a road trip Friday at  
Arizona. The Brewers, who went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that 
ended Wednesday, reached .500 five times this season, but failed 
each time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando, who will remain in the front office as a special  
assistant to Selig-Prieb, signed a three-year contract extension 
last October despite the team's lack of improvement. Milwaukee was 
92-70 during the pairs' first year in 1992, but hasn't finished 
above .500 since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando's biggest free-agent gambles of the last offseason turned  
into busts. Pitcher Jim Abbott was ineffective and retired from 
baseball last month, while infielder Sean Berry is hitting .232 and 
has been benched for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner leaves with a 563-617 record. He was hired in October  
1991 with no previous managing experience, and was runner-up for 
the AL Manager of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-year playing career as an infielder for Oakland,  
Pittsburgh, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He retired in 
1988 and spent three years on Houston manager Art Howe's coaching 
staff before succeeding Tom Trebelhorn in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	With his outgoing personality and soft Texas drawl, Garner was a  
favorite among Brewers' fans, and he was active in charity concerns 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner is well-respected in baseball and likely will be a strong  
candidate for another managerial job next season. Bando co-owns a 
successful venture capital company in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando played 16 seasons with the Athletics and the Brewers as a  
third baseman.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Live Ads for Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is betting that 64 live  
commercials will give its new line of Focus subcompact cars an edgy 
and topical twist that will appeal to teen-age and 20-something 
viewers of MTV and other youth-oriented television programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials featuring comedian and actress Annabelle  
Gurwitch will begin Sept. 9, during the MTV Video Music Awards 
show, and continue through March, primarily on prime-time network 
programs popular with ``echo-boomers,'' the children of baby 
boomers. There will be simultaneous live promotions on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford Focus campaign also will include conventional taped  
commercials, print advertising, billboards and radio ads. 
</P>
<P>
	To generate additional ``buzz'' among young people, Ford will  
loan customized Focus cars to what the automaker describes as ``120 
trendy people'' -- club DJs, concert promoters and such -- in New 
York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 automaker did not disclose the cost of the campaign as  
it outlined the plans Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Live commercials were standard fare during television's infancy  
in the 1950s, before recorded programming took over. They still 
surface. The Prodigy online service ran more than 100 live ads in a 
1993-94 campaign, and live contests have become a halftime fixture 
of major sports championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with live ads is they can go wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	There was the time in 1958 when John Cameron Swayze put a Timex  
watch on a motorboat propeller in a big tank of water and it fell 
off. He couldn't retrieve it to report his famous line: ``It takes 
a licking and keeps on ticking,'' although the watch, still 
running, was later recovered. In another '50s-era commercial, an 
actress couldn't open the refrigerator she was showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford marketers say the risk of live commercials is a lure to  
reach the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's precisely why we're doing it,'' said Jan Klug, the  
Ford's marketing communications manager. ``It's all about taking 
risks and living in the moment, which is really what the brand is 
all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Focus is Ford's latest attempt at a ``world car.'' On  
sale in Europe for about a year, the Focus recently began arriving 
at dealerships in the United States and Canada in advance of its 
formal launch Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Focus was styled in Ford's ``new edge'' school of design,  
with sharp creases and angles. It stands much taller than most 
small cars, a trend that automakers are adopting as car drivers 
increasingly find themselves in a sea of big sport utility 
vehicles, minivans and pickups that block their view. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will offer the Focus with several optional packages aimed  
at young drivers' interests. The ``pet package,'' for example, will 
include a dog safety harness, an insulated, tip-resistent water 
bowl and a ``doggie bag'' to pack pet supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will be sold alongside the venerable Escort, which ranks  
fifth in U.S. sales. Ford will produce the 2000 Escort in fewer 
variations as a low-budget model and industry analysts expect the 
model to disappear from Ford's lineup at the end of the 2002 model 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials with Gurwitch, who hosts Turner Broadcasting  
System's ``Dinner &AMP; a Movie'' program on cable, will be scripted 
and rehearsed. But Ford hopes to make them topical and 
improvisational enough to appear spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to find some bloopers, and I think that's going  
to build a cult following around this,'' said Bruce Rooke, creative 
director at the J. Walter Thompson agency. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 minutes before each commercial is broadcast, computer  
users can log on a special Web site to watch the crew set up. The 
view will be from a hand-held camera and will include brief 
interviews with cast and crew in a live documentary format. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising experts said Ford's novel approach could succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Younger consumers have built up a tremendous amount of  
skepticism against polished ads,'' said advertising Professor 
Roland Rust at Vanderbilt University. ``This is a way to break out 
of that. It's new, off the wall and risky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing consultant Jack Trout of Trout &AMP; Partners said Ford  
needs to make sure the ads get across a message about the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want all jokes,'' he said. ``A lot of car  
manufacturers get so cute you don't learn too much about the car. 
You don't want to get so involved in the production values of this 
live, behind-the-scenes stuff that you lose the message.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Retracts Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Presidential candidate Bill Bradley is  
questioning Al Gore's commitment to abortion rights, citing a 
statement by a vice presidential aide who now says he was mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect a woman's right to choose, and that includes women  
who are poor,'' the former New Jersey senator told supporters 
Wednesday night when asked to outline his differences with Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was referring to a recent story in The Des Moines  
Register about the abortion positions of Gore and Bradley, the sole 
combatants in the 2000 Democratic presidential contest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said the vice  
president has long felt federal money should not be used to pay for 
abortions, except to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government should not be involved in those decisions,''  
Salazar told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Informed of Bradley's remark, Salazar said the information he  
gave the newspaper was wrong. He said Gore opposes restrictions on 
abortion funding. ``I gave the wrong answer. I didn't do my 
research,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign has had its share of miscues, including the time  
Gore appeared to take credit for inventing the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bradley and Gore are courting the votes of female  
Democrats, a majority of whom tell pollsters they oppose abortion 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president opposes any attempt to restrict Medicaid  
funding for abortions,'' Salazar said Wednesday. ``He has fought to 
guarantee that Medicaid recipients who are victims of rape or 
incest should have access to abortion, in addition to those whose 
lives are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice President Gore has fought repeated Republican attempts to  
restrict Medicaid funding and, as president, Gore will continue 
that fight,'' Salazar said. ``If Congress passes a bill to extend 
Medicaid funding for abortions, as president, Gore will sign it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, federal law has prohibited the use of federal funds,  
including Medicaid, to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, 
incest or instances where the mother's life is endangered.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Group Rushing on Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- With several deadlines approaching, Mario  
Lemieux's advisers are rushing to preserve the retired star's 
purchase of the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins and are considering 
adding more investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux twice failed to meet deadlines set by a federal  
bankruptcy judge to close on the sale, apparently because he does 
not yet have signed agreements from all his investors. An Allegheny 
County commissioner also balked at freeing the Penguins from debt 
owed for Civic Arena improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's aides insist they have raised the $55 million in cash  
needed to complete the purchase, which was approved by U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the investors are solid and are ready to close next  
week,'' Lemieux spokesman John Brabender said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Team Lemieux has spent part of this week talking to  
additional investors, creating speculation that more cash must be 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemieux advisers say they are merely exploring whether to  
raise additional capital so they can field a competitive team once 
Lemieux takes over. 
</P>
<P>
	That search led the Lemieux group to again talk with Mark Cuban,  
a Pittsburgh native and the Broadcast.com Web site founder who 
originally discussed an investment last spring but could not 
formalize an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban is a lifelong Penguins fan who attended several playoff  
games last season wearing a team jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban, who fears Pittsburgh will lose the Penguins if the  
Lemieux bid fails, is believed to be willing to sink as much as $40 
million into the team. That stake would be worth twice as much as 
Lemieux's own $20 million share and theoretically would make Cuban 
the majority owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``But what any additional investor's role might be and the  
percentage of ownership is so far down the road, it isn't even 
worth discussing,'' Brabender said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cuban does make such a large investment -- before or after the  
sale -- he would clearly have much more say in the team's 
operations. The operations plan drawn up by Team Lemieux puts 
nearly all of the control in the hands of Lemieux and his advisers, 
which may have led Cuban to fail to join the group initially. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mario needs money and that's what we have,'' said Harry L.  
Manion III, Cuban's lawyer, on Thursday. ``Mark wants to do 
whatever is reasonable to make sure the team is viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Cuban joins, it is possible that Beverly Hills billionaire  
Ron Burkle may pull out his $20 million stake if and when the sale 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always looking for new investors,'' said Doug Campbell,  
Lemieux's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed that Lemieux's group now believes that $55  
million is not enough to buy the team and operate it long term, 
especially at a time when one player -- Jaromir Jagr -- will make 
$10.4 million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins ran up $120 million in debt from 1991-98, a period  
when Howard Baldwin and, later, Roger Marino were the owners. 
Marino sank about $40 million into the team over the last two 
years, but recently decided not to invest in the Lemieux group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Penguins have been undercapitalized for eight years,''  
Manion said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week is an especially important one for Lemieux because the  
Penguins' line of credit with the French bank Societe Generale runs 
out Aug. 20. The team is collecting money from season ticket sales, 
but those funds are in an escrow account that the Penguins cannot 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, training camp begins three weeks from Saturday. Because  
the NHL ceded to the bankruptcy court any rights it had to seize 
the franchise and operate it on its own, it is possible the 
Penguins might go out of business if the sale isn't completed by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delays in closing have created the real possibility that  
this team is going to fold because it is out of money,'' Manion 
told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ``As a result of that, Mark Cuban 
has expressed a willingness to work with Team Lemieux to provide 
them with whatever they need to ensure that the Penguins will 
survive in Pittsburgh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lemieux aides say an agreement on the Civic Arena  
debt issue may be near. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny County Commissioner Bob Cranmer last week objected to  
a deal bartered by city and county negotiators that would have 
freed the Penguins from absorbing any debt for past arena 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranmer said he doesn't want taxpayers' money to fund debts  
accumulated by the Penguins' prior ownership.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Fire Garner, Reassign Bando </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Seven years of losing baseball were too many,  
even for the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Phil Garner was fired and general manager Sal Bando was  
reassigned Thursday in a shakeup of the perennially underachieving 
team. The Brewers are 52-60 and appear headed to their seventh 
straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre was appointed interim manager and  
will be on the bench when Milwaukee begins a seven-game road trip 
at Arizona on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando said he proposed both changes, and Garner said his firing  
was ``justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play up to my expectations or their expectations,''  
Garner said. ``In this situation, I think it's deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three managers have longer tenures with their current clubs  
than Garner, who is both the winningest and losingest manager in 
team history. Only Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics had 
survived with a team through more consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers president Wendy Selig-Prieb said she was confident about  
her overhaul of the team she took over last year from her father, 
baseball commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a results business, make no mistake about it,''  
Selig-Prieb said. ``This is not a complacent organization. We will 
not accept mediocrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando and Garner, teammates with the Oakland Athletics, joined  
the Brewers together in October 1991. Selig-Prieb said the two were 
``inextricably linked'' in the minds of fans and other teams, 
making a dual change necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando, who will remain with the Brewers as a special assistant  
to Selig-Prieb, refused to say whether one specific incident 
prompted his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a Brewer, and I've been a Brewer since 1977,'' said Bando,  
a former third baseman in Milwaukee. ``We needed to make a change 
for the sake of the organization, and that's always my first 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she will hire a general manager and the GM will  
hire the next manager. She did not set any timetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a new GM is found, Selig-Prieb and assistant GM Fred  
Stanley will be responsible for the Brewers' baseball decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't made a decision at the All-Star break,'' she said  
when asked about the timing. ``We want to focus on the last six 
weeks of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said rumors that former Brewers stars Paul Molitor  
and Robin Yount would be considered for the positions were 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so far ahead of where I am in the process,'' she said.  
``I will move as quickly as I can, but speed is not my primary 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A typically upbeat Garner was reluctant to criticize the  
small-market Brewers' penny-pinching ways and depleted farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things are frustrating, but those aren't my jobs,  
either,'' Garner said. ``That's a problem that baseball has, not 
only for us, but for a lot of other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, the 10th manager in team history, was the only member  
of Garner's coaching staff with previous managerial experience. 
Lefebvre has spent ample time with mediocre clubs, compiling a 
395-414 record as manager of the Seattle Mariners from 1989-91 and 
the Chicago Cubs the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sad day for me,'' Lefebvre said. ``Hopefully,  
somehow, some way, we can get this team to perform up to 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, hired as the Brewers' batting coach last August during  
a shakeup of the coaching staff, was signed as manager only through 
the rest of the season and doesn't consider himself a candidate for 
the fulltime job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here for seven weeks, and I'm going to do  
everything that I possibly can,'' he said. ``You all know the 
interim manager is usually the first one to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that ended  
Wednesday, reached .500 five times this season, but failed each 
time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner leaves with a 563-617 record. He was hired in October  
1991 with no previous managing experience, and was runner-up for 
the AL Manager of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-year playing career as an infielder for Oakland,  
Pittsburgh, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He retired in 
1988 and spent three years on Houston manager Art Howe's coaching 
staff before succeeding Tom Trebelhorn in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	With his outgoing personality and soft Texas drawl, Garner was a  
favorite among Brewers' fans, and he was active in charity concerns 
off the field. Garner had no sooner been let go than his name began 
to surface as a potential candidate for several new positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, who is well-respected in baseball circles, could come  
under consideration if the Chicago Cubs, the New York Mets, St. 
Louis or Detroit decide to change managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a job, people are very kind to you,'' Garner  
said when asked about his future. ``When you don't have a job, you 
call and nobody's in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando, who played 16 seasons with the Athletics and the Brewers  
as a third baseman, co-owns a successful venture capital company in 
Milwaukee. He said he had no interest in pursuing other baseball 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no desire to be a general manager in the first place,''  
Bando said. ``It was something that just happened.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Course Eliminates 13th Hole  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- There's been something disturbing  
about the 13th hole at Somerset Golf Club. Something that makes 
golfers squeeze their grips a bit tighter and eye the terrain a bit 
longer before they swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say it's the supernatural, the curse of 13. They swear  
their longest drives inexplicably vanish from the 13th fairway and 
balls drop out of nowhere on the 13th green. 
</P>
<P>
	Head pro Don Kramer has heard it all. And, as the final Friday  
the 13th before 2000 dawns, he thinks Somerset has beaten the 
curse. 
</P>
<P>
	Hole No. 13 has been eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, that will do the job,'' Kramer said, pointing to a  
paper 14 taped over the 13 on a sign near the tee. The succeeding 
holes have been renumbered so golfers now play through the 19th 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Triskaidekaphobics -- people who fear the number 13 -- probably  
wonder what took so long. To commemorate the change, the course 
planned a Triskaidekaphobia Open for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer claims Somerset is the first golf course in the country  
to eliminate a 13th hole. And as far as National Golf Foundation 
spokeswoman Judy Thompson knows, he's right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has come up and said it's stupid,'' Kramer said. After  
all, he said, many hotels have no 13th floor and some airlines skip 
the 13 row. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people look to Norse mythology for the source of 13 phobia.  
According to the myth, an evil god crashed a party attended by 12 
other Norse gods and killed one of them. Others say 13 became a bad 
omen because there were 13 diners at the Last Supper. 
</P>
<P>
	President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the superstition so  
seriously, he would have his secretary sit down to make 14 when it 
appeared 13 people would be dining at the White House, said Thomas 
Fernsler, a professor at Mansfield University in Mansfield, Pa., 
and an expert on things 13. 
</P>
<P>
	At Somerset, rumors about the 13th hole could be rooted in the  
local legend that a unit of Confederate soldiers experienced freak 
accidents while crossing the land during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	David Swales isn't sure, but he has his own tale of the  
inexplicable from hole No. 13. The course's management consultant 
was walking across the green in April when a ball hit him on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nobody else on the golf course that I could see,''  
Swales said. ``It was pretty weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the switch, Kramer waited at the former 13th hole -- now  
No. 14 -- and watched. Doug VanderKolk was preparing to tee off. 
</P>
<P>
	VanderKolk, who said he once wrecked a car on the 13th day of a  
month, appeared to be an ideal candidate to smack his ball into the 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he smashed his drive down the left side of the par 4,  
321-yard hole, avoiding a sand trap. His second shot landed 10 feet 
from the hole. He narrowly missed his putt, then tapped in for par. 
</P>
<P>
	``No ghosts,'' VanderKolk said defiantly.  
</P>
<P>
	He had made par but missed the birdie putt. Was that good luck  
or bad?

<HEADLINE>  Rockets Mum on Pippen Trade Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich refused  
comment Thursday on reports that forward Scottie Pippen has 
demanded a trade that would reunite him with Los Angeles Lakers 
coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about trades,'' Tomjanovich said after the team  
summoned reporters for a news conference. ``I do my things 
privately with my players, and these things basically stay 
private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton, told the Houston Chronicle on  
Wednesday that the Rockets were looking into the forward's request 
for a trade to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the Lakers has been talked about,'' Sexton said.  
``There have been discussions with the two clubs. They told us that 
the Rockets have some distance between the offer and what the 
Rockets would be willing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexton did not return a call Thursday from The Associated Press.  
Lakers officials refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich called the reports about Pippen, 33, just another  
obstacle as he tries to rebuild the aging Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This job I've found has a lot of obstacles in it, and this is  
just another one,'' he said. ``I just try to stay positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Pippen had any interest in remaining with the Rockets,  
Tomjanovich refused to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys would have to ask him that,'' the coach said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's time in Houston hasn't been as successful as the  
Rockets hoped when they acquired him in a sign-and-trade agreement 
with the Bulls last January. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen complained about his role in the Rockets offense while  
averaging 14.5 points per game, the lowest since his rookie year. 
He hit a career-low 43.2 percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	He has four years remaining on his Houston contract.  
</P>
<P>
	Sexton said his client has nothing against the Rockets but would  
like to be reunited with the former Bulls coach he -- along with 
Michael Jordan -- helped to win six NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Phil Jackson have an extremely close relationship from  
11 years working together day in and day out,'' Sexton said. 
``Scottie is an attractive piece of the puzzle for a lot of teams, 
but it probably would not be an issue if Phil Jackson was not 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading Pippen wouldn't be easy. Any deal would require  
adjustments to offset the $14,795,000 he counts against the salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen reportedly told Robert Barr, the Rockets' senior  
executive vice president for basketball affairs, to seek a trade 
with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, who had been with the team for 16 years, resigned  
Wednesday, saying he needs a break from basketball and wants to 
spend more time with his family. Barr also has refused comment on 
Pippen's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite disappointing offensive numbers for 1999, Pippen  
averaged 6.5 rebounds and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first 
team.

<HEADLINE>  Brewers Fire Manager Phil Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Phil Garner was fired as manager of the  
Milwaukee Brewers today in the midst of the team's seventh straight 
losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre replaced him on an interim basis.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to call it justified,'' Garner said. ``We didn't play  
up to my expectations or their expectations. In this situation, I 
think it's deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Sal Bando was reassigned in the start of a total  
overhaul of the perennial losers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that we weren't getting it done,'' said team  
president Wendy Selig-Prieb, the daughter of baseball commissioner 
Bud Selig. ``We're all frustrated. We're all disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando hired Garner, his former teammate, shortly after becoming  
the Brewers' GM in October 1991. Bando said last Friday he proposed 
firing Garner and removing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``They way we kind of disappeared the last two weeks, I could  
see the team chemistry wasn't there,'' Bando said. ``We needed to 
make a change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee dropped to 52-60 after an 8-5 defeat by Colorado on  
Wednesday and has the second-lowest attendance in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	The only manager who survived more consecutive losing seasons  
with one team than Garner is Connie Mack, who did it twice with the 
Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil has been a class act though all our troubles,''  
Selig-Prieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Cox of Atlanta, Cleveland's Mike Hargrove and Tom Kelly of  
Minnesota are the only managers who have been with their teams 
longer than Garner, both the winningest and losingest manager in 
Brewers history. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig-Prieb said she will hire a general manager and the GM will  
hire the next manager. Selig-Prieb did not set any timetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a new GM is found, Selig-Prieb and assistant GM Fred  
Stanley will be responsible for the Brewers' baseball decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't made a decision at the All-Star break,'' she said  
when asked about the timing of today's moves. ``We want to focus on 
the last six weeks of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre was the only member of Garner's coaching staff with  
previous managerial experience. Lefebvre has ample experience with 
mediocre clubs, compiling a 395-414 record as manager of the 
Seattle Mariners from 1989-91 and the Chicago Cubs the following 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre, hired as the Brewers' batting coach last August during  
a shakeup of the coaching staff, was signed as manager only through 
the rest of the season and doesn't consider himself a candidate for 
the fulltime job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be here for seven weeks, and I'm going to do  
everything that I possibly can,'' he said. ``You all know the 
interim manager is usually the first one to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee, which didn't play today, starts a road trip Friday at  
Arizona. The Brewers, who went 4-8 on a 12-game homestand that 
ended Wednesday, reached .500 five times this season, but failed 
each time to get above the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando, who will remain in the front office as a special  
assistant to Selig-Prieb, signed a three-year contract extension 
last October despite the team's lack of improvement. Milwaukee was 
92-70 during the pairs' first year in 1992, but hasn't finished 
above .500 since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando's biggest free-agent gambles of the last offseason turned  
into busts. Pitcher Jim Abbott was ineffective and retired from 
baseball last month, while infielder Sean Berry is hitting .232 and 
has been benched for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner leaves with a 563-617 record. He was hired in October  
1991 with no previous managing experience, and was runner-up for 
the AL Manager of the Year award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-year playing career as an infielder for Oakland,  
Pittsburgh, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He retired in

</P>
<P>
	With his outgoing personality and soft Texas drawl, Garner was a  
favorite among Brewers' fans, and he was active in charity concerns 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner is well-respected in baseball and likely will be a strong  
candidate for another managerial job next season. Bando co-owns a 
successful venture capital company in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bando played 16 seasons with the Athletics and the Brewers as a  
third baseman.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Close Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed higher Thursday,  
following overnight gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares rose 1.23 percent, as the U.S. dollar continued  
its climb against the Japanese yen. The dollar bought 115.68 yen 
late in the afternoon, up 0.98 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and 
also above its late New York level of 115.35 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 211.81  
points to close at 17,422.97. On Wednesday, the average rose 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were encouraged by Wednesday's trading in New York,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares surged 2.7 percent after five straight  
sessions of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 341.95 points to 12,779.75. On  
Wednesday, the index had dropped 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors remain concerned, however, over a possible U.S.  
interest rate hike. Hong Kong interest rates usually follow rate 
movements in the United States since the Hong Kong dollar is pegged 
to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	That was keeping many players out of the market, said Terry  
Cheung of Core Pacific-Yamaichi International (HK) Ltd in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, prices were boosted by news reports of heightened  
U.S. military presence in the region. The Weighted Price Index rose 
101.56 points, or 1.40 percent, to 7,330.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were encouraged by reports that the aircraft carrier  
USS Constellation was in Singapore while the USS Kitty Hawk was on 
its way to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have become tired of China's military threats, so  
when there's good news, the market rebounds,'' said Su Kun-mao of 
Masterlink Securities Corp. in Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices have fallen sharply in Taipei over the past month  
as China and Taiwan squared off over Taiwan President Lee 
Teng-hui's recent claim of statehood.

<HEADLINE> Richardson To Review Pipelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress out of town, Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson plans to visit Nigeria and the Caspian Sea region 
to review giant pipeline projects, the Energy Department said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was to depart late Thursday for a three-day visit to  
Nigeria, where he will meet with recently inaugurated Nigerian 
President Olesegun Obasanjo. Their discussions will include energy 
policy, regulatory reforms and removing barriers to trade 
investment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria is the world's fifth largest supplier of oil to the  
United States and has the world's 10th largest reserves of natural 
gas. A consortium led by Chevron is building a $400 million 
pipeline that will ship Nigerian gas to neighboring Benin, Ghana 
and Togo. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline ``is a strong example of (Obasanjo's) commitment to  
economic integration and encouraging investment in the region,'' 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	From Nigeria, Richardson will travel to the Caspian Sea areas  
for a week of discussions with private and government officials 
about progress toward building an oil pipeline from the Caspian to 
the Turkish port of Ceyhan. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3.8 billion, 1,400-mile pipeline has been a top priority of  
the Clinton administration, which sees it as the key to 
establishing an east-west transportation route for Caspian oil that 
avoids Russia and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	But a consortium of 11 oil companies, led by several major U.S.  
producers, have been reluctant to proceed with such a huge capital 
investment because of recent low oil prices and uncertainties over 
Caspian oil reserves.

<HEADLINE> Fassel To Miss Giants Preseason Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	New York Giants coach Jim Fassel left the team in Albany, N.Y.,  
on Thursday, one day before the preseason opener, to be with his 
critically ill mother in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel had intended to coach the game against the Minnesota  
Vikings and then travel to Arizona on Saturday to be with his 
mother, Dorothy, but her condition worsened, Giants spokesman Pat 
Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Fassel has been ill for some time with a kidney-related  
illness, Hanlon said. She collapsed in a hospital in the Phoenix 
area on Tuesday and she has been on a ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her condition has gotten more serious and Jim decided to go to  
Phoenix to be with her,'' Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel notified the team of his plans right before it left  
training camp at the University at Albany to take the flight to 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Jim Skipper and defensive coordinator John  
Fox will run the team on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known when Fassel will rejoin the Giants, Hanlon said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Giants also announced Thursday they had been awarded running  
back Reynard Rutherford on waivers from Oakland. The former 
California running back has spent parts of the last three seasons 
on the practice squads of the San Francisco 49ers and the Raiders. 
He has not played a down in a regular season game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants have been short of running backs with Gary Brown,  
LeShon Johnson, Joe Montgomery and Raymond Priester sidelined with 
minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Push Up July Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans snapped up cars and light trucks  
last month at a brisk clip that helped push overall retail sales up 
by a bigger-than-expected 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Thursday that total retail  
sales, which represent about a third of the nation's economic 
output, rose last month to a seasonally adjusted $248.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were 9.1 percent higher than July of last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Christmas in July,'' said economist Richard Yamarone  
with Argus Research Corp. Record heat in many parts of the country 
drove people into air-conditioned showrooms and stores, where they 
made purchases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	New car and light trucks sales increased by 2.3 percent in July,  
compared with an 0.8 percent drop in June. The auto industry 
predicts record sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reasons cited by Paul Taylor, chief economist with the  
National Automobile Dealers Association, were strong demand for 
mid-sized luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles; manufacturers' 
rebates; and a strong economy that makes people feel comfortable 
about spending money. 
</P>
<P>
	William Mulholland, a 29-year-old information technology  
specialist from Virginia who bought a new Jeep Wrangler two weeks 
ago, said he did not get a ``great deal'' but could afford the 
convertible model he longed for. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists continue to believe the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates again on Aug. 24, to keep the economy from 
overheating and hold inflation under control. The Fed nudged 
interest rates a quarter of a point on June 30, the first rate 
increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said the retail sales report gives the Fed  
additional ammunition to justify a second increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continued solid consumer demand just adds to the belief that  
the Fed is going to raise rates again,'' said economist Joel Naroff 
of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	But others economists took heart in another number in the  
report: Excluding auto sales, retail sales rose just 0.3 percent in 
July, slightly less than many analysts' expectations of a 0.4 
percent rise, and a possible sign that overall retail sales may be 
moderating, said economist David Levy of the Levy Institute 
Forecasting Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been worried about the prospects of  
another rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain in overall retail sales followed a revised 0.2 percent  
decline in June. Last month, the government estimated retail sales 
actually rose 0.1 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter of this year, consumer spending grew by 4  
percent, compared with 6.7 percent for January-March. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment near a three-decade low, growth in wages and  
benefits and a strong stock market, consumers are continuing to 
feel confident. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no stopping the urge to splurge among U.S.  
consumers,'' said First Union's chief economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last at least three  
years -- rose 1.6 percent in July, compared with a 0.9 percent drop 
in June. Sales at furniture stores remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, went up  
0.2 percent in July, down from a 0.4 percent gain in June. At 
gasoline stations, sales rose 1.2 percent in July reflecting a jump 
in gas prices at the time. Gas sales fell by 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sales at general merchandise stores, the category  
that includes department stores, increased 1 percent in July, 
compared with a gain of 0.6 percent in June. Sales at food stores 
rose 0.1 percent in July, after having dropped the month before. 
But sales at grocery stores held steady for the second month in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	At apparel and accessory shops, sales fell 0.4 percent in July,  
matching the 0.4 percent drop in June. Sales at bar and restaurants 
also fell by 0.4 percent in July, following a 0.2 percent gain in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, most chain stores reported that their retail sales  
topped expectations in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the number  
of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 
4,000 to 284,000. But the four-week moving average, which smoothes 
out week-to-week volatility, fell to 288,250, its lowest point in 
over a decade. Economists consider any claims level below 300,000 
to be an indication of an extremely tight labor market.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Close Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed higher Thursday,  
following overnight gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares rose 1.23 percent, as the U.S. dollar continued  
its climb against the Japanese yen. The dollar bought 115.68 yen 
late in the afternoon, up 0.98 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and 
also above its late New York level of 115.35 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 211.81  
points to close at 17,422.97. On Wednesday, the average rose 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were encouraged by Wednesday's trading in New York,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares surged 2.7 percent after five straight  
sessions of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 341.95 points to 12,779.75. On  
Wednesday, the index had dropped 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors remain concerned, however, over a possible U.S.  
interest rate hike. Hong Kong interest rates usually follow rate 
movements in the United States since the Hong Kong dollar is pegged 
to the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	That was keeping many players out of the market, said Terry  
Cheung of Core Pacific-Yamaichi International (HK) Ltd in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, prices were boosted by news reports of heightened  
U.S. military presence in the region. The Weighted Price Index rose 
101.56 points, or 1.40 percent, to 7,330.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were encouraged by reports that the aircraft carrier  
USS Constellation was in Singapore while the USS Kitty Hawk was on 
its way to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have become tired of China's military threats, so  
when there's good news, the market rebounds,'' said Su Kun-mao of 
Masterlink Securities Corp. in Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices have fallen sharply in Taipei over the past month  
as China and Taiwan squared off over Taiwan President Lee 
Teng-hui's recent claim of statehood. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Push Up July Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans snapped up cars and light trucks  
last month at a brisk clip that helped push overall retail sales up 
by a bigger-than-expected 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Thursday that total retail  
sales, which represent about a third of the nation's economic 
output, rose last month to a seasonally adjusted $248.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were 9.1 percent higher than July of last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Christmas in July,'' said economist Richard Yamarone  
with Argus Research Corp. Record heat in many parts of the country 
drove people into air-conditioned showrooms and stores, where they 
made purchases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	New car and light trucks sales increased by 2.3 percent in July,  
compared with an 0.8 percent drop in June. The auto industry 
predicts record sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reasons cited by Paul Taylor, chief economist with the  
National Automobile Dealers Association, were strong demand for 
mid-sized luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles; manufacturers' 
rebates; and a strong economy that makes people feel comfortable 
about spending money. 
</P>
<P>
	William Mulholland, a 29-year-old information technology  
specialist from Virginia who bought a new Jeep Wrangler two weeks 
ago, said he did not get a ``great deal'' but could afford the 
convertible model he longed for. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bills' Fisher Waiting To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Bryce Fisher knows how to wait. He also  
knows how to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force graduate and Buffalo rookie is in a familiar  
holding pattern: waiting to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher sat two seasons before getting a shot in high school and  
waited another two years for a starting job at Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The top defensive player in the Mountain Division of the Western  
Athletic Conference sat beside the telephone on NFL draft day while 
239 players were chosen ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll wait two more years for an opportunity to play for the  
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher will return to the Air Force Academy after playing in  
Buffalo's exhibition opener in his native Seattle on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills, who chose Fisher with the second of two picks in the  
seventh round of the draft, are willing to wait for him to meet his 
military obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a bright future ahead of him,'' veteran  
defensive end Bruce Smith said in training camp Thursday. ``It's 
unfortunate he has to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's 70 tackles and six sacks as a defensive tackle last  
season helped Air Force to a 12-1 record and lead the WAC in 
scoring defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills will take one last good look at Fisher at defensive  
end before saying goodbye. ``We're going to give him a nice little 
homecoming,'' said Buffalo's defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell, 
who likes the 6-foot-3, 260-pound player for his smarts and 
quickness but says he has to gain strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was on his way to anonymity at Washington after  
graduating from Seattle Prep, when Air Force swooped in with an 
offer late in the recruiting season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to take a partial academic scholarship at  
Washington,'' Fisher said. ``I was just going to be a student and 
not play. I was disappointed when nobody came around because I 
thought I was going to get a scholarship out of high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher helped boost Air Force to its first outright conference  
title and a 45-25 romp over Washington in the Oahu Bowl. The only 
blemish was a one-point loss at TCU. 
</P>
<P>
	The bowl victory was particularly sweet.  
</P>
<P>
	``The University of Washington said I wasn't going to develop  
into a Division I athlete,'' Fisher said. ``They said I was just 
too small. Go figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Fisher hears some of the same old stuff, that he must  
bulk up and gain strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``To play at this level he'll have to get in the weight room,''  
said Dwight Adams, Buffalo's director of player personnel. ``He 
gets bounced around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technique counts too, says Smith, and Fisher has that.  
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how he can handle himself on the field at the  
weight that he's at,'' Smith said. ``If he's 260 pounds and he's 
lower than an offensive tackle who's 300, he's going to win that 
battle. It's just a matter of how much he matures mentally and how 
much he learns about the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher is looking forward to going home. His father, Richard,  
will be watching his son play -- on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad doesn't like the tickets the team gets,'' Fisher said.  
``He'd rather watch it on television. That way when his son makes a 
good play he can see it twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A transportation officer, Fisher will work as a recruiter and  
assistant coach. He's fortunate that his Air Force commitment is 
only two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't have a chance to play at the professional level,  
it would be five years,'' Fisher said. ``You can't pay for the kind 
of recruiting you can get from a professional athlete. They see 
that as more beneficial than me sitting around pushing pencils.''

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Hits Downtown Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Confusion descended on downtown Thursday when a  
series of mechanical problems darkened hundreds of office 
buildings, snarled traffic and skidded the Chicago Board of Trade 
to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of commuters left early for the day when power was  
lost, pushing the rush hour forward by hours. Police struggled to 
keep cars moving through darkened intersections. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra buses were called in to handle the crush and generators  
were set up in Union Station, which handles Amtrak and suburban 
commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Kelly, a worker at a 13th-floor temp agency, said people  
struggled to get out when his building's lights went cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of scary. It was so dark and it was chaotic trying  
to get our stuff before we had to get out,'' he said. ``It was 
total confusion. It was mass panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board of Trade officials closed the markets at 1 p.m. after they  
were warned by utility officials that power was going to be shut 
down, said board spokesman Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disruption of trading,'' Gallaway said.  
``The last minutes of trading are often some of the busiest trading 
of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul McCoy, vice president of Commonwealth Edison, said cables  
leading from two big transformers failed Wednesday night and 
Thursday morning at a substation, leaving 2,300 customers west of 
downtown without electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility was forced later Thursday to shut down power for  
about 90 minutes to another 670 business customers in a 30-block 
business district that includes the Board of Trade, the federal 
courthouse and many law firms after a transformer at another 
substation overheated. That transformer had been helping to keep up 
with demand at the defective station. 
</P>
<P>
	Power to all customers was restored by late Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had to shut down all our computers,'' said Eamon Tierney, a  
systems manager in a Michigan Avenue building. ``Then I had to walk 
down 32 flights of stairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the 27-floor Hilton Chicago &AMP; Towers, hotel staff dug into  
their Y2K emergency stash of fluorescent glow sticks to help 
evacuate guests who wanted to leave their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't think we would have to use them unless the worst Y2K  
case scenario happened,'' said Robert Allegrini, a spokesman for 
the hotel. ``Who would have thought they would come in so handy 
before New Year's Eve?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allegrini said they brought out about 6,000 of the glow sticks  
to light darkened stairwells in the hotel and to hand out to guests 
trying to find their way down to the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like being at a rock concert, everybody waving their  
lights in the air,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd is already under fire for an outage during July's brutal  
heat wave outage that affected about 100,000 customers. In 1995, 
the utility's customers also suffered outages during that summer's 
extreme heat, which contributed to the deaths of hundreds of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like everybody, I'm upset and we expect the answers directly  
from ComEd,'' Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a news conference. 
``We deserve answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the utility was a step away from imposing rolling  
blackouts after a series of problems left it short of power on a 
sweltering day. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, ComEd asked residential customers to turn off their air  
conditioners for one- to two-hour intervals, prompting an outcry 
from customers, a watchdog group and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every summer, it seems to be something different,'' said Rob  
Kelter, an attorney for the Citizens Utility Board, a frequent 
critic of ComEd. ``Last summer it was power shortages. This summer 
it's problems with the transmission and distribution system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd officials had been confident similar problems would be  
avoided this year, pointing in particular to improvements in its 
nuclear power stations. 
</P>
<P>
	John Rowe, CEO of ComEd's parent company, Unicom, called the  
utility's performance ``absolutely, totally unacceptable'' and said 
he had appointed a committee to study its problems and recommend 
how to restructure the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to go at this root and branch,'' Rowe said.

<HEADLINE> Government Grants Disaster Declarations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers from Virginia to Massachusetts became  
eligible for low-interest loans as the Agriculture Department 
declared new disaster areas because of the lingering drought. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Connecticut, most of Maryland, six counties in New York,  
five in Virginia and one in New Mexico received disaster 
declarations on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers in counties next to those with disaster designations,  
which would include areas of Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania 
and Rhode Island, also are eligible for the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a devastating year for farmers in Connecticut  
and all over the Northeast,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
said during a tour of parched fields in Connecticut. ``They've been 
hit by the lowest farm prices in a decade and are now experiencing 
this record-setting drought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of New Jersey and West Virginia and 34 New York counties  
were declared disaster areas previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans are limited to farmers who have lost at least 30  
percent of their crops and can't get commercial credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman visited a farm owned by Nelson Cecarelli, who estimates  
he has lost at least 50 percent of his tomatoes, sweet corn, green 
beans, and peppers to the hot, dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a microcosm of the whole problem. I think the whole  
state is devastated,'' Cecarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen Maryland counties received the disaster designation  
Wednesday: Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Carroll, 
Cecil, Charles, Dorchester, Frederick, Garrett, Harford, Howard, 
Montgomery, Prince George's, Queen Anne's, St. Mary's, Washington, 
Wicomico and Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
	The six New York counties are Dutchess, Essex, Putnam, Sullivan,  
Ulster and Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
	The five Virginia counties are Frederick, Giles, Louisa,  
Montgomery and Warren. 
</P>
<P>
	The one New Mexico county is Sierra.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Soar to 8.15 Pct. / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages soared to 8.15 percent this week, reaching its 
highest rate in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.89 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. This week's average rate on 30-year mortgages was the 
highest since early April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb. So far this year,  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and a new high set this week. The 
previous record high this year of 7.89 percent was set last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.70 percent this week, up from the average of 7.45 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.24 percent this week, also up from 6.09 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Mac's chief economist Robert Van Order blamed the rise  
in mortgage rates on investors' fears that the Federal Reserve 
would raise interest rates for a second time. In June, the Fed 
nudged up rates by a quarter of a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stronger-than-expected employment report rattled markets a  
little last week, continuing to raise fears of action by the 
Federal Reserve,'' Van Order said. ``An economic climate like that 
generally results in higher interest rates and that is what we saw 
in this week's (mortgage rate survey) results,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government reported that businesses added 310,000  
new jobs to their payrolls and increased waged by a 
larger-than-expected amount in July. That report prompted 
economists to predict that the Fed would raise rates again on Aug. 
24 to keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending Aug. 6 were 
down 24.1 percent compared to the same week last year.

</P>
<P>
	SHELBURNE, Vt. (AP) -- Whitney Darrow Jr., a popular cartoonist  
for The New Yorker, died Tuesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Yorker published more than 1,500 of Darrow's cartoons  
during a 50-year career that started in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his favorite cartoons was inspired by the advent of  
Laundromats. Darrow drew a woman in a busy Laundromat washing all 
her clothes, including those she'd been wearing. Naked, she stares 
in amazement at the newfangled machine doing her wash. 
</P>
<P>
	John Russell, reviewing a Darrow exhibition in 1978, wrote in  
the New York Times that ``Whitney Darrow has been one of the best 
cartoonists around for as long as anyone can remember. He is an 
environmental cartoonist, in that he goes on setting the scene in 
that misleadingly easygoing style of his until he is ready for a 
one-liner. And what a one-liner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He published four collections of his cartoons and also  
illustrated books by Jean Kerr, Nathanial Benchley and many others. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Middy, Darrow is survived by a son, a  
daughter, and two grandsons.

<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Donald Johnson, a World War II army  
veteran who headed the Veterans Administration during the last 
years of the Vietnam War, died Tuesday of complications of cancer. 
He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who headed the VA from 1969 to 1974, resigned under  
criticism for the Nixon administration's proposal to cut benefits 
for disabled Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	He later served as a top official in the Commerce Department, as  
chief of staff to Sen. Roger W. Jepson, R-Iowa, and then as 
executive director of the National Credit Union Administration. He 
retired in 1993.

<P>
	LOS ALTOS HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Thomas Jones, who began  
his career as a handyman for a flying circus and later developed a 
wing design as a NASA scientist that revolutionized air travel, 
died Wednesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Jones designed swept-back wings in 1944, jet wings were  
built perpendicular to the fuselage. Pivoting them back created 
less wind resistance, allowing for supersonic speeds with the same 
engine power. Virtually every commercial and military jet uses the 
design today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1927 but dropped  
out after his freshman year to join Charles Fower's flying circus. 
Jones received flying lessons in exchange for carrying gasoline 
cans and patching up holes in airplane wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones began his research career in 1934 when he joined the  
predecessor to NASA, the National Advisory Committee for 
Aeronautics, at its laboratory in Langley, Va. He transferred to 
NASA Ames in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, the year he retired, Jones received the Congressional  
Excalibur Award for his contributions to aeronautical science and 
the Smithsonian Institution's Langley Award, an honor also given to 
the Wright brothers and Charles Lindberg.

                         *Earle M. Jorgensen    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Earle M. Jorgensen, a steel entrepreneur and  
the last surviving member of Gov. Ronald Reagan's ``kitchen 
cabinet,'' died Wednesday at the age of 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen sold steel to California's burgeoning oil, aircraft  
and construction industries from the 1920s to the 1990s. The 
company he founded in 1921, now called EMJ Co., grew to sales of 
more than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained active in the steel business he founded until his  
death., 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen and his second wife, Marion, were among the social  
elite of Los Angeles. The couple remained close friends with Ronald 
and Nancy Reagan for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen was among a small group of Reagan advisers who urged  
the former movie star to run for governor, and then for the 
presidency. As governor, Reagan appointed Jorgensen to the State 
College Board of Trustees.

                           *Tommy Ridgley    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Vocalist Tommy Ridgley, a veteran performer  
from the golden age of New Orleans rhythm and blues, died Wednesday 
of lung cancer. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ridgley never had a national hit, his more than 70  
recordings have endured around the globe. He was a fixture in the 
city's nightclubs and at private functions for 50 years, and has 
been featured at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridgley signed with Decca Records in 1952 and produced  
``TraLaLa'' which was later covered by Pat Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recorded over the years for Atlantic Records, where he  
was billed as ``The New King of the Stroll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Ridgley released an acclaimed comeback album, ``Since  
the Blues Began,'' on Rounder Records. Last year Ridgley announced 
plans for a new CD, and remained optimistic about performing even 
after he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Move Early on Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel may agree to implement some provisions  
of the U.S.-brokered Wye agreement early if progress is made in 
current negotiations with the Palestinians, a senior Israeli 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Yatom, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's chief political  
adviser, told Israel radio the government would consider faster 
implementation of Wye if talks between the two sides ``mark up any 
achievements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peace negotiators have said they are determined to end the  
deadlock over implementing the Wye land-for-security agreement, 
under which Israel must withdraw from another 11 percent of the 
West Bank in two stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if no agreement is reached, Yatom said, Israel will start  
implementing the agreement on Sept. 1, and the next phase, during 
which Israel will withdraw from 5 percent of the West Bank, will 
begin on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides disagree on the schedule for the withdrawals. The  
Israelis want to spread them into next year and the Palestinians 
say they should be concluded by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today denied Israeli media  
reports that he was open to some delays, provided that Israel set 
exact dates for carrying out each of the provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about such a tradeoff, Arafat said: ``No, until now, we  
didn't accept it ... We are accepting what has been mentioned in 
the Wye River agreement and signed at the White House under the 
supervision of President Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians reject Barak's proposal that the last stage of  
withdrawal be integrated with the permanent settlement, which the 
two sides have not yet negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Barak's envoy Gilead Sher on Wednesday, the chief  
Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said: ``We will not change the 
Wye agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erekat and Sher are to meet again Sunday. If they reach an  
agreement, there will be a summit meeting between Barak and Arafat, 
Erekat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Wye agreement, Israel undertook the release of  
Palestinian prisoners and pledged to allow the Palestinians to open 
a seaport in Gaza. The Palestinians agreed to take action against 
militant groups, including confiscation of their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the shooting of a Jewish settler in the West Bank,  
Israeli soldiers today continued to blockade a Palestinian town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli army's chief of staff, Lieut. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, told  
Israel radio the settler was attacked by a cell of the Islamic 
Hamas group, and the blockade of Arabe, which has 30,000 
inhabitants, will continue until the Palestinian Authority arrests 
its members. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabe was sealed off on Tuesday night after the settler's car  
was ambushed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians are bitterly opposed to Jewish settlement in  
the West Bank and regard the settlements as an obstacle to peace. 
After the signing of the Wye agreement, settlers began seizing hill 
tops with the declared aim of making it more difficult for the 
government to hand over territory to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli army's judge advocate general has written a report  
that 30 of the 42 small outposts established by the Jewish settlers 
before the Barak government took office are illegal and cannot be 
defended if they are challenged in court, the newspaper Haaretz 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, the settlers claim the outposts are within the  
municipal boundaries of existing settlements, but the judge 
advocate general, Brig. Gen. Uri Shoham, wrote that the Supreme 
Court would probably reject this, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The army spokesman had no immediate response to the report.

<P>
	DIVIDE, Colo. (AP) -- Tom Hardeman, a former United Parcel  
Service executive, now runs an investment firm and serves on six 
company boards. Busy? Yes. But he says the workload of America's 
business leaders is nothing compared with that of pastors of 
Christian churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is unparalleled pressure on ministers,'' said Hardeman,  
who is board chairman for SonScape Re-Creation Ministries, which 
operates on 17 acres in the shadow of Pikes Peak. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are expected to be perfect administrators, perfect  
counselors, perfect fathers, perfect everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet they are human and sometimes give in to pressure, to  
temptation, to sin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bob Sewell and his wife, Sandy, saw the cost of  
mismanaged ministry and the temptations that invaded. They felt the 
burnout. So they founded SonScape, a place where ministers can 
spend time ``exhaling the fatigue and staleness of life and 
breathing deeply in the spirit of the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sewell said others can learn from his and Sandy's mistakes.  
``We did all the things incorrectly; things we're now telling 
people not to do. We worked too many hours. Ministry was at the 
core and center of everything we ate, thought, slept and 
accomplished in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing the danger, they sought help from friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``We needed help getting our lives back together,'' Bob Sewell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today they minister to ministers.  
</P>
<P>
	Couples or singles stay in duplex units at the center, where  
they are counseled, coached and prayed over, and given time to 
reflect and rest. Each eight-day session costs about $1,500 per 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sewells, who hold about a dozen sessions each year, focus on  
Christian ``spiritual disciplines.'' Silence and solitude, for 
example, is ``the art of listening to God,'' Bob Sewell said. 
Others are Bible study, prayer and worship. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressures on pastors come from several areas, the Sewells  
said. For one, society accepts behavior which once was considered a 
moral failing in friends, family, professionals and many role 
models -- but not pastors. Who cares if your neighbor had an affair? 
But your pastor? 
</P>
<P>
	There are also the perennial problems of politics, finance and  
control within congregations, reflected in an attitude that Sewell 
expressed this way: ``Pastor, we were here before you came, and 
we'll be here after you leave. We own the church, and we own the 
parsonage, and as long as you're here, we own you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third, a pastor also is under a higher authority.  
</P>
<P>
	``He must be under the authority of God and the Scriptures,''  
Sewell said. ``There are guidelines in the Scripture for what a 
pastor should be and what he's supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So failure happens. High-profile cases are well-known: Jim  
Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart, for example. But while the reprimand 
process for pastors who fail works for many church groups, 
rehabilitation is largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakker confessed to a relationship with a secretary; he was  
later convicted of defrauding followers of millions. He lost his 
PTL ministries, served five years in prison and was divorced. In 
recent months, he's ministered to the poor in inner-city Los 
Angeles. In Bakker's story, the Sewells see God's grace -- 
forgiveness and restoration following deserved punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ministers are too busy taking care of others to care for  
themselves. So SonScape's lessons point to the New Testament, where 
Jesus practiced getting away for personal rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives us the model. He went away to be alone,'' Bob Sewell  
said. ``The Scriptures do not say, 'and he was in a hurry.''' 
</P>
<P>
	SonScape tells pastors that doing a little preventive  
maintenance will allow them to be the strong, spiritual shepherds 
their congregations need. 
</P>
<P>
	Coloradans Gary and Suzanne Preston visited SonScape on the  
advice of friends after a difficult separation from a church where 
he had been pastor. They were discouraged and he was working in 
construction, never expecting to return to the ministry. ``We were 
done,'' Gary Preston said. ``We had nothing else to give.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But SonScape greeted them with a bouquet of flowers and a  
message they never expected: ``We believe you're OK. We don't 
believe you're perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're (back) in pastoral ministry because of SonScape,''  
Preston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tony Campolo, who was summoned by President Clinton to  
counsel him during the impeachment proceedings, endorsed SonScape 
but acknowledged he went only because his wife wanted to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when I got there, I realized I needed the help and the  
blessings that I received. I had a chance to reflect on my life 
using Scripture as a guide, and that reflection led me into a whole 
new rhythm for life,'' Campolo, a sociology professor at Eastern 
College in St. Davids, Pa., told the Sewells. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're in ministry, does that mean you're called to do your  
very best? The response is, `Yes,''' said Bob Sewell. ``(But) if 
you do not take care of yourself, if you're always tired, always 
weary, depressed, beaten down, empty spiritually, how do you give 
your very best? 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we give away what we do not possess?''

<HEADLINE> Mondale Preps Ventura for Trade Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- It was more than a typical meeting  
between two politicians from Minnesota when Walter Mondale, former 
vice president and ambassador to Japan, helped Gov. Jesse Ventura 
prepare for an upcoming trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota governor requested the meeting Wednesday with  
Mondale, who said he won't join Ventura on the November trip to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to be upstaged,'' Mondale quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	The governor spent about half an hour in his office with  
Mondale, who left his post as ambassador to Japan two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the experience so I listen to him,'' Ventura said of  
Mondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura used to wrestle professionally in Japan and is well  
known there. Mondale said the governor's stature in Japan will 
create possibilities that wouldn't be open to all governors.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Suspect Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white supremacist charged with shooting  
five people at a Jewish community center told investigators he also 
killed a Filipino-American postal worker because he was not white 
and worked for the federal government, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The account, based on an alleged confession by Buford O. Furrow  
Jr., came after Los Angeles County prosecutors charged him with 
murder and five counts of attempted murder -- all filed as hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors already had charged Furrow in the postman's  
slaying. The murder charges could bring the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	After the charges were announced, a shackled and handcuffed  
Furrow was led into a federal courtroom for arraignment. Looking 
around at the crowd of mostly reporters, he smiled and said to his 
public defender, ``They all like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn Turchin refused bail for Furrow,  
who has a history of mental problems and has had ties to hate 
groups in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators he believed the postal employee,  
Joseph Santos Ileto, 39, was a good ``target of opportunity'' 
because he was not white and worked for the government, U.S. 
Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow also told investigators that he thought Ileto was  
Hispanic or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was shot ``willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with  
premeditation,'' Mayorkas said, in a quiet San Fernando Valley 
community about an hour after five people were wounded at the 
nearby North Valley Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators he saw Ileto standing in uniform next  
to his postal van and asked if Ileto would mail a letter for him. 
When he agreed, Furrow allegedly pulled out a gun and shot him 
twice. Ileto tried to run, and Furrow said he shot him in the back 
until Ileto fell to the ground. Furrow allegedly fled in a stolen 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was shot nine times in the chest and the back of the head,  
Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the site of the shooting, Ileto's friends left a red balloon  
that read ``Miss You.'' With it were a small American flag, vases 
with yellow roses and five candles. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint federal-local task force will decide whether Furrow will  
be tried jointly by state and federal authorities or face separate 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayorkas said federal investigators are gathering additional  
evidence in the center shootings. ``We will file federal civil 
rights charges if the evidence so warrants,'' Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's complaint alleged that Ileto ``was  
intentionally killed because of his race or nationality.'' That 
allegation is part of state law dealing with hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was also charged with the attempted murders of Isabelle  
Shalometh, 68, a receptionist at the center; counselor Mindy 
Finkelstein, 16; and three young boys, Benjamin Kadish, Joshua 
Stepakoff and James Zidell. The most seriously wounded, 5-year-old 
Benjamin, shot twice, was in critical but stable condition 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	County prosecutors alleged that Furrow attacked the Jewish  
center ``because of the victims' religion or ancestry or perceived 
religion or ancestry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The center in Granada Hills, a middle-class neighborhood,  
remained closed Thursday, guarded by police and security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to reopen Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play in the sand, and we're going to paint, and  
we're going to have fun,'' said Gerry Volmar, a preschool teacher. 
The center's preschool and day campers have been meeting at a 
neighboring Episcopal church. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow surrendered Wednesday to the FBI in Las Vegas and was  
returned to Los Angeles that night aboard a U.S. Customs 
helicopter. He waived extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially said Furrow fled from Los Angeles to Las  
Vegas after the shootings in two taxis -- one to the 
California-Nevada line, the other the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, investigators said he took one taxi from Los  
Angeles to Las Vegas, spent the night at a hotel before taking 
another cab to an FBI office and confessing. Furrow said he wanted 
the attack to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovik Garibyan, the 31-year-old taxi driver who drove him from  
California, said Furrow paid him $800 for the ride. Furrow first 
asked to go to Los Angeles International Airport, then changed his 
mind, Garibyan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just paid me and he fell asleep,'' he said. ``He laid down  
in the back seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow may have visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of  
Tolerance in Los Angeles two or three months ago, said the 
director, Rabbi Marvin Hier. Staff members recall a man fitting his 
description entering the museum with a tour group but later 
wandering off by himself, ignoring exhibits that focus on the 
Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Building-Size Ads in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In Hollywood, where getting noticed is  
practically a mantra, advertisers are taking the idea to the 
heights. Like the Silver Tab clothing woman with the two-story-high 
hips, planting her feet near Hollywood and Vine. Or the 150-foot 
bottle of Pepsi offering to quench the thirst of a sweltering 
Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to cut through the visual clutter of billboards,  
advertisers are turning whole sides of buildings into murals. There 
is a booming market for what have been dubbed tall walls or 
supergraphics, which can cost advertisers as much as $60,000 a 
month and cover 5,000 to 20,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
	Some literally can be seen a mile away.  
</P>
<P>
	``Advertisers love 'em. They're cool,'' said Rick Robinson,  
creative director in Los Angeles for Phoenix-based Outdoor Systems, 
which creates some of the ads. ``It's a giant canvas. It's an urban 
gallery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although nobody keeps accurate figures, Robinson said there  
could be as many as 200 of the ads around the country. Southern 
California, with perhaps 40, is something of a supergraphics 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is used to big advertising. After all, the famous  
Hollywood sign originally promoted a housing development. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunset Strip, reviews were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Brian Smith, 30, of West Hollywood, said he loves the  
creativity of the images but also worries about their sheer size in 
an already ad-saturated culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``When everything is kind of like in your face ... you don't  
have to see it 100 feet tall driving down the Strip,'' he said. 
``There's a limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that is exactly why the ads flourish here. Unlike vertical  
Eastern cities, the Los Angeles area is mostly low-rise buildings 
that make the murals on the select high-rise buildings stand out. 
Also, the car culture means advertisers must pitch to a moving 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see the ad from 200 feet away in your little bubble of  
glass and steel,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The building-sized ad trend started about four or five years ago  
on the Sunset Strip, a glitzy area just outside Los Angeles 
boundaries that already was jammed with ads and giant billboards 
advertising movies, records and chic clothing. A growth plan 
legalized the 10-story ads, Robinson said, and when advertisers saw 
the result they ``went crazy for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New technology contributed. Lightweight, fire-resistant vinyl  
materials can be used as giant ``peel and stick'' signs or, as a 
mesh, can be placed over windows and still allow office workers to 
see out. Old-fashioned painting can take two weeks; the new 
materials can reduce that to a week or even a day, said Sean 
Robertson, Outdoor Systems' creative director in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the tall walls are much more expensive than standard  
billboards, they are cheaper than TV commercials or magazine ads 
and potentially can reach millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is exactly why the city wants to regulate them. The city  
has sign and billboard laws, but no existing ordinance to limit 
where the monster ads are placed, how long they can remain or how 
they are constructed. Some ads, with limited text, have been 
approved as cultural murals. 
</P>
<P>
	A Supergraphics Task Force is developing regulations and will  
present its recommendations to the City Council by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Without careful planning, the giant ads can become a ``visual  
blight'' and a traffic problem, said Daniel Hinerfeld, a deputy for 
City Councilman Mike Feuer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're huge,'' he said. ``These things are designed to  
distract people. That's their whole purpose ... and there are 
certain places in the city where you don't want to be distracting 
hundreds and thousands of motorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such problems could get worse as next generation technology  
makes giant moving ads affordable, Hinerfeld speculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a 10-story banner for ``Armageddon,'' showing a  
flaming meteorite flying through the side of a glass office 
building, was pulled after a few days when officials said it backed 
up rush hour traffic on nearby freeways for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ads also can be business-enhancing landmarks.  
</P>
<P>
	In Hollywood, a 108-by-198-foot vinyl mural for Apple Computers  
features John Lennon and Yoko Ono, holding flowers and peering 
benevolently over a nearby Mobil gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign is good for business, said Sam Farraji, the station's  
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tourists come ... and they take photographs, like it's  
something famous,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reagan's Near-Death Rumors Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ronald Reagan's family says there is no truth  
to rumors that the former president's health is rapidly 
deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan is in slow decline from Alzheimer's disease, but there  
has been no sudden change in his condition, his wife Nancy said 
Wednesday in an effort to put to rest rumors that he is near death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rumors are absolutely false,'' Nancy Reagan said in a  
statement read to The Associated Press by family spokeswoman Joanne 
Drake. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Reagan suffers from Alzheimer's, a progressive  
disease. However, there has been no dramatic change in his 
condition that would be cause for the alarming rumors that we are 
hearing,'' Mrs. Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that people would be more sensitive than this to the  
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Reagan's health have been swirling for weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. News &AMP; World Report item, published Monday, quoted  
unidentified sources as saying Reagan representatives have talked 
about logistics for a state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Tuesday, an e-mail on Reagan followed some redistributed  
versions of the California Senate Republican Caucus briefing that 
is sent out daily by state Sen. James Brulte, a Republican from 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rumors from newsrooms are that Ronald Reagan's health is  
fading and he is on a 36-hour death watch,'' the e-mail said. 
</P>
<P>
	A staffer in the office of state Sen. John Lewis, an Orange  
County Republican, sent the e-mail to the same group of people to 
which she redistributes the briefing and ``one of the people who 
got that assumed that it came from us,'' Brulte said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rumors spread Tuesday, Reagan was enjoying a scoop of  
sorbet outside Brentwood's Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop, manager 
Abbas Malik said. A Secret Service agent purchased the treat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just saw him the other day and he's fine. Quit scaring the  
family,'' son Michael Reagan said. ``My kids have to deal with it. 
People come up to them and they ask me if something's wrong with 
grandpa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, who disclosed in 1994 that he had the incurable brain  
disorder, now makes weekly appearances at his Century City office 
rather than the daily regimen he had maintained since leaving the 
White House, Ms. Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 88 years old and he maintains as physically active a  
schedule as possible,'' Ms. Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four million Americans have Alzheimer's, the degenerative  
disease of the brain, which attacks memory and eventually leads to 
total dependency on others for help in everyday needs such as 
eating and bathing.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Increases Border Patrols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan wants to avoid a further  
escalation of tensions with India and has increased border patrols 
with F-16 fighters to prevent Indian intrusions, Pakistan's foreign 
minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-line aircraft were deployed at Pakistan's southern  
border with India, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said, as the 
nuclear rivals remained on high alert after two days of air clashes 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions soared Tuesday when an Indian jet downed a Pakistani  
naval patrol plane, and Pakistan responded the following day, 
firing a missile at an Indian fighter it says entered Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The downing of the Pakistani aircraft was an example of India's  
``trigger happy attitude, which is not conducive to peace and 
stability in this area,'' Aziz said in an exclusive interview with 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that Pakistan ``would certainly not like to initiate  
any (incidents) and we hope India won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a U.S. appeal Wednesday for both sides to exercise  
restraint, India today accused Pakistan of violating a 1991 
agreement that bans combat aircraft from coming within six miles of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
	India said the Pakistani naval plane flew into its territory and  
returned to Pakistan after it was hit. Most of the wreckage was 
found in Pakistan, but parts of the plane were scattered along the 
border, India said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan accused India of stealing pieces of the wreckage. ``It  
was such a cruel attempt to prove the Indian viewpoint,'' said 
Aziz, who argued the plane was just inside Pakistan when it was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing whether the Pakistani aircraft violated Indian  
airspace during its flight, Aziz said, ``Suppose it did. ... How 
can a propeller plane like this threaten a jet?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aziz has accused India of violating the 1991 agreement but did  
not specifically say whether Pakistani aircraft were abiding by it. 
He did not discuss the U.S. statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indian capital of New Delhi, Foreign Office spokesman  
Raminder Jassal told reporters that India wanted peace talks with 
Pakistan but the alleged air incursion was ``not conducive to the 
normalization of relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aziz agreed that both sides want peace, but he said that a  
lasting peace can only come once both sides have solved their 
dispute over Kashmir, a Himalayan territory claimed by India and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two nations came to the brink of war this summer during an  
11-week confrontation in the mountains of Kashmir. India said 
Pakistani troops had infiltrated its territory, but Pakistan denied 
that its soldiers were involved and said all the fighters were 
local Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained  
independence from Britain in 1947; two of the conflicts were over 
Kashmir. This week's aerial clash was the first since they went to 
war in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kashmir today, suspected separatist guerrillas triggered a  
mine, killing two Indian commandos and injuring three others, 
Indian military officials said. The blast was near northern 
Bandipora, 40 miles north of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan claims that Indian forces fighting the Islamic  
insurgents in Kashmir routinely abuse civilians in the 
overwhelmingly Muslim territory, two-thirds of which is controlled 
by India. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan cannot be a silent spectator to such brutal  
repression,'' Sartaj said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has acknowledged what  
he has called isolated incidents of rights violations by security 
forces in Kashmir, but he has said his government was committed to 
rooting out abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan frequently has called for international mediation of  
the Kashmir dispute, which India has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Pakistan's top civilian and military leaders  
gathered for a memorial service for the 16 servicemen killed when 
the naval plane was shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering brief prayers, Pakistani leaders stood before the  
coffins, covered with flowers and draped in green and white 
Pakistani flags. 
</P>
<P>
	At the service, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif warned India that  
``Pakistan is capable of safeguarding itself. We will do everything 
to safeguard our sovereignty and national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the downing of the aircraft ``further complicated the  
matter of normalization'' between Pakistan and India.

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Oakland Athletics are the best home team in baseball this  
season -- except, of course, when they play the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees beat the Athletics 5-3 at Oakland on Wednesday  
night. It marked the second time this season that the Yankees won 
two of three at the A's stadium, where Oakland is a major 
league-best 41-19. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the Yankees won with the help of a three-run homer in  
the seventh and a key single in the ninth by Bernie Williams, who 
has 20 RBIs in his last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was too much Bernie Williams for us. That three-run  
homer was what really hurt us, and he also came through in the 
ninth,'' A's manager Art Howe said. ``It was a heck of a game, but 
the wrong team won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other AL games, it was Boston 9, Kansas City 3; Seattle 11,  
Chicago 2; Baltimore 4, Tampa Bay 2; Toronto 6, Minnesota 3; Texas 
8, Detroit 2; and Cleveland 4, California 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' homer in the seventh helped the Yankees wipe out a 2-0  
deficit. After Oakland tied the score in the bottom of the inning 
on a wild pitch by Alan Watson, New York won it with a two-run 
ninth highlighted by Tino Martinez's tie-breaking RBI single of the 
right-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's single off Doug Jones (3-4) came after Williams  
singled and Chili Davis walked. Ricky Ledee followed Martinez's 
decisive hit with a run-scoring double as the Yankees improved 
their road record to 34-22, second-best in the AL behind 
Cleveland's 35-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson (2-1) got four outs for the victory. Mariano Rivera  
pitched the ninth for his 32nd save as the Yankees won for the 
seventh time in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi had a sacrifice fly in the first and Ben Grieve hit  
his 19th homer for the A's in the second as Oakland took a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Red Sox 9, Royals 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Bret Saberhagen, back in the ballpark where he won two Cy Young  
Awards, allowed four hits in eight innings to lead Boston to 
victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen (9-4) struck out three and didn't walk a batter for  
the 10th time in 17 starts. Saberhagen, 110-78 for the Royals from 
1984-91, gave up a solo home run in the second to Mike Sweeney, who 
extended his hitting streak to 23 games, and another solo homer in 
the eighth to Tim Spehr. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Huskey and Mike Stanley homered for the Red Sox. Jose  
Rosado (7-9) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Mariners 11, White Sox 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, Alex Rodriguez homered and drove in five runs as the  
Mariners beat Chicago for a three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who went 3-for-4, has 28 homers, all since he was  
activated from the disabled list May 14. He hit an RBI single in 
the first, a two-run single in the fourth and a two-run homer in 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgar Martinez and Raul Ibanez hit also hit two-run homers for  
Seattle, which handed Chicago its seventh straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners starter Paul Abbott (3-0) allowed two runs and three  
hits in five innings. Jaime Navarro (7-10) was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Orioles 4, Devil Rays 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Mike Mussina stopped his three-game losing streak and B.J.  
Surhoff and Albert Belle hit consecutive homers as Baltimore won at 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mussina (14-7) rebounded from losing three consecutive starts  
for the first time in his career. Mussina gave up two runs and nine 
hits in 7 2-3 innings, striking out seven and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
	Surhoff and Belle hit solo homers in the fifth inning. Tampa Bay  
starter Rolando Arrojo (2-8) went six innings, allowing three runs 
and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Blue Jays 6, Twins 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Chris Carpenter pitched a complete game for his sixth straight  
win, and Carlos Delgado hit his 35th homer as Toronto won at 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter (9-5) allowed only six singles and a two-run homer in  
the ninth inning. The right-hander struck out a season-high nine 
and walked none for his fourth complete game of the season and 
sixth of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter hasn't lost in 10 starts since May 28, when he was  
beaten 10-6 by the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Milton (4-9) took the loss despite striking out a  
career-high 12. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Rangers 8, Tigers 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Rick Helling pitched a six-hitter for his second complete game  
of the season and Tom Goodwin drove in three runs as Texas beat 
visiting Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling (9-7) won his third straight decision, striking out  
eight and walking two in the seventh complete game of his career. 
Texas is 20-6 since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro and Roberto Kelly homered for the Rangers, who  
have won four straight against the Tigers and are 22-5 against the 
AL Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Blair (1-9), making his first start since May 26  
following 19 straight relief appearances, allowed seven runs and 
nine hits in 5 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Indians 4, Angels 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Manny Ramirez hit his 30th homer and Roberto Alomar added his  
20th as Cleveland won at Anaheim to complete a three-game sweep and 
send the Angels to their sixth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, who hit 45 homers last year, connected off Lou Pote in  
the eighth for his second homer in two nights and raised his major 
league-leading RBIs total to 116. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Burba (9-7) allowed one run and seven hits in six innings.  
Steve Sparks (5-9) lost for the fifth time in his last six 
decisions.

<HEADLINE> Nun Arrested for Racist Grafitti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOLIET, Ill. (AP) -- A 66-year-old nun has been arrested for  
scrawling racist graffiti in a hospital where she worked as a 
chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Sister Dorothy Toman, a Franciscan nun, admitted  
that she was responsible for graffiti found in the emergency room 
lobby and in a washroom at Provena Saint Joseph Medical Center. She 
was arrested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She confessed right away,'' said Joliet Police Capt. James  
Grace. ``She said she did it because she wanted to see how the 
hospital would react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toman was charged with two counts of criminal defacement of  
property, punishable by six to 12 months in jail. She was released 
on $100 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The graffiti included anti-black and white supremacy messages,  
according to hospital spokesman Clint Giese. She was fired 
immediately after her confession. 
</P>
<P>
	The graffiti began to appear after racist literature was  
distributed at the hospital in May in two separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Giese said Toman is not a suspect in those incidents and denied  
involvement during police questioning.

<HEADLINE> Bayer Second Quarter Profits Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) -- A difficult second quarter hurt Bayer  
AG's first-half profit margins, but the German pharmaceutical maker 
said Thursday its full-year operating profit should be close to 
last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the first half of 1999 slipped 2 percent to $15.2  
billion, falling short of analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half operating profit fell 3.7 percent to $1.6 billion,  
excluding $1 billion in proceeds from the stock market flotation of 
a 65 percent stake in its Belgian photo-imaging group Agfa-Gevaert 
NV. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer said a second-half economic upturn for the industry will  
help it implement much-needed price increases, especially in 
chemicals. It said it expects operating profit to come close to 
last year's levels of $3.4 billion, and said the gain from Agfa 
will push net income well ahead of last year's $1.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Some Getting Sick From 'Blair Witch' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- You may want to pick up an extra bag with your  
popcorn at the concession stand before seeing the ``The Blair Witch 
Project,'' which is stirring up more than fear among some 
motion-sick moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget horror thriller, mostly shot with shaky hand-held  
cameras, is raking in millions around the country. But it's not a 
favorite of the theater workers who have to clean up the mess left 
by those who get queasy watching the movie's often herky-jerky, 
first-person perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first weekend someone threw up in the women's restroom,  
the men's restroom and in the hallway,'' said Kris Monroe, manager 
at Lefont Plaza Theater in Atlanta. ``It's not pleasant to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy -- he was really cool -- he threw up in the restroom and  
he just came out and asked us for a mop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film, which has taken in $80 million since its  
release, follows three student filmmakers as they venture into the 
woods to track the legendary Blair Witch. 
</P>
<P>
	The mock documentary features footage supposedly shot by the  
students and discovered in the woods a year after their 
disappearance. Unlike many horror films, blood or gore is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenes that make people sick involve quick switches from  
close-up ground shots to views of the tree tops. And throughout the 
film, which runs one hour and 27 minutes, the picture is often 
grainy and out of focus. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the queasy reaction to the movie didn't surprise  
producer Robin Cowie, who said people had panic attacks during the 
initial screening and at the Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard different analysis of why it happens. Some simply  
may get a little motion sickness, that combined with the tension 
and the pace of the film,'' Cowie said. ``It's such an intense 
roller-coaster ride. The buzz we're hearing is it's sort of a 
challenge to see if you can get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Helen Cohen of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston  
explains: ``If you're sitting still, you fool your system into 
thinking that you're moving if objects are being moved back and 
forth in front of you. You assume that you're moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For viewers, especially those up front in the theater, their  
entire visual field is filled up by the screen. They have no visual 
cues to tell them that they are not moving, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone vomits at just about every showing of the movie at AMC  
Colonial 18 in suburban Lawrenceville, said Bonnie Hunsaker, 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past weekend we put up a sign that said the hand-held  
camera can create motion sickness and if you're susceptible to 
motion sickness you may want to rethink your viewing choice,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If people begin to feel ill, they should close their eyes for a  
moment or look away from the screen and focus on something else, 
theater managers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kendall Square Cinema in Cambridge, Mass., assistant  
manager Nancy Campbell said she has started making announcements 
informing moviegoers to leave the cinema if they feel nauseated. 
Cinema staffers were upset about having to clean up the messy 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond the scope of service we like to provide here,''  
Ms. Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Walston of Atlanta had the unfortunate experience of  
witnessing the reaction of one moviegoer while viewing the film at 
Atlanta's Tara Cinema. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Portland WNBA Team Hires Native </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland's WNBA expansion team has  
essentially acquired its first player for the 2000 season, naming 
Oregon native Katy Steding to a front-office job Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Steding, who will be community liaison for the Portland team,  
said she expects the job will lead to a spot on the roster when the 
WNBA's fourth season begins next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first logical step in that progression of  
things,'' the former ABL player said. 
</P>
<P>
	The still-unnammed Portland team, along with the other new teams  
in Miami, Seattle and Indianapolis, won't officially get new 
players until the league holds its expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Steding, 31, still can play. The 6-foot forward averaged 8.4  
points and 3.9 rebounds a game during two seasons with the Portland 
Power of the now-defunct ABL. 
</P>
<P>
	Steding, who grew up in Lake Oswego, was a three-time All-Pac-10  
selection at Stanford. She was named to the all-Final Four team in 
1990 when the Cardinal won the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first player assigned to Portland when the ABL  
opened for business in 1996, and she remained with the team until 
the league shut down last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Steding decided against trying to catch on with any of the 12  
teams in the WNBA this season. Instead she stayed in Portland to 
run youth basketball camps.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Games Win Battle With Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic organizers won the first  
stage of a court battle with an American-based band company in the 
Supreme Court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Bryson refused an injunction sought by World  
Projects Corp. which would have prevented SOCOG from holding the 
opening ceremony of next year's Games without the involvement of 
the international band. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not prepared to vary the arrangements I made for an  
expedited hearing on Monday,'' Justice Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	WPC president Bill Lutt is negotiating with SOCOG to have an  
international marching band in the Games opening ceremony involving 
student musicians from 20 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight says the organizers have offered  
an extra $520,000 to put together the band. He said WPC was asking 
for $780,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If the matter is not settled out of court, the sides are due  
back in the Supreme Court on Monday. WPC is suing SOCOG and Knight, 
seeking damages or the reinstatement of the foreign musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG remains keen to have the matter resolved in the next  
couple days so further expensive legal action can be averted. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG vetoed ceremonies director Ric Birch's plan for a  
2,000-member band, including 1,300 American and 200 Japanese 
students, in June because of a public backlash against the lack of 
Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	WPC and SOCOG then agreed on a band including members from six  
continents, with about 900 Australians making up the largest 
component.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia OKs Genocide Trials Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Ignoring U.N. criticism, parliament  
voted overwhelmingly Thursday to allow genocide and war crimes 
trials to be delayed by up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Assembly had passed a main article of the proposed  
law Wednesday. It passed the entire package Thursday by a vote of 
86-8. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law lets courts extend a six-month pretrial detention  
limit by up to three years for charges of genocide, war crimes or 
crimes against humanity. It will likely delay the trial of the 
architects of the Khmer Rouge genocide between 1975 to 1979, when 
some 1.7 million Cambodians died. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human  
Rights circulated through parliament during the debate Thursday, 
adding fuel to fierce argument by the opposition that the bill was 
deeply flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter to parliament speaker and FUNCINPEC party leader  
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, U.N. human rights official Rosemary 
McCreery warned that the new law violates several international 
legal conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said it is ``legally unsound to extend pretrial  
detention periods for crimes which do not yet exist in Cambodia 
law.'' Cambodia's legislature has never ratified the 1948 
international convention against genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law was conceived by Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian  
People's Party as a Sept. 9 trial deadline for Khmer Rouge general 
Ta Mok approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Ta Mok and one other senior Khmer Rouge figure are in  
custody. Several others are living freely in Cambodia under deals 
reached with the government that ended the civil war they fought 
after losing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Hun Sen has said he intends to bring Khmer Rouge leaders  
to justice, critics fear he will influence the trial process to 
ensure no current national leaders are embarrassed by past 
associations with the Khmer Rouge. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party is led by former Khmer Rouge who escaped bloody purges and 
returned to topple their former comrades in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law comes as Cambodia and the United Nations are  
negotiating the formation of a joint genocide tribunal for Khmer 
Rouge leaders.

<HEADLINE> DC To Enforce Juvenile Curfew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beginning the day after Labor Day, anyone 16  
or younger will have to be off the streets of the nation's capital 
by 11 p.m. on most nights -- midnight on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the curfew will curb crime. Opponents say it  
violates constitutional rights and discriminates against minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted an  
injunction against the law, clearing the way for the city to put it 
into effect, Executive Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers who pick up curfew violators will take them home, not  
to a detention center, Gainer said. That way, if there is a problem 
at home, the officer can muster other city services to try to help 
the family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the D.C. Council have said the curfew,  
combined with recreational, work and other programs for young 
people, can protect juveniles from becoming either victims or 
perpetrators of crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the American Civil Liberties Union has opposed the law in  
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a free country,'' said Arthur B. Spitzer, legal  
director for the ACLU in the nation's capital. ``We don't put 
people under house arrest for their own protection.''

<P>
	Philadelphia Phillies fans booed J.D. Drew for four innings. In  
the fifth, Drew sent them a small white response. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew's 434-foot solo home run capped a tumultuous stay at  
Veterans Stadium, blocking out the boos and leading the St. Louis 
Cardinals to a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's timing is perfect,'' said Drew, who received massive  
police and security presence after having batteries thrown at him 
in the outfield Tuesday night. ``The biggest key to me is to enjoy 
the game and play as hard as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drew was drafted by the Phillies in 1997, but didn't sign with  
them after asking for an $11.5 million, five-year contract. He 
returned to the draft the following year, was taken by St. Louis 
and signed for $7 million for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has established himself as one of baseball's best  
young hitters, although he hasn't made many friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was booed every place he played since last September,''  
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``He went about his business. 
This guy's been terrific. He's got a chance to be outstanding. He 
just needs experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, it was Arizona 7, Chicago 5 in 11 innings;  
Florida 6, San Francisco 5 in 10 innings; Colorado 8, Milwaukee 5; 
Pittsburgh 5, Cincinnati 4; Atlanta 8, Houston 5; Los Angeles 9, 
Montreal 7; and New York 12, San Diego 5. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Garrett Stephenson (3-0) allowed one run and  
five hits in 7 1-3 innings, retiring 14 straight at one stretch. 
Randy Wolf (5-4) took the loss, allowing three runs and six hits in 
five innings, walking five and striking out seven. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Arizona 7, Chicago 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams hit a two-run double in the 11th inning and had  
four RBIs as Arizona beat Chicago at Wrigley Field and opened a 
7 1/2-game lead in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, who have won five straight, are 66-49 and  
topped their win total from 1998. Chicago has lost five straight 
and 11 of 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson, who struck out 11 in eight innings and left with  
a 5-3 lead, lost a chance for the win when the Cubs tied the game 
in the ninth on Henry Rodriguez's RBI double and Glenallen Hill's 
run-scoring infield single. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Marlins 6, Giants 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Mike Lowell singled home the winning run off Robb Nen (3-6) in  
the 10th as host Florida overcame a four-run deficit for the third 
consecutive game against San Francisco, which has lost nine of 12. 
The Marlins have won six straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida trailed 5-1 before Lowell, who had a grand slam in  
Monday's comeback, hit a three-run pinch-hit homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Sanchez (4-4) pitched two scoreless innings.  
</P>
<P>
                        *Rockies 8, Brewers 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Edgard Clemente hit a two-run homer off Steve Woodard (11-7) and  
had three RBIs to help Colorado stop a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Angel Echevarria and Vinny Castilla drove in two runs each as  
the Rockies outhit the Brewers 14-10 and completed a 4-8 road trip. 
Milwaukee finished a 3-9 homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Jones (6-9) gave up two runs and four hits in five  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Pirates 5, Reds 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Brian Giles' two-run double in the ninth off Cincinnati relief  
ace Scott Williamson rallied Pittsburgh past the Reds, who lost for 
only the 11th time in 44 road games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Williams (2-2) got the victory despite allowing Dmitri  
Young's RBI double in the top of the ninth. Williamson (10-5) blew 
his sixth save in 22 chances and took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Braves 8, Astros 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Bret Boone and Chipper Jones hit consecutive homers for the  
second straight night, and Jose Hernandez also homered as Atlanta 
completed a three-game sweep of visiting Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (14-6), who has won four consecutive decisions and  
seven of his last eight, allowed five runs and 11 hits in 5 1-3 
innings. Jose Lima (15-7) dropped to 0-4 against Atlanta, giving up 
six runs and nine hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Dodgers 9, Expos 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Eric Karros hit his first career grand slam and tied a career  
high with six RBIs as Los Angeles rallied from a six-run deficit to 
win at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros had hit the most homers among active major leaguers  
without hitting a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Mets 12, Padres 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Edgardo Alfonzo homered and tied a career high with five RBIs at  
Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza went 3-for-4 with three RBIs to break out of an  
0-for-9 slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn left in the fifth inning with a sore left knee he  
aggravated sliding into third base. Gwynn, who singled in the first 
for his 3,007th career hit to tie Al Kaline for 20th on the career 
list, is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has lost five in a row.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Falls in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spain's unemployment rate fell to 15.6  
percent in the second quarter of 1999, from 17 percent in the first 
quarter, the National Statistics Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of unemployed, including first-time job seekers, fell  
to 2.55 million in the second quarter from a 2.76 million in the 
first quarter, the Institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	The INE's quarterly unemployment data is based on the results a  
survey of around 64,000 families throughout Spain. It is watched 
more closely than the Spanish Labor Ministry's monthly 
jobless-claims figure as it includes information on everyone out of 
work, rather just than those eligible for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the downward trend, unemployment in Spain remains far  
higher than the European Union average of 9.4 percent for June.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Wants Westchester NY Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGEMONT, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has settled on  
Westchester County as her future home, her spokeswoman says, and 
the first lady checked out a house near Scarsdale that carries a 
$1.7 million price tag and annual taxes of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton rolled up in a limousine Wednesday morning to see  
the house in Edgemont, a hamlet in the Town of Greenburgh. Secret 
Service agents had other potential customers wait outside as the 
first lady took a tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, would not say whether  
she made a bid on the house. But she said President Clinton and the 
first lady ``have narrowed their search to Westchester. They're 
actively considering several options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in  
New York, must move to the state by Election Day 2000 to be 
eligible. Some say she should move as soon as possible to deflate 
any carpetbagging charge. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the door at the Edgemont house Wednesday  
night and said she was a friend of the owners said in French that 
Mrs. Clinton ``doesn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's true -- rather than just bargaining strategy -- it may  
be a relief to other agents. One who was kept outside the house 
while Mrs. Clinton inspected it said her own client had been ready 
to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were negotiating and obviously we're dead in the water.  
Would you want to bid against the first lady?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house is a turn-of-the-century colonial on three acres, a  
large spread for southern Westchester. It has 12 rooms, including 
seven bedrooms and two dining rooms, plus 6 1/2 bathrooms. It is white 
with black shutters and a pillared portico. There is an elevator 
inside and a barn outside. 
</P>
<P>
	President and Mrs. Clinton earned $504,109 last year, including  
more than $275,000 in capital gains and business income, and paid 
$89,951 in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the president's salary and Mrs. Clinton's income  
from a book she wrote entitled ``It Takes A Village'', The first 
family received $53,462 in short-term capital gains and $146,856 in 
long-term capital gains -- both from the Pell Rudman Trust Co., 
which holds a private trust for the Clintons.

<HEADLINE>  Lions Tired of Talking About Sanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Coach Bobby Ross and the rest of  
the Detroit Lions are tired of questions about Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even talk about Barry anymore,'' wide receiver  
Johnnie Morton said Thursday of the star running back, who 
announced his retirement two weeks ago. ``It's kind of getting 
blown out of proportion. It seems as if he's seen in a supermarket, 
everyone writes about it, and then we're asked about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's retired, just let him be.''  
</P>
<P>
	Added quarterback Charlie Batch: ``We can't stop a season just  
because he stopped playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ross, he brushed away questions even before they were  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to comment on it,'' the coach said. ``I'm not  
going to talk about it. You're wasting your time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders reportedly returned Wednesday night from a European  
vacation that has occupied him since abruptly announcing his 
retirement July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his retirement, Sanders said his desire to quit  
football outweighed his desire to play -- even for the 1,458 yards 
he needs to break Walter Payton's career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' father has said he would try to arrange a meeting  
between his son and Lions Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. But 
as late as Wednesday, the elder Sanders has said he hasn't heard 
from his son in weeks and was awaiting a call from him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press reported Friday that the Lions have begun  
the process of reclaiming the unearned portion of the $11 million 
signing bonus Sanders received when he signed a six-year contract 
in 1997. The Lions are seeking a $7.3 million repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief operating officer Chuck Schmidt said Thursday that the  
Lions had discussed the payback procedure with Sanders' agents, 
David Ware of Atlanta and Lamont Smith of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early in the week, and then we said we were going to touch  
back with them in a week,'' Schmidt said. ``We didn't set a 
timetable, but we left it open that we're going to talk to each 
other fairly soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left Thursday with Ware were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Lions security director Allen Hughes, a family friend, has been  
staying with Wiliam Sanders in Wichita. The elder Sanders has said 
Hughes stay there was more pleasure than business. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he never pressured the elder Sanders to try to get  
his son to come back to the team. He didn't have to -- Sanders 
already had promised his friend even before the visit that he would 
do anything he could to help. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hughes said he came to visit the Sanders family in  
response to a long-standing invitation -- not at the Lions' urging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he said. ``I  
came here to relax and have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders has avoided all contact with the Lions' front  
office and coaching staff since the final game of last season. Ross 
tried to contact him through 13 telephone calls or handwritten 
letters, but Sanders never responded. 
</P>
<P>
	In talking about Friday's opening exhibition with Atlanta, Ross  
never mentioned the team's chances without Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he alluded briefly to Atlanta's All-Pro running back, Jamal  
Anderson who ended his contract holdout Wednesday and returned to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During the team's drills Thursday, there were unavoidable  
reminders of Sanders' absence. Many fans wore No. 20 jerseys. Near 
the team's practice field, a public-address system blared last 
season's highlights of Sanders, touted by the announcer as ``the 
standard by which all other running backs are measured.''

back with them in a week,'' Schmidt said. ``We didn't set a 
timetable, but we left it open that we're going to talk to each 
other fairly soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left Thursday with Ware were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Lions security director Allen Hughes, a family friend, has been  
staying with Wiliam Sanders in Wichita. The elder Sanders has said 
Hughes stay there was more pleasure than business. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he never pressured the elder Sanders to try to get  
his son to come back to the team. He didn't have to -- Sanders 
already had promised his friend even before the visit that he would 
do anything he could to help. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Hughes said he came to visit the Sanders family in  
response to a long-standing invitation -- not at the Lions' urging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he said. ``I  
came here to relax and have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders has avoided all contact with the Lions' front  
office and coaching staff since the final game of last season. Ross 
tried to contact him through 13 telephone calls or handwritten 
letters, but Sanders never responded. 
</P>
<P>
	In talking about Friday's opening exhibition with Atlanta, Ross  
never mentioned the team's chances without Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he alluded briefly to Atlanta's All-Pro running back, Jamal  
Anderson who ended his contract holdout Wednesday and returned to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During the team's drills Thursday, there were unavoidable  
reminders of Sanders' absence. Many fans wore No. 20 jerseys. Near 
the team's practice field, a public-address system blared last 
season's highlights of Sanders, touted by the announcer as ``the 
standard by which all other running backs are measured.''

<HEADLINE> Big Crops Projected Despite Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While farmers' fields parch in the East, much  
of America's heartland has had sufficient rain and that means 
bumper crops and little help for depressed commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's soybean crop is shaping up to be the biggest on  
record, and the corn harvest would be the third largest, the 
Agriculture Department reported Wednesday. Big crops of cotton and 
rice are expected across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of tighter world supplies and improved exports, USDA  
expects a modest increase in prices for some commodities -- 20 cents 
a bushel for soybeans and 5 cents a bushel for corn -- from what was 
forecast a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher prices could save the government as much as $1  
billion in crop subsidies, but many farmers still wouldn't recover 
their cost of production, so the rosier projections are unlikely to 
slow a drive in Congress to pass a major bailout of the 
agricultural economy. The Senate last week approved a $7.4 billion 
package of farm assistance; the House has yet to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time where there is nowhere to hide,'' said Doug  
Wilson, who grows corn and soybeans in north-central Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is most acute in the Northeast -- the entire states  
of New Jersey, Connecticut and West Virginia as well as most of 
Maryland -- have been declared disaster areas. But Ohio and parts of 
Indiana and Illinois have been short of water, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's soybeans are healthy, but his corn was hurt by July's  
heat wave, he said. ``What scared me the most was where it looks 
like we are, a mediocre crop with a mediocre to poor price,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest impact of the drought could be on dairy farmers.  
Milk prices are expected to rise as much as 50 cents per hundred 
pounds because of strong demand for cheese and declining milk 
production in the parched Northeast. Cows make less milk when it's 
hot, and pastures are drying up from the lack of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern peach crops have been largely untouched by the drought,  
although the fruit is smaller than normal. Pennsylvania is expected 
to produce 68 million pounds, 3 million more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's production forecasts reflect field conditions Aug. 1.  
Even as they were released Wednesday, rain fell from the northern 
Plains across the Midwest, which could increase crop yields and 
depress prices, especially for late-developing soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we're sitting here, the soybean plants out back have gained  
another bushel or two,'' said Joe Victor, a commodity analyst with 
Allendale Inc. of McHenry, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The soybean harvest is forecast at 2.9 billion bushels, up 4  
percent from last year. Corn production is expected to dip 2 
percent this year to 9.6 billion bushels, but that is 4 percent 
above 1997's harvest. Most corn and soybeans are used for animal 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expected the average price of corn to range from  
$1.70 to $2.10 this year. Soybean prices should average $4.10 to 
$4.90 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton production is expected to be up by a third from last year  
when there was a severe drought across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The rice crop is expected to be a record 21 billion pounds, up  
12 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat production is down 9 percent, as many farmers switched to  
other crops they thought would be more lucrative this year. But 
world wheat stocks are rising because of a big crop in China this 
year, so USDA doesn't expect prices to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see much of anything that would change our net farm  
income,'' said USDA economist Larry Salathe.

<HEADLINE> Same Sex Harassment Suit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- A meat packing company and the U.S.  
Equal Opportunity Commission have agreed to a $1.9 million 
settlement in the first male-on-male sex harassment lawsuit to 
receive class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Prairie Packing Co. Inc. settled the lawsuit filed on  
behalf of workers who alleged they were subject to repeated verbal 
and physical harassment by co-workers. Long Prairie is 104 miles 
northwest of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes more than a year after the U.S. Supreme  
Court ruled that same-sex harassment may violate federal law 
prohibiting sex discrimination in employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Few details beyond the settlement's total were disclosed, and  
the company admitted no wrongdoing in Wednesday's consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few companies have entered into settlements that are so  
emphatic,'' said Lloyd Zimmerman, senior trial attorney for the 
EEOC in Minneapolis. ``We appreciate that they're settling with us 
without putting us through three or four years of expensive 
litigation about matters that are private and painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.9 million settlement will be distributed to all eligible  
claimants. Men who worked at the company between Jan. 1, 1996, and 
June 22, 1999, and were subject to harassment, may send a 
confidential letter to the EEOC, which will assess the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Prairie Packing currently employs 235 people -- 85 percent  
of whom are male. The number of men eligible to file claims was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company said it also has settled civil lawsuits  
filed by three former workers, who alleged various incidents of 
sexually explicit and violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
	One male worker said in court documents that he was jumped by  
groups of men who held him down, sometimes in a bin of raw meat or 
a trough of blood. The worker said the sometimes daily occurrences 
involved simulated sex acts on him. He said at least one supervisor 
took part and another threatened to fire him when he complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of those settlements were not released and the former  
workers and their attorneys declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Long Prairie Packing would not say whether any of the allegedly  
offending workers or supervisors were fired or disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the EEOC settlement, the company must establish a  
``zero tolerance'' policy for sexual or disability-based harassment 
and institute mandatory sexual harassment training for all plant 
employees, supervisors, managers and new employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are fully committed to providing our employees a workplace  
that is free of discrimination and harassment,'' said Chief 
Executive Officer Tom Rosen in a prepared statement. ``We are 
pleased that we were able to resolve the matter without resorting 
to litigation.''

<HEADLINE> Krispy Kreme May Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Krispy Kreme may soon sell more than  
just hot glazed doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston-Salem-based Krispy Kreme is considering an initial  
public offering of shares of its common stock, the company said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they plan to file registration papers for  
the possible IPO later this year and to complete the offering in 
early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Krispy Kreme has flourished, mainly in the South, since it began  
61 years ago. But is has expanded to about 130 stores in 17 states, 
including ones in New York City, St. Louis, Omaha and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Krispy Kreme announced last year it was moving toward  
establishing 400 stores in five years. In 1998, Krispy Kreme's had 
sales of $203.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the stock offering is contingent on a number of  
factors, including market conditions.

<HEADLINE> Sega of America President Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The president of Sega of America Inc. has  
been replaced just as the video-game maker is about to launch a 
high-powered console designed to revive flagging sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Stolar's departure, effective immediately, was announced  
Wednesday, three weeks before launch of the Dreamcast game system. 
Sega did not say whether Stolar, who has been a marketing force for 
Dreamcast, was fired or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiro Kezuka is replacing him, becoming vice chairman and  
chief operating officer. Kezuka joined Sega of America this year as 
deputy chairman. He was head of domestic sales and distribution for 
Sega Enterprises Ltd., the Japanese parent company and previously 
served as president at Honda France. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Svensson, editor in chief of MCV, a video-game trade  
magazine, said the timing of the change in leadership was 
``extremely bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dreamcast has been gaining support over the past six  
months and presales are stronger than Sega expected,'' he said. 
``But this is going to confuse people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kezuka predicted that the change will not affect the Dreamcast  
launch, scheduled for 15,000 stores on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-powered, Internet-ready Dreamcast system is Sega's  
comeback attempt. Sega posted $375 million in losses for the fiscal 
year ending in March and is forecasting a loss of $99 million for 
the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega says 200,000 consoles have already been pre-sold in the  
United States, the strongest launch ever for a video game console. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival consoles Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 do not offer  
built-in Internet connections, which allow players in compete 
against one another online. The Dreamcast console is also faster 
and more powerful.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Agent Wants Others Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) -- The agent of disgraced track star Ben  
Johnson has some tough words for sprinter Ato Boldon and others who 
have criticized his client. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview from Toronto, Morris Chrobotek told The  
Associated Press on Thursday that he believes 99.9 percent of track 
athletes are taking banned drugs, but said Johnson was no longer 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrobotek's comments came after Boldon said earlier Thursday  
that the sport was at its lowest point since Johnson tested 
positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would welcome him to run against Ben Johnson and to be  
tested against Ben and all the rest to be tested and let's see 
who's clean,'' Chrobotek said. ``If they think that athletics is 
going through the worst since Ben Johnson, after the testing it 
will be much lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was banned for life in 1993 after a second positive drug  
test, but is appealing the decision and hopes to be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrobotek said athletes should prove they are clean before they  
point the finger at anyone else, and said British sprinter Linford 
Christie, who recently tested positive for a banned drug, was one 
of the biggest critics of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	He also attacked Boldon for pulling out of the world  
championships in Spain because of a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He says that Ben Johnson didn't do any justice to athletics.  
What kind of justice is he doing by dropping out of the worlds for 
no apparent reason?'' Chrobotek said.

<HEADLINE> Priest Promoted Despite Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest was promoted to  
pastor of a church just weeks after church officials learned he had 
fathered a child with a married woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The priest, the Rev. Joseph Gallenstein, has since received a  
three-month leave of absence at his own request. A statement issued 
by the Diocese of Covington in Erlanger said Gallenstein intends to 
remain a priest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Tom Sacksteder, a diocesan spokesman, said Gallenstein,  
who is in his early 40s, will work in the diocese when he returns 
but said he did not know where. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacksteder said the diocese had no comment on why it allowed  
Gallenstein to become pastor after it learned he had fathered a 
child. Catholic priests are required to be celibate. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not a matter for the press. It is an internal matter  
for the church,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diocesan officials learned in late March or early April that  
Gallenstein had fathered the child, the diocese said. It did not 
release any information about the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallenstein acknowledged his paternity and addressed the  
personal and spiritual issues involved, according to the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallenstein, whose leave of absence began July 26, was an  
associate pastor at St. Paul Church in Florence since June 1995 
before he was elevated to pastor last month. He was ordained in May 
1990.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grains and soybeans futures prices plummeted in trading Thursday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade on bearish crop production reports. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cotton futures were higher and coffee prices  
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The price drops on the Board of Trade were in reaction to a  
surprising crop production report from the U.S. Agriculture 
Department. USDA estimated the 1999-00 corn crop at 9.56 billion 
bushels, far above the average trade guess. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants hoping for a late rally were disappointed  
when the Board of Trade closed an hour early Thursday after a power 
outage affecting the downtown Loop area threatened to expand. The 
Board of Trade said Project A electronic trading in all markets 
would shut down as well Thursday night, and reopen at 8 a.m. 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA supply/demand report showed a lower-than-expected cut  
to U.S. soybean production. In general, the Midwest heat wave did 
less damage to crops than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficial overnight rains in the Midwest that were expected to  
last until Friday also weighed on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report was definitely bigger than the trade was looking  
for,'' Don Roose of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. said of the 
production figures. ``You got hit with two things today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices were lower in sympathy with corn and soybeans,  
despite some bullish production news. 
</P>
<P>
	CBOT chief executive officer Thomas R. Donovan made the decision  
to close the markets at 2 p.m. EDT after speaking to Commonwealth 
Edison CEO John Rowe, said CBOT spokesman Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Donovan wanted to ensure an orderly shut down, avoiding  
the potential chaos if power failed with as many as 5,000 traders 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disruption of trading,'' Gallaway said.  
``The last minutes of trading are often some of the busiest trading 
of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were blamed on the failures of two power  
transmission cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 8 1/2 cents to $2.80 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 12 cents to $2.23 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
2 1/2 cents to $1.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 30 cents to 
$4.56 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were lower and feeder cattle futures higher  
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mostly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .22 cent to 65.50 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .28 cent to 77.40 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .08 cent to 54.45 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .93 cent to 56.82 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures prices were higher on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York Thursday after a surprisingly low crop estimate in 
the USDA supply/demand report. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA estimates put the crop at 18.3 million bales, down from  
July and below analysts' guesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton for October delivery rose 1.45 cents to 53.20 cents per  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures prices fell Thursday on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York on news that a cold front expected to hit 
Brazilian growing areas this weekend is unlikely to cause any 
damage. While cooler temperatures will predominant, no cold front 
is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for September delivery fell 2.95 cents to 93.75 cents per  
pound.

<HEADLINE> Court Dismisses Rams Trademark Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  
upheld a decision dismissing a $100 million lawsuit claiming rights 
to the St. Louis Rams trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reinforces that the NFL's trademarks and slogans  
associated with a team are property of the team, even if the club 
moves and hasn't used them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled last week in the case of Johnny Blastoff Inc.  
vs. Los Angeles Rams Football Company, that such a ``public use of 
a mark is deemed to be on behalf of the mark's owners,'' and not on 
a third party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams moved from Los Angeles to St. Louis in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	In finding for the Rams, the Court relied on the fact that the  
media and public had used the mark ``St. Louis Rams'' to refer to 
the team before the plaintiff in the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Frankel May Have Stolen Only $50M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Martin R. Frankel, accused of absconding  
with a huge cache of insurance company investments, may have stolen 
as little as $50 million, the newspaper Greenwich Time reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While still a significant sum, the figure is far smaller than  
the estimate of $3 billion originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwich Time, citing an unidentified source close to the  
federal investigation, said Frankel may not have invested any of 
the money that insurance companies in five states paid him to 
manage. 
</P>
<P>
	The source told the newspaper that Frankel may have suffered  
from ``trader's block'' -- a psychological inability to complete a 
financial transaction -- and sought help from a hypnotist and at 
least one psychiatrist to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, who remains at large, apparently had a computer program  
which would comb through actual transactions to create the 
appearance of huge returns on investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The program ``monitored actual market trades, so when the client  
got the statement and checked on a particular security -- by looking 
in The Wall Street Journal, for example -- the computer-generated 
earning would match exactly with what it would have actually 
earned,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say he wanted to show an insurance company their investments  
earned $20 million. The program would come up with the trades to 
match that amount,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statements Frankel sent to investors apparently led to the  
early estimates of losses, which ranged from more than $200 million 
to as much as $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	When insurance regulators in April began questioning the  
legitimacy of Frankel's Liberty National Securities, the brokerage 
he allegedly ran from a fortified mansion in Greenwich, regulators 
apparently believed the insurance investments had grown to as much 
as $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it appears that all Marty took was whatever the insurance  
companies first gave him to invest,'' the source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. ``So we're not looking at billions of 
dollars, or even hundreds of millions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $2 billion more was supposedly missing from a  
charitable foundation Frankel had created; that money, too, may 
have existed only on paper, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury has been investigating Frankel since  
mid-May. He disappeared in early May and remains on the loose. A 
warrant has been issued for his arrest on fraud charges.

	Tornado Destroys Millions in Property  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The mayor's office estimated that  
yesterday's tornado destroyed about $150 million in property, 
excluding damage to the Outdoor Retailers Market, a trade show held 
twice annually in Salt Lake City. One person was killed and dozens 
were injured. Fifteen people remained hospitalized, two in critical

assessing the destruction, but at least 121 homes were damaged, 
with 34 left uninhabitable.

	Clinton Pushes for Cleaner Fuel  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to reduce U.S. oil demand and protect  
the environment, President Clinton today created an interagency 
council to promote technologies that turn trees, plants and even 
animal waste into energy. Clinton cast the initiative as both a 
security issue and a crucial stroke against global warming. ``If we 
can make the raw material of tomorrow's economy living, renewable 
resources instead of fossil fuels, which pollute the atmosphere and 
warm the planet, the future of our children and our grandchildren, 
the likelihood that there will be more prosperity and peace -- all 
that will be far greater,'' he said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recommending disciplinary action today against  
a senior official and two other employees of the Los Alamos nuclear 
laboratory because of failures in the China espionage 
investigation, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, cited a ``total 
breakdown in the system.'' While the internal investigation also 
cited ``systemic problems in the Energy Department's management of 
counterintelligence matters,'' no action was taken against any 
department headquarters officials. Nor were any former senior DOE

postal worker because he was not white and worked for the federal 
government. The alleged confession by Buford O. Furrow Jr. came 
after Los Angeles County prosecutors charged him with murder and 
five counts of attempted murder -- all hate crimes. Federal

he made several campaign stops en route to Iowa. Dozens of state 
officials endorsed Bush, the governor of Texas, during a statehouse 
rally. Gov. George Ryan put his powerful campaign apparatus in 
Bush's corner. ``Without question, he is the best candidate

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Rare in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tornadoes can form anywhere if the right atmospheric conditions  
exist -- from the Midwest to the Rockies and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they touch down in Kansas or downtown Salt Lake City,  
twisters need several ingredients found only in large 
thunderstorms: Warm, moist air near the ground, cool air aloft and 
winds that speed up and change direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regions of the United States are more vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest is in an area where warm, wet air from the Gulf of  
Mexico collides with the fast-moving and cooler winds from the 
Rocky Mountains or Canada. Twisters are most likely to occur there 
in the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, meteorologists in Salt Lake City watched the same  
conditions develop over their state. A severe thunderstorm watch 
was issued at 12:48 p.m.; the twister touched down about seven 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what was going on,'' said David Toronto, a  
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ``But to look at it 
and say there's a tornado and it's going to hit downtown -- we 
didn't have that information because of the rapid development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remained on the ground for about five minutes, he said. Wind  
speeds were estimated to be about 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes are rare in Utah. Thirty-two have been reported in the  
last 25 years, said Tim Shy, a researcher at the University of 
Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Oklahoma recorded 1,326 over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown areas also offer no special protection, he said. There  
just happen to be more rural than densely urbanized areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get a `Wizard of Oz' mentality that they occur in  
the middle of nowhere,'' Shy said. ``There have been enough counter 
examples here recently as Oklahoma City, Nashville and downtown 
Miami got hit in the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a tornado strikes a building or a barn, the most  
dangerous aspect is the debris carried by high winds. Researchers 
have discounted theories that pressure differences cause structures 
to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	``The damage comes from wind and flying debris, and we saw that  
downtown today,'' Toronto said.

<HEADLINE> Hunter Still Conscious, but Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter remained  
conscious and in critical condition Thursday, four days after the 
Hall of Famer pitcher fell and hit his head on concrete steps at 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease since last fall,  
was under treatment in the intensive care unit of Pitt County 
Memorial Hospital. Spokesman Doug Boyd said Hunter's condition was 
unchanged from Wednesday, when he awakened after lapsing into 
unconsciousness for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	His long-range prognosis was unclear, said a doctor treating  
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still in our monitoring phase, and it's too early to  
predict Mr. Hunter's needs'' in terms of future treatment, said Dr. 
Paul Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials said Wednesday that Hunter suffered brain  
bruising. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter retired to his farm in Hertford from the New York Yankees  
in 1979 after a 15-year pitching career during which he won the Cy 
Young Award and collected five World Series rings. He was 
baseball's first multimillion-dollar player. 
</P>
<P>
	A diabetic who requires three injections daily, Hunter was  
diagnosed last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -- a gradual, 
irreversible deterioration of the muscles. He likely will require 
rehabilitation because he already was weakened by ALS, Cunningham 
said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appeals for Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the nation on Thursday  
to embrace ``our common humanity'' in the aftermath of the latest 
shootings linked to ethnic hatred. He appealed to Congress to pass 
``common-sense'' laws tightening gun control and banning hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said hatred apparently was a motive in the  
shootings at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acts of hate against individuals are acts of hate against our  
values and our entire nation. So let us all speak clearly and with 
one voice: Our nation will not stand for such acts,'' Clinton said 
in remarks videotaped for a ``safe schools'' conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the president took advantage of a previously scheduled  
meeting at the White House with about 30 American Jewish leaders to 
discuss his hopes for hate crimes legislation. During the nearly 
two-hour meeting, Clinton advocated that minority groups unite 
behind the push for hate crimes legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Anti-Defamation League said the  
leaders pressed Clinton to use his presidency to push for broader 
anti-hate efforts. Abraham Foxman also referred to a statement an 
FBI source said was made by Buford O. Furrow Jr., who has been 
charged in the Los Angeles shootings, 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Furrow talked about, `This is a wake-up call to kill  
Jews,' perhaps this is a wake-up call to unite America,'' Abraham 
Foxman said. ``There needs to be attention given to it beyond the 
crisis, beyond the tragedy. What happens is it passes from the 
pages of the newspaper and the hate continues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew  
Congregations, said Clinton ``expressed his disbelief and his grave 
concern'' over the Los Angeles shootings and spoke passionately 
about the need for tighter gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the members of Congress just don't seem to care, and  
the American people need to send a message that we're going to hold 
them responsible for their actions,'' Yoffie said. ``He said we're 
not talking about disturbed teen-agers here, but the re-emergence 
of militia groups and militant groups and extremist groups, and 
this really required some strong action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yoffie said the leaders also urged Clinton to step up  
surveillance ``and even infiltration'' of known hate groups, and 
Clinton promised ``to look into this personally ... and he will do 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman David Leavy said Clinton agreed that more  
should be done, but that care also must be taken to avoid violating 
constitutional freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton addressed the subject in at least three appearances  
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shootings presented ``another compelling argument,  
in my judgment, for this country to renew its commitment to our 
common community, our common humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It now appears that they were motivated by racial and ethnic  
hatred,'' Clinton said. He noted they followed a July shooting 
spree in Illinois and Indiana in which two people were killed and 
nine wounded -- all of them black, Jewish or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acts of hate must strengthen our resolve and deepen our  
determination that Americans will come together and stand together 
and work together against violence, intolerance and hatred,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Days before the latest shootings, Clinton had reiterated his  
appeal to Congress to pass a hate crimes bill that would make it 
easier for the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute such 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the measure last month and added it to a  
still pending spending bill. The House Judiciary Committee held a 
hearing on the measure last week. Critics say a federal law is 
unnecessary since states prosecute hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Child Death Rate Doubles in 90s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The death rate for small children has  
doubled this decade across most of Iraq, according to a U.N. survey 
released Thursday that's likely to inflame debate over continuing 
sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said the survey -- the  
first of child deaths in Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War -- reveals an ongoing humanitarian emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF officials say a host of factors have influenced the child  
mortality rate, including the sanctions, two wars, a collapsed 
economy and Baghdad's own response. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey will undoubtedly add to the ongoing U.N. Security  
Council debate over whether to ease the economic sanctions -- 
regardless of whether Iraq has fully complied with U.N. demands to 
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions were 
imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not calling for a lifting of sanctions as such, because  
we cannot. That is not in our jurisdiction,'' Bellamy said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF recognizes that sanctions are used by the international  
community to promote peace and security, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when they're used they need to be implemented in a way to  
avoid serious human impact,'' especially on vulnerable children, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which opposes lifting sanctions until Iraq is  
disarmed, blamed President Saddam Hussein for the malnutrition and 
deaths of Iraqi children in government-controlled areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that if Saddam Hussein would not continue  
to hoard medicines and capabilities to assist the children of Iraq, 
they wouldn't have this problem,'' said State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to help ordinary Iraqis cope with the sanctions,  
the United Nations has allowed Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil 
to buy food, medicine, and other humanitarian aid since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. runs the oil-for-food program in northern Iraq. But it  
relies on the Iraqi government to implement the program in the 
government-controlled central and southern regions, home to 85 
percent of the country's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNICEF findings back a trend that U.N. officials identified  
in an April report: U.N. humanitarian relief operations were more 
effective in the areas outside Saddam's control. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that in government-controlled central and  
southern Iraq, there were 131 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 
live births from 1994 to 1999. That's compared to 56 deaths per 
1,000 live births from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The new, higher rate puts child mortality in most of Iraq on par  
with rates in Haiti and Pakistan, UNICEF said. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, in the autonomous northern region, the mortality  
rate of children under 5 fell to 72 deaths per 1,000 live births 
from 1994-1999 from 80 deaths per 1,000 live births from 1984-89. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellamy noted that Iraq's child mortality rate was on the  
decline in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF urged the international community to provide more money  
for humanitarian efforts in Iraq and called on the U.N. committee 
overseeing sanctions and the Iraqi government to give priority to 
directly improving the well-being of children. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also said the Iraqi government should implement  
nutrition programs, adopt a national policy promoting 
breast-feeding and replace the baby formula in the current food 
rations with additional food for nursing mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF surveyed nearly 24,000 randomly selected households in  
south and central Iraq between February and May, in cooperation 
with the Iraqi government, and 16,000 households in the north, in 
cooperation with local authorities. The margin of error was less 
than 5 percentage points.

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers added depth to their  
front court today by signing free agent forward Mark Bryant to a 
two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, an 11-year NBA veteran, spent the 1998-99 season with  
the Chicago Bulls where he averaged 9 points a game. Bryant, 34, 
also has played for Portland, Phoenix and Houston.

	The Cavaliers were criticized for having a thin lineup last  
season that was exposed when several starters went down with 
injuries. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Defendant in Starr Case Loses Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former defendant in one of Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutions has lost a legal battle to 
have the government pay her attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton rejected the arguments of  
Julie Hiatt Steele that Starr's case was ``vexatious, frivolous and 
in bad faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an Aug. 3 ruling, Hilton said the government won't have to  
pay costs and attorneys fees for Ms. Steele because ``the evidence 
was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find the defendant 
guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury on May 7 deadlocked 9-3 in favor of convicting  
Ms. Steele on charges that she obstructed Starr's investigation of 
allegations by Kathleen Willey that President Clinton made an 
unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr decided not to retry Ms. Steele, who denied Mrs. Willey's  
assertion that she confided the alleged advance to her friend hours 
after it happened.

<HEADLINE> La Russa Hopes To Return in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- It's starting to look like Tony La Russa might  
return to the St. Louis Cardinals next season, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa was offered a two-year contract extension in spring  
training but hasn't accepted the deal. That has led to speculation 
that he might leave for another job after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, La Russa told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that  
barring a huge slide in the final seven weeks, he would like to 
stay in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa thinks Cardinals' owners should have the right to  
change their minds about keeping him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't prove yourself in spring training,'' he said. ``You  
have to have the confidence of your owners at the end of the each 
season. It's something you have to earn. I've believed that for 20 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa, 54, ranks 11th on baseball's career list for victories  
(1,622) by a manager and leads active managers. His Oakland 
Athletics won three pennants and a World Series title from 1988-90. 
He led the Cardinals to the NL Central title in 1996, his first 
season in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cardinals have not made the playoffs since, despite the  
heroics of home run king Mark McGwire. The Cardinals are 58-58 this 
year, 11 games behind first-place Houston.

<HEADLINE> Big Crops Predicted Despite Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers will harvest bin-busting crops of  
corn, soybeans, rice and other crops despite the drought and heat 
that have plagued parts of the country this summer, the Agriculture 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expects a modest increase in prices for some  
commodities -- 20 cents a bushel for soybeans and 5 cents a bushel 
for corn -- because of tightening world supplies or rising exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher prices could save the government as much as $1  
billion in crop subsidies, but many farmers still wouldn't recover 
their cost of production, so the rosier projections are unlikely to 
slow a drive in Congress to pass a major bailout of the 
agricultural economy. The Senate last week approved a $7.4 billion 
package of farm assistance; the House has yet to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see much of anything that would change our net farm  
income,'' said USDA economist Larry Salathe. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest impact of the drought could be on dairy farmers.  
Milk prices are expected to rise as much as 50 cents per hundred 
pounds because of strong demand for cheese and declining production 
in the parched Northeast.

	Soybean production is forecast at a record high 2.9 billion  
bushels, up 4 percent from last year, although the drought has 
ruined crops from Ohio through the mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nation's heartland has received plenty of rain this  
summer and a Midwest heat wave eased in time to spare most crops.

	The corn harvest is expected to be the third largest on record  
at 9.6 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expected the average price of corn to range from  
$1.70 to $2.10 this year. Soybean prices should average $4.10 to 
$4.90 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton production is expected to be up by a third from last year  
when there was a severe drought across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The rice crop is expected to be a record 21 billion pounds, up  
12 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat production is down 9 percent, as many farmers switched to  
other crops they thought would be more lucrative this year. But 
world wheat stocks are rising because of a big crop in China this 
year, so USDA doesn't expect prices to increase.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Jones Hurt on Punt Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- San Diego receiver Charlie Jones dislocated  
his left hip Thursday night when he was tackled near the sideline 
at the end of a punt return and fell hard on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred early in the second quarter of an exhibition  
game against the San Francisco 49ers. The game was delayed several 
minutes while medical personnel attended to Jones, who was starting 
his fourth season in San Diego after being drafted in the fourth 
round out of Fresno State in 1996. He had 46 catches for 699 yards 
and three touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones fielded the punt, started up the middle and cut to the  
right sideline, where he was met by the 49ers' Zack Bronson and 
ridden down at San Francisco's 45. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflatable cast was placed around his damaged leg and he was  
lifted onto a gurney. Jones, visibly in pain, clutched his head 
with both hands as the gurney was moved off the field.

	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Steve Elkington, the 1995 PGA Champion,  
withdrew from the tournament this afternoon after his caddie 
complained of heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than get another caddie to carry his bag, Elkington  
withdrew shortly before he was supposed to tee off and went to the

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japan Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar continued its rise against the yen late  
today following overnight gains on Wall Street. Japanese stocks 
closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.68 yen at late-afternoon, up 0.98 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
115.35 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 211.81 points,  
or 1.23 percent, to 17,422.97 at the end of the day's trading. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 9.07 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, Japanese banks bought dollars after seeing  
the gains in the U.S. stock and bond markets overnight, a dealer at 
a European bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, movement was meager, as the dollar was caught  
between offers from some U.S. investors and Japanese exporters and 
bids from Japanese investors. Near the end of the session, the 
dollar moved in a range of 115.33 yen to 115.77 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	While the dollar is still firm, ongoing concern the U.S. Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates is keeping market players from 
aggressively buying dollars. Some investors worry that higher 
borrowing costs would slow the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 123.36 yen at  
late-afternoon, up from 122.99 late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened higher today as investor  
sentiment was bolstered by overnight rises in New York and Chicago, 
where futures prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shares have been boosted by the overnight rise in New York and  
the yen's relative stability around the mid-115 yen level,'' said 
Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 132.65 points  
to 10,787.80 at Wednesday's close. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
Composite Index climbed 74.87 to 2,564.98. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed up 17.80 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,438.44. 
The TOPIX closed down 3.61 points, or 0.25 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8250 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8400 
percent, driving its price up to 99.78 yen from 99.65 yen.

<HEADLINE> Science Standards Approved in Kan. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The Kansas Board of Education has approved  
new standards for teaching science in public schools that critics 
say strips evolution from its accepted place at the center of 
biological studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Bill Graves called the board's action on  
Wednesday ``a terrible, tragic, embarrassing solution to a problem 
that didn't exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standards are general guidelines for local school boards,  
which may still decide to teach evolution. But many fear students 
won't be evaluated on evolution in state assessment tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe we would test anything that's optional,'' said  
board member Janet Waugh of Kansas City, who voted against the new 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new standards delete references to so-called  
``macroevolution'' -- the process of change from one species to 
another -- but include references to ``microevolution,'' or changes 
within species. They also mention natural selection, the idea that 
advantageous traits increase in a population over time. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the standards do not contain language recommended by  
science educators that called evolution by natural selection ``a 
broad, unifying theoretical framework in biology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of evolution education continues to raise passions in  
American schools more than 70 years after teacher John Scopes was 
convicted of violating a Tennessee law against teaching it. 
</P>
<P>
	Evolution is the theory that all life evolved from common  
ancestors. Those opposed to it say it contradicts the biblical 
account of the creation of life, and they object to the idea that 
human life resulted from a lower life form. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that public  
schools cannot teach creationism, the theory that a divine being 
created the universe. Opponents of the new standards say 
conservatives are trying their only remaining tactic -- to limit the 
teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is one of several states, including Arizona, Alabama,  
Illinois, New Mexico, Texas and Nebraska, where school boards 
recently have attempted to take evolution out of state science 
standards or de-emphasize evolutionary concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the Kansas board's action worry it took a step toward  
permitting schools to teach creationists' view that the earth is 
only a few thousand of years old, based on the Bible's account. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative board members said they wanted to make sure that  
schools teach sound science, arguing that evolution is a flawed 
theory that cannot be proven. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waugh and board member Bill Wagnon of Topeka, both  
Democrats, said the new standard will put Kansas students at a 
disadvantage with students from other states on college entrance 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we allow our students to be tested on information that  
has never been presented to them?'' Waugh asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the National Academy of Sciences said evolution must  
be taught in public schools if children are to understand biology 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization issued a guidebook for teachers, parents and  
school administrators that asserted: ``There is no debate within 
the scientific community over whether evolution has occurred, and 
there is no evidence that evolution has not occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consequences of Wednesday's vote were not entirely clear  
even to the state's highest education administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to go put the pieces back together before I can  
answer that,'' said Education Commissioner Andy Tompkins after the 
board's 6-4 vote.

<HEADLINE> Discipline Urged in Nuke Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former director of the Los Alamos nuclear  
weapons lab and two former counterintelligence officers face 
possible discipline arising from the mishandling of a China spy 
investigation at the research center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday he strongly urged  
lab officials to take disciplinary action against the three, 
including the scientist who headed the prestigious lab for nearly a 
dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Richardson nor Los Alamos officials would name the three  
officials, citing privacy policies. 
</P>
<P>
	But government sources familiar with the recommendation  
identified the officials as: 
</P>
<P>
	--Siegfried ``Sig'' Hecker, who was director of the lab from 1986  
to 1997. Hecker, a metallurgist, remains on the staff as a research 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	--Robert Vrooman, former chief of the lab's counterintelligence  
office, now retired but working as a part-time consultant to the 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
	--Terry Craig, a former counterintelligence officer, who is still  
employed in another job at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecker, who stepped down as lab director in November 1997 to  
return to full-time research after heading the lab for nearly 12 
years, likely will be the highest-ranking official to face 
disciplinary action arising from the China spy controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	John Browne, who succeeded Hecker as director, said in a  
statement he would decide shortly what action to take. ``I intend 
to act as quickly as possible, but I must ensure fairness in this 
process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson cannot directly take action against the Los Alamos  
employees because they work for the University of California, the 
private contractor that has managed the lab in New Mexico since the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecker, through his wife, declined comment to an AP reporter  
sent to his home. Vrooman and Craig could not be reached Thursday 
night for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson took the action after reviewing a report by the DOE's  
inspector general into the mishandling of a three-year 
investigation into alleged espionage by a Los Alamos computer 
scientist, Wen Ho Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired in March after being under scrutiny by the FBI  
since 1996, for possibly giving nuclear secrets to China in the 
1980s. Lee, who has not been charged with a crime, has denied 
giving any secrets away. 
</P>
<P>
	The IG report concluded that failures by Hecker, Vrooman and  
Craig contributed to Lee being allowed continued access to 
top-secret information while the FBI investigation dragged on for 
nearly three years, and for the failure of investigators to search 
Lee's computer until earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IG report also cited ``systemic problems'' in the Energy  
Department's management of counterintelligence matters and said 
some senior officials in Washington paid little attention to the 
Lee case, maintaining it was not their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	They ``were not aware, nor did they seek essential information''  
about Lee's status and his access to nuclear secrets as the FBI 
investigation floundered, the IG investigators concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the inspector general concluded that there was  
insufficient evidence to warrant sanctions against the senior DOE 
officials, most of whom no longer are in the department. 
</P>
<P>
	One DOE source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two  
officials -- former Deputy Energy Secretary Elizabeth Moler and 
Assistant Secretary Victor Reis -- might have been subject to 
discipline arising from the handling of the Lee case if they had 
not left the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis resigned as head of the nuclear weapons program in June  
because of disagreement with Richardson over department 
reorganization. Moler, who briefly served as acting energy 
secretary, left when Richardson was named secretary last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither could be reached for comment late Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he was ``frustrated'' that the factual record  
examined by the IG's office ``isn't clearer about who knew what 
when'' concerning Lee's continued access to Los Alamos secrets long 
after the FBI investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a total breakdown in the system and there's plenty  
of blame to go around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the IG report and department sources, it was  
decided Hecker should face some discipline because he failed to 
follow through on a specific request by DOE management to limit 
Lee's access to secrets while under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Vrooman, according to a recent report released by a Senate  
committee, had been told in 1997 by an FBI agent assigned to the 
Albuquerque office that Lee could be reassigned away from the 
super-secret weapons design team without jeopardizing the 
investigation. Yet, no reassignment was made until late 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, according to government officials, failed to notify the  
FBI that Lee actually had signed a privacy waiver that specifically 
gave permission for such a computer search. 
</P>
<P>
	Without this knowledge, the Justice Department adamantly opposed  
a search, which finally took place earlier this year after Lee had 
been fired. Investigators discovered Lee had shifted thousands of 
files of top-secret nuclear computer codes from a highly secure 
computer system to an unclassified system with access to the 
Internet.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake City Tornado Injures 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes aren't supposed to touch down in  
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was Bill Alder, the chief meteorologist for the  
National Weather Service in Utah, watching his radar screen with 
growing concern just after lunch Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like severe weather, and severe weather can generate  
funnel clouds which can turn into a tornado,'' he said. ``But that 
doesn't happen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before 1 p.m., a twister ripped through the heart of the  
city that will host 2002 Winter Olympics, destroying 34 homes and 
damaging 87 others. It overturned trucks, blew the windows out of 
downtown hotels and sent the city into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and at least 150 people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the first fatal tornado ever recorded in Utah, where  
tornado sightings only occur about twice a year. Some of the first 
to spot the twister didn't believe what they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `Is that a fire?''' said Cole Lundquist, who was  
standing by a window on the 24th floor of the headquarters of The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the city's tallest 
building. ``Then we saw all the debris, then flames and sparks 
shooting above it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The black funnel swept in from southeast of the city center and  
seemed to target the Delta Center, home of the National Basketball 
Association's Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could just see it peeling the roof off,'' Lundquist said.  
``The debris there was at eye level with us on the 24th floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also shattered the arena's plate glass windows. But it did  
its worst damage just opposite the Delta Center, where exhibitors 
for the massive Outdoor Retailers Summer Market were setting up 
under a block-long tent, now mostly in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Crandy, 38, of Las Vegas was killed when he was struck in  
the head by debris. The contractor for the retailers' show was 
skipping lunch to make sure the booths looked their best. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was postponed one day, until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	As people ran screaming from tents, waitresses at a nearby diner  
watched while the lunchtime crowd huddled under tables. Visitors at 
Temple Square, the usually placid heart of the Mormon Church, 
dashed for shelter as the tornado churned by. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, nearly 1,000 workers crawled through the  
shell of the church's under-construction assembly hall. Bill Morton 
was pouring concrete on the roof of the five-story assembly hall 
when the storm hit. At first, his workers thought the Delta Center 
was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	For two more miles and about five more minutes, the twister --  
classified as an F2, which has winds between 110 mph and 150 mph -- 
stomped through the city, ripping away street signs, tearing down 
electric lines and stacking delivery trucks atop each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-story Wyndham Hotel had dozens of windows blown out on  
either side, with long shards of glass strewn on the grass below. 
Four-inch-wide poles were bent over into U-shapes, their signs 
nearly touching the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm headed north across the lawn of the state Capitol,  
uprooting trees and punching out one window. Then it turned into 
the foothills and one of the poshest neighborhoods in town, the 
Avenues, where Patty Reagan was sitting, watching the weather on 
the noon news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weatherman said there was hail and wind gusts,'' she said.  
She looked out her front window only to see her 100-foot pine tree 
ripped out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched the tree and I thought it was just blowing, but then  
it didn't blow back,'' Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado's path also was marked by downed power lines. Robert  
Stock of Toronto, one of the vendors in town for the convention, 
said he followed its progress by the series of exploding 
transformers atop power poles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came up the road and blew them out, one at a time,'' Stock  
said. ``It was a horrifying and spectacular sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt surveyed the damage by helicopter and declared  
a state of emergency. Except for the Delta Center, which will be 
the venue for skating events in two years, little property related 
to the Olympics was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tornado touched down, crowds gathered downtown to gawk  
at the destruction. Tourists filmed the scene with their video 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing. I never thought I'd see a tornado, least of  
all in Utah,'' said David Gross, a vendor from Sudbury, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the church construction site, Morton said: ``I'll tell  
you one thing, God was watching out for us. I'll tell you another. 
I never want to see another one.''

<HEADLINE> SKorea OKs NKorea Nuke Plant Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's parliament today  
approved $3.2 billion for two nuclear power plants for North Korea, 
despite fears that its northern rival is planning to test-fire a 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The government-proposed bill passed the single-chamber National  
Assembly without any objection from the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks before the vote, government officials stressed the  
importance of keeping the $4.6 billion reactor project alive 
despite the Stalinist state's reported preparations to launch a 
long-range ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1994 accord with Washington, North Korea agreed to freeze  
and eventually dismantle its suspected nuclear weapons program in 
exchange for two light-water nuclear power plants and 500,000 tons 
of fuel oil annually until the reactors are completed in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western-developed reactors will replace the North's  
Soviet-developed reactors, which experts say produce greater 
amounts of weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	An international consortium, led by the United States, Japan and  
South Korea, is financing the reactor project. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea would cover 70 percent of the cost, or $3.2 billion,  
Japan would pay $1 billion and the European Union would provide 
about $88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Japan has threatened to halt funding if North Korea  
fires the missile, which military experts say is capable of 
reaching Alaska or Hawaii. Last year, North Korea alarmed Tokyo by 
firing a rocket over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, South Korea and Japan have warned of economic  
and diplomatic penalties if North Korea, which relies heavily on 
outside aid, goes ahead with the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction on the power plants began in August 1997 in Kumho,  
a village on North Korea's northeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea will be required to repay the project's costs over  
20 years after a three-year grace period once the plants are 
completed. No interest will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea plans to raise electricity rates to pay its share of  
the cost.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Freeman Signs 1-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers have signed All-Pro  
wide receiver Antonio Freeman to a one-year tender offer, the team 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal means Freeman will be able to report to training camp  
and play for the Packers while the team and Freeman's agent, Joel 
Segal, continue to work on a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio wants to be here,'' coach Ray Rhodes said. ``I'm just  
happy they worked something out. We're going to take our time 
getting him ready to play and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman will be in camp Friday as the Packers prepare for their  
Saturday preseason opener against the New York Jets. Freeman won't 
be ready to play in that game but could see preseason action, 
Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased and excited to have Antonio in training camp,''  
general manager Ron Wolf said in a statement. ``Meanwhile, the 
parties will continue to negotiate on a long-term contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman held out through the first two weeks of training camp  
while reportedly seeking a contract worth more than $6 million 
annually, which could have made him the game's highest-paid 
receiver. Talks reportedly stalled over the amount of Freeman's 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he also signed to play for the Packers' tender  
offer of $1.153 million. Freeman then set career-highs with 84 
catches for 14 touchdowns and a league-best 1,424 yards despite 
suffering a broken jaw late in the year.

<P>
	Green Bay placed its franchise player tag on Freeman after the  
season, meaning the team had the right to match any offer made to 
him. Added urgency was placed on the negotiations last week when 
Robert Brooks, the Packers' starting flanker last season, announced 
his retirement after seven injury-plagued seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want him in here before training camp,'' Rhodes said. ``It  
gives him enough time to get him ready for the season opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers have been auditioning wide receivers to play  
alongside Freeman. Veterans Bill Schroeder, Derrick Mayes and Corey 
Bradford are all expected to make the team, while Jahine Arnold and 
rookie Donald Driver are among the leading candidates for a final 
roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay players have not criticized Freeman for his holdout,  
and last month Rhodes said he understood and supported his wide 
receiver's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Moore received a five-year contract extension from the  
Lions last month that pays him $5.6 million annually. Freeman's 
contract is expected to include a signing bonus of more than $10 
million. Moore got a signing bonus between $8 million and $9 
million from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who said he only wanted to play in Green Bay, never  
seemed comfortable with his holdout. He visited his teammates 
during minicamps during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my family, man,'' he said at a June minicamp. ``I'm not  
going to turn my back on my teammates.''

<HEADLINE> Gap Inc. Earnings Above Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Clothing retailer The Gap Inc.'s  
second-quarter earnings came in slightly above analysts' 
expectations, rising 43 percent to $195.8 million from $136.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gap reported earnings per share of 22 cents for the three  
months ending July 31, a penny above expectations, according to a 
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales increased 29 percent, to nearly $2.5 billion, from  
$1.9 billion last year, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of our divisions -- Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and  
International -- grew earnings at double digit rates,'' said Millard 
S. Drexler, Gap's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are signs that the strength of older Gap stores is  
waning. Sales in stores open a year or longer were up 8 percent, 
down from 19 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said last week, after July sales figures came out, that  
Old Navy, Gap's low-end division, may be stealing sales from 
Gap-brand stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gap operated 2,611 stores on July 31, up 339 from a year  
earlier. There are 1,163 Gap stores, 699 GapKids stores, 442 Old 
Navy stores and 307 Banana Republic stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended July 31, The Gap earned $398.2 million  
on sales of $4.73 billion. In the year-ago period, the retailer 
earned $272.9 million on sales of $3.62 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap shares fell 62 1/2 cents to $37.87 1/2 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pushes for Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton set a goal today to reduce  
global warming over the next decade by increasing U.S. use of 
technology that converts plants and trees into fuel, chemicals and 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The president issued an executive order establishing a council  
to coordinate the federal government's effort to develop a biomass 
research program, and setting a goal of tripling use of bioenergy 
and bioproducts by 2010. Biomass energy, generated mostly from wood 
and wood waste, is currently about 3 percent of the total U.S. 
energy supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called bioenergy a possible ``technological fix that can  
help us to meet our economic challenges, maintain our security, 
sustain our prosperity and ease the threat of global warming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biomass technology uses trees, crops and waste from agriculture  
or forestry to make energy that can then be used as fuel for cars 
or power factories. It also can be used to create a variety of 
chemicals and products ranging from pharmaceuticals to glue, paint 
or even textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate goal of Clinton's order is to replace coal, oil,  
natural gas and uranium with cleaner, renewable biomass energy. If 
the goal of tripling biomass use by 2010 is met, annual greenhouse 
gas emissions would drop by more than 100 million tons, the 
equivalent of taking 70 million automobiles off the nation's roads, 
the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting the goal also would generate $15 billion to $20 billion  
in income for farmers and rural areas, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit today to the Agriculture Department, Clinton  
appealed to Congress to approve $242 million in his fiscal 2000 
budget proposal for research and tax credits to promote energy 
efficiency, bioenergy and other clean energies. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive order directs the secretaries of agriculture and  
energy and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
to prepare a report within 120 days on options for increasing 
biomass energy use.

<HEADLINE>  Charges Filed Against L.A. Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With a suspect jailed in the attack at a  
Jewish community center, authorities and a violence-weary public 
were left with a question: Why would a white supremacist allegedly 
travel the length of the West Coast to a quiet neighborhood to 
deliver ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been asking ourselves trying to figure this out,  
and we can't,'' said 17-year-old Maritza Tobo, who lives with her 
mother near the center where three children were among the wounded. 
``Innocent kids? They don't do anything to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they don't know why Los Angeles was a target, but  
they are no longer searching for the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O. Furrow Jr., 37, was brought back to Los Angeles on  
Wednesday night aboard a U.S. Customs helicopter after waiving 
extradition in Las Vegas. Hours earlier, he was charged by federal 
prosecutors with killing a postal worker an hour after the assault 
at the community center. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces five charges of attempted murder in that attack: three  
boys, a teen-age counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist were 
shot. The most seriously wounded, a 5-year-old boy shot twice, 
remained in critical condition after doctors inserted four pins in 
his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Furrow fled to Las Vegas by taxi -- a 275-mile  
trip that involved two cabs -- after Tuesday's shootings. He spent 
the night at a hotel, then walked into an FBI office and confessed, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles,'' an  
FBI source quoted Furrow as saying. The source said Furrow assumed 
he had killed some children. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told investigators ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call  
to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged with murder and illegal possession of a  
firearm in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, the postal worker 
killed after the center shootings. Prosecutors could seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow has also admitted to shooting Ileto, Postal Inspector  
Pamela Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
	At his federal court appearance, Furrow sat expressionless as  
the charges were read, said his attorney, Art Allen. Asked if he 
understood the charges, he answered: ``Yes, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shackled at the feet and cuffed at the wrists, Furrow then  
walked down the steps of the courthouse to the jeers of a bystander 
who rushed up and shouted: ``You're a coward! You are a coward!' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow looked at him and smiled, and was then hustled away.  
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The balding suspect also belonged to the Aryan Nations group in  
1995, said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the center shooting, police said, Furrow abandoned a van  
full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to 
white supremacist thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved the attack 
was a hate crime, though it was not immediately clear whether 
federal civil rights charges will be filed against the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	But most are at a loss to explain why the North Valley Jewish  
Community Center was targeted for an attack in which 70 shots were 
sprayed around the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The randomness is the reason it's so dangerous,'' Hier said.  
</P>
<P>
	Furrow may have visited the Wiesenthal Center's Museum of  
Tolerance two or three months ago, Hier said. Staff members recall 
him entering the museum with a tour group but later wandering off 
by himself, ignoring exhibits that focus on the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was alerted, but the man had disappeared by the time  
guards went to look for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center in suburban Granada Hills, a leafy  
middle-class neighborhood, remained closed today, guarded by police 
and security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the children assembled next door in St. Andrews and St.  
Charles Episcopal Church, which shares its space with Temple Beth 
Torah -- a refuge for children the day of the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to scare us away,'' J. Eliad, the father of a  
4-year-old girl, said Wednesday. ``We're going to be here for 
good.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Suspect Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white supremacist charged with shooting  
five people at a Jewish community center told investigators he also 
killed a Filipino-American postal worker because he was not white 
and worked for the federal government, a prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The account, based on an alleged confession by Buford O. Furrow  
Jr., came after Los Angeles County prosecutors charged him with 
murder and five counts of attempted murder -- all filed as hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors already had charged Furrow in the postman's  
slaying. The murder charges could bring the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	After the charges were announced, a shackled and handcuffed  
Furrow was led into a federal courtroom for arraignment. Looking 
around at the crowd of mostly reporters, he smiled and said to his 
public defender, ``They all like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn Turchin refused bail for Furrow,  
who has a history of mental problems and has had ties to hate 
groups in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators he believed the postal employee,  
Joseph Santos Ileto, 39, was a good ``target of opportunity'' 
because he was not white and worked for the government, U.S. 
Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow also told investigators that he thought Ileto was  
Hispanic or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was shot ``willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with  
premeditation,'' Mayorkas said, in a quiet San Fernando Valley 
community about an hour after five people were wounded at the 
nearby North Valley Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators he saw Ileto standing in uniform next  
to his postal van and asked if Ileto would mail a letter for him. 
When he agreed, Furrow allegedly pulled out a gun and shot him 
twice. Ileto tried to run, and Furrow said he shot him in the back 
until Ileto fell to the ground. Furrow allegedly fled in a stolen 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was shot nine times in the chest and the back of the head,  
Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the site of the shooting, Ileto's friends left a red balloon  
that read ``Miss You.'' With it were a small American flag, vases 
with yellow roses and five candles. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint federal-local task force will decide whether Furrow will  
be tried jointly by state and federal authorities or face separate 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayorkas said federal investigators are gathering additional  
evidence in the center shootings. ``We will file federal civil 
rights charges if the evidence so warrants,'' Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's complaint alleged that Ileto ``was  
intentionally killed because of his race or nationality.'' That 
allegation is part of state law dealing with hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was also charged with the attempted murders of Isabelle  
Shalometh, 68, a receptionist at the center; counselor Mindy 
Finkelstein, 16; and three young boys, Benjamin Kadish, Joshua 
Stepakoff and James Zidell. The most seriously wounded, 5-year-old 
Benjamin, shot twice, was in critical but stable condition 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told investigators he had no intention of shooting small  
children and that they ``got in the way'' as he shot at the 
teen-ager and Shalometh, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, Furrow said he scouted three  
prominent Jewish institutions -- the Museum of Tolerance, the 
Skirball Cultural Center and the University of Judaism -- while 
shopping for places to kill Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow found security too tight at the facilities and stumbled  
upon the Jewish community center in suburban Granada Hills after 
pulling off a freeway to get gas, a law enforcement source told the 
Times. It was unclear when Furrow made his scouting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The center remained closed Thursday, guarded by police and  
security officers. It was expected to reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play in the sand, and we're going to paint, and  
we're going to have fun,'' said Gerry Volmar, a preschool teacher. 
The center's preschool and day campers have been meeting at a 
neighboring Episcopal church. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow surrendered Wednesday to the FBI in Las Vegas and was  
returned to Los Angeles aboard a U.S. Customs helicopter. He waived 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially said Furrow fled from Los Angeles to Las  
Vegas after the shootings in two taxis -- one to the 
California-Nevada line, the other the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, investigators said he took one taxi from Los  
Angeles to Las Vegas, spent the night at a hotel before taking 
another cab to an FBI office and confessing. Furrow said he wanted 
the attack to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI 
source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovik Garibyan, the 31-year-old taxi driver who drove him from  
California, said Furrow paid him $800 for the ride. Furrow first 
asked to go to Los Angeles International Airport, then changed his 
mind, Garibyan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just paid me and he fell asleep,'' he said. ``He laid down  
in the back seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported Friday that Furrow stayed in a hotel in the  
Santa Clarita area near Los Angeles for two nights before the 
shootings. After allegedly abandoning a carjacked Toyota following 
the shootings, he got a haircut, bought a new shirt and took a taxi 
to Hollywood where he searched unsuccessfully for a prostitute, the 
police source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow then had several beers before flagging down Garibyan, the  
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow may have visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of  
Tolerance in Los Angeles two or three months ago, said the 
director, Rabbi Marvin Hier. Staff members recall a man fitting his 
description entering the museum with a tour group but later 
wandering off by himself, ignoring exhibits that focus on the 
Holocaust.

<HEADLINE>  Seahawks Extend Sinclair Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Sinclair  
signed a five-year contract extension Thursday with the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holmgren, the Seahawks' first-year general manager and  
coach, announced the extension at an afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, Sinclair, 31, was given a seven-year contract by  
Seattle. He had two seasons left on his old contract, which he 
signed in 1996 and had restructured in 1997, and is now signed 
through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the new deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's already done a lot of wonderful things in this  
business,'' Holmgren said. ``I even think his best years are still 
ahead of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair, 31, led the NFL with a team-record 16 1/2 sacks last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren made good on a promise made to Sinclair by the previous  
Seahawks administration. Dennis Erickson was fired after the team 
went 8-8 last season and Holmgren was hired away from Green Bay in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to thank Michael for trusting me to get this thing  
done,'' Holmgren said. ``We had kind of an agreement, call it a 
handshake, that we were going to work very, very hard to make this 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 270-pound Sinclair, a sixth-round draft choice  
from Eastern New Mexico, is a four-year starter who plays on 
Seattle's defensive line with tackles Cortez Kennedy and Sam Adams 
and end Phillip Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks third on the Seahawks' career-sacks list with 60 1/2  
behind Jacob Green's 116 and Jeff Bryant's 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair hopes to become a better player with his contract  
worries now behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come to training camp and have it on the back of your  
mind, sometimes it's a load,'' he said. ``I'm glad that we got it 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair phoned Holmgren from Hawaii, where he was preparing for  
last season's Pro Bowl, when he heard reports that the Seahawks 
were going to trade him to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `No, that's not going to happen,''' Sinclair said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair said his contract extension will allow him to finish  
his career in Seattle. He had a chance to leave the Seahawks as a 
restricted free agent, but chose to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that Michael Sinclair is all about is in Seattle,''  
he said. ``There's no other team that I want to play for. This is 
where I started. Seattle is home for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair said his contract was important for him -- and for the  
Seahawks, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what's missing in professional sports is loyalty,'' he  
said. ``So I think this definitely sends a message to the players 
to what kind of organization that the Seahawks have become, 
definitely to the young players. If you go out and play, you will 
be taken care of. That's a huge message.''

<HEADLINE> Concern About Nation's Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARADISE, Wash. (AP) -- When Mount Rainier became the nation's  
fifth national park in 1899, it was a roadless, heavily wooded 
wilderness area that drew only a few thousand visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	As the park celebrates its 100th birthday, it has become a  
favorite camping, climbing and gawking spot for more than 2 million 
people each year. As it enters its second century, it faces a 
challenge before many national parks: how to cope with the curse of 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Grand Canyon or Acadia National Park in Maine, Mount  
Rainier suffers smog that clouds its beauty. Its waterways are 
dirtied by man-made pollutants. Its flora and fauna are also 
threatened by heavy park usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials are considering ways to balance its twin  
goals of encouraging public access while protecting the park's 
pristine environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is often hard to know where to begin -- and when to leave  
things alone,'' National Park Service Director Robert Stanton said 
Thursday during a celebration to mark the park's centennial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early years after President McKinley signed legislation  
designating Rainier as a national park, there weren't throngs of 
people willing to tour its 365 square miles on foot. But with the 
advent of private autos and the decision in 1907 to make it the 
first national park to open its gates to car traffic, attendance 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
	With the traffic came the problems, including smog. During the  
summer, a brown-and-yellow haze is common in some national parks, 
cutting down visibility and often creating a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the air quality in Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains  
National Park was declared unhealthy on 43 days, and the visibility 
was sometimes just 12 miles, instead of the 60 miles a visitor 
could see in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, President Clinton announced new regulations directing  
states to restore the air quality in 37 national parks and 119 
wilderness areas to pre-industrial levels -- a goal that is expected 
to take at least 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mount Rainier, officials have discussed closing some camping  
facilities and limiting cars, but so far, no firm decisions have 
been made. On Thursday, organizers encouraged use of free shuttle 
bus service to the visitors' center at Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 people attended the sodden centennial celebration near  
the foot of the 14,410-foot peak, which was obscured by clouds and 
fog. A steady drizzle fell on the crowd, which was about half the 
number organizers had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Famed mountaineer Lou Whittaker remembered his early days of  
climbing and starting to guide others up the mountain in 1951. His 
son, Peter, led a ``centennial climb'' this week, emerging at 
Paradise late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Lang, 91, and Irv Pratt, 81, recalled their skiing exploits  
back when Rainier was a downhill draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wild and woolly, totally out of control!'' Lang said.  
``We had miserable equipment, but we believed in safety and had a 
modicum of elegance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt was part of the Silver Skis competition back in 1934, on  
what he called ``the longest, toughest downhill course in the 
world.'' Competition ended during World War II and rope tows were 
taken down. Today, there are cross-country skiing and snowboarding, 
but no downhill skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other founders of the Ancient Skiers organization brought  
along battle-scarred skis from the early days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash., has climbed Rainier five times. While  
he and others have a personal attachment to the mountain, he said 
it is ``the nation's mountain, in fact the world's mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the mountain we call our mother. It is the mountain we  
see in the morning and the mountain we see before we go to bed, a 
center to many of our lives.''

<HEADLINE> Vanguard Founder To Retire in Dec. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John C. Bogle, the public face behind the  
nation's second-largest family of U.S. mutual funds, will resign by 
year's end from the board of Vanguard Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard said today that its founder must step down under a  
policy that requires board members to resign in December of the 
year in which they reach 70. Bogle turned 70 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But a report Thursday in The Wall Street Journal said there was  
a dispute over whether the retirement policy was mandatory and said 
there were policy differences between Bogle and his successor, John 
Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle did not immediately return a call seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard dismissed the contention that controversy surrounds  
Bogle's retirement. Vanguard spokesman John Demming said Vanguard 
has a ``long-standing policy'' established by the board regarding 
the retirement policies of its board members. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Vanguard now appears to have a public relations problem  
on its hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle's name is synonymous with Vanguard. He founded the company  
in 1975 and now is senior chairman of a firm that manages nearly 
$500 billion in investments. 
</P>
<P>
	But many longtime Vanguard watchers believe Bogle's role with  
the company will change little whether he remains on the board or 
retires. For several years, Bogle's role has been primarily as an 
educator and lecturer on issues affecting the mutual fund industry. 
He is a staunch supporter of low-cost funds and long-term 
investing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vanguard spokesman said it's unknown whether the board may  
ask Bogle to remain in some unofficial capacity or as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Merriman, a Seattle-based money manager who also edits an  
online mutual fund guide, said Bogle's retirement won't have much 
impact unless Vanguard changes its policies and starts raising its 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The public's perception of the company is likely to change  
somewhat because Bogle is so closely identified with Vanguard, 
``but I don't think that matters,'' Merriman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund analysts said the transition between leaders is  
expected to be smooth because Vanguard's day-to-day operations have 
been run by Brennan, a protege of Bogle and the chief executive 
since 1996. Brennan, 45, was named chairman in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Transition isn't the issue because Brennan has been running  
the show their for several years,'' said Dan Wiener, editor of The 
Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter. ``The 
real loss is that of the Vanguard icon. Bogle is the last of the 
mutual fund icons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiener said Bogle ``personified Vanguard.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Many of Vanguard's investors trust Bogle to look out for their  
best interests because he's the guy who started the whole thing,'' 
Wiener said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, on the other hand, while well known in the mutual fund  
world, is relatively unknown among consumers, according to Wiener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported that Bogle had differences with  
Brennan over Brennan's support for an expansion into the discount 
brokerage business. Bogle has complained that the discount business 
encourages a gambling mentality among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., was formed in the wake of  
differences between the senior managers of Wellington Management, 
an investment firm founded in 1928. Vanguard is widely regarded as 
the fastest growing mutual fund company, with assets second only to 
Fidelity Investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press uses Vanguard to manage its retirement  
investment plans.

<HEADLINE> `Spanish-Only' in Texas Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL CENIZO, Texas (AP) -- A community on the Mexican border has  
declared itself a ``safe haven'' for undocumented immigrants and 
passed an ordinance making Spanish the town's official language. 
</P>
<P>
	Any city worker who helps the U.S. Border Patrol uncover  
undocumented immigrants will be fired, Mayor Rafael Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Cenizo, incorporated in 1989, is an impoverished town with a  
high population of first-generation immigrants, both documented and 
undocumented. It sits alongside the Rio Grande about 10 miles south 
of Laredo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez himself does not speak English and says it's  
discrimination in City Council meetings ``not to speak Spanish and 
explain what is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a right to share our opinions and know what is  
happening,'' the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinances, adopted last week, stipulate that local  
governmental transactions be conducted in Spanish, with an English 
translation provided with 48 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
	In compliance with state and federal laws, written ordinances  
will be adopted in English and translated into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The safe haven ordinance bars city employees from inquiring  
about anyone's immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would treat anyone the same, whether they're here illegally  
or not,'' Rodriguez said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Take Measure of Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley is walking around a  
wrap-around porch on a steamy summer night, hoping to convert the 
curious and Clinton-weary Democrats to his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaning toward Bill Bradley,'' says Lars Fatland, a  
36-year-old teacher watching the former Hall of Fame basketball 
player wipe his sweaty brow at a neighbor's house. ``But I'm not 
altogether sure why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator is drawing increasingly large  
crowds, stocked with people like Fatland. They tend to be liberal 
or independent, new to Democratic politics, awed by Bradley's 
celebrity, fuzzy about the former senator's political record, not 
committed to either candidate -- and worried that Gore can't shake 
President Clinton's shadow to beat the Republican nominee in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitalizing on that anxiety may be Bradley's best hope of  
upsetting Gore, who is still the favorite of the party's most 
influential voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley is doing what you have to do when you're a challenger  
-- reaching out to those who would otherwise not consider themselves 
activists or who don't have very focused interests,'' said Iowa 
Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatland fits the mold.  
</P>
<P>
	He supported Jesse Jackson, a liberal candidate, in the 1988  
Iowa caucuses but hasn't been active in recent campaigns. He may be 
a bigger fan of sports than politics. He is more curious than 
knowledgeable about Bradley. And he thinks the vice president is 
damaged goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think highly of Gore,'' said Fatland, who teaches children  
with discipline problems. ``But I want to make sure we can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the same methodical determination that made him a Hall of  
Fame basketball player, the 6-foot-5 Bradley is loping through the 
early voting states -- quietly offering himself as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	He promises to be tougher on guns, more supportive of a woman's  
right to abortion, an enemy of dirty money in politics, a champion 
for poor children and, above all, a man Americans can trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The last reference, a staple in every campaign speech, strikes a  
tone with Democrats trying to determine whether Clinton's 
sex-and-lies scandal should undercut their support of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the people filling seats at Bradley campaign stops, the most  
active Democratic voters generally worry about his ability to be 
elected president. The independent and casual voters seem to object 
to Clinton and Gore in more personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Willadsen, a 46-year-old accountant from Ames, surveyed a  
standing-room-only crowd of 300 Democrats on Thursday. ``A lot of 
these people would vote for Clinton again, given another choice, 
but are disappointed by the choices he made,'' said Willadsen, who 
attended Iowa's caucuses in 1992 for Clinton, but said he falls in 
and out of active party politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Gore will pay the price for Clinton in the general  
election,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Yager, 42, an English professor at Iowa State University,  
shuffled her feet along a red-brick patio in a long line to hear 
Bradley speak. She had expected to back Gore, but the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal is making her consider a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore stood by Clinton through the smarmiest thing in the  
world,'' she said, squinching her face in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent-minded voter, Yager recently attended a rally for  
Republican candidate George W. Bush out of curiosity. She plans to 
be a caucus delegate for the first time, but doesn't know enough 
about Bradley yet to commit to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into his speech, she said: ``I want to like what I  
hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's low-key, folksy style seems to wear well with crowd  
members, most of whom arrived with low or no expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Al Gore,'' said Hamilton Cravens, 61, a history  
professor. ``But this Bradley guy has more pizzazz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growing crowds and good reviews are giving Bradley  
summertime momentum. But he will find it more difficult to turn out 
supporters on a wintry day in 2000, said Iowa governor Vilsack. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is relying on his Internet site and follow-up work by  
his staff to get people involved in his campaign. In an interview 
Thursday between campaign stops, the former lawmaker said he didn't 
know if an underdog had ever won the Democratic primary by 
expanding the party's base. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to me it's not whether it's been done before. The question  
is how it can be done now, and why,'' he said. ``Why it can be done 
is as important as how. Why it can be done is people yearn to once 
again have a politics that's responsive and accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack, who has helped Gore without endorsing him, said Bradley  
can make the race tight -- but winning Iowa will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need strong institutional support to win,'' Vilsack said.  
``Gore's got it.''

<HEADLINE> Rap's `Suge' Denied Early Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Rap music entrepreneur Marion ``Suge''  
Knight was denied an early release from prison by the California 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, 33, the owner of Beverly Hills-based Death Row Records,  
had asked the state high court to review his nine-year prison 
sentence for a probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
	The court decided instead Wednesday to leave Knight's 1996  
sentence intact. 
</P>
<P>
	A Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided that year that Knight  
had violated his probation by kicking a man during a scuffle in a 
Las Vegas hotel. The former college football star had been on 
probation since 1995 after pleading no contest to two counts of 
assault stemming from a 1992 attack on two aspiring rappers in a 
Hollywood recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, once the music industry's most successful ``gangsta''  
rap entrepreneur, founded Death Row in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talks Expected To Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rising economic tensions between the United  
States and its major trading partners will not prevent the 
successful launch of a new round of global trade talks later this 
year, the Clinton administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Susan Esserman, who is leading  
the U.S. team preparing for the negotiations, conceded that serious 
differences remain over negotiating goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is pushing for a limited agenda focusing on  
tariff cuts on manufactured goods, agriculture and services while 
Europe wants more areas covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, a follow-up to the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of trade  
liberalization, are scheduled to start in December at a meeting of 
the 134-member World Trade Organization in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``America, as the world's largest exporter, has much to gain  
from a new round of negotiations,'' Esserman told a group of 
reporters Thursday. She insisted that differences over the items to 
be discussed would be resolved before the Seattle meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trade analysts were not as optimistic, given growing  
protectionist sentiments in this country triggered by record trade 
deficits and rising trade tensions between the United States and 
its major trading partners, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is deep disagreement between the United States, the  
European Union, Japan and the developing nations over what ought to 
be included in the next round,'' said Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert 
at the Institute of International Economics, a Washington think 
tank. ``I don't see a smooth road ahead at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hufbauer said that part of the problem was growing foreign  
unhappiness with the administration's objections to including U.S. 
trade barriers in such areas as America's restrictive anti-dumping 
laws and high protections for textiles and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration, in an effort to pre-empt U.S. opponents,  
has been taking things off the table that other countries want,'' 
Hufbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman said the administration would block any effort to  
include anti-dumping regulations as part of the upcoming 
discussions. The administration has used these regulations, which 
allow higher tariffs for U.S. industries threatened by imports, as 
the primary mechanism to provide relief for U.S. steelmakers in the 
wake of the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite differences, Esserman said consensus was forming around  
U.S. efforts to limit the upcoming round of talks to three years, 
preventing a repeat of the Uruguay Round, which dragged on for 
nearly eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two areas of negotiations -- agriculture and services -- are part  
of the so-called built-in agenda, meaning that countries agreed as 
part of the Uruguay package to re-open talks in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman noted a recent agreement among trade ministers of the  
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, made up of the United 
States and other Pacific Rim nations, that the new talks also 
should aim to further cut tariffs on manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
	More progress could come in outlining the goals for the talks  
when President Clinton meets with other APEC leaders in New Zealand 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is expected to have discussions with Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin while at APEC. Esserman refused to speculate 
on whether the two leaders would be able to strike a final 
market-opening trade agreement that would clear the way for China's 
membership in the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries came close to a deal in April. Since then,  
discussions have broken off because of China's unhappiness with the 
mistaken NATO bombing of its embassy in Yugoslavia. A final 
agreement by lowering Chinese barriers would represent a boon for 
U.S. businesses and farmers hoping to break into the world's 
largest market.

<HEADLINE>  L.A. Suspect Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A white supremacist told the FBI that he  
killed a Filipino-American postal worker because he was nonwhite 
and worked for the federal government, authorities said today as 
more charges were filed in that killing and a bloody attack on a 
Jewish center. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas revealed a detailed account of  
the murder of postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto shortly after 
county prosecutors filed new state charges against Buford O. Furrow 
Jr., 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The new charges include first-degree murder and five counts of  
attempted murder -- all alleged as hate crimes based on race, 
nationality or religion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the prosecutor, Furrow confessed to killing Ileto  
shortly after the shootings that wounded five at the North Valley 
Jewish Community Center a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayorkas said Furrow saw Ileto as a ``target of opportunity.''  
</P>
<P>
	Furrow told authorities he saw the postal worker standing next  
to his van and asked if Ileto would mail a letter for him. When he 
agreed, Furrow pulled out a gun and shot him 10 times. Ileto tried 
to run away, but Furrow shot him again and watched him fall to the 
ground face down. He then fled in a stolen Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	He told investigators that he thought Ileto was Hispanic or  
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto's relatives at his mother's home in Monterey Park, a city  
near Los Angeles, could not bear to watch the prosecutors' 
televised news conference. ``It's hard for us to hear,'' cousin 
Thomas Tiangco said, his eyes filling with tears. ``It hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the shooting at the Jewish center, Mayorkas said  
additional evidence was being gathered and ``we will file federal 
civil rights charges if the evidence so warrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, shackled and handcuffed, was led into a courtroom late  
this morning for arraignment on the federal charges. Looking around 
at the standing-room only crowd of mostly reporters he smiled and 
said to his public defender, ``They all like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Magistrate Judge Carolyn Turchin refused bail.  
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's state complaint alleged that Ileto ``was  
intentionally killed because of his race or nationality.'' The 
so-called ``enhancement'' to the murder count -- the allegation of a 
hate crime -- could make Furrow eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged with the attempted murders of Isabelle  
Shalometh, 68, a receptionist at the center; counselor Mindy 
Finkelstein, 16; and three little boys, Benjamin Kadish, Joshua 
Stepakoff and James Zidell. Benjamin was the most seriously wounded 
and remained in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	County prosecutors alleged that Furrow committed the crimes  
``because of the victims' religion or ancestry or perceived 
religion or ancestry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was also charged with carjacking.  
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, who surrendered to the FBI in Las Vegas, was brought  
back to Los Angeles Wednesday night aboard a U.S. Customs 
helicopter after waiving extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Furrow fled to Las Vegas by taxi -- a 275-mile  
trip that involved two cabs -- after Tuesday's shootings. He spent 
the night at a hotel, then walked into an FBI office and confessed 
to both the center shooting and the slaying of the mailman, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles,'' an  
FBI source quoted Furrow as saying. The source said Furrow assumed 
he had killed some children. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told investigators ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call  
to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At his federal court appearance, Furrow sat expressionless as  
the charges were read, said his attorney, Art Allen. Asked if he 
understood the charges, he answered: ``Yes, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shackled at the feet and cuffed at the wrists, Furrow then  
walked down the steps of the courthouse to the jeers of a bystander 
who rushed up and shouted: ``You're a coward! You are a coward!' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow looked at him and smiled, and was then hustled away.  
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The balding suspect also belonged to the Aryan Nations group in  
1995, said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	After the center shooting, police said, Furrow abandoned a van  
full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to 
white supremacist thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved the attack 
was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center in suburban Granada Hills, a leafy  
middle-class neighborhood, remained closed today, guarded by police 
and security officers. It was expected to reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the children assembled next door in St. Andrews and St.  
Charles Episcopal Church, which shares its space with Temple Beth 
Torah -- a refuge for children the day of the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to scare us away,'' J. Eliad, the father of a  
4-year-old girl, said Wednesday. ``We're going to be here for 
good.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Unveils plans To Reduce Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being hammered by airline executives for  
delays this summer, the Federal Aviation Administration has 
developed a plan to help reduce such inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, in a letter to the airlines, said it will soon have  
its command center in Herndon, Va., start coordinating traffic 
flows in bad weather, eliminating conflicts between local centers 
spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FAA will let the center minimize the use of  
extra buffers that are otherwise routinely established between 
planes in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has also pledged to develop a policy in which  
airplanes held on the ground because of bad weather will be given a 
specific projected departure time. Such information can then be 
relayed to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline passengers, who have suffered through hundreds of delays  
this summer, should start seeing the effect of the changes within 
the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the FAA said a long-term improvement hinges on the  
continuation of the agency's $13 billion modernization program, as 
well as congressional approval of a plan to renew the agency for 
another five years. Included in that ``reauthorization'' bill, now 
stalled in the Senate, is language that would let the FAA start 
charging fees for some of its services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we and the airlines developed is a short-term program  
that we believe will have the effect of reducing the delays,'' 
Eliot Brenner, the agency's chief spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agree that what's needed over the longer term is the  
FAA's steady program modernizing the system, which is why the 
long-term reauthorization is so important to us,'' Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, airlines have united in protest about air  
traffic delays, saying they are costing them money and contributing 
to rising passenger discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group,  
estimates the more than 308,000 air traffic control delays last 
year cost the industry $4.1 billion -- up from $3.9 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never have the on-time record we want unless the (FAA)  
can ensure that their system keeps up with growth,'' Jim Goodwin, 
chairman of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., said in Chicago 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which runs the air traffic control system and is  
responsible for ensuring passenger safety, contends that only 3 
percent of air traffic problems are attributed to equipment 
troubles. It says three-quarters of all delays are caused by bad 
weather, especially in the summer, when thunderstorms are common. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the agency is in the midst of a long-awaited  
program to upgrade its computers and displays in en route centers 
and facilities controlling traffic near airports. The FAA is also 
studying technology that would free pilots from the limits of the 
existing system of aerial highways and let planes fly routes picked 
by the pilots, a concept called ``free flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to American Airlines President Donald Carty, which  
mirrored letters sent to other airline executives, FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey said the agency benefited from the 
carriers' suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA is committed to do its part to follow through on the  
action items on which the airlines and we have agreed,'' Garvey 
wrote. ``Those actions, along with individual airline efforts to 
review and amend internal policies and procedures as appropriate, 
will lead us toward the improvements we are both seeking.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Airline Orders Airbus Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Taiwan's China Airlines has agreed to buy seven  
Airbus A340-300 long-range planes and has taken options on five 
more jets in a deal worth up to $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with state-controlled China Airlines includes options  
for an eighth A340-300 as well as four twin engine A330-300, the 
European consortium Airbus Industrie said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Airbus sale comes after Seattle-based Boeing Co. lost out on  
a deal to sell China Airlines a dozen Boeing 777 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, however, Boeing signed a $2.5 billion order to  
supply the airline with 13 747-400 cargo jets. 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines signed a letter of intent with Boeing in 1995 to  
acquire the 777 passenger jets, but switched the order to Airbus in 
another letter of intent signed in June, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is locked in a fierce competition with Airbus over orders  
for A340s and the slightly smaller 777s. 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines said at a news conference Thursday in Taipei that  
the A340s will be delivered between 2001 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Airlines deal took on political overtones this month  
when accusations surfaced that Taiwan was snubbing Boeing in the 
passenger plane sale to retaliate against U.S. government policies 
seen as unfavorable to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	China Airlines officials have denied the accusations.  
</P>
<P>
	Chiang Hung-yi, China Airlines chairman, said Thursday that  
Airbus was selected because the standardized design of the A340 and 
A330 will help reduce maintenance and pilot training costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline can put the four-engine A340s into service right  
away, Chiang said, noting that it would take the carrier about a 
year to gain approval for using the two-engine Boeing 777s on its 
transoceanic routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus Industrie, which groups France's Aerospatiale, British  
Aerospace, Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas and DaimlerChrysler 
Aerospace, is Boeing's main competitor.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Trade Hawkins, Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls finally made their long-awaited  
first move of the offseason Thursday, sending Brent Barry to the 
Seattle SuperSonics for guards James Cotton and Hersey Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat curious move on the part of the Bulls, who  
signed Barry to a six-year, $27 million contract last January as 
one of the first pieces of their rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brent did a fine job for us, but we felt we needed a veteran  
like Hersey to work with our younger guys,'' general manager Jerry 
Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, 6-foot-6 and 27 years old, averaged 11.1 points, 3.9  
rebounds and 3.1 assists in 37 games last season. He is the second 
shooting guard picked up by the Sonics in recent days, joining free 
agent acquisition Vernon Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle remains in the market for a small forward to replace the  
departed Detlef Schrempf, who signed with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to trade Hersey we needed to receive someone very  
special in return,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We think 
Brent's athleticism, versatility and youth will fit perfectly with 
the new direction of our team. We hate to see Hersey and James go, 
but this opportunity was too good to pass up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, 32, is an 11-year veteran who had been with the Sonics  
for four seasons. He lost his starting spot last season and had 
career-low averages of 10.3 points and 2.5 assists. It was no 
secret in recent weeks that the Sonics were trying to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton, 23, played just 10 games last season because of a  
strained hamstring and averaged 2.5 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen a whole lot of him, but we've liked what we  
have seen,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins has two years remaining on a contract that will pay him  
nearly $4.2 million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls still have as much as $18 million in salary cap room,  
although Krause seems determined to save much of it for next summer 
when Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Latrell Sprewell are among the 
possible free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago was rebuffed in its attempt to sign Portland free agent  
Jermaine O'Neal, and Krause said there are few, if any, players 
left on the market who fit his team's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously what we're doing, it's a situation where we'll be  
looking to do things down the road,'' Krause said. ``We had 
interest and talked to a few players, and we're still talking. But 
we feel that with the way our club is developing, there aren't many 
players we feel like committing to long-term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry was Chicago's third-leading scorer last season behind Toni  
Kukoc and Ron Harper. Kukoc is entering the final year of his 
contract, while Harper is a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chip Stocks Rise / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today, although a  
disappointing auction of Treasury bonds sapped some of the market's 
strength in the push to extend Wednesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 48.13 at 10,835.93, adding to Wednesday's 132.65-point gain. The 
Dow rose as much as 113 points earlier in today's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index  
was up 3.98 at 1,305.91, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 
0.45 at 2,564.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Wednesday, bargain-hunters went shopping for stocks  
that have been pounded down from the record heights reached in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about higher interest rates, which have held the  
market down, continued to rattle investors today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell following the Treasury's afternoon auction of $10  
billion in 30-year bonds. Traders said demand for the bonds fell 
short of expectations, driving the price down and the yield up. 
Yields on 30-year bonds hit 6.27 percent in the open market, a 
level unseen since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in bond yields this summer has hurt stocks in two ways.  
For one thing, rising interest rates raise the cost of business 
borrowing, cutting into profitability. In addition, with rates 
above 6 percent, bonds are presenting an attractive alternative to 
investing in volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest evidence that the Federal Reserve may raise rates in  
an effort to stave off inflation came from a stronger-than-expected 
report on retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose 0.7  
percent in July, boosted by a big gain in automotive sales. Strong 
consumer spending could suggest to the Fed that the booming economy 
is overheating, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But without automobiles and seasonal goods like air  
conditioners, the retail sales increase was quite modest, noted 
Robert G. Smith, chief executive officer of Smith Affiliated 
Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really kind of a bland number,'' he said. ``But there's  
a lot of anxiety right now about every new domestic economic 
indicator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe the Fed will be more interested in the  
producer price index, due for release on Friday. That index is a 
measure of inflation pressures at the wholesale level, or before 
reaching consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar rose 2 11/16 to 61 15/16, helping buoy the Dow after  
Goldman Sachs added the company to its list of recommended stocks. 
An analyst said Caterpillar should benefit from the improving 
global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online extended its gains from the previous session,  
rising 1 5/8 to 94. AOL shares rose 7 3/8 on Wednesday after company 
executives held an upbeat conference call with analysts and major 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But most major computer makers slipped today after a Merrill  
Lynch analyst said in a report that a trend toward low-priced 
computers could eventually cut into profits. Hewlett Packard 
plunged 5 3/8 to 104, the biggest decliner in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewed rumors that Merrill Lynch will seek a partner in the  
financial-services industry pushed its shares up 4 1/8 to 71 1/8. 
Brokerage officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 599.78 million shares at late 
afternoon, slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.82 at 613.04, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.83 at 779.20. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.37 to 428.56.

	The district attorney's state complaint alleged that Ileto ``was  
intentionally killed because of his race or nationality.'' The 
so-called ``enhancement'' to the murder count -- the allegation of a 
hate crime -- could make Furrow eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged with the attempted murders of Isabelle  
Shalometh, 68, a receptionist at the center; counselor Mindy 
Finkelstein, 16; and three little boys, Benjamin Kadish, Joshua 
Stepakoff and James Zidell. Benjamin was the most seriously wounded 
and remained in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	County prosecutors alleged that Furrow committed the crimes  
``because of the victims' religion or ancestry or perceived 
religion or ancestry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was also charged with carjacking.  
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, who surrendered to the FBI in Las Vegas, was brought  
back to Los Angeles Wednesday night aboard a U.S. Customs 
helicopter after waiving extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Furrow fled to Las Vegas by taxi -- a 275-mile  
trip that involved two cabs -- after Tuesday's shootings. He spent 
the night at a hotel, then walked into an FBI office and confessed 
to both the center shooting and the slaying of the mailman, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles,'' an  
FBI source quoted Furrow as saying. The source said Furrow assumed 
he had killed some children. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told investigators ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call  
to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At his federal court appearance, Furrow sat expressionless as  
the charges were read, said his attorney, Art Allen. Asked if he 
understood the charges, he answered: ``Yes, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shackled at the feet and cuffed at the wrists, Furrow then  
walked down the steps of the courthouse to the jeers of a bystander 
who rushed up and shouted: ``You're a coward! You are a coward!' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow looked at him and smiled, and was then hustled away.  
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The balding suspect also belonged to the Aryan Nations group in  
1995, said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	After the center shooting, police said, Furrow abandoned a van  
full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to 
white supremacist thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved the attack 
was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center in suburban Granada Hills, a leafy  
middle-class neighborhood, remained closed today, guarded by police 
and security officers. It was expected to reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the children assembled next door in St. Andrews and St.  
Charles Episcopal Church, which shares its space with Temple Beth 
Torah -- a refuge for children the day of the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to scare us away,'' J. Eliad, the father of a  
4-year-old girl, said Wednesday. ``We're going to be here for 
good.''

<HEADLINE> Rams Named in Wrongful Death Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams have been added as a  
defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of a 
woman killed in a wreck involving linebacker Leonard Little. 
</P>
<P>
	The widower and teen-age son of Susan Y. Gutweiler allege Little  
was driving drunk after participating in a Celebrity Waiters' Night 
on Oct. 19 at a hotel bar. Little's sport utility vehicle collided 
with Gutweiler's car after he left the event in downtown St. Louis. 
She died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gutweilers' attorney, John Kilo, said the Rams failed to  
properly supervise Little, who was an employee and making an 
appearance that night at a charitable event. Kilo said the Rams 
failed to stop the intoxicated linebacker from leaving the hotel. 
Police have said Little was legally drunk at the time of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilo filed the original lawsuit last November in St. Louis  
County Circuit Court seeking damages from Little. He amended the 
lawsuit earlier this week to include the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rams attorney Alan B. Bornstein of St. Louis could not  
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, 24, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter on June  
16. He has spent 21 days at the city workhouse and must spend an 
additional 69 nights in jail over a 12-month period. He's also been 
ordered to serve four years of probation and perform 1,000 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL suspended Little without pay for the first eight games  
of the season, but he can practice with the team and play in 
exhibition games.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Jean Van de Velde will always be remembered  
for a triple bogey on the 72nd hole that cost him the British Open. 
But judging from his opening round at the PGA, he couldn't be more 
popular with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds cheered and encouraged him as he struggled to a 74  
Thursday. His golf clubs didn't arrive at Medinah until Tuesday 
afternoon, throwing off his preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played terrible. I didn't play good at all. I couldn't hit  
it straight,'' Van de Velde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde admits he is much better known in the United States  
than in his native France because there are so many more golfers 
here -- by his estimates 25 million to about 350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	His nightmarish finish at the British is something weekend  
hackers can relate to and empathize with. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were really pulling for me today,'' he said. ``Telling me  
to keep on going and keep on trying and that's what I tried to do. 
It's very easy to have people behind you when things go your way. 
It feels even better when they are not going the way you want and 
that people are still behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first appearance in a major since his debacle at Carnoustie,  
Scotland, didn't faze Van de Velde. He was gregarious, witty and 
seemingly carefree after his round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't nervous,'' he said. ``Why should I be?''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSE CALL:* Mike Weir, who lives in Draper, Utah, phoned home  
after Wednesday's tornado struck Salt Lake City, about a 15-minute 
drive from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife said she looked outside the window and saw downtown  
Salt Lake and she thought there was a fire with the black smoke. 
That was the funnel,'' Weir said. ``It was pretty close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weir, one of the rare left-handers on tour, is close to his  
parents this week. They live in suburban Crystal Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the area. My parents live here just 40 minutes outside  
of town and I feel very comfortable here definitely. Great 
restaurants. I love coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SENIORS BOUND:* With only a month left before he heads to the  
Senior PGA Tour, five-time British Open champion Tom Watson is 
trying to head out in style. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who turns 50 on Sept. 4, holed a 25-foot birdie putt  
from the left edge of the green on the par-4 No. 3 Thursday at the 
81st PGA Championship. As the ball dropped into the cup, Watson 
yelled, ``Yeah,'' and the crowd broke into loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go get 'em, Tommy!'' a fan yelled as Watson walked off the No.  
4 tee. ``You've still got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who's won two PGA Tour events in the last 12 years,  
smiled and thanked the man. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished the round with a 3-over 75.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER REJECT:* With all the controversy swirling over the Ryder  
Cup and whether players should have a say in how revenues are 
allocated to various charities, Brian Watts just wants the chance 
to play for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd die for my country, so I'd really like to play on the  
Ryder Cup,'' Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, who finished second in the 1998 British Open, said he was  
told earlier this year by the PGA that he's not eligible for the 
team because his parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of his 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was born in Canada but lived there for only six months and  
is a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dead issue for this year because even if I was accruing  
points, I think I'd be down there about 40 or 50th on the list,'' 
Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of support on my side, though. I'm hoping in  
the future that they will change that rule as I've only lived 
outside of the country for six months of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said he'd talked with PGA president Will Man and was told  
the ruling could be changed. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOW WET WAS IT?:* Rain gear, slickers and umbrellas. Staying  
dry was in fashion Thursday for the first day of the PGA 
Championship as summer storms rolled through the Chicago area, 
dousing Medinah's No. 3 course and softening drought-scorched 
greens. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Haas said it was raining so hard as he was on the putting  
green before his 7:25 a.m. tee time that he thought the tournament 
might be suspended immediately. It eventually was, but not until 
nearly 10 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The wet conditions for the first six holes of his round hampered  
visibility, as Haas tried to follow the flight of his own shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first six holes it rained pretty heavy at times. And you  
know, just grabbing the club trying to keep the grip dry,'' Haas 
said after his opening 68. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dark, too. Not because of it being 7:25 but just  
because of the cloud cover. I would literally lose the ball on a 
longer shot. On the second hole, I hit a 4-iron and I could not see 
the ball on the green. I heard a couple of people clapping and I 
knew I had hit a good shot, but I couldn't have told you where it 
ended up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, who shot 70, said the soggy conditions allowed him  
to be more aggressive off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that any ball that lands in the fairway will stay in  
the fairway,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did put up an umbrella like everybody else. My dad always  
says, `You only can get wet once. And once you're wet, you're wet. 
Just deal with it.''' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Hale Irwin, who won the 1990 U.S. Open at Medinah, is  
the oldest competitor in the field at age 54. Paul Runyan, 92, is 
the oldest past champion in the gallery. He won the PGA title in 
1934 and 1938. ... Spain's 19-year-old Sergio Garcia is the 
youngest PGA competitor since Gene Sarazen in 1921. Sarazen, who 
died this year at age 97, was 19 years,six months and 29 days when 
he made his PGA debut. Garcia is making his first appearance at 19 
years, seven months, 27 days. ... The PGA is being held for the 
fifth time in the state of Illinois. The third PGA was held in 1919 
at Flossmoor Country Club, the 1925 and 1961 tournaments at Olympia 
Fields and the 1989 tournament at Kemper Lakes in Hawthorn Woods.

<HEADLINE> Workers' Families Sue in Van Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The families of 13 tomato pickers killed  
when their van slammed into a tractor-trailer filed a lawsuit 
Thursday accusing the truck driver and two trucking companies of 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Highway Patrol is still investigating the  
accident and has not assigned blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in Fresno County Superior Court, names truck  
driver Adrian Erazo; Raul H. Oropeza, sole proprietor of Oropeza 
Trucking; and Hoffman Bros. Harvesting Inc. of Tracy, Calif., owner 
of the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not name the owner of the van.  
</P>
<P>
	The families' attorney, Robert Perez, and Fernando F. Chavez,  
the oldest son of United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez, hope to 
use the lawsuit to address farmworker transportation problems in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This accident has brought the issue to the conscience of the  
community,'' Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Hoffman Bros. was not immediately returned.  
There is no listing for Oropeza Trucking in the Fresno area.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Live Ads for Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., hoping to build an edgy image for  
its 2000 Focus that will appeal to teen-agers and 20-somethings, 
will broadcast 64 live commercials to introduce the new line of 
subcompact cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials featuring comedian and actress Annabelle  
Gurwitch will begin Sept. 9, during the MTV Video Music Awards 
show, and continue through March, primarily on prime-time network 
programs popular with ``echo-boomers,'' the children of baby 
boomers. There will be simultaneous live promotions on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford Focus campaign also will include conventional taped  
commercials, print advertising, billboards and radio ads. 
</P>
<P>
	To generate additional ``buzz'' among young people, Ford will  
loan customized Focus cars to what the automaker describes as ``120 
trendy people'' -- club DJs, concert promoters and such -- in New 
York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 automaker did not disclose the cost of the campaign as  
it outlined the plans Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Live commercials were standard fare during television's infancy  
in the 1950s, before recorded programming took over. They still 
surface. The Prodigy online service ran more than 100 live ads in a 
1993-94 campaign, and live contests have become a halftime fixture 
of major sports championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with live ads is they can go wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	There was the time in 1958 when John Cameron Swayze put a Timex  
watch on a motorboat propeller in a big tank of water and it fell 
off. He couldn't retrieve it to report his famous line: ``It takes 
a licking and keeps on ticking,'' although the watch, still 
running, was later recovered. In another '50s-era commercial, an 
actress couldn't open the refrigerator she was showing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford marketers say the risk of live commercials is a lure to  
reach the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's precisely why we're doing it,'' said Jan Klug, the  
Ford's marketing communications manager. ``It's all about taking 
risks and living in the moment, which is really what the brand is 
all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Focus is Ford's latest attempt at a ``world car.'' On  
sale in Europe for about a year, the Focus recently began arriving 
at dealerships in the United States and Canada in advance of its 
formal launch Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Focus was styled in Ford's ``new edge'' school of design,  
with sharp creases and angles. It stands much taller than most 
small cars, a trend that automakers are adopting as car drivers 
increasingly find themselves in a sea of big sport utility 
vehicles, minivans and pickups that block their view. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford will offer the Focus with several optional packages aimed  
at young drivers' interests. The ``pet package,'' for example, will 
include a dog safety harness, an insulated, tip-resistent water 
bowl and a ``doggie bag'' to pack pet supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will be sold alongside the venerable Escort, which ranks  
fifth in U.S. sales. Ford will produce the 2000 Escort in fewer 
variations as a low-budget model and industry analysts expect the 
model to disappear from Ford's lineup at the end of the 2002 model 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials with Gurwitch, who hosts Turner Broadcasting  
System's ``Dinner &AMP; a Movie'' program on cable, will be scripted 
and rehearsed. But Ford hopes to make them topical and 
improvisational enough to appear spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to find some bloopers, and I think that's going  
to build a cult following around this,'' said Bruce Rooke, creative 
director at the J. Walter Thompson agency. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 minutes before each commercial is broadcast, computer  
users can log on a special Web site to watch the crew set up. The 
view will be from a hand-held camera and will include brief 
interviews with cast and crew in a live documentary format. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising experts said Ford's novel approach could succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Younger consumers have built up a tremendous amount of  
skepticism against polished ads,'' said advertising Professor 
Roland Rust at Vanderbilt University. ``This is a way to break out 
of that. It's new, off the wall and risky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing consultant Jack Trout of Trout &AMP; Partners said Ford  
needs to make sure the ads get across a message about the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want all jokes,'' he said. ``A lot of car  
manufacturers get so cute you don't learn too much about the car. 
You don't want to get so involved in the production values of this 
live, behind-the-scenes stuff that you lose the message.''

</P>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Donald Johnson, a World War II army  
veteran who headed the Veterans Administration during the last 
years of the Vietnam War, died Tuesday of complications of cancer. 
He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who headed the VA from 1969 to 1974, resigned under  
criticism for the Nixon administration's proposal to cut benefits 
for disabled Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	He later served as a top official in the Commerce Department, as  
chief of staff to Sen. Roger W. Jepson, R-Iowa, and then as 
executive director of the National Credit Union Administration. He 
retired in 1993.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Earle M. Jorgensen, a steel entrepreneur and  
the last surviving member of Gov. Ronald Reagan's ``kitchen 
cabinet,'' died Wednesday at the age of 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen sold steel to California's burgeoning oil, aircraft  
and construction industries from the 1920s to the 1990s. The 
company he founded in 1921, now called EMJ Co., grew to sales of 
more than $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained active in the steel business he founded until his  
death., 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen and his second wife, Marion, were among the social  
elite of Los Angeles. The couple remained close friends with Ronald 
and Nancy Reagan for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorgensen was among a small group of Reagan advisers who urged  
the former movie star to run for governor, and then for the 
presidency. As governor, Reagan appointed Jorgensen to the State 
College Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Jorgensen sold his company, with 28 plants in 24 cities  
nationwide, to a group backed by leveraged buyout specialists Kelso 
&AMP; Co. He wouldn't say what he received in the $264 million dollar 
purchase, but he had owned 32 percent of the company stock -- worth 
about $84 million -- and retained 13.5 percent for a Jorgensen 
family trust.

	NEW HOPE, Minn. (AP) -- Mildred F. Lane, who looked inside a  
``big fluffy bun'' while another woman asked ``Where's the Beef?'', 
died Saturday from injuries she suffered during a fall. She was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Lane was 80, an advertising agent discovered her while  
buying yarn in a Chicago knitting shop. She appeared in commercials 
for Rhodes Bread before doing spots for the Wendy's restaurant 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	In her most famous commercial, filmed in the mid-1980s, Lane  
stood between two other women while wearing bifocals. The trio 
criticized other hamburger restaurants, with one asking: ``Where's 
the Beef?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For appearing in the Wendy's commercials, she received a gold  
card to get a free meal every day from the restaurant chain, said 
nephew Robert Egan.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anthony Radziwill, a television executive and  
cousin of the late John F. Kennedy Jr., died of cancer Tuesday, one 
week after his 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of Lee Bouvier Radziwill Ross -- sister to Jacqueline  
Kennedy Onassis -- and Prince Stanislas Radziwill, died Tuesday at 
New York Hospital after a 10-year illness, said a statement from 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Radziwill had a steadfast friendship with first cousin John F.  
Kennedy Jr. When Kennedy married Carolyn Bessette in 1996, 
Radziwill was best man at the clandestine wedding ceremony in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Radziwill grew up in England, where his parents lived at the  
time. In 1982, he received a bachelor's degree in broadcast 
journalism from Boston University and started his career as an 
associate producer for NBC Sports, doing Emmy-award winning work 
during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined ABC News as a producer for ``Prime Time Live'' in  
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Radziwill won television's prestigious Peabody Award  
for an investigation of new Nazism in the United States. He later 
won two more Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
	Radziwill is survived by his wife, Carole, mother, stepfather  
Herbert Ross, and sister Anna Christina Radziwill.

	SEBASTOPOL, Calif. (AP) -- Steven Schack, co-owner of the Redwood  
Hill Farm brand of goat cheese that has become synonymous with 
California cuisine, died Thursday after a five-month battle with 
pancreatic cancer. He was 49.

<P>
	Redwood Hill Farm started out as a hobby and grew into a  
thriving business that sells goat cheese and other dairy products 
around the country.

	GIBSONTON, Fla. (AP) -- Jeanie Tomaini, who was born without legs  
and became known as ``The Half Girl'' on the carnival circuit, died 
Tuesday. She was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 2-foot-6 in stature, in spirit Mrs. Tomaini is  
remembered as a giant -- a matriarch who helped shape this tiny 
hamlet into an off-season haven for circus workers. 
</P>
<P>
	While crisscrossing the United States on the sideshow circuit,  
she met Al Tomaini, who stood 8-foot-4 and wore a size 22 shoe. 
They married and worked the shows together as ``The World's 
Strangest Couple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, Mrs. Tomaini never saw her disability as a  
stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only if I meet a person who is morally, spiritually and  
physically perfect will I ever hang my head in shame,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Talking Fish Boosts Sega's New Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The mysterious fish with a human face pops onto the  
TV monitor, swims up lazily and asks for your birthday. Answer late 
July, and it drawls: ``Leo, huh? The type who likes to play 
leader?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The verbose smart aleck is ``Seaman,'' the new Japanese hit  
video game for the Sega Enterprises Dreamcast machine arriving at 
U.S. stores Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo manufacturer is counting on solid Dreamcast sales in  
the United States to hold its ground against Sony Computer 
Entertainment and Nintendo Co. in the heated competition over the 
world game-machine market. 
</P>
<P>
	Popular games are key to boosting machine sales. And ``Seaman''  
appears to be the hit Sega has been desperately waiting for. It has 
already sold out in some stores in Japan with about 120,000 copies 
moved since July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mistake to assume that it's enough to have a great  
machine. That's only the beginning,'' said Toshiyuki Fukuda, 
manager for game store Laox. ``Without hit games, the Dreamcast is 
just a box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, the scant repertoire of Dreamcast games was hurting  
sales. Titles for the machine total about 60 in Japan, compared to 
more than 2,000 for Sony's Playstation. There will be at least 16 
games by the time Dreamcast goes on sale in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seaman'' has a voice recognition system that allows the fish  
to understand -- at least most of the time -- up to 100 words at a 
time, depending on the question it asks. The game creates the 
illusion of an offbeat dialogue with an unorthodox pet. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many games, there is no real plot in ``Seaman,'' which is  
also being planned for the U.S. market. The player takes care of 
the fish for 25 days until it evolves into a frog. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut this month of another popular title, fighting game  
``Soul Calibur'' which highlights the dazzling, smooth visuals of 
Dreamcast, also has helped machine sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Before ``Seaman,'' Dreamcast sales in Japan had not been  
promising, hitting only about a million since going on sale last 
November, about 10 percent below company forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't stack up well against the competitors. Some 16  
million Playstations have been sold in Japan and more than 21 
million in North America. Nintendo 64 sales total 4 million in 
Japan, and 14 million in North America. Advance U.S. orders for the 
Dreamcast total 200,000 so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega has not released any recent figures. But the new games are  
pushing up machine sales, said Yoshitsugu Sato, manager of 
Hakuhinkan Toy Park in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	More powerful than the Playstation or Nintendo 64, the Dreamcast  
also comes with a modem, allowing users to play games with other 
Dreamcast players on the Internet, as well as download game 
characters and other information. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Playstation nor the Nintendo offers Internet access,  
although the rivals are expected to catch up soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the splash ``Seaman'' is making, Sega needs a string of  
hot-selling games if it hopes to stay in the home game-machine 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is in dire trouble. Sega posted $375 million in  
losses for the fiscal year ending in March and is forecasting a 
loss of $99 million for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the gamemakers's financial woes, former vice-chairman and  
chief operating officer Bernard Stolar left Sega of America Inc. to 
be replaced by Toshiro Kezuka, the company said Wednesday. No 
reason was given for the personnel change. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appear skeptical about a Sega comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	Sega share prices at one point plunged about 45 percent on the  
Tokyo Stock Exchange from the beginning of this year, to as low as 
$12 in June, though they have since recovered somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's life or death for Sega,'' said Mitsuko Morita, an analyst  
with Morgan Stanley Japan in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Sega slashed Dreamcast prices in Japan 35 percent, to  
$170, to lure buyers. The Dreamcast will sell at $199 in the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Permits More Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has increased the number of  
refugees to be allowed legal entry into the United States to 
90,000, including those who fled Kosovo during the recent conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo Thursday, Clinton authorized entry of up to 90,000  
refugees during fiscal 2000, up from 78,000 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Admissions are based on country-by-country allocations made each  
year by the State Department. Applicants must prove valid fears of 
persecution based on race, religion, membership in a particular 
social group or political opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Clinton reduced the entry levels for European  
refugees by 1,000 and increased levels for African refugees by 
6,000. Entries from Latin America and the Caribbean remained at 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new authorization, 47,000 refugees would be allowed in  
from Europe, 8,000 each from East and South Asia, and 18,000 from 
Africa. An additional 6,000 slots were not allocated. 
</P>
<P>
	The allocation for Europe includes 27,000 from the former  
Yugoslavia and 20,000 from newly independent and Balkan states. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 48,000 refugees were allowed from Europe, 9,000 from  
East Asia, 12,000 from Africa, 3,000 from Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and 4,000 from Near East/South Asia. An additional 2,000 
slots were not allocated.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Push Hard for Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Straw poll fever has Iowa in its grip.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes has bought up last-minute television ads, George  
Bush is searching out ``team leaders,'' and Lamar Alexander has 
campaigned in virtually every corner of Iowa in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll on Saturday night is being portrayed as a turning  
point in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination -- and 
the candidates are responding in kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see every campaign putting every ounce of campaign energy  
into this,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican rivals have built substantial  
organizational efforts for the straw poll. Only Arizona Sen. John 
McCain is absent, calling the straw poll a ``scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve a campaign based on ideas and issues not the  
financial arms race that the straw poll has become,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a cheap deal. Bush admits to spending $750,000, and  
accuses Forbes of spending $2 million. Alexander admits only to 
``low six-figure'' spending, but his campaign has focused almost 
exclusively on the straw poll all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has worked his way through a brutal, 21-day grind that  
took him to every corner of the state. The Forbes bus has been 
rumbling around the state for nearly two months, all pointing to 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not discussing budgets,'' said Forbes aide Bill Dal Col.  
``This is a test along the way to February. This is a check to see 
who can deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer has been working hard on a  
church-based network, working night and day to lure social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit a wall about two days ago,'' said exhausted aide Marlys  
Popma. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for a live debate at WOI-TV studios the night before the  
GOP straw poll were canceled Thursday after just three candidates -- 
Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah -- 
agreed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush arrived in Davenport Thursday night to begin a weekend of  
campaigning for straw poll votes, adding a special plea to his 
well-worn stump speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturday is a pretty important test. So I'm here not only to  
share what's in my heart and tell you why I'm running, I'm hear to 
ask you to come to Ames. It's important,'' Bush told about 600 
supporters at a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has bought a half-hour of television time Friday evening  
to air a campaign commercial featuring prominent social 
conservatives, a group he's worked overtime to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has been running phone banks, both from campaign  
headquarters in Des Moines and from his campaign bus, leaving 
nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the work is pure drudgery, the kind of  
nuts-and-bolts work that goes on in campaign boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had 20 phones working for the last two weeks, from nine  
in the morning until nine at night,'' said Monte Shaw, an aide to 
former cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. ``We're doing it the 
old-fashioned Iowa way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's technique is to find ``ticket captains,'' valued backers  
who volunteer to show up at the straw poll and bring along 10 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets are $25 apiece, largely provided by the campaigns.  
People have to be from Iowa and they get one vote each. The 
Republican Party has not said how many they've sold, but say the 
tickets are still selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is running a low-budget operation, but his campaign  
office is filled every night with volunteers making phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bush, the phone banks are searching for ``team leaders,''  
folks who agree to bring along nine others to the straw poll and 
collect a special reward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team leaders get their picture taken with the governor,'' said  
Bush spokesman Eric Woolson. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican contenders were buzzing around  
the state Thursday, most focusing on the just-opened Iowa State 
Fair. Bauer headed to a cattle exhibit, while former Vice President 
Dan Quayle sought support at a pork exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the logistical headache of getting supporters to  
Ames for the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've leased approximately 100 buses,'' said Woolson. ``Our  
strategy has been more of an organizational strategy as opposed to 
those campaigns that are spending money on television and radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion in Iowa has been difficult to gauge. One poll  
taken for several television stations of likely caucus attendees 
showed Bush with almost a 3-1 lead over Forbes and another taken by 
a Maryland firm called Research 2000 showed Bush and Forbes in a 
dead heat. The other candidates were grouped together behind Bush 
and Forbes in both polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters say polling for Iowa's political events is tough  
because it is hard to identify the population that will show up for 
the caucus and the straw poll.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to reduce U.S. oil demand and protect  
the environment, President Clinton on Thursday created an 
interagency council to promote technologies that turn trees, plants 
and even animal waste into energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cast the initiative as both a security issue and a  
crucial stroke against global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can make the raw material of tomorrow's economy living,  
renewable resources instead of fossil fuels, which pollute the 
atmosphere and warm the planet, the future of our children and our 
grandchildren, the likelihood that there will be more prosperity 
and peace -- all that will be far greater,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting the initiative were two key farm-state senators who  
have legislation of their own promoting ``biomass'' development. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must press forward with creative, high-tech solutions to  
counter the world's finite supply of traditional energy sources,'' 
said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Senate  
Agriculture Committee, added: ``We are only at the beginning of a 
revolution in biotechnology that will lead to more efficient use of 
the world's resources, enabling ecologically sustainable growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have been slow to embrace the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``biomass'' industry is dedicated to finding more efficient  
ways of using trees, plants and other renewable sources -- chicken 
droppings, for example -- to fuel cars, light homes, and propel 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Advances in this area could reduce emissions that are hazardous  
to the environment and also provide a multibillion dollar industry 
for loggers, chemical companies and the nation's farmers. Vice 
President Al Gore unveiled the plan in Iowa, where he has been 
campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential economic benefits are staggering,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reducing the nation's dependence on volatile foreign markets was  
an added plus. Clinton said that increasing global economic 
activity and competition for oil could soon begin to drive oil 
prices up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for our economy, for our security, for our  
environment,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Graddy Dismissed From Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Rod Graddy, a starter at strong safety,  
was kicked off the Florida football team on Thursday by coach Steve 
Spurrier for his involvement in an incident that led to two 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's looking to transfer right now, which would  
probably be in his best interest,'' Spurrier said. He said Graddy 
wants to transfer to a school, probably in Division I-AA, where he 
could play this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Graddy started 11 games last season, with 75 tackles. He has two  
years of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainesville Police stopped Graddy's car shortly after a fight at  
a night club last Friday. Two passengers, Timothy Taylor, 27, and 
Kenneth James Welch, 19, both of Gainesville, were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was charged with strong-armed robbery and aggravated  
battery, Welch with a misdemeanor count of accessory after the 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Taylor and Welch took advantage of a ``mob scene''  
at the club by robbing a man of a $1,200 bracelet. Taylor and Welch 
fled to Graddy's waiting car and Taylor pointed a handgun at two 
men chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
	When Graddy's car was pulled over, Graddy cooperated with police  
and told them Taylor had thrown the gun out the window. Police 
recovered it and arrested the two passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Graddy, who wasn't charged, was already under suspension for the  
first five games of the season for another rules violation.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Uproar Overshadows PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- As David Duval left the 15th tee at Medinah  
Country Club, he crossed paths with Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw, 
who was on his way to the adjacent 12th tee box. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw saw that Duval was 3-under for the first round of the  
PGA Championship, smiled and waved two fingers. Duval grinned and 
nodded back. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the ropes, one would never know the Ryder Cup  
controversy is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the course is another story.  
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw opened fresh wounds on the eve of the PGA, saying he  
was disappointed by the viewpoints of a couple of players on 
revenue generated by the Ryder Cup. Those players later were 
identified as Duval, Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods played their rounds, then stood their ground.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like a pretty large corporate outing,'' Duval said  
when asked if he still thought the matches were nothing more than 
an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods also refused to back down.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exhibition. It always has been,'' Woods added. ``It's  
not meant to be played as a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It sure sounds like a Civil War.  
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw apologized for keeping the topic in the headlines, but  
not for the way he feels about the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from a different generation where the Ryder Cup means a  
lot to us,'' Crenshaw said. ``I'm upset people aren't jumping over 
the moon about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most players would jump over the moon to make the team that  
tries to regain the cup next month. But four top players already on 
the team have talked more about how the money is divided than how 
they can win the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That may say something about team unity with a little more than  
a month before the United States plays Europe at The Country Club 
at Brookline outside of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want 12 committed players going to Boston,'' Crenshaw said  
after shooting a 77 in the opening round of the PGA. ``I want our 
players to be unified. To be honest, I haven't seen that in the 
last four teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't get commitment from them two days after a team meeting  
in which everyone left saying they were on the same page. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there were 13 people in agreement,'' Duval said.  
``Apparently, there's only 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he watched Crenshaw's finger-pointing on television  
Wednesday night, never thinking that his captain might be referring 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was,'' Duval said.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara didn't talk to Crenshaw. He said he only got a message  
from the captain on his phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a dead issue,'' O'Meara said. ``I'm  
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was equally disappointed in how he has been portrayed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The media keeps saying it's pay-for-play, and I don't see it  
that way,'' O'Meara said. ``I take offense to the fact that 
somebody might call me unpatriotic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval spent much of his time after the opening round of the PGA  
defending his position on the issue. No, he never asked for money 
to play. Yes, it is an honor to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, he strongly believes a portion of the money should go  
to charities designated by the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods issued a stronger statement, especially when asked why he  
keeps referring to the Ryder Cup as an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a winner's check?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Further evidence that there is division among the Americans  
comes from Davis Love III, who lashed out at the media for 
continuing to bring it up. And from Tom Lehman, who has said he 
would pay to play in the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman likely would give a handsome sum to have the firestorm  
put out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all be ashamed of ourselves in a way,'' Lehman said.  
``This is an issue that could have been resolved quietly behind 
closed doors, and it wasn't. We don't need this.''

<HEADLINE> Women Plans To Swim Tennessee River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRING CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- After swimming 125 miles of the  
Tennessee River, Mimi Hughes has a unique understanding of what 
happens to the herbicides, pesticides and litter of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything ends up in the river. Everything,'' the 43-year-old  
mother of four said Wednesday on arriving at Watts Bar Dam, marking 
the end of the first leg of her five-year quest to swim the 
652-mile Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming to promote a cleaner river, Hughes set out Aug. 2 at  
the Tennessee headwaters above Knoxville. She plans to swim another 
125 miles each August until she reaches the river's end at Paducah, 
Ky., in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, who swam from Alcatraz to San Francisco in 1996 and from  
Alaska to Russia across the Bering Strait in 1997, at first feared 
a Tennessee River swim because of pollution, then made it her 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I thought about it, the more I realized it was an  
athletic endeavor with a lot of purpose behind it,'' said Hughes, 
who lives in Taft and is a developmental reading teacher and 
adjunct professor at Motlow State Community College in Tullahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Valley Authority, which manages the river system  
and provides teams to help communities solve pollution problems, 
provided Hughes with an escort boat and accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Hughes said she found the shoreline gorgeous,  
but the water tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can turn my head to take a breath and the beauty is so  
spectacular,'' she said. ``And then I put my face into the water 
and I might smell a septic tank that is not working correctly or 
some fertilizer that is runoff from the green, green grass that I 
just passed in someone's yard.''

<HEADLINE> BET Plans Web Site Aimed at Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to draw more black Americans to the  
Internet, cable network operator BET Holdings announced an 
ambitious new Web site today with backing from four major media and 
technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new site, to be called BET.com, is the latest effort to  
narrow the ``digital divide'' between whites and minority groups, 
who have lagged behind others in their access to and usage of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	BET Holdings, which operates the Black Entertainment Television  
network and three other cable channels as well as several 
magazines, intends to make the new site a leading online 
destination for blacks, a ``portal'' that Web surfers can use as 
their home base to jump to other Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture will receive $35 million in backing from its four  
partners, including Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three major media players involved: USA Networks Inc.,  
the American arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and AT&AMP;T Corp.'s 
Liberty Digital, the online media company run by cable magnate John 
Malone. Liberty owns a minority stake in BET. 
</P>
<P>
	BET's chairman and founder, Robert Johnson, called the new  
venture a ``unique social and economic opportunity for African 
Americans.'' He said he believed it was the largest amount ever 
spent to launch a product aimed specifically at blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failure of any community to avail itself of the resources  
of the Internet will limit its ability to succeed in the new 
millennium,'' Johnson said. ``BET is bringing its media channels, 
content and brand resources together with those of our partners to 
create an online destination that will educate, enrich, empower and 
entertain African Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new site, which will launch in November, will offer a  
variety of news, entertainment, finance and free messaging 
services. It will also sell items aimed at black buyers including 
clothes, books, music and gifts.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 19.95 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were held to a minuscule gain  
today and broader indicators retreated. A surge in interest rates 
following a disappointing Treasury bond auction deflated a bid to 
extend Wednesday's broad stock market rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 19.95 at 10,807.75. The Dow rose as much as 113 
points earlier in today's session as it followed through on 
Wednesday's 132.65-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators gave up early gains to finish lower.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were higher across the board for much of today's session  
as bargain-hunters sought out shares that have been pounded down 
from the record heights reached in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about higher interest rates, which have held the  
market down for the past three weeks, prevailed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell following the Treasury's afternoon auction of $10  
billion in 30-year bonds. Traders said demand for the bonds fell 
short of expectations, driving the price down and the yield up. 
Yields on 30-year bonds hit 6.27 percent in the open market, a 
level unseen since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the bond market is behaving like a bear market, it  
will be tough for stocks to take off,'' said Eugene G. Mintz, 
financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in bond yields this summer has hurt stocks in two ways.  
For one thing, rising interest rates raise the cost of business 
borrowing, cutting into profitability. In addition, with rates 
above 6 percent, bonds are presenting an attractive alternative to 
investing in volatile stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest evidence that the Federal Reserve may raise rates  
further in its effort to stave off inflation came from a 
stronger-than-expected report on retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose 0.7  
percent in July, boosted by a big gain in automotive sales. Strong 
consumer spending could suggest to the Fed that the booming economy 
is overheating, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But without automobiles and seasonal goods like air  
conditioners, the retail sales increase was quite modest, noted 
Robert G. Smith, chief executive officer of Smith Affiliated 
Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really kind of a bland number,'' he said. ``But there's  
a lot of anxiety right now about every new domestic economic 
indicator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe the Fed will be more interested in the  
producer price index, due for release on Friday. That index is a 
measure of inflation pressures at the wholesale level, or before 
reaching consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	While economists remained focused on the stream of economic  
data, companies across a wide range of sectors served up 
market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	United Technologies posted the sharpest gains of all Dow  
components after saying it will cut 1,500 jobs in an effort to 
reduce costs at its Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engine unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar also helped buoy the Dow after Goldman Sachs added  
the company to its list of recommended stocks. An analyst said 
Caterpillar should benefit from the improving global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online extended its gains from the previous session. AOL  
shares rose 7 3/8 on Wednesday after company executives held an upbeat 
conference call with analysts and major investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But most major computer makers slipped today after a Merrill  
Lynch analyst said in a report that a trend toward low-priced 
computers could eventually cut into profits. Hewlett Packard was 
the biggest decliner in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Renewed rumors that Merrill Lynch will seek a partner in the  
financial-services industry pushed its shares up. Brokerage 
officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 3.77 to 1,298.16 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 15.44 to 
2,549.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York  
Stock Exchange, with 1,537 down, 1,510 up and 510 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 742.40 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
782.79 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.73 to 610.95, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.28 to 780.65.

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Asher Dislocates Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jamie Asher, the Philadelphia Eagles'  
starting tight end, dislocated his left ankle Thursday night on the 
sixth play of the team's first exhibition game against Baltimore 
and is out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Asher was signed to a $4.1 million, three-year contract to  
solidify the second-most important position in coach Andy Reid's 
new offense. His injury is a huge blow to the team's rebuilding 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Asher was blocking on the Eagles' sixth offensive play when he  
went down clutching his leg. Teammates gathered around as he was 
loaded onto a cart. He raised his helmet to a cheering crowd, a 
look of pain on his face, as he was driven off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, coaching his first game Thursday night, has preached that  
his West Coast offense cannot function without a pass-catching 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Eagles had five tight ends who caught only 33  
passes for 287 yards. Two of them, Jason Dunn and Kaseem Sinceno, 
finished the season on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles have four other tight ends on the roster: Chris  
Fontenot, Jed Weaver, Andrew Jordan and Sinceno. 
</P>
<P>
	Asher caught 28 passes for 294 yards in nine games for the  
Washington Redskins. He started seven games and was leading the 
team in receptions before a loose piece of cartilage in his knee 
gave him problems. Eventually, surgery was required. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months earlier, Asher had a graft performed to increase  
the amount of cartilage in his knee.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Create `Super Batteries' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new generation of batteries that could run  
that pink bunny ragged may be on the horizon: They last 50 percent 
longer than today's batteries, thanks to a ``super-iron'' component 
that promises to be easy and affordable to manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
	They're still under development, so don't look for them in local  
stores soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers at the Israel Institute of Technology invented  
super batteries that could run CD players and flashlights -- and say 
the new batteries also could come in the rechargeable forms needed 
to power camcorders, laptop computers, even electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Improved batteries are needed,'' says Stuart Licht, a  
chemistry professor who led the research team in trying a host of 
materials, from sulfur to tin, before they discovered an unusual 
form of iron boosts battery life. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the outside, the super-iron batteries look identical to  
conventional'' AA or AAA batteries, he said in an e-mail interview 
from Haifa. ``The difference is within, and in the much greater 
energy generated by the super-iron battery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new batteries have 50 percent more energy than traditional  
batteries, Licht reports in Friday's edition of the journal 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	When he tested gadgets that drain batteries at extra-high rates,  
such as portable CD players, he found that the super iron also has 
extra conductivity, leading to another advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``A conventional AAA-size alkaline battery may last only a few  
minutes at high-drain rate, but under the same conditions, a AAA 
super-iron battery discharges for well over an hour,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battery experts called the discovery promising.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a significant advance scientifically,'' said Jack  
Winnick, a chemical engineer at the Georgia Institute of 
Technology. ``I think the manufacturers will be intrigued by it. 
The market right now for these alkaline cells is so enormous ... 
that if they could make a rapid replacement, I think they would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Licht declined comment when asked if manufacturers already  
are interested in commercializing his invention. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 60 billion alkaline batteries -- the type most sold -- are  
used worldwide each year. But their basic internal design hasn't 
changed much since the late 19th century: They typically contain a 
zinc anode and a manganese dioxide cathode. 
</P>
<P>
	Batteries convert chemical energy into electrical energy through  
reactions at the anode and cathode. When active materials at either 
electrode are used up, the battery dies. In most alkaline 
batteries, the cathode dries up long before the anode. 
</P>
<P>
	So the scientists made a new cathode from ``super iron,'' a  
chemically unusual form called iron(VI) that scientists long 
believed too unstable for batteries -- because if it came into 
contact with liquids, it disintegrated into rust in minutes. But 
Licht discovered that the caustic solutions commonly used inside 
batteries actually stabilize the super iron so it doesn't decay. 
</P>
<P>
	The super iron absorbs more electrons than the old-fashioned  
cathode, making it more powerful, Licht's team showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry -- and consumers -- are demanding longer-lasting  
batteries for a variety of uses. Electric cars, for instance, have 
been stalled by the quest for an affordable battery that can go 
longer distances without frequent recharging. 
</P>
<P>
	Most such research has focused on lithium-based batteries, where  
highly energetic but lighter-weight lithium compounds are used to 
make anodes, said Georgia Tech's Winnick. 
</P>
<P>
	But lithium is much more scarce than iron and a hundred times  
more expensive, Licht said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are still questions about the new batteries that require  
further testing, such as how long a shelf life they will have. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if the batteries ultimately are sold, disposing of used  
ones will cause a little less environmental damage than today's 
batteries because the super-iron eventually just rusts, Licht said.

<HEADLINE> Ken Harvey Retires From Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Ken Harvey of  
the Washington Redskins retired Thursday after 11 seasons, unable 
to come back from an injury to his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's come to a point in my life where my mind's there, but my  
body can't go as much as I want it to,'' said Harvey, 34, who was 
under contract through the 2002 season. ``When that time came, it 
was time for me to make this decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know your body, and when it comes to a point where you  
wake up and your knees are sore -- it's time to say goodbye. Even 
though someone else might think you look good, you just know it 
doesn't feel like it used to feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey was a starter in three of the four Pro Bowls he played in  
from 1994-97. The 12th overall pick by the Arizona Cardinals in the 
1988 draft, he came to Washington as a free agent in the spring of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	That autumn, he became the first Redskin to lead the NFC in  
sacks with 13.5 and only the fourth linebacker in NFL history to 
lead the conference in sacks. The mark set a club record for most 
sacks in a season by a linebacker, eclipsing Monte Coleman's record 
of 10.5 set in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put together character, athletic ability, heart and  
willingness to compete no matter what the circumstance, Ken Harvey 
is the best that I've been around,'' Redskins coach Norv Turner 
said. ``It's easy to say that; He's done some things here that no 
one will ever appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be missed dearly by me and by his teammates. But  
he's going out on his own terms. He's doing what he believes it 
right. And I'm happy that he's able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey echoed that sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no regrets,'' he said. ``I would rather walk away  
knowing that I couldn't give to the team than to be on the team 
just faking it. My whole thing has always been to contribute 
something to the team, and I wouldn't want to be a player who just 
hung on to make it to the playoffs.''

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Extend Sinclair Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Sinclair  
signed a five-year contract extension Thursday with the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holmgren, the Seahawks' first-year general manager and  
coach, announced the extension at an afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, Sinclair, 31, was given a seven-year contract by  
Seattle. He had two seasons left on his old contract, which he 
signed in 1996 and had restructured in 1997, and is now signed 
through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the new deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's already done a lot of wonderful things in this  
business,'' Holmgren said. ``I even think his best years are still 
ahead of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair, 31, led the NFL with a team-record 16 1/2 sacks last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren made good on a promise made to Sinclair by the previous  
Seahawks administration. Dennis Erickson was fired after the team 
went 8-8 last season and Holmgren was hired away from Green Bay in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to thank Michael for trusting me to get this thing  
done,'' Holmgren said. ``We had kind of an agreement, call it a 
handshake, that we were going to work very, very hard to make this 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 270-pound Sinclair, a sixth-round draft choice  
from Eastern New Mexico, is a four-year starter who plays on 
Seattle's defensive line with tackles Cortez Kennedy and Sam Adams 
and end Phillip Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks third on the Seahawks' career-sacks list with 60 1/2  
behind Jacob Green's 116 and Jeff Bryant's 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair hopes to become a better player with his contract  
worries now behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come to training camp and have it on the back of your  
mind, sometimes it's a load,'' he said. ``I'm glad that we got it 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair phoned Holmgren from Hawaii, where he was preparing for  
last season's Pro Bowl, when he heard reports that the Seahawks 
were going to trade him to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `No, that's not going to happen,''' Sinclair said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair said his contract extension will allow him to finish  
his career in Seattle. He had a chance to leave the Seahawks as a 
restricted free agent, but chose to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that Michael Sinclair is all about is in Seattle,''  
he said. ``There's no other team that I want to play for. This is 
where I started. Seattle is home for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair said his contract was important for him -- and for the  
Seahawks, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what's missing in professional sports is loyalty,'' he  
said. ``So I think this definitely sends a message to the players 
to what kind of organization that the Seahawks have become, 
definitely to the young players. If you go out and play, you will 
be taken care of. That's a huge message.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scott Pippen wants the Houston Rockets to trade  
him to the Los Angeles Lakers so he can be reunited with his former 
coach Phil Jackson, and the forward's agent says the team is 
looking into the request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the Lakers has been talked about,'' Sexton told  
the Houston Chronicle. ``There have been discussions with the two 
clubs. They told us that the Rockets have some distance between the 
offer and what the Rockets would be willing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an unidentified source, the newspaper reported that  
Pippen told Rockets official Robert Barr to attempt to trade him to 
the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr resigned Wednesday and would not comment about discussions  
with players. The source, however, said that Barr's departure as 
vice president of basktball affairs would intensify Pippen's 
interest in leaving the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston television station KRIV also reported that Pippen wants  
to be a Laker. The station cited sources close to Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets reportedly have turned down the Lakers' offer of  
forwards Glen Rice and Robert Horry for Pippen. There would have to 
be additional adjustments made to the offer to offset the 
$14,795,000 that Pippen counts against the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who was not available for comment, won six championships  
playing for Jackson with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	This past season was the forward's first in Houston. He has four  
seasons remaining on his contract with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Phil Jackson have an extremely close relationship from  
11 years working together day in and day out,'' Sexton said. 
``Scottie is an attractive piece of the puzzle for a lot of teams, 
but it probably would not be an issue if Phil Jackson was not 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything against the Rockets or any coaches with the  
Rockets' staff. It's just about the very close and unusual 
relationship with Phil Jackson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said he and Pippen have discussed  
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie and I talked about a lot of things and I listened to  
him and asked for his ideas,'' he said. ``I don't want to get into 
what exactly we said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexton said Tomjanovich had assured Pippen the Rockets would  
move to a more up-tempo style that better suits the perennial 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, acquired in a sign-and-trade agreement with the Bulls in  
January, averaged 14.5 points per game this past season, his lowest 
since his rookie year, and he made a career-low 43.2 percent of his 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	He also averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists and was named to  
the NBA All-Defensive first team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be lying if I told you Scottie was not extremely  
frustrated playing in that system last season,'' Sexton said. ``I 
don't think he could make it another year like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they did say they would play a more up-tempo game with  
more movement and motion, running up and down the floor. Now, you 
have one of the best players in the game throwing in entry 
passes.''

<HEADLINE> Violence, Protests Wrack Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Religious violence and protests shook  
Indonesia on Thursday, with Christians and Muslims fighting in one 
province while demonstrators demanded independence for another. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence in the eastern province of Maluku left six people dead  
Thursday, including an 11-year-old boy, when riot police dispersed 
rampaging gangs on the outskirts of the provincial capital, Ambon, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's death toll from clashes between Christian and Muslim  
mobs in Maluku rose to at least 45 after more than a dozen bodies 
were found in burned out buildings, military spokesman Capt. 
Sutarno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutarno, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, also said  
257 civilians and 16 security officers were injured in the unrest 
in Maluku, known as the Spice Islands during Dutch colonial rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 400 people have died this year in a series of clashes and  
riots between Christians and Muslims in the province, 1,450 miles 
northeast of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, Islamic students scuffled with police Thursday after  
demanding the resignation of Indonesia's defense minister, blaming 
him for crimes against humanity in the campaign against separatists 
in the northern province of Aceh. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 students chanted ``Allah Akbar,'' or ``God is great,''  
and accused Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto of being responsible for 
the deaths of hundreds of rebels and civilians in Aceh, located 
1,100 miles northwest of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes with rebels demanding an independent Muslim state have  
claimed the lives of more than 250 people in Aceh, including 44 
Indonesian troops. More than 140,000 villagers have fled their 
homes since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has dispatched 11,000 troops to the province and human  
rights activists claim the military has massacred hundreds of 
villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wiranto must take responsibility for the massacres in Aceh  
since he commands the troops,'' said protest organizer Mastur 
Yahya. 
</P>
<P>
	At a seminar in Jakarta, Wiranto insisted that Indonesia would  
not consider granting independence to the oil-rich province. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Jakarta, Portugal's foreign minister condemned the  
killings of two pro-independence activists in East Timor, a 
half-island province where the United Nations is supervising a vote 
on independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply deplore the continuation of violence in East  
Timor,'' said Fernando Neves, Portugal's envoy at a two-day meeting 
with U.N. and Indonesian representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded the Portuguese colony in 1975, and the United  
Nations has refused to recognize the occupation and still considers 
Portugal to be the sovereign power. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise policy reversal in January, Indonesia offered to  
withdraw from East Timor if voters there reject its autonomy 
proposal. Many foreign analysts believe that is exactly what will 
happen.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Return High-Scoring Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings return the  
highest-scoring offense in NFL history, with the exception of 
injured third receiver Jake Reed, and the New York Giants are 
hurting at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	That combination could prove explosive Friday night at the  
Metrodome when both teams begin their exhibition schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	After Vikings starting quarterback Randall Cunningham puts in  
his work, he'll give way to backup Jeff George, intent on 
resurrecting his career, then rookie Daunte Culpepper, the 
franchise's future, and finally Todd Bouman, who had a good season 
in NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defensively, they will be a challenge,'' said Giants coach Jim  
Fassel, who will miss the game because he will be visiting his 
ailing mother in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a little nicked up at the corner and a little nicked up  
here and there. This is a team that set a scoring record last year. 
I want to see us play solid defensively and hold them down if we 
can and not give up big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants don't have their top cornerbacks to counter the  
Vikings, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Sehorn, who sat out last year with a knee injury and  
watched the Giants go from NFC East champs to 8-8, is out with a 
torn hamstring and Conrad Hamilton hurt an ankle in a scrimmage 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to come out as a defense on fire,'' said Jeremy  
Lincoln, who will start at corner with Phillippi Sparks. ``We're in 
front of a national audience (ESPN) and Dennis Green will try to 
put the ball up a little bit. We know this team likes to light up 
the scoreboard. Even when they weren't great, when I played against 
them in Chicago, they didn't run that much. They'd just air it, 
lights out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green said the starters won't play more than a couple series and  
that all his quarterbacks will get equal playing time. He's eager 
to see his backups, especially Culpepper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody that has watched practice likes him a lot. I  
said a long time ago I thought he was the best player in the draft. 
He'll have a chance to show exactly how good he is in the next four 
preseason games before he takes his role of waiting to play,'' 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very smart player. He's probably on the field working  
right now because he's always the last guy to leave the field. He's 
very athletic. He throws a good deep ball that's easy to catch. He 
can run the ball a la Randall Cunningham and he brings a lot of 
enthusiasm and talent to the ball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper, the record-setting quarterback from Central Florida,  
said he didn't know what to expect Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I don't know. I've never played in an NFL game yet. I'm  
pretty sure it's going to be loud, it's going to be crazy and it's 
going to be pretty intense,'' he said. ``That's what I'm looking 
for. That's why I play the game. I thrive on those kinds of 
situations. I want to be in that type of environment.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Won't Help Cotton Prices / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The lingering heat wave killing cotton crops  
in the South won't be enough to help raise cotton prices for 
growers in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Lavis, executive vice president of the Arizona Cotton  
Growers Association, said even with the Southern woes, prices will 
remain low because of a global cotton glut. 
</P>
<P>
	China, in particular, is producing an abundance of the fiber,  
keeping prices down, and 90 percent of Arizona's crop goes to Asian 
buyers. Cotton is selling for 51 cents a pound or 52 cents a pound, 
significantly off its peak of 85 cents a pound earlier this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still too early to tell how strong the Arizona crop will  
be, growers said, because it won't be harvested until at least next 
month. The harvest usually continues from September to January. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers in the East have been hammered by the heat wave because  
it has been accompanied by a lack of rain, but Arizona farmers are 
far less dependent on rain because of irrigation systems across the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Arizona growers are worried that too much rain has fallen  
lately, making temperatures too cool and conditions too humid. 
Prolonged wetness can make cotton rot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather has been kind of crazy. We really need the warmth  
during the day and the coolness in the evening to produce good 
cotton,'' said Kevin Rogers of the Rogers Brothers Partnership, a 
family farming operation with 1,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ST. PETER, Minn. (AP) -- Fish and trees are becoming viable  
alternatives for some Minnesota farmers who are tired of trying to 
make corn and soybeans profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 members of the Minnesota House Agriculture Policy  
Committee heard testimony this week on how African Tilapia fish and 
poplar trees were helping some farmers out of an agriculture slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to further diversify,'' said Richard Hagen  
of Olivia, who spoke on behalf of the MinAqua Fisheries Cooperative 
in Renville County. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilapia fish operations use the heated wastewater of a sugar  
beet processing plant to warm the pools where the tropical perch 
are produced, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, about 1.5 million pounds of the fish raised in  
Minnesota are sold live and unprocessed. 
</P>
<P>
	And with about 24 million pounds of fish imported into the  
United States annually, Hagen said Minnesota can make its mark in 
Tilapia production and reduce the need for the United States to 
import the fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, John Krantz, a forestry official with the Department  
of Natural Resources, said Minnesota farmers can help meet paper 
and wood production needs by growing hybrid poplar trees. 
</P>
<P>
	With aspen becoming an increasingly popular source of wood  
sheets used in housing construction, Krantz said the state's 5.3 
million acres of the tree will be exhausted in 45 to 50 years. 
Poplar trees, with shorter harvest times, could fill the void, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But program development coordinator Debbie Letosky, of the  
Minnesota Agro-Forestry Cooperative, acknowledged that some people 
may be hesitant to get into poplar farming because it takes about 
10 to 12 years to see potential profits. She said the Legislature 
could make tree farming more attractive by providing financial 
incentives.

<HEADLINE> Activists Condemn Clinton Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Independence activists condemned a  
conditional U.S. offer of clemency for 11 islanders convicted of 
sedition, saying it only underscored Puerto Rico's colonial status. 
</P>
<P>
	``These conditions are inviting a confrontation,'' said Luis  
Nieves Falcon, leader of a campaign to free 16 Puerto Ricans linked 
by U.S. prosecutors to a wave of U.S. bombings in the 1970s and 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are shameful demands,'' said Lolita Lebron, who in 1979  
was pardoned by President Carter for a 1954 shooting attack on the 
House of Representatives. ``The president has insulted the dignity 
of the Puerto Rican nation and those who fight for its liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Wednesday that the members of the  
Armed Forces of National Liberation would be freed if they agreed 
to renounce violence, don't meet other independence leaders and 
obey a ban on using weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven prisoners would be released immediately if they agree;  
two would have to serve more prison time; and three would have the 
unpaid balance of their criminal fines canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also required that the prisoners sign  
statements requesting commutations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president reviewed the matter and obviously concluded that  
the sentences imposed for the crime committed were out of 
proportion to sentences for similar offenses for others,'' Attorney 
General Janet Reno said today in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions were applauded by Puerto Rico's pro-U.S.  
statehood governor and congressional representative, who long have 
insisted the prisoners renounce violence before obtaining freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe (Clinton) did this in the most prudent and just  
manner possible,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that every one of these people understand that  
they committed a crime,'' declared Resident Commissioner Carlos 
Romero-Barcelo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieves Falcon has led a petition drive for the ``political  
prisoners,'' as the activists are commonly known here, and he and 
fellow supporters had gathered at San Juan's cathedral Wednesday to 
celebrate their anticipated release. The mood soured when they 
learned of Clinton's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an injustice,'' said a tearful Clarissa Lopez,  
daughter of Oscar Lopez, one of those ineligible for immediate 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	While the independence party won less than 3 percent of the vote  
in a December plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status, the 
campaign to free the prisoners has received broad popular support. 
</P>
<P>
	But the short-lived 1998 release of Antonio Camacho Negron, a  
member of a Puerto Rico-based guerrilla group, the Macheteros, 
showed why some prisoners may reject the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho Negron was paroled after serving 10 years for the 1983  
robbery of a Wells Fargo armored truck in West Hartford, 
Connecticut, to fund guerrilla attacks. He was returned to prison 
after missing interviews with his parole officer and meeting with 
other independence activists in violation of his parole rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's 3.8 million islanders are U.S. citizens. They can  
serve in the military and receive billions from Washington but pay 
no federal taxes, cannot vote for president and have only a 
nonvoting delegate in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Diet Drug Maker Said Misled Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- With a Barbie doll as a prop, a  
lawyer accused one of the makers of the fen-phen diet drug 
combination of pushing an unattainable ideal of thinness on 
millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is, most women don't look like that,'' Esther  
Berezofsky said Wednesday at the beginning of the first 
class-action lawsuit over the use of fen-phen to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing is that many people desperately try and in many  
ways that is what (American Home Products) preyed upon,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyers said American Home marketed its half of the  
weight-loss cocktail to doctors so that millions of Americans would 
take it to lose a few pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Peter Bleakley said the company only  
recommended the Pondimin and Redux pills for the obese. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were not designed or promoted ... to make people like  
this,'' Bleakley told jurors, picking up the Barbie doll. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison-based American Home -- which made fenfluramine and a  
chemical lookalike marketed under the brand names Redux and 
Pondimin -- faces more than 4,000 lawsuits nationwide by people who 
say they suffer heart and lung problems because of the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	This lawsuit is different because it seeks medical checkups  
rather than financial damages for illnesses already suffered. 
American Home could be forced to pay more than $1 billion over the 
next decade to 94,000 healthy people who took the pills for at 
least three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here for money. We're here for monitoring,''  
Berezofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine, which was  
sold under the brand name Pondimin, or the lookalike, 
dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux, to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products removed the drug from the market shortly  
after learning of the risk of heart-valve disease in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market. Both 
drugs make the brain trick the stomach into feeling full. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing three New Jersey women who lead the lawsuit  
said the company knew years before the drug was taken off the 
market that it was linked to heart valve disease and pulmonary 
hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Saul Weiss produced e-mails between employees at  
American Home's Wyeth-Ayerst subsidiary in Pennsylvania that 
discussed changing a label that stated that four people using the 
drug had developed pulmonary hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995, the company knew of 180 such cases, Weiss said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, Bleakley cited a study that said long-term users of  
Pondimin and Redux had a 1-in-20,000 chance of developing pulmonary 
hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the patients had as much chance of being struck and  
killed by lightning, and said the people suing in this lawsuit were 
even less at risk, because most only took the drug for a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the Food and Drug Administration knew for years of  
several cases of pulmonary hypertension in people taking the diet 
pills, but let the drug remain on the market.

<HEADLINE> NASA Delays Endeavour Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA has delayed the launch of  
shuttle Endeavour so technicians can check its wiring to avoid 
problems similar those plaguing Columbia, NASA officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Endeavour was supposed to blast off Sept. 16 but now will not be  
launched earlier than October so technicians can remove radar 
equipment and check the shuttle's wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said they were not sure whether Endeavour would  
fly before Discovery, scheduled for a Hubble telescope repair 
mission in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a damaged wire in Columbia's cargo bay caused a  
short circuit just five seconds into the launch. The short knocked 
out the primary computers for two of the three main engines.

	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Substitute Dario Brose's goal in the 77th  
minute lifted the San Jose Clash over the New England Revolution 
2-1 Thursday night in Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was only the third in regulation time for San Jose  
(12-10). New England (8-13) dropped its fifth straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Brose, who came into the game eight minutes earlier, got through  
the New England defense and beat goalie Jeff Causey from 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	New England opened the scoring in the sixth minute when Ted  
Chronopoulos headed in a crossing pass from Ivan McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose tied it in the 54th minute, thanks to an own goal by  
Causey, playing for injured Walter Zenga. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal came when Jeff Baicher's corner kick was headed toward  
the right post by John Doyle. Causey made an awkward save and 
accidentally kicked the ball into his net.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Shammond Williams signed a three-year contract  
Thursday with the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled to be able to sign Shammond,'' Sonics head  
coach Paul Westphal said. Williams played with the Sonics summer 
league team in Boston, averaging 12.2 points and 6.5 assists in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the stars of our summer league team. The  
difference was noticeable when he was in the game and when he 
wasn't,'' Westphal said. ``We think he has a very good career ahead 
of him and we expect to see him on the floor a lot this season.'' 
</P>

	The 6-foot-1 guard was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the

<HEADLINE> Life on Earth Traced Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying Australian rocks have  
found evidence that primitive forms of life existed 2.7 billion 
years ago -- a billion years earlier than had been previously shown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The molecular fossils we report are the oldest preserved  
biological molecules in the world,'' said researcher Jochen J. 
Brocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This age should provide a new calibration point for molecular  
clocks and the universal tree of life,'' Brocks and his fellow 
Australian researchers report Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding pushes back evidence of life to the Archean era, the  
period from the beginning of Earth to about 2.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unknown that complex molecules can survive such a long  
period of time on Earth,'' Brocks, of the University of Sydney and 
the Australian Geological Survey, said in response to questions via 
e-mail. ``We opened up a window into a time when almost nothing was 
known about life on Earth and provide a tool that will multiply our 
knowledge about this shadow land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew H. Knoll of the Botanical Museum at Harvard University  
called the report ``a pretty exciting paper. It really opens 
doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really admire about these guys is they heard the  
conventional wisdom that said this couldn't be done, and they 
searched for and found'' the evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most rocks as old as the ones studied have undergone a process  
called metamorphism, an intense geological heating that changes 
them and which scientists believed would destroy any organic 
compounds they contained. But the shales studied by this team were 
well-preserved and still contained the biological chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found evidence of organic compounds called  
lipids in the sedimentary rocks located more than 2,100 feet deep 
in northwestern Australia's Roy Hill Shale and Marra Mamba 
Formations. The rocks formed a seabed 2.6 billion to 2.7 billion 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipids are produced by living organisms and finding them  
indicates the presence of eukaryotes -- life forms with cells that 
have a distinct nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their complexity, eukaryotes were thought to have  
developed relatively late in Earth's history. This discovery pushes 
the date for their appearance back to the earliest part of 
geological time. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers noted that a similar report several years ago  
had been discounted by scientists who assumed the rocks had been 
contaminated with more recent chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure that wasn't the case this time, they put their rock  
samples through several rinses in solvents to remove any possible 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocks were then ground and chemicals, including sterane, a  
hydrocarbon of biological origin, were extracted. Steranes derive 
from sterols, a component of certain living tissues, the best known 
of which is cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biomarkers we report are the oldest known that'' can be  
shown to have originated in the areas where they were found and 
were formed at the same time as the rocks in that area, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are more than a billion years older than those from the  
... Barney Creek Formation, previously the oldest 
well-characterized molecular fossils,'' they reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brocks said the finding will help scientists who are trying to  
calculate back to the common ancestor of all living things. 
</P>
<P>
	In this effort scientists came up with widely different values,  
he noted, with some calculating the origin of eukaryotes to 1.7 
billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we found that eukaryotes already lived 2.7 billion years  
ago, hence proving many molecular clocks wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some evidence for the existence of what may have  
``possibly'' been bacteria even earlier, Brocks added.

<P>
	Philadelphia Phillies fans booed J.D. Drew for four innings. In  
the fifth, Drew sent them a small white response. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew's 434-foot solo home run capped a tumultuous stay at  
Veterans Stadium, blocking out the boos and leading the St. Louis 
Cardinals to a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's timing is perfect,'' said Drew, who received massive  
police and security presence after having batteries thrown at him 
in the outfield Tuesday night. ``The biggest key to me is to enjoy 
the game and play as hard as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drew was drafted by the Phillies in 1997, but didn't sign with  
them after asking for an $11.5 million, five-year contract. He 
returned to the draft the following year, was taken by St. Louis 
and signed for $7 million for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has established himself as one of baseball's best  
young hitters, although he hasn't made many friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was booed every place he played since last September,''  
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``He went about his business. 
This guy's been terrific. He's got a chance to be outstanding. He 
just needs experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, it was Arizona 7, Chicago 5 in 11 innings;  
Florida 6, San Francisco 5 in 10 innings; Colorado 8, Milwaukee 5; 
Pittsburgh 5, Cincinnati 4; Atlanta 8, Houston 5; Los Angeles 9, 
Montreal 7; and New York 12, San Diego 5. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philadelphia, Garrett Stephenson (3-0) allowed one run and  
five hits in 7 1-3 innings, retiring 14 straight at one stretch. 
Randy Wolf (5-4) took the loss, allowing three runs and six hits in 
five innings, walking five and striking out seven. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Arizona 7, Chicago 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams hit a two-run double in the 11th inning and had  
four RBIs as Arizona beat Chicago at Wrigley Field and opened a 
7 1/2-game lead in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, who have won five straight, are 66-49 and  
topped their win total from 1998. Chicago has lost five straight 
and 11 of 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson, who struck out 11 in eight innings and left with  
a 5-3 lead, lost a chance for the win when the Cubs tied the game 
in the ninth on Henry Rodriguez's RBI double and Glenallen Hill's 
run-scoring infield single. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Marlins 6, Giants 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Mike Lowell singled home the winning run off Robb Nen (3-6) in  
the 10th as host Florida overcame a four-run deficit for the third 
consecutive game against San Francisco, which has lost nine of 12. 
The Marlins have won six straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida trailed 5-1 before Lowell, who had a grand slam in  
Monday's comeback, hit a three-run pinch-hit homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Sanchez (4-4) pitched two scoreless innings.  
</P>
<P>
                        *Rockies 8, Brewers 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Edgard Clemente hit a two-run homer off Steve Woodard (11-7) and  
had three RBIs to help Colorado stop a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Angel Echevarria and Vinny Castilla drove in two runs each as  
the Rockies outhit the Brewers 14-10 and completed a 4-8 road trip. 
Milwaukee finished a 3-9 homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Jones (6-9) gave up two runs and four hits in five  
innings. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Pirates 5, Reds 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Brian Giles' two-run double in the ninth off Cincinnati relief  
ace Scott Williamson rallied Pittsburgh past the Reds, who lost for 
only the 11th time in 44 road games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Williams (2-2) got the victory despite allowing Dmitri  
Young's RBI double in the top of the ninth. Williamson (10-5) blew 
his sixth save in 22 chances and took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Braves 8, Astros 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Bret Boone and Chipper Jones hit consecutive homers for the  
second straight night, and Jose Hernandez also homered as Atlanta 
completed a three-game sweep of visiting Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (14-6), who has won four consecutive decisions and  
seven of his last eight, allowed five runs and 11 hits in 5 1-3 
innings. Jose Lima (15-7) dropped to 0-4 against Atlanta, giving up 
six runs and nine hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Dodgers 9, Expos 7    	
</P>
<P>
	Eric Karros hit his first career grand slam and tied a career  
high with six RBIs as Los Angeles rallied from a six-run deficit to 
win at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros had hit the most homers among active major leaguers  
without hitting a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Mets 12, Padres 5    	
</P>
<P>
	Edgardo Alfonzo homered and tied a career high with five RBIs at  
Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Piazza went 3-for-4 with three RBIs to break out of an  
0-for-9 slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn left in the fifth inning with a sore left knee he  
aggravated sliding into third base. Gwynn, who singled in the first 
for his 3,007th career hit to tie Al Kaline for 20th on the career 
list, is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has lost five in a row.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds rose by $2.66 billion in the latest week to $887.90 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $3.03 billion to $736.62 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $368.4 million to $151.28 billion.

	Total money market assets stood at $1.489 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.480 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.48 percent from 4.50 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks soared Thursday as insurance and  
technology shares made strong gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance index gained 2.7 percent on a round of solid  
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch-based Aegon rose 2.40 euros to 79.30 euros, helping  
Amsterdam's AEX index to close up 2.1 percent to 553.31. First-half 
results were better than expected, and the company also said it 
will buy the British life insurance operations of Guardian Royal 
Exchange from Sun Life and Provincial Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies are heavily invested in bonds, so if  
European government bonds have peaked, after rising an average one 
percentage point this year, insurance companies will benefit, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the sector, Sun Life shares rose 22.5 pence to  
452.75 pence in London, after the company reported a 32 percent 
gain in their first-half operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares were also among the best performers, following  
gains in New York on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among European bourses, London's FTSE 100 index of blue-chip  
shares rallied 2.3 percent to 6,153.30, with mining group Billiton 
soaring 13 percent on speculation that Anglo American may be 
preparing a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies rallied 5.78  
points, or 2.0 percent, to close at 299.69, the highest since Aug. 
3, when it closed at 300.70. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 297 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 6.71 points at 
312.54. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 89.05 points to 
3640.44, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 80.17 points at 
3589.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.1 percent to 5,127.43, as  
chemical group Bayer rose 2.10 euros to 43.10 euros, after 
announcing a more optimistic full-year outlook than before. 
France's CAC-40 index of most actively traded stocks closed up 
96.71 points, or 2.3 percent, at 4,365.66. The Swiss Market Index 
closed up 1.8 percent at 6,806.10.

<HEADLINE>  Japan OKs New Wiretapping Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Parliament today gave Japanese police new powers to  
use wiretaps against organized crime, overcoming a grab bag of 
opposition stalling tactics, one of which had lawmakers walking 
very slowly to cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	The 142-99 vote in the upper house followed the powerful lower  
house's approval of the anti-crime package on June 1 and gives 
Japanese police surveillance powers similar to those enjoyed by 
investigators in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will apply these laws appropriately and effectively and  
with determined intention we will deal squarely with organized 
crime,'' Justice Minister Takao Jinnouchi said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The wiretapping provision is to take effect within a year.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after a marathon 21-hour parliamentary session  
in which opposition lawmakers used a barrage of procedural attacks 
to block a vote backed by the governing coalition led by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The wiretapping law is similar to those in other countries. But  
many Japanese, remembering secret police brutality during World War 
II and crackdowns on radical students and labor unions in the 1950s 
and 1960s, have long been reluctant to hand police greater powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot but feel the sense of danger that people's freedom  
and privacy are being violated,'' the national Asahi newspaper said 
in an editorial today. 
</P>
<P>
	The public, however, has been demanding more aggressive police  
action against potentially subversive groups since a doomsday 
religious cult attacked Tokyo subways with nerve gas in March 1995, 
killing 12 and injuring thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	After a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi  
failed Wednesday, opposition members paralyzed parliament through 
the night with a filibuster and other go-slow tactics. The measure 
finally passed this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-leaning parties have long opposed police wiretaps, fearing  
they could be used to attack leftists and other critics of the 
government, and they had vowed to do what they could to delay the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	After an all-night, on-and-off session, three opposition parties  
submitted censure motions against the ministers of finance, trade, 
health and education, and the chief cabinet secretary. The motions 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition lawmakers also delayed a motion to vote on the  
package by staging a ``cow walk,'' in which members walk 
excruciatingly slowly -- or almost not at all -- to place their 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have long sought the power to wiretap, saying it would  
strengthen their hand against the yakuza, Japan's organized crime 
syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other bills in the package would stiffen penalties for  
organized crime and increase protections for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The wiretap bill, which has already been changed to appease  
critics, requires police to seek court permission for each wiretap, 
which could be used only in cases of murder or smuggling of drugs, 
weapons or people. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate over the measure has inflamed passions on both sides.  
When an upper house committee approved the measure earlier this 
week, opposition lawmakers rushed the chairman's podium, knocking 
over desks and microphones. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Obuchi's coalition easily squashed the  
no-confidence motion in the lower house. Another 
opposition-sponsored censure motion against Obuchi was also 
rejected by a vote of 140-77 in the upper house early today, said 
Ichiro Kouchi, a spokesman for the chamber.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- David Duval and Tiger Woods played their  
rounds and then stood their ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The uproar over the Ryder Cup crested Thursday with Duval and  
Woods not backing off of their bid for control of some of the 
millions of dollars generated by the event. 
</P>
<P>
	After both shooting 2-under 70s to get in contention in the PGA  
Championship, they dismissed the importance of the Ryder Cup 
despite captain Ben Crenshaw's attempt to get them to rally around 
the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like a pretty large corporate outing,'' Duval said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exhibition. It always has been,'' Woods added. ``It's  
not meant to be played as a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed that way, however, to others, such as journeyman Bruce  
Zabriski, who sneaked into the press room to watch Crenshaw talk 
about flag and country a day earlier and used the inspiration to go 
out and shoot a 70 of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have walked through brick walls after that speech,''  
Zabriski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval watched the same speech on television and came away  
wondering just what Crenshaw was trying to say. Woods didn't even 
bother to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Both tried to concentrate on their golf, despite the firestorm  
that overshadowed the start of the season's final major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went out and played,'' Duval said. ``You know, when you  
get inside the ropes, I think it's easy to forget about stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Crenshaw had lashed out at top players for worrying  
more about where the money from the Ryder Cup goes than in winning 
the cup back from Europe, the captain said he may have spoken a bit 
too much from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from a different generation where the Ryder Cup means a  
lot to us,'' Crenshaw said. ``I'm upset people aren't jumping over 
the moon about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most players would jump over the moon to make the team that  
tries to regain the cup next month. But four top players already on 
the team have talked more about how the money is divided than how 
they can win the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That may say something about team unity with a little more than  
a month before the United States plays Europe at The Country Club 
at Brookline outside of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want 12 committed players going to Boston,'' Crenshaw said  
after shooting a 77 in the opening round of the PGA. ``I want our 
players to be unified. To be honest, I haven't seen that in the 
last four teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw, who played on four Ryder Cup teams, sees the  
competition that began in 1927 as a historic opportunity to wave 
the flag and make the country proud. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, Duval, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson see it as  
something else -- a corporate-run event that reportedly will gross 
$63 million using players who have nothing to say about where the 
money goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not greed,'' Woods insisted. ``It's the fact we want to  
help out. We want to donate money to our charities in our local 
areas. There's so much money being generated at the Ryder Cup, it's 
become a corporate event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players met with PGA officials Tuesday in an hour-long  
meeting at which they all proclaimed themselves ``on the same 
page.'' But that supposed unity was shattered the next day when 
Crenshaw gave his press room speech in which he said it ``burns the 
hell out of me to listen to some of their viewpoints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said after watching the outburst on TV, he called  
Crenshaw, not thinking Crenshaw was referring to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was,'' Duval said.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval spent much of his time after the opening round of the PGA  
defending his position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	He never, Duval said, asked for money to play on the team. It  
is, he said, an honor to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Duval didn't back down over a desire to give money from  
the event to charities of his choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody even thought this was a major event 10 years ago,''  
Duval said. ``I can only tell you what I think and feel. I have a 
hard time not answering questions when I'm asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was not alone in feeling that his remarks about Ryder Cup  
money were misinterpreted and misreported. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media keeps saying it's pay-for-play, and I don't see it  
that way,'' O'Meara said. ``I take offense to the fact that 
somebody might call me unpatriotic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara said Crenshaw left him a message apologizing for his  
comments, and Crenshaw backed down just a bit Wednesday. But he 
still was passionate about the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're from different generations and I'm trying to  
understand that,'' Crenshaw said. ``Obviously, there was quite a 
bit of frustration. I can't expect everybody to be as passionate as 
I am, especially about the history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the outside looking in were players such as Zabriski and Jay  
Haas, who voiced support for Crenshaw despite having no chance for 
making the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Watts, who doesn't get Ryder Cup points because he was  
born in Canada even though he is a U.S. citizen, had a similar 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just say this. I'd die for my country, so I'd really like  
to play on the Ryder Cup,'' Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman does have a good chance of making the team, but had  
heard enough about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sick of it I could just barf,'' Lehman said.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tornadoes aren't supposed to touch down in  
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was Bill Alder, the chief meteorologist for the  
National Weather Service in Utah, watching his radar screen with 
growing concern just after lunch Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like severe weather, and severe weather can generate  
funnel clouds which can turn into a tornado,'' he said. ``But that 
doesn't happen here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before 1 p.m., a twister ripped through the heart of the  
city that will be the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics, destroying 
34 homes and damaging 87 others. It overturned trucks, blew the 
windows out of downtown hotels and sent the city into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and scores were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the first tornado fatality ever recorded in Utah, where  
tornado sightings typically happen only about once or twice a year. 
Some of the first to spot the twister didn't believe what they were 
seeing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, `Is that a fire?''' said Cole Lundquist, who was  
standing by a window on the 24th floor of the headquarters of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the city's tallest 
building. ``Then we saw all the debris, then flames and sparks 
shooting above it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Deedee Corradini said this morning that 79 people were  
injured severely enough to go to a hospital. Many others suffered 
lesser injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tragedy for us, but we've been very, very lucky --  
it could have been much worse,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corradini said crews had worked through the night clearing  
debris and, ``We are open for business in downtown Salt Lake City 
this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt, speaking on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
said, ``There was virtually no way in which to warn people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a hurtful experience for many and we're grateful  
that the sun's going to come up this morning and we can now finish 
the cleanup and move forward,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The black funnel swept in from southeast of the city center and  
seemed to target the Delta Center, home of the National Basketball 
Association's Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could just see it peeling the roof off,'' Lundquist said.  
``The debris there was at eye level with us on the 24th floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also shattered the arena's plate glass windows. But it did  
its worst damage just opposite the Delta Center, where exhibitors 
for the massive Outdoor Retailers Summer Market were setting up 
under a block-long tent, now mostly in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Crandy, 38, of Las Vegas was killed when he was struck in  
the head by debris. The contractor for the retailers' show was 
skipping lunch to make sure the booths looked their best. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people remained hospitalized today, two in critical  
condition and four in serious condition. One man with severe leg 
injuries was downgraded from serious to critical following lengthy 
surgery overnight, LDS Hospital spokesman Jess Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was postponed one day, until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	As people ran screaming from tents, waitresses at a nearby diner  
watched while the lunchtime crowd huddled under tables. Visitors at 
Temple Square, the usually placid heart of the Mormon Church, 
dashed for shelter as the tornado churned by. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street, nearly 1,000 workers crawled through the  
shell of the church's under-construction assembly hall. Bill Morton 
was pouring concrete on the roof of the five-story assembly hall 
when the storm hit. At first, his workers thought the Delta Center 
was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	For two more miles and about five more minutes, the twister --  
classified as an F2, which has winds between 113 mph and 157 mph -- 
stomped through the city, ripping away street signs, tearing down 
electric lines and stacking delivery trucks atop each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-story Wyndham Hotel had dozens of windows blown out on  
either side, with long shards of glass strewn on the grass below. 
Four-inch-wide poles were bent over into U-shapes, their signs 
nearly touching the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm headed north across the lawn of the state Capitol,  
uprooting trees and punching out one window. Then it turned into 
the foothills and one of the poshest neighborhoods in town, the 
Avenues, where Patty Reagan was sitting, watching the weather on 
the noon news. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weatherman said there was hail and wind gusts,'' she said.  
She looked out her front window only to see her 100-foot pine tree 
ripped out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt surveyed the damage by helicopter and declared a state  
of emergency. Except for the Delta Center, which will be the venue 
for skating events in two years, little property related to the 
Olympics was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tornado touched down, crowds gathered downtown to gawk  
at the destruction. Tourists filmed the scene with their video 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing. I never thought I'd see a tornado, least of  
all in Utah,'' said David Gross, a vendor from Sudbury, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the church construction site, Morton said: ``I'll tell  
you one thing, God was watching out for us. I'll tell you another. 
I never want to see another one.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Center To Be Closed 6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Delta Center, declared structurally  
sound Thursday despite shattered windows and holes in the roof, is 
going on the injured list for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8-year-old arena, home to the NBA's Utah Jazz and WNBA's  
Utah Starzz, took a direct hit when a tornado churned through 
downtown Salt Lake on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Miller, owner of the Jazz and the Delta Center, estimated  
damage at just under $5 million. He said insurance would cover 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19,911-seat facility had holes in its roof, broken windows  
and drenched floors. There was water damage to carpets and 
ceilings, mostly in the arena's upper-level suites and club rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	As cleanup progressed, Miller said the place looked presentable.  
</P>
<P>
	``To see this building now, as opposed to 24 hours ago, is day  
and night,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest hit corner was on the club level, six floors up,  
where crumbled ceiling tiles littered the carpet and jagged shards 
of glass poked in from metal window frames. 
</P>
<P>
	In a triangular room, 75 feet wide on its long side, light  
fixtures dangled at chest level from what used to be a ceiling. 
Sunlight came through 20-foot holes in the roof, shining on twisted 
heating ducts. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 green seats on the mezzanine were nicked by falling  
debris and the Starzz court was declared playable despite a 
half-inch dent and visible water damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of water on the floor, a lot from rain but the  
bulk from the fire extinguishing system,'' Miller said. ``One of 
those pipes broke, and it puts a lot of water out in a hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny bits of shattered glass were everywhere on the concourse,  
remnants of roughly 400 exterior glass panels, each costing $1,000, 
that were blown out by the twister. The building has about 800 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in the 25-foot high loading dock, massive aluminum  
roller doors lay in cluttered piles. Changing air pressure from the 
tornado blew them off their hinges and 100 feet down a corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we would have had a concert crew unloading a truck, there  
would have been a lot of fatalities,'' Delta Center general manager 
Scott Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the damage, no serious injuries were reported, and that  
left Miller thankful and gloating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Delta Center was designed to withstand much more than the  
tornado threw at it yesterday,'' he said. ``We're pleased with how 
well the building actually came through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said complete repairs will take at least six weeks, but  
Miller hopes ``to have it functional'' in time for an Aug. 20 
concert by country singer Neil McCoy, a benefit for charities 
designated by Jazz forward Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have it fully restored is going to take longer,'' Miller  
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City is also host city for the 2002 Winter Olympics.  
The Delta Center will be the venue for the figure skating and 
short-track speed skating. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister upstaged an announcement that the Mormon Church  
plans to lend an undeveloped downtown block for the medals 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, just northeast of the Delta Center, is where one man  
died when the tornado shredded a cluster of soft plastic and 
aluminum tents that housed exhibits for an outdoor retailers 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado struck at 12:55 p.m. MDT, about the time the church  
announcement was released. Salt Lake Organizing Committee president 
Mitt Romney tried to stop the fax machines, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously would have not had any (announcement) at all,  
given this tragedy,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church property was SLOC's first choice, Romney said. He  
approached Mormon leaders months ago about donating use of the 
site, along with money for stages and fences. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the gift was unknown, but Olympic organizers  
budgeted $5 million for rent and construction. Romney has proposed 
concert stages and hospitality tents surrounding the medals podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what I would envision for that block would be in  
memoriam to anyone who lost their life there,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starzz have moved their last two home games, Friday against  
Phoenix and Aug. 21 against Los Angeles, to the Dee Events Center 
on the Weber State campus in Ogden, 33 miles to the north.

<HEADLINE> Military Engine Plant Leaving Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Jet engine maker Pratt &AMP; Whitney  
will move its military engine operations from Florida to 
Connecticut and relocate other operations, cutting about 1,500 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to moving the military business from West Palm  
Beach, Fla., to its headquarters here, Pratt, a subsidiary of 
United Technologies Corp., said today that it would move its 
manufacturing operation from North Haven, Conn., to the East 
Hartford plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves are part of a restructuring scheduled to be completed  
by 2000. Pratt has been hit hard by the decline in demand for its 
military engines, including powerplants for the F-15 and F-16 
fighters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made considerable progress transforming Pratt into a  
lean organization, reducing costs and improving our ability to 
respond to customers,'' said Pratt president Louis R. Chenevert. 
``However, we see continuing competitive pressures which make it 
critical that we eliminate excess floor space and more closely 
match our cost structure to changing business conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 of the positions to be cut are salaried positions,  
the company said. It was not immediately clear how many of the job 
cuts would involve layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt said it would offer transfers to Connecticut to most of  
the military engine employees in Florida, including moving 
assistance. Employees whose jobs are being cut or who decide 
against moving will receive severance packages and help finding a 
new job, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the move is complete, Pratt will have about 1,000  
employees in Florida to operate engine test facilities and the 
Space Propulsion business there. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Air Force has warned that the movement of the  
engine operations could imperil Pratt's multi-billion dollar 
contracts for the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is not expected to affect Pratt plants in  
Cheshire, Conn.; North Berwick, Maine; or Columbus, Ga.; nor does 
it involve Pratt &AMP; Whitney Canada, which has taken restructuring 
actions independently. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides jet engines, Pratt &AMP; Whitney also designs, manufactures  
and services, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of United Technologies were up $1.12 1/2 to $64.31 1/4 in late  
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Federated Earnings Rise 28 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Federated Department Stores Inc.'s earnings  
rose 28 percent in the second quarter as sales increased in 
virtually all merchandise categories nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the quarter ended July 31 were $137 million, or 61  
cents per share, compared with $107 million and 47 cents in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were better than analysts had forecast. Federated  
stock rose 37 1/2 cents to $50.50 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 17 percent to $4.11 billion from $3.52 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best start to a year that any of us can  
remember,'' said James Zimmerman, Federated's chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the most critical earnings time for retailers is the  
Christmas sales period in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Irwin Teturns to Scene of Triumph  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Hale Irwin's glance across the green was  
enough to tell him where he was. As if he needed a reminder. 
</P>
<P>
	He was back at Medinah, where he scored one of the most dramatic  
victories of his long career. 
</P>
<P>
	And back on the regular tour, competing against younger players,  
including one of his partners in the first round of the PGA 
Championship -- 19-year-old Sergio Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``You mean my grandson?'' Irwin joked after shooting a 2-under  
70 Thursday, leaving him four shots behind Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He rips it, no doubt,'' Irwin said. ``If I swung that hard  
you'd have to pick me up in 14 different pieces and put me back 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at him and can't tell if he's 13 or 19. They all look  
so young to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 54, Irwin is the oldest player in the PGA Championship  
field. But he's not here as a token from the Senior Tour that he 
has dominated the last several years with 24 victories, including 
five this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He's here to play well and relish his return to Medinah, where,  
in 1990, he captured the U.S. Open in sudden death on the 91st 
hole. He also wants to show he can still compete with players half 
his age. Or, in Garcia's case, younger. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can laugh about it and joke about it,'' he said. ``It's  
not a marathon. I'm not trying to get into a strength or stamina 
test. I'm just trying to play golf. I still have a few skills that 
are there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a different arena from which I normally play and this  
is an event that is important. I don't want to say today's round 
was emotion. I played no golf last week. I needed the rest. You 
come in and play Medinah against the best players in the world and 
you need a little energy, maybe like you had when you were 19 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to fool anybody.''  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin's score would have been lower if not for a bogey on the  
18th hole and some problems all day with his putter. When he missed 
his short par putt on 18, he twirled his putter several times, 
looking as if he'd like to launch it into the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was satisfied with the round.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's be realistic,'' he said. ``If I can come here and play  
good solid golf, which I did today, if I can be competitive and 
shoot three more scores like that, you never know.''

<HEADLINE> BET Launches Web Site for Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owner of the leading black cable TV network  
is launching an ambitious Web site aimed at luring more black 
Americans online, a move to narrow the ``digital divide'' that has 
left use of the Internet among blacks well below whites. 
</P>
<P>
	BET.com, which will be launched in November by BET Holdings, is  
getting $35 million in backing from Microsoft Corp. and three major 
media companies, as well as cooperation from the NAACP and the 
United Negro College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Johnson, the chairman and founder of BET Holdings, wants  
to create the leading online destination for blacks, a ``portal'' 
that Web surfers can use as their home base to jump to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet as a revolution has economic as well as social  
implications,'' Johnson said. ``It's being instantly informed of 
information that people are going to find interesting. If you're 
not a part of that, you lose out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture will expand on a Web site that BET launched four  
years ago with Microsoft called www.msbet.com. BET Holdings will 
control a majority of the new venture, and the rest will be held by 
Microsoft, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., USA Networks Inc., and 
AT&AMP;T's Liberty Media Corp. Liberty also owns a minority stake in 
BET. 
</P>
<P>
	The new site will offer a variety of news, entertainment,  
finance and free messaging services. It will also sell items aimed 
at black buyers including clothes, books, music and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	By enlisting help from leaders of the black community, BET is  
hoping to reverse a trend that has skewed Internet usage to a 
predominantly white audience. A study by the Commerce Dept. found 
that just 11.7 percent of black households use the Internet, 
compared with 32.4 percent of white households and 12.9 percent of 
Hispanic ones. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP president Kweisi Mfume, who participated in the  
announcement of the Web site, said he hopes the venture will 
provide a central location for blacks to look for information about 
education and social issues. He said the NAACP would likely 
cooperate by providing information to the site, but details have 
yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The social implications are that we will be able to empower a  
whole group of individuals that still lags behind in access to 
technology and to the World Wide Web,'' Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson acknowledged that there remains a ``cultural block''  
that has kept many black Americans from going out and buying 
computers to get on the Internet. ``The bottleneck is in the mind, 
because the buying power is there. We need to send a message that 
it's in your interest to change that mindset and get your kids on 
the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is hoping to parlay his company's ability to penetrate  
black homes into success at building an online destination for a 
minority group, a goal that has so far proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sites aimed at particular minority audiences such as  
www.netnoir.com for blacks and www.latinolink.com for Hispanics 
have had only limited success. ``None of them are knocking the 
doors down,'' says Jupiter Communications analyst David Card. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cultural or demographic sites just haven't paid off yet,''  
Card said. ``In order to get people back you need to be in front of 
their face all the time, but I'm somewhat optimistic because BET 
has succeeded in doing that in TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BET has established itself as the main cable network catering to  
black audiences, and reaches 57 million households. In addition to 
its main BET network, BET Holdings also operates three other cable 
networks, three magazines and book publishing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study from Forrester Research suggested that use of the  
Internet by blacks, while low, is increasing. Black use of the 
Internet is accelerating faster than any other ethnic group, the 
study found.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Odom Signs With Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lamar Odom is so self-assured that he spoke  
of becoming the NBA's top rookie before the ink on his first 
contract was dry. 
</P>
<P>
	And he did so without so much as a touch of arrogance.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a rookie who hasn't proven himself yet. I've got to work  
on every aspect of my game,'' Odom said Thursday, minutes after 
signing a three-year, $7.8 million contract with the Los Angeles 
Clippers. ``On Monday, I'm going to get right in the gym, starting 
my campaign for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every rookie isn't talking like that, then something's  
wrong. I might not end up as rookie of the year. Maybe I'll end up 
as one of the best seventh men in the league. There's something I'm 
going to bring this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers feel exactly the same way about the fourth overall  
selection in this summer's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very likable person,'' Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor said. ``What I visualize him 
doing is making other players better because of his ability to pass 
the basketball, create for the other people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about having a player like that, who has such a  
great feel, such a great understanding for the game. He certainly 
has the potential to be one of the better players in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 Odom will be paid $2.4 million in his first season,  
$2.6 million in 2000-2001 and $2.8 million in 2001-2002. The 
Clippers hold a club option for $3.5 million in 2002-2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm officially in the NBA -- my lifetime dream,'' said Odom,  
who averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists for Rhode 
Island last year in his only season of college basketball. ``This 
is the opportunity of a lifetime for anybody. The ball is rolling, 
finally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odom figures to play small forward for the Clippers, perhaps  
teaming on a front line with third-year forward Maurice Taylor and 
second-year center Michael Olowokandi, the first overall selection 
in last year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sky's the limit for this team,'' Odom said. ``I  
think it's time for Los Angeles to have two great teams; hopefully, 
I can bring something special to this city, this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls weren't always the best team in the NBA. I'm not  
saying I'm Michael Jordan; it's got to start somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, who turns 20 on Nov. 6, admits he's had ups and downs. He  
attended three high schools during his senior year, began his 
college career at UNLV, but didn't play, and wound up leaving Rhode 
Island after one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, he changed his mind twice, first declaring himself  
eligible for the draft, then changing his mind, and finally 
changing his mind yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks leading up to the draft, many felt he'd be the  
first overall selection. However, he fell to fourth, much to the 
delight of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has doubts,'' Odom said in the team's offices at the  
Los Angeles Sports Arena, not far from the Staples Center, where 
the Clippers and Lakers will play this season. ``People go through 
adversity to reach the mountaintop, to look down at the doubters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've been through a lot. I have a great organization  
around me. When I come in, I see smiles, hugs, handshakes. I get a 
great feeling from everyone here.''

<HEADLINE> Aussie Coal Miners May Strike Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Coal miners in Australia will strike  
for 24 hours from midnight Thursday night in a move that could cost 
the industry nearly $20 million in lost production. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike was called Thursday by the Construction, Forestry,  
Mining and Energy Union, which is campaigning for 125 workers who 
were recently dismissed from the Oakdale mine in New South Wales 
state to receive their entitlements of more than $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike will affect 20,000 coal miners in about 100 mines,  
mostly in New South Wales and Queensland states. The coal industry 
is worth about $6.5 billion to the Australian economy each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Maher, the union's mining and energy division president,  
said the strike is drastic because the federal government hasn't 
fixed the problem for the workers, who were dismissed suddenly two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers and the union have been negotiating with the  
government over their unpaid entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government offers tea and sympathy but no real action and  
we've had enough of it,'' Maher said in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith said the strike  
would achieve nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think problems are settled by industrial action, this  
is just a bloody-minded attack for political purposes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakdale mine, southwest of Sydney, folded in June, leaving  
125 employees out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger over the miners' plight and the wider issue of security of  
workers' entitlements in the event of corporate collapses has 
brewed since. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of a meeting on Tuesday involving government  
ministers, union and worker representatives to agree on a bailout 
plan led the miners' union to call Thursday's action.

<HEADLINE> FAA Unveils plans To Reduce Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being hammered by airline executives for  
delays this summer, the Federal Aviation Administration has 
developed a plan to help reduce such inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, in a letter to the airlines, said it will soon have  
its command center in Herndon, Va., start coordinating traffic 
flows in bad weather, eliminating conflicts between local centers 
spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FAA will let the center minimize the use of  
extra buffers that are otherwise routinely established between 
planes in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has also pledged to develop a policy in which  
airplanes held on the ground because of bad weather will be given a 
specific projected departure time. Such information can then be 
relayed to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline passengers, who have suffered through hundreds of delays  
this summer, should start seeing the effect of the changes within 
the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the FAA said a long-term improvement hinges on the  
continuation of the agency's $13 billion modernization program, as 
well as congressional approval of a plan to renew the agency for 
another five years. Included in that ``reauthorization'' bill, now 
stalled in the Senate, is language that would let the FAA start 
charging fees for some of its services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we and the airlines developed is a short-term program  
that we believe will have the effect of reducing the delays,'' 
Eliot Brenner, the agency's chief spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agree that what's needed over the longer term is the  
FAA's steady program modernizing the system, which is why the 
long-term reauthorization is so important to us,'' Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, airlines have united in protest about air  
traffic delays, saying they are costing them money and contributing 
to rising passenger discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group,  
estimates the more than 308,000 air traffic control delays last 
year cost the industry $4.1 billion -- up from $3.9 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never have the on-time record we want unless the (FAA)  
can ensure that their system keeps up with growth,'' Jim Goodwin, 
chairman of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., said in Chicago 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which runs the air traffic control system and is  
responsible for ensuring passenger safety, contends that only 3 
percent of air traffic problems are attributed to equipment 
troubles. It says three-quarters of all delays are caused by bad 
weather, especially in the summer, when thunderstorms are common. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the agency is in the midst of a long-awaited  
program to upgrade its computers and displays in en route centers 
and facilities controlling traffic near airports. The FAA is also 
studying technology that would free pilots from the limits of the 
existing system of aerial highways and let planes fly routes picked 
by the pilots, a concept called ``free flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to American Airlines President Donald Carty, which  
mirrored letters sent to other airline executives, FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey said the agency benefited from the 
carriers' suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA is committed to do its part to follow through on the  
action items on which the airlines and we have agreed,'' Garvey 
wrote. ``Those actions, along with individual airline efforts to 
review and amend internal policies and procedures as appropriate, 
will lead us toward the improvements we are both seeking.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton set a goal today to reduce  
global warming over the next decade by increasing U.S. use of 
technology that converts plants and trees into fuel, chemicals and 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The president issued an executive order establishing a council  
to coordinate the federal government's effort to develop a biomass 
research program, and setting a goal of tripling use of bioenergy 
and bioproducts by 2010. Biomass energy, generated mostly from wood 
and wood waste, is currently about 3 percent of the total U.S. 
energy supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called bioenergy a possible ``technological fix that can  
help us to meet our economic challenges, maintain our security, 
sustain our prosperity and ease the threat of global warming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biomass technology uses trees, crops and waste from agriculture  
or forestry to make energy that can then be used as fuel for cars 
or power factories. It also can be used to create a variety of 
chemicals and products ranging from pharmaceuticals to glue, paint 
or even textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate goal of Clinton's order is to replace coal, oil,  
natural gas and uranium with cleaner, renewable biomass energy. If 
the goal of tripling biomass use by 2010 is met, annual greenhouse 
gas emissions would drop by more than 100 million tons, the 
equivalent of taking 70 million automobiles off the nation's roads, 
the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting the goal also would generate $15 billion to $20 billion  
in income for farmers and rural areas, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit today to the Agriculture Department, Clinton  
appealed to Congress to approve $242 million in his fiscal 2000 
budget proposal for research and tax credits to promote energy 
efficiency, bioenergy and other clean energies. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive order directs the secretaries of agriculture and  
energy and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
to prepare a report within 120 days on options for increasing 
biomass energy use.

<HEADLINE> Warren Beatty in Presidential Run? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the age of Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura,  
it didn't seem so farfetched: President Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan blazed a trail from Hollywood to Washington, but  
is the latest crop of could-be celebrity candidates just movie 
make-believe? 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony to a celebrity's instant access to headlines, the  
ripples of a possible Beatty campaign quickly grew to a swell. 
Ditto with recruiters boosting TV slugfest host Jerry Springer for 
United States Senate. Even TV's Grandpa Munster is running in New 
York to catch the Tinseltown-to-Washington wave. 
</P>
<P>
	In Memphis, wrestler Jerry ``The King'' Lawler, whose claim to  
national fame is slapping comedian Andy Kaufman on ``Late Night 
With David Letterman,'' wants to be mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Mouse and Howdy Doody must not be available,'' sniffed  
Cleveland's Plain Dealer at the thought of a Springer candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard political analyst Laura Liswood chalked it up to  
Capitol-sized Hollywood egos. ``They do start believing their own 
press releases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear Thursday whether Beatty, the actor who created  
the dangerously honest senator in ``Bulworth,'' was for real about 
joining Campaign 2000 -- or just stirring publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	After the morning newspaper made him a potential candidate,  
Beatty sounded apologetic on the phone to progressive Washington 
activist Robert Borosage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet you're surprised to hear you're an adviser to me  
since we've never talked,'' Beatty told Borosage, co-director of 
the progressive Campaign for America's Future and a veteran of 
Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the headline ``Actor hinting that he'll run for  
president,'' in Thursday's New York Times, Beatty had falsely named 
Borosage one of his political consultants and railed on about money 
corrupting politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty did not return press calls on Thursday, apparently  
content to watch the buzz he created gather momentum -- or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's anxious to use it to start raising some of these issues''  
such as campaign finance reform, Borosage said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's in the process of seriously putting  
together a presidential campaign. He's not a fool, so he knows he 
has lots of difficulties in being taken seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty's talk of the need for a liberal alternative to Democrats  
Al Gore and Bill Bradley -- someone fresh, different -- echoes in 
some of the talk surrounding Springer, the controversial talk-show 
host, and his possible candidacy in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this guy would spice things up to the point that  
people would use it as an opportunity to express their dismay at 
the mainstream politicians,'' said Dan Martin, head of the state 
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	The attraction between celebrity and politician is magnetic,  
said Janet Staihar, a PR agent whose portfolio includes Cafe 
Milano, Washington's only real celeb hangout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We here have power they are in awe of, while L.A. has the  
glamor and the glitz that Washington D.C.-ers are starved for,'' 
said Staihar. 
</P>
<P>
	But giving in to the hunger carries risk, said Washington  
pollster Mark Mellman. And celebrities may be misreading Ventura's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the pro wrestler costumed in feathers and Lycra shorts,  
sparked such voter interest that his gubernatorial election last 
year witnessed a record 60.4 percent turnout in Minnesota compared 
to a national turnout of 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	He benefited from same-day voter registration, which is not  
available nationwide. In the same year's congressional races, 
voters rejected millionaire candidates with flash but no public 
record. ``That sent the message that experience counts,'' said 
Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``There is a portion of the populace that will  
be turned on by something new, different and mischievous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That group may also be easily fooled, suggested Liswood.  
Especially with the recent spate of hit movies casting Kevin Kline, 
Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas as president. Even Annette 
Benning, Beatty's wife, played a first-lady-to-be in ``The American 
President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem competent because they play the role of  
competence,'' said Liswood. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people think 'That's so cool that so-and-so is running!'  
and, when they can register to vote on Election Day, it's like 
impulse buying.''

<HEADLINE> Wilkes Booth Home Being Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEL AIR, Md. (AP) -- To the dismay of preservationists, the  
childhood home of presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth is to be 
auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be a huge public outcry if it were bulldozed,''  
said Gary Sloan, executive director of the Preservation Association 
for Tudor Hall Inc. ``It's become the legacy of the Booth family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preservationists are concerned because although the home is  
listed on national and state registers of historic places, an 
easement has not been placed on the property to prevent its 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
	The four bedroom brick home about 20 miles northeast of  
Baltimore, known as Tudor Hall, is scheduled to be sold Oct. 16. It 
is worth an estimated $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband and wife that owned the house, Howard and Dorothy  
Fox, died this spring. Their heirs are selling the property, 
confirmed their lawyer, Robert G. Cassilly. They decided to auction 
the property after a deal to sell the home to Harford Community 
College fell through and county officials expressed no interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The house was built as a country retreat for John Wilkes Booth's  
father, Junius Brutus Booth, a Shakespearean actor who moved to 
Baltimore from England in 1821. 
</P>
<P>
	While John Wilkes Booth is known primarily for the assassination  
of Abraham Lincoln, he was also an acclaimed Shakespearean actor, 
and his brother Edwin Booth, was one of the most highly respected 
actors of his time.

<HEADLINE> CNN, CNBC Battle on Floor of NYSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN and CNBC are heading to the floor of the New  
York Stock Exchange as they continue their pitched battle for 
business viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after CNN quietly announced it would produce a daily  
show from Wall Street's epicenter, CNBC said it would do the same 
thing -- and it will be first. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC's ``Business Center'' will uproot from its New Jersey  
studio starting Monday for a new desk at the stock exchange. The 
6:30 p.m. EDT financial wrap-up show, starting 2 1/2 hours after the 
exchange shuts down for the day, competes with CNN's higher-rated 
``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go to the source of what we're reporting on for the  
final word of the day,'' said Bill Bolster, CNBC president. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime this fall, CNN will premiere ``Street Sweep,'' a new  
business show broadcast from the stock exchange daily starting at 
3:59 p.m., or one minute before the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moneyline'' will continue to be broadcast from its New York  
studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition between the two networks has been particularly  
intense this summer. While CNBC is the leading business network, 
``Moneyline'' consistently outrates ``Business Center'' and is 
extraordinarily attractive to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC expanded ``Business Center'' to an hour after popular  
``Moneyline'' host Lou Dobbs quit and cut into its rival's 
audience, but CNN has remained in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange first allowed live TV reports from  
the trading floor in 1995, requiring networks to use robotic 
cameras to minimize congestion. Twenty-two television stations are 
accredited to report there, said NYSE spokesman Robert Zito 
</P>
<P>
	Now the exchange is making space for desks so CNN and CNBC can  
deliver full shows there, although ongoing live shows won't be 
allowed during the midst of trading. The networks will pay a 
nominal production fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we want to do is tell them to go away,'' Zito  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are reports CNBC is spending more than $1 million to  
quickly make the ``Business Center'' shift. Bolster wouldn't 
dispute the figure, but said he didn't know the exact amount. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC wasn't necessarily racing to be first on the floor, but was  
watching its competitor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had always been our strategic plan,'' Bolster said. ``When  
Lou Dobbs left, we saw that opportunity and we just accelerated the 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN believes ``Street Sweep'' will be able to take better  
advantage of its location because more people will be at the stock 
exchange as the bell sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's better than being there a few hours later ``when the  
janitors are sweeping up,'' said Steve Korn, vice chairman of the 
CNN News Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're at the head of the pack and leading the  
race,'' Korn said. ``We're not looking behind us. We're looking 
ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Acts Quickly After Tornado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Thirty minutes after a rare tornado  
rampaged through downtown without warning, volunteers were 
directing traffic and striding through neighborhoods, equipped with 
chain saws and hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, most streets were free of debris, and  
officials attributed the remarkable response to the culture of 
preparedness that is central to Mormonism. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was killed and dozens were injured in Wednesday's  
twister. Fifteen people remained hospitalized Thursday, two in 
critical condition and four in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were still assessing the destruction, but at least 121  
homes were damaged, with 34 left uninhabitable. The mayor's office 
estimated that the tornado destroyed about $150 million in 
property, excluding damage to the Outdoor Retailers Market, a trade 
show held twice annually in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt, who said 80 percent of the damage would be  
fixed within four to five days, declared the city a disaster area 
and requested federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning,  
but forecasters said they couldn't tell a tornado had formed until 
it was too late. The tornado gouged holes in historic homes, pulled 
up trees 100 feet tall and blew out car windows. Adjusters for the 
large insurance companies said they had handled more than 250 
claims by Thursday afternoon and were expecting more. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of warning, Mormon church members quickly hit  
the streets armed with a 50-page disaster booklet and a 
military-style plan for handling emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  
Saints have urged members -- who make up about 70 percent of Utah's 
population -- to stockpile a year's supply of food as a hedge 
against the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	Before survivalism was popular, Utah companies sold food in  
40-pound bags, 100-hour candles and water storage barrels. And the 
church has a silo filled with 19 million pounds of wheat just in 
case normal distribution systems break down. 
</P>
<P>
	Those policies -- which date to the state's pioneer history and  
gave Mormons a head start on preparing for the Y2K bug -- help when 
Utah is hit by natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had dozens of people turn out just to help clean up,'' said  
Ronald Coleman, bishop of the First Capitol Hill Ward, the first 
residential area hit by the storm after it skipped through 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said each Mormon man in the ward is assigned four or  
five families to call or visit after a disaster. The plan then 
calls for them to check on other neighbors and report back to the 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all did their checking and before everyone went to bed  
last night, the windows were covered and everybody was trying to 
help their neighbors,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members handed out tarps and fresh water; others formed  
roving crews to clear streets with chainsaws; still others stood by 
at an apartment complex where the elevator was broken to help if an 
ill resident needed to be carried down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the storm, city officials asked the church for  
tarps, ropes and tents. The church took the gear from a massive 
central warehouse it maintains for disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross asked for help from LDS Family Services, the  
church's counseling program, to help work with residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the church is known for helping out  
in emergency situations,'' said Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee 
Corradini, who is not Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
	As the city shook off the twister's effects, the National  
Weather Service began examining its performance just before the 
tornado tore through downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning as  
the storm approached, expecting the marble-sized hail that pelted 
the city. Tornadoes are rare near Salt Lake City -- only about two a 
year occur statewide -- and forecasters don't have a lot of 
experience spotting twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters normally rely on computers to interpret radar images  
and give an early indication that a tornado is likely. But in this 
case, said forecaster Mike Conger, the system didn't pick up the 
telltale signature of a twister until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a lot of hard evidence prior to its development  
that would have given us a reason to go with a tornado warning,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials said there was no indication the  
weather service had made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us ever dreamed there would be a tornado in Salt Lake  
City,'' Corradini said. ``We have major thunderstorms here, and I 
think that's what we thought it was.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slid against the yen Friday after the  
Japanese government said an economic growth spurt in the first 
three months of the year was actually greater than initially 
thought. Tokyo share prices fell moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.77 yen at midday, down 0.91 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 115.62 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 82.93 points,  
or 0.48 percent, to 17,340.04 at the end of the morning trading. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 211.81 points, or 1.23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency announced Japan's economy grew 2.0  
percent during the January-March period, slightly higher than the 
1.9 percent growth it initially reported in June. 
</P>
<P>
	If the growth pace set in the last quarter were to continue, GDP  
would expand 8.1 percent this year, the EPA said. That was up from 
the 7.9 percent announced in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has recently strengthened against the dollar amid  
optimism that the economy is showing signs of emerging from a 
prolonged downturn. Friday's announcement was likely to enhance 
such beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.57 yen, down  
from 123.36 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell on selling sparked by the  
yen's renewed rise against the dollar. Investors are worried about 
the impact of a stronger yen on corporate earnings, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, and reduces the dollar-denominated earnings 
of exporting companies when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.59  
points to 10,789.39 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.03 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,437.41. 
The TOPIX closed up 17.80 points, or 1.25 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8450 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8250 percent, driving 
its price down to 99.61 yen from 99.78 yen.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Fire Manager Phil Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Phil Garner was fired as manager of the  
Milwaukee Brewers today in the midst of the team's seventh straight 
losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jim Lefebvre replaced him on an interim basis.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Sal Bando was reassigned in the start of a total  
overhaul of the perennial losers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know that we weren't getting it done,'' said team  
president Wendy Selig-Prieb, the daughter of baseball commissioner 
Bud Selig. ``We're all frustrated. We're all disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando hired Garner, his former teammate, shortly after becoming  
the Brewers' GM in October 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee dropped to 52-60 after an 8-5 defeat by Colorado on  
Wednesday and has the second-lowest attendance in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	The only manager who survived more consecutive losing seasons  
with one team than Garner is Connie Mack, who did it twice with the 
Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil has been a class act though all our troubles,''  
Selig-Prieb said.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Farmer May Reap $20B Windfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASON CITY, Iowa (AP) -- U.S. farmers could reap a $20 billion  
windfall in the next decade under President Clinton's plan to 
triple the use of biomass products and technology such as 
corn-based gasoline additives, Vice President Al Gore says. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sparking a sagging farm economy, a sharp boost in  
the use of plant-based products could prove a boon for the 
environment, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will mean jobs for rural America since most of the  
value-added work will need to occur in rural communities close to 
where the raw materials are grown,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was announcing in Washington today his decision to set a  
goal of tripling the use of biomass technologies by 2010, including 
ethanol gasoline additives, plant-based textiles and other 
products. Ethanol, an alcohol additive that makes gasoline burn 
more cleanly, now is made from corn but theoretically could be 
processed from any plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who was set to talk about the plan here as he courts the  
Iowa farm vote, estimated that farm income could jump by $15 
billion to $20 billion over the decade as a result of increased 
biomass production. 
</P>
<P>
	Biomass technologies have been evolving rapidly, and Clinton's  
announcement could well spur research into finding still more uses 
for the new techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's opponent for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination,  
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, also was in the state, and has 
endorsed an $11 billion emergency aid program the Senate rejected 
before the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to help good people through tough times  
and these are tough times for Iowa farmers,'' said Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore was grabbing the limelight by unveiling the new biomass  
effort, which is also likely to draw cheers from environmentalists. 
Boosting the planting of trees and other deep-rooted plants used in 
biomass technologies can help control the release or greenhouse 
gases often linked to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing that planting can also help control soil erosion and  
boost the leaching of chemicals from groundwater, Gore argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new technologies offer opportunities to increase our  
rural markets enormously,'' Gore said in a statement. ``They will 
give new meaning to the term power plant -- literally helping us 
grow clean energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't have been better for Gore. With both Bradley  
and Gore focusing on farm issues during their latest campaign 
swing, Gore was able to bring to the table the prospect of 
increased farm income at a time when traditional commodities prices 
are at historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	That's left many parts of the Farm Belt -- including politically  
sensitive Iowa -- struggling with a sagging farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley swept through separate sections of the state  
Wednesday, both focusing on farm issues in hopes of drawing a 
contrast with Republicans vying for a high-profile straw poll on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also called on the Justice Department to launch an  
antitrust investigation of the meatpacking industry, and Gore said 
he was worried about increasing concentration throughout the farm 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lack of competition has led to Depression-era prices for hogs  
while the meatpacking industry is making record earnings,'' Bradley 
said. ``That is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore joined with Gov. Tom Vilsack to lead a discussion with  
farmers about their troubles. The vice president called for 
revisions to the nation's basic farm legislation, the Freedom to 
Farm Act. He said farm policy was ``in serious need of improvement 
and change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom to Farm Act ended most traditional subsidy payments  
while also ending most planting restrictions. The issue is a 
delicate one for Gore because Clinton signed the measure into law.

<HEADLINE> Harvard School Names Roman Catholic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest is taking over  
the leadership of Harvard's Divinity School, replacing the dean 
forced to quit after pornography was found on his university-owned 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. J. Bryan Hehir is the first Catholic in the school's  
183-year history to assume the role in a permanent capacity. A 
product of the Divinity School himself, Hehir specializes in the 
study of Roman Catholic social teaching and has been a Harvard 
professor of religion and society since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been acting dean at Harvard since the university asked  
Dean Ronald F. Thiemann, an ordained Lutheran minister, to resign 
last fall for ``conduct unbecoming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School computer technicians found thousands of pornographic  
sites on his personal computer at his university residence after 
Thiemann requested technical assistance in transferring files. 
</P>
<P>
	To allow him to continue his commitments as a Catholic priest  
and his role as a counselor with the Catholic Relief Services, 
Hehir, 58, will be assisted by other faculty members and associate 
deans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hehir won't actually be called dean, but will bear the title of  
``chair of an executive committee'' for the school of about 550 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, his responsibilities as a Catholic priest are to  
the Catholic Church. Given that, the job has been adjusted slightly 
in order to take advantage of his talents,'' said Joe Wrinn, a 
university spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hehir has parish responsibilities at St. Paul's near Harvard and  
at the Church of the Resurrection in Ellicott City, Md., outside 
Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> BOT Closes Early on Power Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade closed an hour early  
today after a power outage affecting the downtown Loop area 
threatened to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Board Options Exchange planned to temporarily halt  
trading at 2:40 p.m. EDT until they could switch over to backup 
generators, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBOT chief executive officer Thomas R. Donovan made the decision  
to close the markets at 2 p.m. after speaking to Commonwealth 
Edison CEO John Rowe, said CBOT spokesman Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Donovan wanted to ensure an orderly shut down, avoiding  
the potential chaos if power failed with as many as 5,000 traders 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disruption of trading,'' Gallaway said.  
``The last minutes of trading are often some of busiest trading of 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were blamed on the failures of two power  
transmission cables, which left 2,300 customers in the heart of 
downtown Chicago in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Trade's agricultural markets were to close at 2:15  
p.m. and the financial markets normally close at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange remained open.

<HEADLINE> Williams, Collins Debut Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- At first glance, the matchup between Ricky Williams  
and Cecil ``the Diesel'' Collins hardly looks even. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams rushed for an NCAA-record 6,279 yards and 72 touchdowns  
before winning the Heisman Trophy. Collins rushed for 713 yards and 
four touchdowns before going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rookie running backs will share the spotlight in their  
NFL debuts Friday night when the New Orleans Saints face the Miami 
Dolphins in a preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the fifth player taken in the April draft, is expected  
to rejuvenate a Saints franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs 
in seven years. Collins, the 134th player drafted, is the latest 
candidate to rejuvenate the Dolphins' perennially moribund ground 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Both will see limited action in the exhibition opener. Williams  
will play no more than 1 1/2 quarters, Collins perhaps even less. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to finally get out there in a stadium and get my  
first NFL experience,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Collins, who has shown so far in training camp that  
the Dolphins gambled wisely when they drafted him in the fifth 
round. He slipped that far only because drug and legal problems 
limited him to six games in college at Louisiana State and McNeese 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've proved a lot since day one,'' Collins said.  
``It's been a long road for me. The more repetitions I get, the 
more comfortable I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins fans are so desperate for a productive running back  
that they're still buzzing about Collins' performance in a 
scrimmage last week, when he rushed for a grand total of 22 yards 
in four carries. Coach Jimmy Johnson's comments have fueled the 
hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good back. He doesn't give you a whole to tackle -- just  
shoulder pads, knees and elbows,'' Johnson said. ``He tends to put 
a smile on a lot of people's faces, other than the opponents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has also received rave reviews from teammates and  
Saints coach Mike Ditka, who traded all of his draft choices for 
the chance to pick Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I watch him, the more I'm amazed,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he stays healthy, there's no doubt in my mind he may be one  
of the best running backs ever to play the game,'' quarterback 
Billy Joe Hobert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints owner Tom Benson has said he expects the Saints to make  
the playoffs, a lofty goal for a franchise with just four 
postseason games in their history -- all losses. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the draft, Johnson poked fun at Ditka for the  
trade that netted Williams. But this week, Johnson admitted he 
might swap an entire draft for one player under the right 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were desperate for a quarterback, yes, I'd trade a draft  
for a quarterback,'' Johnson said. ``I would have traded a draft 
for Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I would have paid an entire draft for Emmitt Smith --  
maybe. Emmitt has turned into a Hall of Fame player, but I don't 
know that I knew that back when I drafted him. There are key 
players you would probably pay a draft for, but very few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would Johnson trade the players he drafted this year for  
Williams? That question may be easier to answer after watching 
Williams and Collins play Friday.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Retain Czerkawski, Sign 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders signed four free  
agents Thursday, including Mariusz Czerkawski. 
</P>
<P>
	Czerkawski, a restricted free agent, signed a one-year contract  
reportedly worth slightly over $1 million to stay with the 
Islanders. The deal also includes a second year at the team's 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	New York also signed three unrestricted free agents; center  
Daniel Lacroix and defensemen Dallas Eakins and Aris Brimanis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Czerkawski played 78 games for the Islanders and  
finished with 21 goals and 17 assists. The 21 goals were his second 
highest season total, only eclipsed by the 26 goals he had with 
Edmonton in 1996-97. He will be counted on to score more with New 
York's trade of Zigmund Palffy to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix spent most of last season with Hamilton of the AHL. In  
46 games, he had 13 goals and nine assists to go along with 260 
penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 18 games last season with the Maple Leafs, Eakins had two  
points and 24 penalty minutes. Brimanis played 66 games for Grand 
Rapids of the IHL and scored 16 goals and had 21 assists.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shrugs Off China Ship Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration insisted today that  
a Chinese shipping company that will operate terminals in the 
Panama Canal poses no threat to U.S. shipping or security 
interests, despite fresh concerns from Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company does not have any ability to stop or impede  
traffic through the canal,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., in a letter to Defense Secretary William Cohen,  
raised the possibility that ``U.S. naval ships will be at the mercy 
of Chinese-controlled pilots'' and could even be denied passage. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Panama's 1997 decision to award a Hong Kong-based  
shipping company, Hutchinson Whampoa Ltd., a long-term contract to 
operate ports on the canal's Atlantic and Pacific entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott cited reports that the company had ties to China's  
leadership and its military. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration is allowing a scenario to develop where  
U.S. national security interests could not be protected without 
confronting the Chinese Communists in the Americas,'' Lott 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
	Other conservative Republicans have raised similar concerns  
about the arrangement in the past, but Lott's was the highest-level 
congressional protest thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was quick to insist that the Chinese shipping  
company's presence was not a security threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States is satisfied our interests will be protected  
after the canal is turned over this December. We have seen no 
capability on the part of (China) to disrupt the canal's 
operations,'' said David Leavy, a national security spokesman at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would caution people not to get too concerned,'' Leavy said.  
``Our team looked into this, analyzed this and made a judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the Hong Kong firm will  
essentially operate terminals at either end of the canal to unload 
containers from container ships too large to fit through the canal. 
The shipping company will then transport the containers to the 
opposite end of the canal and then load them onto other container 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, Bacon said the United States is prepared to use  
force, if necessary, to guarantee that the canal remains open to 
international shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has a unilateral right to maintain the  
neutrality of the canal and to reopen if there should be any 
military threat,'' he said. ``We do not see Chinese-owned port 
facilities as a military or a national security threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin said, ``We have  
seen no capability or interest on the part of the People's Republic 
of China, a major user of the Panama Canal, to disrupt its 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will maintain a close interest in canal operations after  
transfer of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1977 Panama Canal treaties guarantee the neutrality of the  
canal after 2000, requiring Panama to let all ships cross 
independent of political conflicts -- and letting the United States 
intervene militarily if it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military also will leave Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Elkington Withdraws Due to Caddie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- His caddie's health means more to Steve  
Elkington than the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 PGA winner withdrew from this year's tournament about  
an hour before he was to tee off Thursday after his longtime 
caddie, Joe Grillo, was taken to the hospital complaining of chest 
pains. Grillo was in stable condition in the intensive care unit at 
Glen Oaks Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Chris Prester said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Grillo) said he was glad he got the proper care on time  
and he is doing well,'' Prester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grillo was waiting for Elkington to arrive at Medinah Country  
Club when he began complaining of shortness of breath and 
dizziness. Paramedics put him on a gurney just as Elkington 
arrived, and Grillo tried to convince him to play. But after 45 
minutes passed without any word on his condition, Elkington 
withdrew and drove to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed with Grillo until early in the afternoon. He was  
replaced by Bob Friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no other decision,'' Elkington told GolfWeb.com.  
``It was the only one I could make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington's decision wasn't a surprise, said Greg Norman, one of  
his best friends. Grillo has been Elkington's caddie for years, and 
the two are very close, Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very close to our caddies. Outside of our wives,  
they're the person we spend the most time with,'' Norman said. 
``I'd withdraw, too. I wouldn't hesitate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elkington might have additional empathy because of his own  
history of health problems. He was hospitalized in January 1994 
with a viral infection and spent the first part of the year 
recuperating. While he was hospitalized, a malignant growth was 
removed from his shoulder and he had surgery to correct a sinus 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He needed additional surgery for the sinus problem in March  
1998, and was hospitalized later that spring for viral meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Grillo) probably means a lot more to him than any golf  
tournament,'' said Tony Navarro, a friend of Grillo and Norman's 
caddie. 
</P>
<P>
	Grillo never complained about heart problems before, but he  
wasn't in the best shape and occasionally had trouble walking the 
golf course, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most popular caddies on the tour, Grillo has been a  
tireless advocate for his co-workers. He started a kitchen so 
caddies could be assured of a reasonably cheap meal, driving a 
motor home from tournament to tournament and often cooking food 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He usually acts as an organizer at tournaments, arranging hotels  
and shuttle service to the golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest guys in the world and probably my  
dearest friend,'' Navarro said. ``He's one of everybody's favorites 
out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second straight PGA Tour event in Chicago in which a  
caddie has had heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Western Open last month, caddie Garland Dempsey's  
heart stopped and he collapsed while walking off the 15th tee 
during the third round. Paramedics had to use a defibrillator to 
restart his heart.

<HEADLINE> Osborne in Coaches' Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Tom Osborne still has the itch to coach.  
He's just not doing it on a football field anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, who will be enshrined tonight in the College Football  
Hall of Fame as one of the winningest coaches in Division I-A 
history, is using his ``retirement'' to teach at-risk middle school 
students in Nebraska through a mentoring program he created while 
he was still coaching the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that someone who affirms them, supports them, has a  
vision of what they might become and is there and is concerned is 
very important,'' Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne was inspired to begin the program after he saw more and  
more troubled players come into the Nebraska program. Some, like 
Lawrence Phillips, grabbed headlines with their problems. But 
others were heavy on emotional baggage and low on parental support. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were young people who were screened. They had decent  
grades. They were recommended highly by their teachers and coaches, 
so we were dealing with probably the upper 25 percent of high 
school graduates,'' Osborne said. ``I began to realize a lot of 
things were falling through the cracks for young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teammates Mentoring Program, which Osborne founded in 1991,  
has chapters in 17 Nebraska cities and has a goal of having a 
presence in every school district in the state. While it may seem a 
daunting task, after crafting the Cornhuskers football program into 
a perennial powerhouse with a 255-49-3 record over 25 years, if 
anybody in Nebraska can do it, Osborne can. 
</P>
<P>
	People still regard him as a larger-than-life figure in  
Nebraska, where he won national titles in 1994 and 1995 and split 
the crown in 1997, his last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people are willing to work with the program because of  
how highly people think of coach Osborne,'' said Shauna Valentine, 
who coordinates the Lincoln chapter of the Teammates program. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne began the program after asking players if they were  
interested in mentoring middle school children. Six years later, he 
expanded it to match students with adult mentors rather than 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't go to him with an idea. It was his idea, and he was  
doing it,'' Valentine said. ``Beyond being the founder, he's been 
the cheerleader for the rest of us. He's the leader. He's the 
director in many ways, not only in the example that he sets but 
what he does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, who along with his wife Nancy also serves as a mentor  
in the program, said he hopes to reach 1,400 kids by next fall, 
with hopes of doubling the enrollment each year until the program 
reaches 10 percent of Nebraska middle school students, about 17,000 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're limited only by the number of people who volunteer to be  
mentors,'' he said. ``It's been probably the most meaningful thing 
that I've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's saying something, considering Osborne led the Cornhuskers  
to an NCAA-record 25 straight bowl appearances, reached the 250-win 
plateau quicker than any other Division I-A coach and averaged more 
than 10 wins a season for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, he'll be enshrined into the Hall of Fame after the  
National Football Foundation Honors Court waived its customary 
three-year waiting period, something it's done only once before. 
</P>
<P>
	Other enshrinees include Division I players Al Brosky, Brad  
Budde, Bill Fralic, Randy Gradishar, Bo Jackson, Mel Long, Jim 
McMahon, Jerry Rhome, Jim Richter, Johnny Roland, Alex Sarkisian 
and Bill Stanfill. They were elected to the hall last spring and 
inducted during a December ceremony in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Divisional Class includes players George Bork, Teel Bruner,  
George Floyd, Willie Galimore, Jim LeClair and Randy Trautman, 
along with coaches Don Coryell, Billy Nicks and Jim Sochor. They 
were elected this spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- IDT Corp. and Telefonica S.A. of Spain  
have formed a joint partnership to sell Internet and telephone 
services to the Hispanic market in the United States, the companies 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad-based venture between the two telecommunication  
companies will offer Internet access, prepaid calling cards and 
other phone services, David Brainson, vice president of finance for 
IDT, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Madrid-based Telefonica, the leading telecom provider in Spain  
and Portugal, has half of its 55 million customers in Latin 
America. Telefonica is trying to expand its presence to Latinos in 
the United States and elsewhere by using IDT technology and know 
how, IDT spokesman Larry Weisman said. 
</P>
<P>
	IDT is attempting to increase its presence among the 30 million  
Hispanics in the United States by using Telefonica's name 
recognition and networking services. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, IDT began marketing an Internet access  
service aimed at Hispanic users called Nuestra Voz, or Our Voice. 
Telefonica has a Web portal service called Ole! IDT, however, did 
not say how the two services would be connected, if at all.

<HEADLINE> Bush Meets With Limbaugh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush chatted  
privately with conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh for 
an hour, but didn't sew up an endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Bush said he wasn't seeking an endorsement when he paid  
a late-night ``courtesy call'' at the Missouri home of Limbaugh's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Limbaugh, who grew up in Cape Girardeau and was back home on  
vacation, called the governor ``and old friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in Missouri for an appearance today at an agricultural  
bagging service where he planned to promote a Christian volunteer 
organization aimed at helping out farmers during times of need. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bellwether state, it's a swing state and it's an early  
state,'' Bush told reporters. ``This is a primary season that could 
end pretty quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press shortly before  
arriving at the Limbaugh family home about 10 p.m. Wednesday, Bush 
summed up the campaign's competitive nature with a line used by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The politics of personal destruction and those who exercise it  
are going to be rejected by the electorate,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming names, Bush seemed to criticize GOP opponent  
Steve Forbes for doing just that in the 1996 primary season against 
Republican front-runner Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, there's one person in this race who can write a  
check,'' Bush said. ``In 1996, the campaign got very ugly because 
that person who could write the checks ran negative ads against 
everybody else in the field. I will defend my honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said the Republican Party was big enough for both him  
and opponent Pat Buchanan, despite their numerous policy 
differences. Campaign sources have said Buchanan, who won 
Missouri's GOP caucus in 1996, is exploring the possibility of 
running under the Reform Party banner this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush says he expects to win this weekend's Iowa straw poll but  
generally doesn't put much stock in the polls. After all, he said, 
he watched his father reach some of the highest approval numbers 
ever recorded for a president, then plummet in the polls and end up 
losing his re-election bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some of Bush's competitors are taking a swipe at the  
front-runner over a recent magazine interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The article in Talk magazine quotes Bush as saying ``I don't  
know'' whether the number of abortions in Texas has gone up or down 
during his tenure as Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably down,'' Bush says in the interview, ``Not because of  
anything we've done though. We haven't passed any laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has been criticized by some conservatives for not taking a  
stronger stance against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also was asked about his handling of the case of Karla Faye  
Tucker, a convicted murdered executed in Texas last year despite 
pleas for clemency from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The article recounted Bush's comments about the case,  
specifically about Tucker's appearance on television asking for 
clemency. Writer Tucker Carlson describes Bush as mimicking Tucker, 
writing: ``Please,' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock 
desperation, 'don't kill me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer said this week he was  
dismayed that Bush would react that way about so serious a matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he made a very bad decision to mock somebody he had  
life and death control over,'' Bauer said in an Iowa news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a very difficult moment for me and anybody who  
covered me during that period knows how tough that was,'' Bush told 
the AP. ``It was a serious, somber time. Mr. Carlson misread, 
mischaracterized me. He's a good reporter, he just misunderstood 
about how serious that was. I take the death penalty very 
seriously. I take each case seriously. I just felt he misjudged me. 
I think he misinterpreted my feelings. I know he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he also was concerned about other parts of the  
article, such as Bush's comments on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was also quoted as using profanity on several occasions in  
the interview, something Republican candidate Pat Buchanan 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw that article and I was mildly astonished,'' Buchanan  
said Monday in an interview with Fox News. ``There are no saints in 
this business, but I would urge the governor for his own good to 
clean up the language in these interviews.''

<HEADLINE> Alcan Won't Rule Out Reynolds Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Alcan Aluminium Ltd. president and chief  
executive Jacques Bougie said Alcan isn't ruling out the 
possibility of making a bid for Reynolds Metals Co. following 
yesterday's $5.6 billion offer for Reynolds by Alcoa Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a news conference here about the possibility of a  
counterbid for Reynolds, Bougie said, ``We exclude no options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bougie declined to comment further on the Rnolds situation  
however, saying he wanted to focus his comments on Alcan's planned 
three-way merger with Pechiney S.A. and Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Bougie did dismiss as far-fetched a theory that Alcoa had  
announced its bid merely as a ploy to complicate antitrust 
regulatory clearance for Alcan's three-way merger. He said he 
believes Alcoa is serious about wanting to acquire Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Alcan had been rumored as a possible suitor  
for Reynolds. Some analysts Wednesday characterized Alcoa's offer 
for Reynolds as a low-ball bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Reynolds initially rose Thursday, before declining on  
profit-taking, as investors speculated that either the $65 per 
share offer would be increased or a another bid would emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	In early afternoon trading, shares were down 25 cents to $65,  
well off the high of $67.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> States Stick to Their Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Another violent shooting has become  
another bitter opportunity for gun-control advocates to call for 
stricter regulations -- though few states appear inclined to change. 
</P>
<P>
	Political leaders in several states with strong histories of gun  
ownership say they are unlikely to toughen gun-control laws 
following the nation's third major shooting in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gun laws wouldn't have helped in Los Angeles,'' Vermont Gov.  
Howard Dean, a Democrat, said Wednesday. ``Better enforcement would 
have helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A man walked into a Jewish community center in Los Angeles on  
Tuesday and fired more than 70 bullets from a semiautomatic weapon, 
wounding three children, a teen-ager and a woman. The suspect, 
white supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., surrendered a day 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, is also charged with murder and illegal possession  
of a firearm in the slaying of a postal worker near the community 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately clear where Furrow obtained the weapon.  
California gun buyers must pass a background check with a 10-day 
waiting period, and convicted felons are barred from possessing 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton immediately urged the nation to ``intensify  
our resolve to make America a safer place,'' and White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv repeated the call Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a number of incidents involving guns this year  
that just point to the obvious need for sensible gun legislation,'' 
Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the April school massacre in Littleton, Colo., Congress  
weighed new federal gun control measures that, among other things, 
would have required safety devices on handguns and background 
checks on all gun show sales. The legislation is the subject of a 
fierce partisan battle amid strong lobbying by pro-gun groups. 
</P>
<P>
	State legislators also hear from gun lobbyists.  
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana state Rep. Kyle Green said he hoped the recent  
shootings would change the minds of lawmakers who continued to 
oppose tighter gun control after the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Green, a Democrat, is not optimistic. Louisiana recently  
passed a bill exempting gun manufacturers from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not bet the bank on the Legislature reversing courses  
and taking actions to protect kids over the profits of gun 
manufacturers,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	While a few states, including California, have imposed tighter  
controls on gun ownership, most states have done nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona state Sen. Randall Gnant said the only people he hears  
from on gun control are National Rifle Association members and 
others who want no controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think this Legislature, given the state's Wild  
West history, is going to be inclined to take this issue on,'' said 
Gnant, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat in a state with a  
Democratic-dominated Legislature, said after the community center 
shooting that he would sign additional ``responsible'' gun-control 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis last month signed laws restricting gun purchases to one a  
month and tightening a ban on assault weapons by closing a loophole 
that let manufacturers get around the law by renaming their 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Wednesday that Davis will likely sign legislation  
that would restrict cheaply made handguns and require trigger locks 
and warning labels on all guns sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are well on our way to implementing the most comprehensive  
package of gun-control bills in the history of our state,'' said 
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Utah, state legislators have rejected Gov. Mike Leavitt's  
call for a special session to tighten the state's liberal gun laws. 
Gun ownership is considered a birthright in Utah, where any adult 
with a clean record can get a permit to carry a concealed weapon 
just about anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a special law signed by Leavitt in March to declare the  
2002 Winter Olympics would be a gun-free event. Even that drew 
tough opposition from legislators, who finally relented under 
pressure from the governor and Olympic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, where Republicans control the Assembly and  
Democrats dominate the Senate, legislative leaders also doubted the 
Los Angeles shootings would affect gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wisconsin is a state with a lot of gun lovers,'' said Senate  
President Fred Risser, who favors tougher regulation. ``Even the 
weakest measures to pass stricter gun control have failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Assemblywoman Audrey Hochberg said gun-rights groups  
have blocked state gun bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous that we haven't been able to make more gains  
with these terrible incidents,'' Hochberg said. ``I think we just 
have to keep working and hope that some common sense comes out of 
all of this.''

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed Against L.A. Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With a suspect jailed in the attack at a  
Jewish community center, authorities and a violence-weary public 
were left with a question: Why would a white supremacist allegedly 
travel the length of the West Coast to a quiet neighborhood to 
deliver ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been asking ourselves trying to figure this out,  
and we can't,'' said 17-year-old Maritza Tobo, who lives with her 
mother near the center where three children were among the wounded. 
``Innocent kids? They don't do anything to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they don't know why Los Angeles was a target, but  
they are no longer searching for the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O. Furrow Jr., 37, was brought back to Los Angeles on  
Wednesday night aboard a U.S. Customs helicopter after waiving 
extradition in Las Vegas. Hours earlier, he was charged by federal 
prosecutors with killing a postal worker an hour after the assault 
at the community center. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces five charges of attempted murder in that attack: three  
boys, a teen-age counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist were 
shot. The most seriously wounded, a 5-year-old boy shot twice, 
remained in critical condition after doctors inserted four pins in 
his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Furrow fled to Las Vegas by taxi -- a 275-mile  
trip that involved two cabs -- after Tuesday's shootings. He spent 
the night at a hotel, then walked into an FBI office and confessed, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking for me -- I killed the kids in Los Angeles,'' an  
FBI source quoted Furrow as saying. The source said Furrow assumed 
he had killed some children. 
</P>
<P>
	He also told investigators ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call  
to America to kill Jews,'' an FBI source said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged with murder and illegal possession of a  
firearm in the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39, the postal worker 
killed after the center shootings. Prosecutors could seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow has also admitted to shooting Ileto, Postal Inspector  
Pamela Prince said in today's Daily News of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	At his federal court appearance, Furrow sat expressionless as  
the charges were read, said his attorney, Art Allen. Asked if he 
understood the charges, he answered: ``Yes, I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shackled at the feet and cuffed at the wrists, Furrow then  
walked down the steps of the courthouse to the jeers of a bystander 
who rushed up and shouted: ``You're a coward! You are a coward!' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow looked at him and smiled, and was then hustled away.  
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Furrow tried to commit himself at the Fairfax  
Psychiatric Hospital in the Seattle suburbs, but got in trouble 
when he pulled a knife on a nurse. He pleaded guilty to 
second-degree assault, served about five months in jail and was 
released on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The balding suspect also belonged to the Aryan Nations group in  
1995, said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which 
maintains a database of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a picture of him, Furrow, in a Nazi outfit,'' Potok  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the center shooting, police said, Furrow abandoned a van  
full of ammunition, survival paraphernalia and a book linked to 
white supremacist thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly had the wherewithal to create a greater tragedy  
than the one we had,'' Police Chief Bernard Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  
Angeles, said Furrow's comments upon surrendering proved the attack 
was a hate crime, though it was not immediately clear whether 
federal civil rights charges will be filed against the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``To these kinds of demented and warped minds, having a few  
hours under the sun where the whole world is paying attention to 
you is really tantalizing,'' Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow lived at times in Metaline Falls, Wash., once a haven for  
the supremacist group The Order and had a relationship with Debbie 
Mathews, widow of Order founder Robert J. Mathews. Mathews was 
killed in 1984 when his hideout caught fire during a shootout with 
federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	But most are at a loss to explain why the North Valley Jewish  
Community Center was targeted for an attack in which 70 shots were 
sprayed around the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The randomness is the reason it's so dangerous,'' Hier said.  
</P>
<P>
	Furrow may have visited the Wiesenthal Center's Museum of  
Tolerance two or three months ago, the Daily News reported. Staff 
members recall him entering the museum with a tour group but later 
wandering off by himself, ignoring exhibits that focus on the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was alerted, but the man had disappeared by the time  
guards went to look for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The community center in suburban Granada Hills, a leafy  
middle-class neighborhood, remained closed Wednesday, guarded by 
police and security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the children assembled next door in St. Andrews and St.  
Charles Episcopal Church, which shares its space with Temple Beth 
Torah -- a refuge for children the day of the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's going to scare us away,'' said J. Eliad, the father  
of a 4-year-old girl who wouldn't give his first name. ``We're 
going to be here for good.''

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raiser Huang Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Democratic fund-raiser John Huang  
pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiracy for violating campaign 
finance laws and was sentenced to one year of probation and a 
$10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea and sentence were expected but had been delayed by an  
effort to have Huang, who has been cooperating, testify before 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Paez said he expected Huang to  
continue cooperating with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``These matters should not be taken lightly. I expect that you  
will cooperate with everyone in all these matters,'' Paez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, said his client would appear before  
Congress if called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, I'm very sad and embarrassed by my mistakes that  
have brought disrepute to my family and my community,'' Huang told 
the judge. ``I'm glad the court has given me the opportunity to 
serve my community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, a former executive of the Jakarta-based Lippo Group, was  
the Democrats' chief fund-raiser for the Asian-American community 
in 1996. He brought in $1.6 million in questionable donations that 
later were returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He was only accused of an illegal $2,500 donation to the  
campaign committee of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Michael Woo in 
1993, and an illegal $5,000 donation to California Victory Fund '94 
that was shared by Sen. Dianne Feinstein's re-election committee, 
the Democratic senatorial campaign committee and the state 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang could have been sentenced to prison for five years.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb said it was clear from government documents that ``although  
Mr. Huang did not play a minor role, he was not the main leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel O'Brien does not suspect Huang of  
involvement in espionage. However, the government left open the 
possibility that he could be called as a witness in espionage 
probes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the chairman of the House Committee on  
Government Reform, last month pressed U.S. Attorney General Janet 
Reno to seek postponement of sentencing for both Huang and 
fund-raiser Charlie Trie because they had not testified before 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was granted a six-week delay to assess Trie's  
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie has pleaded guilty to two counts involving campaign finance  
violations and pledged to cooperate in the investigation. 
Prosecutors have recommended three years' probation.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Barricaded Homeowner Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man who barricaded himself on his 14-acre estate  
for nine months in a fight over whether he had to repay a $1.6 
million bank loan has been sentenced to four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sweeney, who was captured in February 1998 by six marshals  
after they broke a window to get in, was convicted of contempt of 
court in a nonjury trial in April. He had ignored a federal order 
to vacate his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sickened by the court and its actions,'' Sweeney said,  
vowing to appeal. ``Is it over? No way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say they own the estate because Sweeney and  
his wife, Rhetta, defaulted on their 1987 bank loan, which had been 
taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney, 59, was evicted but refused to leave the estate, which  
once belonged to his great-grandfather, a secretary of the Navy, 
postmaster general and ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also said the Sweeneys owed $1.4 million in taxes  
in addition to the loan payments; the Sweeneys said they had been 
swindled by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, anti-government militia members allied themselves  
with the Sweeneys and patrolled the estate, 20 miles outside 
Boston.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pushes for Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton set a goal today to reduce  
global warming over the next decade by increasing U.S. use of 
technology that converts plants and trees into fuel, chemicals and 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The president issued an executive order establishing a council  
to coordinate the federal government's effort to develop a biomass 
research program, and setting a goal of tripling use of bioenergy 
and bioproducts by 2010. Biomass energy, generated mostly from wood 
and wood waste, is currently about 3 percent of the total U.S. 
energy supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called bioenergy a possible ``technological fix that can  
help us to meet our economic challenges, maintain our security, 
sustain our prosperity and ease the threat of global warming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biomass technology uses trees, crops and waste from agriculture  
or forestry to make energy that can then be used as fuel for cars 
or power factories. It also can be used to create a variety of 
chemicals and products ranging from pharmaceuticals to glue, paint 
or even textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate goal of Clinton's order is to replace coal, oil,  
natural gas and uranium with cleaner, renewable biomass energy. If 
the goal of tripling biomass use by 2010 is met, annual greenhouse 
gas emissions would drop by more than 100 million tons, the 
equivalent of taking 70 million automobiles off the nation's roads, 
the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting the goal also would generate $15 billion to $20 billion  
in income for farmers and rural areas, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit today to the Agriculture Department, Clinton  
appealed to Congress to approve $242 million in his fiscal 2000 
budget proposal for research and tax credits to promote energy 
efficiency, bioenergy and other clean energies. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive order directs the secretaries of agriculture and  
energy and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
to prepare a report within 120 days on options for increasing 
biomass energy use.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Cop Has Impeccable Timing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A police officer who was instructing bank  
employees on what to do when a robbery occurs had to interrupt his 
teaching when a man robbed a teller in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm talking with the assistant manager when a teller said, `Go  
get him, he just robbed us,''' said Officer Duane A. Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	When the suspect entered the Bank One office on Wednesday, he  
apparently didn't notice Ward in uniform, authorities said. The 
suspect gave a note to a teller and took an undisclosed amount of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, 30, tackled the man in a motel parking lot 50 yards from  
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just wanting to catch him. I didn't know who he was,''  
said Ward. ``Money was flying out of his bag like it was a 
Christmas giveaway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified as Ricky Lynn Caudill, 43. Police  
have charged Caudill, a homeless man, with one count of robbery for 
the bank holdup and one count of aggravated robbery for trying to 
take the officer's gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has linked Caudill to 13 other bank robberies.

<HEADLINE> American, Pilots To Continue Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and the leaders of  
its pilots union will return to the bargaining table early next 
week to try to settle an issue that led to a pilots' sickout 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have been arguing for months over how American  
should absorb lower-paid pilots from Reno Air, which American's 
parent company bought in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Baker, American's executive vice president of operations,  
said Wednesday that American has agreed to a request by mediator 
George Nicolau to meet next week with representatives of the Allied 
Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker repeated that the airline will go ahead with the  
completion of the merger on Aug. 31 even if there is no deal with 
the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Union spokesman Gregg Overman said leaders are hopeful they can  
reach a deal on Monday. The union's board has scheduled a meeting 
Tuesday, during which it could vote to ratify any agreement that 
had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9,500-member union opposes American's use of about 300 Reno  
pilots who are paid roughly half what American pilots make. The 
union has demanded that Reno pilots' pay be raised to American's 
levels retroactive to December and that about 1,900 American pilots 
be promoted into higher-paying jobs over the next 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
	American has said the union's demands would greatly increase the  
cost of the Reno acquisition, and it prefers to raise the new 
pilots' pay as they are retrained to fly American jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse led to a sickout by about a quarter of American's  
pilots in February. The airline said about 6,700 flights were 
canceled, costing it $225 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicolau, the mediator, gave both sides a proposal to settle the  
dispute last month. American approved the proposal, but the union's 
directors made several changes that American rejected.

<HEADLINE> Oolong To Test Colts in Zweig Trot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hambletonian Oaks winner Oolong will test  
the colts in Sunday afternoon's $212,075 Dr. Harry M. Zweig 
Memorial Trot at the Syracuse Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25th edition of the Zweig, for 3-year-old trotters, was  
split into two divisions with 13 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Oolong drew post position No. 4 in the second division, worth  
$112,000. Trainer Per Henriksen will drive the daughter of 1988 
Zweig winner Armbro Goal, who has earned nearly $350,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first stakes test vs. the boys for Oolong, who  
has won her last two starts and five of six. 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy Lavec, third in last weekend's $1 million Hambletonian,  
heads the first Zweig split, carrying a $109,075 purse. The son of 
Pine Chip has made in excess of $180,000 in 1999, winning twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Ouellette drives from post No. 3 for trainer Jimmy Takter.  
</P>
<P>
	CR Commando, last season's 2-year-old champ, starts right  
outside Enjoy Lavec in post No. 4 with trainer/driver Carl Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's closing-day Syracuse program also features the $52,000  
Zweig Filly Trot as well as the $64,350 New York Sire Stakes for 
3-year-old pacing colts and geldings.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Sign Top Draft Choice King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks signed first-round  
draft choice Lamar King and unrestricted free agent wide receiver 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	King, a 6-foot-3, 294-pound defensive lineman from Saginaw  
(Mich.) Valley State, was the 22nd player selected in April's 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-4, 195-pound Jackson has played in the NFL for eight  
seasons -- five with the Cleveland Browns and three with the 
Baltimore Ravens. He had 38 receptions for 477 yards and no 
touchdowns with the Ravens last season. 
</P>
<P>
	King reportedly agreed to a five-year contract for $5.075  
million, with a $3.6 million signing bonus. He wanted a four-year 
deal, but went for a longer contract because he got a larger 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	King and Jackson began practicing with the Seahawks this  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks will open their exhibition season against Buffalo

Holmgren said it was unlikely that King would play against the 
Bills.

<HEADLINE> Reno Pleads for Tolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today deplored  
``our culture of violence'' and called on the country to act now to 
combat racial intolerance, bigotry and gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno told her weekly news conference that, although the  
investigation is still under way, the shootings at a Jewish 
community center in Los Angeles this week ``appear to have been 
motivated by hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A suspect, Buford O. Furrow Jr., 37, told investigators as he  
surrendered that ``he wanted this to be a wake-up call to America 
to kill Jews,'' according to an FBI official, who requested 
anonymity. Furrow is charged with attempted murder of five people, 
including three boys, who were shot and wounded at the Jewish 
center, and with the murder of an Hispanic postal carrier nearby 
soon afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes represent an attack not just on individual  
victims,'' Reno said, ``but also on the victims' communities. They 
tear at the very fabric of a people's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called for a response from schools, religious institutions,  
civic organizations and ``each one of us as individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must decide now, as a nation, whether we are going to allow  
our culture of violence to continue on into the next millennium, or 
whether we are going to start into the new era with a commitment to 
tolerance and to peaceful resolution of our disputes,'' Reno said. 
``We must act now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to teach our children tolerance, and make sure  
that they learn to accept people regardless of their race, 
religion, nationality or sexual orientation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called on Congress to enact the administration's proposal to  
expand federal authority to prosecute hate crimes and its gun 
control measures ``to keep dangerous firearms out of the hands of 
criminals, children and others who should not have them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow also was charged Wednesday with the federal crime of  
illegal possession of a gun, based on his earlier felony conviction 
in Washington state. Federal law bars felons from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``For four months since the tragedy in Littleton, Colo., the  
administration and Congress have debated over how to reform our gun 
laws,'' Reno said, citing the deadly attack by two well-armed 
students on a Colorado high school. ``Yet we have not been able to 
pass gun safety measures that even most gun owners support. ... And 
anyone can still walk into a gun show and buy a high-powered, 
dangerous weapon without even having to establish their identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called for passage of the Senate version of a juvenile  
justice bill when Congress returns next month. The Senate bill 
contains administration-backed provisions to extend background 
checks to gun buyers at gun shows and adds violent juveniles to 
those banned for life from owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also has proposed a three-day cooling-off  
period before a gun can be purchased, that every gun be sold with a 
triggerlock and criminal penalties for adults who let children get 
hold of guns and use them for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	And Reno renewed her appeal for serious study by states and the  
federal government of ``the possibility of requiring the licensing 
of all handguns'' so that prospective owners who have to 
demonstrate they ``know how to safely and lawfully use them.'' The 
administration has not formally backed such a proposal though 
President Clinton has spoken favorably about licensing.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Prices Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grains and soybeans futures prices plummeted in  
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade on bearish crop 
production reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants hoping for a late rally were disappointed  
when the Board of Trade closed an hour early Thursday after a power 
outage affecting the downtown Loop area threatened to expand. The 
Board of Trade said Project A electronic trading in all markets 
would be shut down Thursday night and reopen at 9 a.m. EDT Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price drop was in reaction to a surprising crop production  
report from the U.S. Agriculture Department. USDA estimated the 
1999-00 corn crop at 9.56 billion bushels, far above the average 
trade guess. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA supply/demand report showed a lower-than-expected cut  
to U.S. soybean production. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficial overnight rains in the Midwest that were expected to  
last until Friday also weighed on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report was definitely bigger than the trade was looking  
for,'' Don Roose of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. said of the 
production figures. ``You got hit with two things today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices were lower in sympathy with corn and soybeans,  
despite some bullish production news. 
</P>
<P>
	CBOT chief executive officer Thomas R. Donovan made the decision  
to close the markets at 2 p.m. EDT after speaking to Commonwealth 
Edison CEO John Rowe, said CBOT spokesman Bret Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Donovan wanted to ensure an orderly shut down, avoiding  
the potential chaos if power failed with as many as 5,000 traders 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disruption of trading,'' Gallaway said.  
``The last minutes of trading are often some of the busiest trading 
of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were blamed on the failures of two power  
transmission cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 8 1/2 cents to $2.80 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 12 cents to $2.23 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
2 1/2 cents to $1.16 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 30 cents to 
$4.56 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were lower and feeder cattle futures higher  
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mostly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .22 cent to 65.50 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .28 cent to 77.40 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .08 cent to 54.45 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .93 cent to 56.82 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Still in Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter remained in  
critical condition after regaining consciousness three days after 
hitting his head on concrete steps at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, who pitched in the majors 15 years and earned five  
World Series rings, was conscious, alert and responding to doctors' 
commands today, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Hertford, the tight-knit Perquimans County  
community where Hunter lives, anxiously awaited word on changes in 
his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing you learn about this place, this area, is how much  
baseball means around here,'' said Steve Lane, who owns an Internet 
service and who moved to Hertford from Providence, R.I. ``People 
here look at him and think of how much he's meant to this 
community, and it's like everyone wants to change places with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Hunter, diagnosed last year with Lou Gehrig's  
disease -- a gradual, irreversible deterioration of the muscles -- 
suffered brain bruising. He likely will require rehabilitation 
because he already was weakened by the disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would be premature to even think about that,'' said Dr.  
Paul Cunningham, a trauma physician and professor of surgery at the 
East Carolina University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``His prognosis is still somewhat guarded. We're being hopeful  
as we can be, but we're taking things one day at a time,'' said 
Cunningham. He said no surgery was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman Doug Boyd said Hunter regained consciousness  
Wednesday after being unconscious much of Tuesday. He began 
responding to commands -- ``wiggle your toes and that sort of 
thing,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Hunter and other relatives, gathered in the hospital ICU,  
declined to talk to the media. ``The family is very private right 
now,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter left Hertford to play for the Kansas City Athletics in  
1965 and moved with the club to Oakland in 1968. He became the 
first multimillionaire baseball player when he signed with the 
Yankees in 1974. Beginning in 1971, Hunter strung together five 
straight, 20-victory seasons and won the Cy Young Award in 1974. He 
retired from the Yankees in 1979 and returned to Hertford, where he 
easily returned to life on his 400-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``To show you what kind of guy he was and always has been, I  
remember in 1976, I was in high school and it was the year of the 
baseball strike,'' said Russell Lassiter, owner of Carolina Trophy 
&AMP; Engraving. ``Jimmy stayed here and came out and pitched batting 
practice for us. Here was the guy who was the best in the business 
out pitching baseball practice to a bunch of high school kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it was just like he was one of us.''  
</P>
<P>
	A diabetic who required thrice-daily insulin injections, Hunter  
announced last fall he had ALS, a neurological disease that 
interferes with signals the brain sends to muscles, causing the 
muscles to degenerate over time. There is no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	ALS has robbed Hunter of use of his right arm and diminished his  
upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter fell Sunday while climbing steps to his home after saying  
goodbye to a friend. He was taken first to an Edenton hospital, 
then transferred early Monday to the Greenville hospital, which 
serves the East Carolina medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some bad knocks before, but this is the worst,'' said  
Tommy Harrell, who lives next door to the Hunters. ``The only thing 
people can do right now is pray for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Keith Vaughan, minister of The Hertford Baptist Church,  
said the church received calls from people in several states who 
said they were praying for the former pitching great. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Helen asked for prayers, that was a very sincere  
request,'' Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hunter issued a statement Wednesday expressing gratitude  
for Hunter's friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outpouring of love and support for us and for Jimmy is a  
tremendous encouragement to us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have asked what they can do. The greatest thing  
you can do for us at this time is to pray for Jimmy and all the 
thousands who suffer from ALS.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Turn Mixed / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with the blue-chips  
making the most aggressive push to extend Wednesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 23.12 at 10,810.92, adding to Wednesday's 132.65-point gain. The 
Dow rose as much as 62 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.45 at 1,304.38, and the  
Nasdaq composite index was down 4.56 at 2,560.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about higher interest rates, which have held the market  
down for nearly three weeks, continued to rattle investors today. 
The latest evidence that the Federal Reserve may raise rates in an 
effort to stave off inflation came from a stronger-than-expected 
report on retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose 0.7  
percent in July, boosted by a big gain in automotive sales. Strong 
consumer spending could suggest to the Fed that the booming economy 
is overheating, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But without automobiles and seasonal goods like air  
conditioners, the retail sales increase was quite modest, noted 
Robert G. Smith, chief executive officer of Smith Affiliated 
Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really kind of a bland number,'' he said. ``But there's  
a lot of anxiety right now about every new domestic economic 
indicator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe the Fed will be more interested in the  
producer price index, due for release on Friday. That index is a 
measure of inflation pressures at the wholesale level, or before 
reaching consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar rose 2 5/8 to 61 7/8, helping buoy the Dow after Goldman  
Sachs added the company to its list of recommended stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online extended its gains from the previous session,  
rising 15/16 to 93 5/16. AOL shares rose 7 3/8 on Wednesday after 
company executives held an upbeat conference call with analysts and 
major investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 231.84 million shares 
at late morning, behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.12 at 612.34, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.77 at 779.14.

<HEADLINE> Kelly: PGA Alternate Now 3 Behind  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Jerry Kelly gave his cellular phone number  
to the starter on the first tee and told him to call if he was 
needed. Then he went off to watch a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner had the opening credits of ``The Jackal'' started to  
roll when the phone rang. Kelly had gone from first alternate in 
the 81st PGA Championship to a starter. A few hours later, he was 
near the top of the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that you would have known what was coming on the first tee.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get in the fairway and when I didn't, it was like,  
`OK, game on,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly fired a 3-under 69 in Thursday's first round, leaving him  
three strokes behind leader Sergio Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit a lot of greens. I had a lot of chances,'' he said. ``It  
wasn't a surprising 69. It was solid all around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is Kelly's fourth year on the PGA Tour, but his first time  
as an alternate. He thought there was a good chance he'd play, but 
when no one dropped out Monday, he started to wonder. And when 
everyone showed up for registration Tuesday, he started making 
alternate plans for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone told him Wednesday night that Frankie Minoza had a bad  
knee and hadn't picked up a club all week. Not a good sign for 
Minoza, but still, no word. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly woke up at 5 a.m. Thursday and got to Medinah Country Club  
an hour later. He warmed up, putting a little and hitting about 15 
balls. Then he wandered over to the No. 1 tee to watch the first 
couple groups go off. 
</P>
<P>
	When he saw that everyone appeared to be there, he gave the  
starter his number and figured he'd be on the road to his home in 
Madison, Wis., by midafternoon. His bag was already in the car, and 
he'd arranged to check out of his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be stuck with a hotel room and hang around,''  
he said. ``I'm only two hours away from Madison. If I don't get in, 
I'm driving straight up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, he wanted to play in the PGA. He played the last two  
years, but withdrew last year and didn't make the cut in 1997. But 
his son, Cooper, turns 1 on Saturday, so at least he'd be home for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	With a few more hours to kill, Kelly ate some breakfast and then  
headed for the workout trailer that doubles as a screening room. At 
8:15 a.m., the phone rang. Minoza had withdrawn and Kelly was due 
on the first tee in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad he didn't have the chance to play and I'm sure he  
feels bad, but I thank him,'' Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have time for his usual 70-minute practice session. He  
didn't have time for much of anything except to call his wife and 
grab his clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	That might have been the key.  
</P>
<P>
	``I usually put too much pressure on myself,'' he said. ``This  
had me just so excited to be on the first tee. I had nothing but 
good thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't spectacular on the first two holes, but he birdied  
Nos. 3, 8 and 14. As he walked up to the 18th green, the crowd 
greeted him with a huge cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Kelly said the day was great but not overwhelming.  
And he had at least one thing left on his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to go back down there and watch the rest of the  
movie now.''

<HEADLINE> Local Governments Hire More Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State and local governments are hiring more  
workers, the Census Bureau reports. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 14.5 million workers employed by local and state  
governments across the nation as of March, 1998, up from 14.2 
million a year earlier, according to tabulations for the 50 states 
and the District of Columbia released Wednesday by the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	That included 10.5 million people working for local governments  
and 3.9 million for state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The boost in workers raised payrolls for March 1998 to $43  
billion, up from $39 billion a year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment figures are given for full-time equivalent workers,  
that is combining full and part time employees and calculating the 
number of full-time jobs done. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, education was the largest area for state and local  
government workers with 5.7 million elementary and secondary school 
workers, up from 5.5 million, and 1.7 million higher education 
employees, up from 1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 941,280 people employed in state and local hospitals,  
down from 984,375 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Police accounted for 817,941 employees in 1998, up from 798,424  
while fire protection accounted for 281,922, up from 277,152 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial administration kept 363,049 state and local employees  
busy in 1998, up from 360,724 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And there were 530,097 street and highway workers last year,  
down from 530,577 a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Study Probes Biological Clock Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genes that control the biological clock of  
fruit flies also affect whether those flies become addicted to 
cocaine, says a surprising new study that suggests these internal 
clocks -- humans have them, too -- might have still other 
undiscovered roles in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what the cocaine discovery might mean for human  
drug addiction, although scientists have used fruit flies as 
potential models to study the biology behind drug abuse. The hope 
is that the insect studies ultimately will point the way toward 
better drug treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Virginia researchers studied the ``sensitization''  
of fruit flies to cocaine, giving repeated doses to produce 
increasingly severe responses -- in flies, problems with flying. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers report Friday in the journal Science that genes  
that control fruit flies' internal circadian rhythms also 
determined whether they become sensitized to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that normal fruit flies do become sensitized, but  
flies that lacked any of four genes that play a role in the flies' 
biological clocks did not become sensitized, despite repeated 
cocaine dosings. 
</P>
<P>
	Those genes may regulate an enzyme that appears important in  
determining whether cocaine sensitization occurs, the researchers 
said.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Works Out at Falcons Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson took the field in his  
familiar 32 jersey Thursday afternoon, but it wasn't the same field 
taken by his Atlanta Falcons teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	While coach Dan Reeves led the Falcons in a hour-long  
walk-through session in preparation for their first exhibition game 
Friday night against Detroit, Anderson jogged and sprinted on a 
neighboring field the day after signing a five-year, $32 million 
contract and ending a two-week holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the two rode off together in a golf cart, clearly  
happy that Wednesday's four-hour negotiating session brought the 
NFL's No. 2 rusher to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson called Reeves his ``captain, oh my captain'' and ``el  
presidente.'' Reeves insisted there was only one president on the 
team, and it wasn't him. 
</P>
<P>
	He also challenged reporters to ``ask him (Jamal) a serious  
question and see if you get a serious answer.'' Anderson, who 
gained 1,846 yards last season, will not play in Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how long it will be before he's ready to play in  
a game situation,'' Reeves said. ``It might be next week (Aug. 20 
vs. Baltimore) or maybe the following week. Right now we need all 
the reps we can get for the younger players, so we'll let Jamal do 
a lot of conditioning work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson insisted that conditioning ``is nothing without the  
pads'' and then joked that ``I'm sure come Monday I'll probably 
pass out. I hope he (Reeves) doesn't kill me, but I'm anticipating 
the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons will go with regular starter Chris Chandler at  
quarterback against Detroit, then switch to newcomer Danny Kanell 
early on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's good in the first series, he might come out then,''  
Reeves said about Chandler, who was fourth in league passing 
ratings last season. ``Or he might go another series. But basically 
we'll be looking at Danny this week and Tony (Graziani) next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell, acquired during the offseason from the New York Giants,  
``has an extremely quick release, sees the field well, and is 
extremely smart,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he still has those years in another system that he has to  
forget. The key to any quarterback being successful is to be fully 
comfortable with the system he's in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said the big questions in Friday's game will be in the  
secondary and at wide receiver, where injuries have dogged the team 
during training camp. Reserve cornerbacks Michael Booker and Elijah 
Williams and first-team receiver Chris Calloway will not play, and 
wideout Tim Dwight is questionable after missing Thursday's 
walk-through. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is an opportunity for a lot of guys to perform. It's  
a good test,'' Reeves said. ``We'll get a chance to evaluate 
everyone. I hope we go out and execute well and start to be the 
type of team that we were last year.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Top Draft Pick James </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- Running back Edgerrin James, the  
surprise first-round pick of the Indianapolis Colts, ended a 21-day 
holdout Thursday when he signed a seven-year contract valued at $49 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Leigh Steinberg, announced the signing and the  
financial terms of the contract. James, who took a physical before 
signing, joined the Colts for their afternoon practice at 
Rose-Hulman Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Miami star was drafted fourth overall in April's  
draft, one pick ahead of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams. He 
missed 25 practices, a scrimmage and the Colts' opening exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to get it done. A lot of people talked about our  
reasoning. It's because he's the best football player,'' owner Jim 
Irsay said of the selection of James, who will team with last 
year's No. 1 pick, Peyton Manning, in the Indianapolis backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's going to fit with Peyton and those guys are  
going to be a lot like Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman,'' Irsay said. 
``That combination is something that we think is special. We were 
offered tremendous amounts for Peyton. We were offered tremendous 
amounts for Edgerrin in draft picks and that sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to keep them both because we think they're the  
impact players, they're part of the nucleus that's going to make us 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Mora said James would not play in Saturday's  
exhibition game with Cincinnati and would spend a lot of time 
studying with backfield coach Gene Huey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get him up to speed. He's a bright fellow and he's  
worked very hard in preparing himself,'' Polian said. ``He looks 
like he is in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract included a $9.5 million signing bonus and an  
additional $350,000 bonus for making the roster, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes $1.15 million in reporting bonuses over the  
life of the contract and four tiers of bonuses based on 
performance, Steinberg said. James would earn the first bonus by 
rushing for 701 yards this year. The final year of the contract 
will be voided if James reaches certain milestones within the first 
six years. They include playing in 35 percent of the offensive 
plays this upcoming season and 45 percent in future years. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' contract, by contrast, is heavily loaded with  
incentives based upon performance. His seven-year deal with an 
optional eighth year includes an $8.84 million signing bonus and 
will be worth between $11.1 million and $68.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in pretty condition. It's just a matter of getting into  
football shape with the pads on,'' said James, who has been 
spending much of the past month working on his conditioning in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing signals a dramatic change for James, who has spent  
summers harvesting watermelons to raise money for his family, which 
got by with the aid of food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	After he became the fourth overall pick in the draft, James  
remarked, ``It's a big world out there and a lot of people don't 
know about being poor. Growing up, I was one of those that knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James passed up his senior year of college eligibility at Miami  
to help his 2-year-old daughter and his mother, a cafeteria worker 
at Immokalee High School who raised six sons on her own and never 
earned more than $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good feeling,'' he said about being financially  
secure. ``It's better for my mom. I'm happy for my mom, she's not 
working right now. I'll give her the opportunity to fill her dreams 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James did participate in the team's minicamp and voluntary  
summer camp and workouts. However, he was not able to report to 
training camp until he was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-year starter at Miami, James finished his career as the  
school's No. 2 career rusher with 2,960 yards while making only 17 
starts. He tied the Miami school record of 35 touchdowns, 32 by 
rushing and 3 on pass receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	James' signing leaves three first-rounders who have not agreed  
to terms. Heading the list is Cincinnati quarterback Akili Smith, 
the third overall selection.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Tries Again To Enter U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan started a new drive Thursday to  
rejoin the United Nations, an effort that could escalate tensions 
between the island and an already angry China. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid for U.N. membership has become an annual ritual, but  
this year's plea by Taiwan was fine-tuned to reflect President Lee 
Teng-hui's recent declaration that the island is its own state. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest effort was likely to provoke a hostile reaction from  
China, which has threatened to reunite Taiwan with the Chinese 
mainland through force. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Taiwanese said they held little hope that this time  
they will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Foreign Minister David Lee told reporters the bid will  
probably be crushed by China, which has resolutely objected to the 
island's participation in the United Nations. China considers 
Taiwan a renegade province. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen of Taiwan's diplomatic allies -- most of them small, poor  
nations in Africa, Latin America and the South Pacific -- filed a 
draft resolution with the U.N. secretariat on Wednesday asking that 
Taiwan's lack of representation be discussed by the General 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan has long sought recognition as a state, but President Lee  
made the call more explicit by announcing July 9 that Taiwan's 
relations with China should be designated as ``state-to-state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's statement discarded earlier, more ambiguous  
language about Taiwan's relations with China, from which Taiwan 
separated 50 years ago after a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing has lashed back furiously at what it characterizes as a  
dangerous step toward a formal declaration of independence -- a 
declaration China says would lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has called for both sides to calm down. The United  
States does not recognize Taiwan, but it is bound by law to treat 
the island's security as a matter of concern. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether Washington would help fight off a Chinese  
attack, though the United States has moved warships into the area 
during previous standoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan would like to see China take a ``rational'' approach to  
Taiwan's quest for representation in the world body, but wasn't 
holding its breath, David Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone is very clear that this endeavor, I'm afraid,  
won't achieve any immediate results, but we've always felt that no 
one can predict international change,'' the deputy foreign minister 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan walked out of the United Nations in 1971, just before  
other members voted to give its old seat to the People's Republic 
of China. By seeking to rejoin, Taiwan is only demanding its rights 
and doesn't want to ``pick a fight,'' David Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	An explanatory memorandum accompanying President Lee's  
resolution to the U.N. points out Taiwan's efforts at international 
humanitarian relief, saying it has sent 10,000 experts overseas 
through the years to help countries in trouble, while providing 
$150 million in disaster aid over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	It also referred to a $300 million aid package promised to  
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Williams, Collins Debut Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- At first glance, the matchup between Ricky Williams  
and Cecil ``the Diesel'' Collins hardly looks even. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams rushed for an NCAA-record 6,279 yards and 72 touchdowns  
before winning the Heisman Trophy. Collins rushed for 713 yards and 
four touchdowns before going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rookie running backs will share the spotlight in their  
NFL debuts Friday night when the New Orleans Saints face the Miami 
Dolphins in a preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the fifth player taken in the April draft, is expected  
to rejuvenate a Saints franchise that hasn't been to the playoffs 
in seven years. Collins, the 134th player drafted, is the latest 
candidate to rejuvenate the Dolphins' perennially moribund ground 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Both will see limited action in the exhibition opener. Williams  
will play no more than 1 1/2 quarters, Collins perhaps even less. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to finally get out there in a stadium and get my  
first NFL experience,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Collins, who has shown so far in training camp that  
the Dolphins gambled wisely when they drafted him in the fifth 
round. He slipped that far only because drug and legal problems 
limited him to six games in college at Louisiana State and McNeese 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've proved a lot since day one,'' Collins said.  
``It's been a long road for me. The more repetitions I get, the 
more comfortable I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins fans are so desperate for a productive running back  
that they're still buzzing about Collins' performance in a 
scrimmage last week, when he rushed for a grand total of 22 yards 
in four carries. Coach Jimmy Johnson's comments have fueled the 
hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good back. He doesn't give you a whole to tackle -- just  
shoulder pads, knees and elbows,'' Johnson said. ``He tends to put 
a smile on a lot of people's faces, other than the opponents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has also received rave reviews from teammates and  
Saints coach Mike Ditka, who traded all of his draft choices for 
the chance to pick Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I watch him, the more I'm amazed,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he stays healthy, there's no doubt in my mind he may be one  
of the best running backs ever to play the game,'' quarterback 
Billy Joe Hobert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints owner Tom Benson has said he expects the Saints to make  
the playoffs, a lofty goal for a franchise with just four 
postseason games in their history -- all losses. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the draft, Johnson poked fun at Ditka for the  
trade that netted Williams. But this week, Johnson admitted he 
might swap an entire draft for one player under the right 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were desperate for a quarterback, yes, I'd trade a draft  
for a quarterback,'' Johnson said. ``I would have traded a draft 
for Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I would have paid an entire draft for Emmitt Smith --  
maybe. Emmitt has turned into a Hall of Fame player, but I don't 
know that I knew that back when I drafted him. There are key 
players you would probably pay a draft for, but very few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would Johnson trade the players he drafted this year for  
Williams? That question may be easier to answer after watching 
Williams and Collins play Friday.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Trade Hawkins, Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls finally made their long-awaited  
first move of the offseason Thursday, sending Brent Barry to the 
Seattle SuperSonics for guards James Cotton and Hersey Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a somewhat curious move on the part of the Bulls, who  
signed Barry to a six-year, $27 million contract last January as 
one of the first pieces of their rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brent did a fine job for us, but we felt we needed a veteran  
like Hersey to work with our younger guys,'' general manager Jerry 
Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry, 6-foot-6 and 27 years old, averaged 11.1 points, 3.9  
rebounds and 3.1 assists in 37 games last season. He is the second 
shooting guard picked up by the Sonics in recent days, joining free 
agent acquisition Vernon Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle remains in the market for a small forward to replace the  
departed Detlef Schrempf, who signed with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to trade Hersey we needed to receive someone very  
special in return,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We think 
Brent's athleticism, versatility and youth will fit perfectly with 
the new direction of our team. We hate to see Hersey and James go, 
but this opportunity was too good to pass up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, 32, is an 11-year veteran who had been with the Sonics  
for four seasons. He lost his starting spot last season and had 
career-low averages of 10.3 points and 2.5 assists. It was no 
secret in recent weeks that the Sonics were trying to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton, 23, played just 10 games last season because of a  
strained hamstring and averaged 2.5 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen a whole lot of him, but we've liked what we  
have seen,'' Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins, a Chicago native who attended Bradley Univerity in  
Peoria, Ill. and led the nation in scoring his senior season, has 
two years remaining on a contract that will pay him nearly $4.2 
million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls still have as much as $18 million in salary cap room,  
although Krause seems determined to save much of it for next summer 
when Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Latrell Sprewell are among the 
possible free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago was rebuffed in its attempt to sign Portland free agent  
Jermaine O'Neal, and Krause said there are few, if any, players 
left on the market who fit his team's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously what we're doing, it's a situation where we'll be  
looking to do things down the road,'' Krause said. ``We had 
interest and talked to a few players, and we're still talking. But 
we feel that with the way our club is developing, there aren't many 
players we feel like committing to long-term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry was Chicago's third-leading scorer last season behind Toni  
Kukoc and Ron Harper. Kukoc is entering the final year of his 
contract, while Harper is a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect Had Neo-Nazi Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NISQUALLY, Wash. (AP) -- It's becoming a distressingly familiar  
profile: a low-profile racist with a nasty temper. 
</P>
<P>
	People in this rural area outside Olympia where Buford O'Neal  
Furrow Jr. grew up describe a bespectacled, overweight kid who was 
teased about his allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't somebody that stood out. He was somebody who nobody  
knew,'' said former junior high schoolmate Loni Merrill. He is 
known to friends and family as Neal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers show Furrow's parents and others were worried last  
year about his mental condition and pushed for treatment, futilely 
as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow turned himself in to the FBI in Las Vegas on Wednesday,  
saying he had ``killed the kids in Los Angeles.'' None of those 
shot Tuesday at the Jewish community center died, but postal worker 
Joseph Ileto, 39, was killed about an hour later. Furrow, 37, is 
charged with his murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the overweight kid grew up to become an  
overwrought adult who once predicted a deadly outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel like I could just lose it and kill people,''  
Furrow was quoted in charging papers last year from the King County 
prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, he had tried to commit himself to a private  
psychiatric hospital east of Seattle where he told staff ``he was 
thinking about suicide and shooting people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged Nov. 2 with assault, accused of attacking a nurse  
at the hospital with a knife. Deputies found a 9 mm handgun and 
ammunition and four knives in his vehicle. He pleaded guilty and 
served about five months before his release May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after that incident, a King County deputy prosecutor pushed  
for incarceration and treatment, saying Furrow posed a ``grave risk 
of danger to himself and society should he be released,'' court 
records show. And a jail psychologist urged deputies to quickly 
file charges so he would have ``time to prepare civil commitment 
papers'' for Furrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow posted a $15,000 bond before prosecutors filed charges  
and was released from jail on Oct. 30, before any civil commitment 
proceeding could take place. 
</P>
<P>
	But his parents told a bail bondsman, Troy Hanson, they ``didn't  
feel fit to have him released to the street,'' Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode followed the breakup of a long relationship Furrow  
had with Debbie Mathews. She was the widow of Robert Mathews, who 
founded the neo-Nazi group the Order, a violent offshoot of the 
Idaho-based Aryan Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow had settled with her in Metaline Falls, a timber town of  
230 people on the other side of the state near the Canadian and 
Idaho borders. The area of rural northeast Washington and the Idaho 
panhandle is haunted with racist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't make much of an impression, though neighbors were  
aware of his racist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good neighbors, but, well, I got blue eyes, so I  
guess that helps,'' rancher Meda VanDyke told The Seattle Times. 
``I never saw any of his violent side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow apparently had addresses in Rosamond, Calif., near Los  
Angeles, in 1993 and 1994, but locals say he lived in Metaline 
Falls for several years with Ms. Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
	Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler said he believes he married  
Furrow and Ms. Mathews around 1996, though the union was not 
recorded with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Wednesday from his Hayden Lake, Idaho,  
compound, Butler said Furrow may have attended services at his 
Church of Jesus Christ Christian-Aryan Nations a few times several 
years ago, but he did not know him well. Furrow may also have 
served as a security guard during the group's Aryan World Congress 
gatherings in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what might have motivated Tuesday's shootings, Butler  
replied: ``The war against the white race. There's a war of 
extermination against the white male.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the phone at the number listed for Debbie  
Mathews hung up Wednesday. ``I don't speak to reporters,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Reynolds works with the Southern Poverty Law Center in  
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate groups and has a file on 
Furrow. He said Furrow's actions are consistent with the beliefs of 
the so-called Phineas Priesthood, which is opposed to interracial 
marriage and the charging of interest by banks. 
</P>
<P>
	That loose-knit group also has been linked to 1996 Spokane-area  
bombings and bank robberies, and to recent attacks on synagogues in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Aryan Nations member Floyd Cochran said he met Furrow at  
the group's northern Idaho compound in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had basic conversations about Jews running the world,''  
Cochran said from his home in Moshannon, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow ``was not any more violent than other people there,''  
said Cochran, who now lectures against hate groups. ``He had a 
fascination with guns, but at the Aryan Nations if you didn't have 
a fascination with guns you might get shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Furrow also ``was fascinated with where did the money  
from the Order go,'' which ``might explain his fascination with 
Debbie Mathews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Robert Mathews, was killed in 1984 when his hideout  
caught fire during a shootout with federal agents on Whidbey Island 
in Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	After his death, 22 Order members were jailed on racketeering  
charges, accused in the 1984 murder of Jewish radio talk-show host 
Alan Berg in Denver and of robberies that netted more than $4 
million -- one-third of which was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochran said Furrow also dated Jeannie Yarbrough, whose husband  
was among those imprisoned, and that he'd heard Furrow used to dig 
in Yarbrough's yard, apparently looking for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow left the area last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Ms. Mathews) dumped him a year or so ago, and I  
haven't seen him since,'' the Metaline Falls town marshal, Rick 
Reiber, told The Spokesman-Review newspaper of Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow returned to the west side of the state, for a time living  
in a trailer near Lynnwood north of Seattle, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his clash at the hospital. After his release from  
jail, he headed south to his parents' home near Olympia. The house 
here -- visited by the FBI and staked out by reporters -- is tucked 
into lush woods, out of sight at the end of a long private drive. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Buford Sr., retired from the Air Force in 1977 and  
subsequently worked for the military as a civilian. Furrow tried to 
follow his father into the military after graduating from high 
school. But a knee injury kept him from completing boot camp, said 
Army spokeswoman Verna Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a loner, a kind of bookish guy -- what they'd call a  
nerd these days. But he was always nice to me,'' said Ms. Merrill, 
a classmate of Furrow's at Nisqually Junior High.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Odom Signs With Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lamar Odom, the fourth selection in the NBA  
draft, signed a three-year, $7.8 million contract with the Los 
Angeles Clippers on Thursday, and immediately spoke of helping turn 
the perennial losers into winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm officially in the NBA -- my lifetime dream,'' said Odom,  
who averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game for 
Rhode Island last year in his only season of college basketball. 
``This is the opportunity of a lifetime for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sky's the limit for this team. I think it's time  
for Los Angeles to have two great teams; hopefully, I can bring 
something special to this city, this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 Odom will be paid $2.4 million during the upcoming  
season, $2.6 million in 2000-2001 and $2.8 million in 2001-2002. 
The Clippers hold a club option for $3.5 million in 2002-2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a rookie who hasn't proven himself yet. I've got to work  
on every aspect of my game,'' Odom said. ``On Monday, I'm going to 
get right in the gym, starting my campaign for rookie of the 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About having such a high goal, Odom said, ``If every rookie  
isn't talking like that, then something's wrong. Maybe I might not 
end up as rookie of the year, maybe I'll end up as one of the best 
seventh men in the league, I don't know. There's something I'm 
going to bring this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, who turns 20 on Nov. 6, admits he's had ups and downs. He  
attended three high schools during his senior year, began his 
college career at UNLV but didn't play, and wound up leaving Rhode 
Island after one season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, he changed his mind twice, first declaring himself  
eligible for the draft, then changing his mind, and finally 
changing his mind yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks leading up to the draft, many felt he'd be the  
first overall selection. However, he fell to fourth, much to the 
delight of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has doubts,'' Odom said in the team's offices at the  
Los Angeles Sports Arena, not far from the Staples Center, where 
the Clippers and Lakers will play this season. ``People go through 
adversity to reach the mountaintop, to look down at the doubters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've been through a lot. I have a great organization  
around me. When I come in, I see smiles, hugs, handshakes. I get a 
great feeling from everyone here. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls weren't always the best team in the NBA. I'm not  
saying I'm Michael Jordan; it's got to start somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odom figures to play small forward for the Clippers, perhaps  
teaming on a front line with third-year forward Maurice Taylor and 
second-year center Michael Olowokandi, the first overall selection 
in last summer's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very likeable person,'' Clippers vice president of  
basketball operations Elgin Baylor said. ``What I visualize him 
doing is making other players better because of his ability to pass 
the basketball, create for the other people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about having a player like that, who has such a  
great feel, such a great understanding for the game. He certainly 
has the potential to be one of the better players in the league.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Push Hard for Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Straw poll fever has Iowa in its grip.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes has bought up last-minute television ads, George  
Bush is searching out ``team leaders,'' and Lamar Alexander has 
campaigned in virtually every corner of Iowa in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll on Saturday night is being portrayed as a turning  
point in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination -- and 
the candidates are responding in kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see every campaign putting every ounce of campaign energy  
into this,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican rivals have built substantial  
organizational efforts for the straw poll. Only Arizona Sen. John 
McCain is absent, calling the straw poll a ``scam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve a campaign based on ideas and issues not the  
financial arms race that the straw poll has become,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a cheap deal. Bush admits to spending $750,000, and  
accuses Forbes of spending $2 million. Alexander admits only to 
``low six-figure'' spending, but his campaign has focused almost 
exclusively on the straw poll all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander has worked his way through a brutal, 21-day grind that  
took him to every corner of the state. The Forbes bus has been 
rumbling around the state for nearly two months, all pointing to 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not discussing budgets,'' said Forbes aide Bill Dal Col.  
``This is a test along the way to February. This is a check to see 
who can deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer has been working hard on a  
church-based network, working night and day to lure social 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit a wall about two days ago,'' said exhausted aide Marlys  
Popma. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for a live debate at WOI-TV studios the night before the  
GOP straw poll were canceled Thursday after just three candidates -- 
Alexander, commentator Pat Buchanan and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah -- 
agreed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has bought a half-hour of television time Friday evening  
to air a campaign commercial featuring prominent social 
conservatives, a group he's worked overtime to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has been running phone banks, both from campaign  
headquarters in Des Moines and from his campaign bus, leaving 
nothing to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the work is pure drudgery, the kind of  
nuts-and-bolts work that goes on in campaign boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had 20 phones working for the last two weeks, from nine  
in the morning until nine at night,'' said Monte Shaw, an aide to 
former cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. ``We're doing it the 
old-fashioned Iowa way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's technique is to find ``ticket captains,'' valued backers  
who volunteer to show up at the straw poll and bring along 10 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets are $25 apiece, largely provided by the campaigns.  
People have to be from Iowa and they get one vote each. The 
Republican Party has not said how many they've sold, but say the 
tickets are still selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is running a low-budget operation, but his campaign  
office is filled every night with volunteers making phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bush, the phone banks are searching for ``team leaders,''  
folks who agree to bring along nine others to the straw poll and 
collect a special reward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team leaders get their picture taken with the governor,'' said  
Bush spokesman Eric Woolson. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all of the Republican contenders were buzzing around  
the state Thursday, most focusing on the just-opened Iowa State 
Fair. Bauer headed to a cattle exhibit, while former Vice President 
Dan Quayle sought support at a pork exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the logistical headache of getting supporters to  
Ames for the straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've leased approximately 100 buses,'' said Woolson. ``Our  
strategy has been more of an organizational strategy as opposed to 
those campaigns that are spending money on television and radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion in Iowa has been difficult to gauge. One poll  
taken for several television stations of likely caucus attendees 
showed Bush with almost a 3-1 lead over Forbes and another taken by 
a Maryland firm called Research 2000 showed Bush and Forbes in a 
dead heat. The other candidates were grouped together behind Bush 
and Forbes in both polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters say polling for Iowa's political events is tough  
because it is hard to identify the population that will show up for 
the caucus and the straw poll.

<HEADLINE> Barry Sanders Spotted in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- There's been a Barry Sanders sighting in  
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press reported today that Barry Sanders was  
spotted at Detroit Metropolitan Airport shortly after 8 p.m. 
Wednesday getting off a Delta flight from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recently retired running back's father, William Sanders,  
said he hasn't heard from his son yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to call him,'' he told the newspaper, ``because  
he knows I want to talk to him. He's probably going to call me. I'm 
just going to play it by ear. I know he's back now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams Sanders and a friend, Allen Hughes, who happens to be  
in the Detroit Lions' front office as director of security, spent a 
couple of days together in Wichita where the elder Sanders now 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	And, every once in a while, the two men even talked about Barry  
Sanders, who quit the Lions and football, and went to Europe for a 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hughes, who has been a guest in the family home since  
Monday, said he never pressured the elder Sanders to try to get his 
son to come back to the team. He did not have to -- Sanders had 
already promised his friend even before the visit that he would do 
anything he could to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes told The Associated Press he came to visit in response to  
a long-standing invitation -- and not at the urging of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he did not even tell anyone he was coming, except  
for one coach who he told so he wouldn't be considered absent 
without leave. He said he decided to take a few days off during 
training camp and planned to stay in Wichita another day or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not been instructed as far as I know by anybody here,''  
Schmidt told the Free Press. ``It was a matter of him letting 
people know Mr. Sanders wanted him to come out, and what's the 
harm? It just makes sense to do it. Jocko has a relationship with a 
lot of players and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lions publicist Bill Keenist said Wednesday that Hughes was  
visiting Sanders as a Lions official, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he advised his son not to quit three years  
ago when he was considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time he didn't ask me, he just quit,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said his son called to tell him about his decision to  
retire only so that he heard it directly from him rather than the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disenchanted with the direction the team was going. He  
was tired of losing,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders announced his retirement July 28, the day before  
the team reported to training camp at Saginaw Valley State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. When camp opened July 29, Sanders was in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders quit needing just 1,458 yards to break Walter  
Payton's career rushing record.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA Delays Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Computer retailer CompUSA Inc. said Thursday it  
will delay releasing fourth-quarter financial results by nearly two 
weeks while it completes work on a restructuring move. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the delay, from Aug. 18 until after financial  
markets close Aug. 30, will allow it to discuss the restructuring 
changes at the same time it releases earnings for the quarter ended 
June 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to delay its earnings report does not relate to its  
results of operations and is not an indication of a change in its 
previous statements regarding the quarter, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call estimate the company will post  
fourth quarter losses of 24 cents a share, compared with a loss of 
19 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	CompUSA operates 208 stores in 82 U.S. metropolitan areas. In  
late June, the company said it was working on a long list of 
strategic moves to redefine its business concept. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in June it will cut 1,000 to 1,500 jobs, or  
about 7 percent of its work force of 21,000 and plans to shift its 
focus from personal computer sales to consumer electronics. The 
shift to consumer electronics is in response to the decline in PC 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Some changes, such as the closing of four stores and a  
distribution center, have been announced. The company needs more 
time to finish work on the others before discussing them when it 
releases financial results, said spokeswoman Suzanne Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't predict how people are going to react'' to the delay,  
Ms. Shelton said. ``It's not related to the financial reporting.''

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Push Up July Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans snapped up cars and light trucks  
last month at a brisk clip that helped push overall retail sales up 
by a bigger-than-expected 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported Thursday that total retail  
sales, which represent about a third of the nation's economic 
output, rose last month to a seasonally adjusted $248.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were 9.1 percent higher than July of last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Christmas in July,'' said economist Richard Yamarone  
with Argus Research Corp. Record heat in many parts of the country 
drove people into air-conditioned showrooms and stores, where they 
made purchases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	New car and light trucks sales increased by 2.3 percent in July,  
compared with an 0.8 percent drop in June. The auto industry 
predicts record sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reasons cited by Paul Taylor, chief economist with the  
National Automobile Dealers Association, were strong demand for 
mid-sized luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles; manufacturers' 
rebates; and a strong economy that makes people feel comfortable 
about spending money. 
</P>
<P>
	William Mulholland, a 29-year-old information technology  
specialist from Virginia who bought a new Jeep Wrangler two weeks 
ago, said he did not get a ``great deal'' but could afford the 
convertible model he longed for. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists continue to believe the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates again on Aug. 24, to keep the economy from 
overheating and hold inflation under control. The Fed nudged 
interest rates a quarter of a point on June 30, the first rate 
increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said the retail sales report gives the Fed  
additional ammunition to justify a second increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continued solid consumer demand just adds to the belief that  
the Fed is going to raise rates again,'' said economist Joel Naroff 
of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	But others economists took heart in another number in the  
report: Excluding auto sales, retail sales rose just 0.3 percent in 
July, slightly less than many analysts' expectations of a 0.4 
percent rise, and a possible sign that overall retail sales may be 
moderating, said economist David Levy of the Levy Institute 
Forecasting Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have been worried about the prospects of  
another rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain in overall retail sales followed a revised 0.2 percent  
decline in June. Last month, the government estimated retail sales 
actually rose 0.1 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter of this year, consumer spending grew by 4  
percent, compared with 6.7 percent for January-March. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment near a three-decade low, growth in wages and  
benefits and a strong stock market, consumers are continuing to 
feel confident. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no stopping the urge to splurge among U.S.  
consumers,'' said First Union's chief economist David Orr. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last at least three  
years -- rose 1.6 percent in July, compared with a 0.9 percent drop 
in June. Sales at furniture stores remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, sales of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, went up  
0.2 percent in July, down from a 0.4 percent gain in June. At 
gasoline stations, sales rose 1.2 percent in July reflecting a jump 
in gas prices at the time. Gas sales fell by 0.5 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sales at general merchandise stores, the category  
that includes department stores, increased 1 percent in July, 
compared with a gain of 0.6 percent in June. Sales at food stores 
rose 0.1 percent in July, after having dropped the month before. 
But sales at grocery stores held steady for the second month in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	At apparel and accessory shops, sales fell 0.4 percent in July,  
matching the 0.4 percent drop in June. Sales at bar and restaurants 
also fell by 0.4 percent in July, following a 0.2 percent gain in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, most chain stores reported that their retail sales  
topped expectations in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the number  
of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose by 
4,000 to 284,000. But the four-week moving average, which smoothes 
out week-to-week volatility, fell to 288,250, its lowest point in 
over a decade. Economists consider any claims level below 300,000 
to be an indication of an extremely tight labor market.

<HEADLINE> CDC Unveils Anti-Tuberculosis Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In an effort to stamp out the last remnants of  
tuberculosis in the United States, federal health officials on 
Thursday unveiled a plan that calls for new methods of treating and 
preventing the sometimes deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Great strides have been made in lowering TB rates -- now at an  
all-time low of seven cases per 100,000 people -- but doctors are 
worried that drug-resistant strains of TB may be spreading. That, 
combined with complacency and global TB outbreaks, could cause a 
resurgence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're interested in seeing tuberculosis become a disease of  
the past but it's not yet,'' said Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, deputy 
director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB 
Prevention. ``We have to be mindful that the disease is still with 
us and in some parts of the country we are not seeing the national 
decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberculosis is an airborne disease spread only through  
prolonged, close-quarters contact. In most cases, it is easily 
cured. But if the disease goes undiagnosed or untreated, it can be 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, TB cases in the United States have decreased 31  
percent, reaching a record low of 18,361 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But between 1992 and 1997, the number of TB cases increased six  
percent among people born in another country. And drug-resistant 
strains were reported in 43 states and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The outline released Thursday by a federal advisory council to  
the CDC is similar to a strategic plan to eliminate TB released in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	A TB vaccine exists, but it has proven ineffective in adults.  
The report said a new vaccine is crucial, as are long-term sources 
of private and public money to support vaccine research. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifapentine, the first new anti-TB drug in 25 years, was just  
approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration. And few 
pharmaceutical companies are involved in TB drug development. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that strategies targeting high-risk groups --  
including people with HIV and prison inmates -- have been poorly 
applied and that treatment measures are often underused or 
inadequate. Among the underused methods of treatment cited was 
directly observed therapy, which many experts have called the best 
way to eradicate TB. 
</P>
<P>
	In directly observed therapy, health workers make sure patients  
take each dose of medicine during their months of treatment. 
Patients may be required to take medicine daily or several times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Lung Association puts the costs at fighting TB at  
more than $900 million. In a statement released Thursday, the group 
urged Congress to approve $320 million to support the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have inexpensive tests to diagnose tuberculosis. We have  
drugs to cure it. We have public health strategies to prevent its 
spread,'' said Ernest P. Franck, president of the group. ``What is 
missing is a more aggressive financial commitment from Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Erstad's Knee To Be Re-Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- First baseman-outfielder Darin Erstad  
will be re-examined Friday after an MRI on his right knee revealed 
some problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Erstad was scratched from the lineup before Wednesday night's  
game against Cleveland because of the injury, suffered when his 
cleats got caught in the dirt while he was swinging at a pitch in 
the seventh inning of Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	The MRI was performed Thursday by team physician Dr. Craig  
Milhouse in Anaheim and showed trouble with the lateral collateral 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, idle Thursday, open a seven-game road trip Friday  
night in Detroit having lost six straight games and 22 of their 
last 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Erstad, 25, has played in all but two of his team's 113 games  
and is hitting .246 with 10 homers and 37 RBIs. He hit .296 with 19 
homers and 82 RBIs last season.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Challenges Gore on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
challenged Vice President Al Gore Thursday to clarify his position 
on federally funding abortions for poor women in light of 
conflicting statements by Gore's staff this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is time for him to answer what his position is,''  
Bradley said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press. 
``On this issue in particular you've got to say what you believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lahane offered conflicting statements when  
asked Thursday about the vice president's position on federal 
funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Lahane said that Gore supports the current federal  
law -- ``federal funding of abortion in situations involving incest, 
rape and when the life of the mother is endangered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say if Gore favored Medicaid funding for poor women's  
abortions without the restrictions in the current law. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, Lahane was again asked if Gore was in favor of  
Medicaid funding of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Lahane responded without elaborating.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley campaign, however, released a series of statements  
by Gore, both as a congressman and senator, showing he was opposed 
to federal funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Gore's change of positions since he was in Congress -- as  
Bradley's campaign alleged -- Lahane said that the important issue 
is only his current position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue shouldn't be what his position was a decade ago,''  
Lahane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore addressed the issue himself at a campaign stop in Iowa, but  
without giving any details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support federal funding, if that's what you're asking,''  
Gore said in response to a question shouted by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bradley challenge was prompted by a story in Sunday's Des  
Moines Register in which a Gore spokesman said the vice president 
was against federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, 
incest, or the need to save the life of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Roger Salazar retracted that statement Thursday and  
said he had inaccurately depicted Gore's position, and that the 
vice president opposes restrictions on abortion funding. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides say President Clinton, during the 1992  
campaign, said he would not veto any bill that allowed for the 
Medicaid funding of abortions, and they said he has not addressed 
that exact question since.

<HEADLINE> Nets Sign Muresan, Burrell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets signed Gheorghe  
Muresan, the NBA's tallest player, to a one-year contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also re-signed free agent forward Scott Burrell. Terms  
of the deals were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old, 7-foot-7 Muresan hasn't played for most of the  
past two seasons because of injury. He was signed in May for New 
Jersey's final two games and then became a free agent. He has been 
playing in the Boston Summer League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gheorghe is an effective low-post scorer and his addition  
bolsters the depth of our front line,'' Nets general manager John 
Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Muresan was Washington's second-round pick in 1993 and played  
four seasons for the team, averaging 10.6 points and 6.8 rebounds 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out the entire 1997-98 season, and most of the 1998-99  
season with a stretched tendon in his ankle and a compressed nerve 
in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-7 Burrell averaged 6.6 points and 3.7 rebounds in 32 games  
for the Nets last season, scoring a season-high 18 against Seattle 
on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, who has averaged 7.1 points and 3.5 rebounds in a  
six-year career, had surgery to repair a tear in his right knee on 
April 24.

<HEADLINE> Denver Mayor Urges Gun Control March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Mayor Wellington Webb, president of the U.S.  
mayor's conference, called on mayors and police chiefs Thursday to 
march on Congress to press for gun control to stop an epidemic of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's attack on a Jewish Center in Los Angeles shows gun  
control ``is more important than tax cuts,'' Webb told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's time, he said, for ``Congress to respond to the wishes of  
the American public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb clashed with the National Rifle Association after the  
Columbine massacre in nearby Littleton, urging the group to move 
its national convention from Denver. When the group went ahead with 
the meeting, Webb marched with protesters outside the meeting site. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Thursday, Webb called on mayors and police  
chiefs to head for Washington on Sept. 9 ``to urge their local 
congresspersons to support responsible and effective gun control 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said he expected ``a substantial number'' to heed his  
call. He said he picked Sept. 9 to coincide with the return of many 
of the country's schoolchildren to school.

<HEADLINE> Ala. OKs Handling of DuBose Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama trustees upheld on Thursday the  
decision to discipline rather than fire football coach Mike DuBose, 
who lied about his relationship with an employee who accused him of 
sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sid McDonald, president pro tem of the system's governing board,  
said some trustees thought president Andrew Sorensen's disciplinary 
action should be overturned. But, he said, that was not the 
``prevailing opinion'' of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald, commenting after the trustees met for about four hours  
behind closed doors, said the DuBose matter will remain under 
review and could come up again when the board meets in 
mid-September. But he said it would take ``new information'' to 
change the board's position. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, starting his third season, had his salary cut by  
$360,000 over the next three years by Sorensen as part of the 
disciplinary action taken against him. At the same time, the 
university agreed to pay $350,000 to the employee who filed the 
sexual harassment complaint against DuBose. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, who said during a May news conference that rumors about  
him and an employee were false, admitted last week that he'd lied. 
He didn't elaborate, and university officials didn't identify the 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said the board ``will think of Mike DuBose as being on  
probation'' for an episode that has left scars on the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't heal quickly. They won't go away fast,'' he said.  
``The entire matter proves that not every cloud has a silver 
lining. We can't find one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said no formal vote was taken by the trustees, whose  
meeting was described as a retreat and not a regular business 
session, but the preliminary approval of the disciplinary action 
was the consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorensen, speaking after the trustees' private session, said he  
doesn't know ``for sure'' if he still can trust DuBose to abide by 
NCAA regulations. ``That does make it difficult,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could accept whatever the board chose to do, even if  
it eventually decides to fire the coach. But, he said: ``I do not 
expect that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, who previously met with Sorensen, said prior to the  
trustees' session that he had no anxiety about it. He did not 
immediately return a phone message left at his Tuscaloosa office 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees have complained that the decision by Sorensen was made  
without their knowledge or input. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the meeting, system chancellor Thomas Meredith said he  
didn't tell trustees about the sexual harassment claim against 
DuBose at the request of Sorensen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations were intense. They were trying to hold it  
close,'' Meredith said of the lawyers' settlement talks. But he 
said board members have asked to be better informed ``and they 
should have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorensen also said he should have discussed with Meredith the  
process for informing the trustees of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Discipline Urged in Nuke Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, citing a  
``total breakdown in the system,'' recommended disciplinary action 
Thursday against a former director and two officials at the Los 
Alamos nuclear laboratory because of failures identified in the 
China espionage investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson did not identify the three officials. But sources  
familiar with the internal investigation said one of them was 
Siegfried ``Sig'' Hecker, who was director of the New Mexico 
weapons lab from 1986 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The three officials' ``responsibilities were clear and that they  
failed to meet their responsibilities'' in the investigation of 
alleged spying by Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was fired last March after being under investigation since  
1966. 
</P>
<P>
	While an internal investigation also cited ``systemic problems  
in the Energy Department's management of counterintelligence 
matters,'' no action was taken against any department headquarters 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the DOE's inspector general said certain senior  
DOE officials with direct management responsibilities over the lab 
contributed to the problem because they ``were not aware nor did 
they seek essential information'' about the Lee investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
two senior officials -- former Deputy Energy Secretary Elizabeth 
Moler and Assistant Secretary Victor Reis -- might have been subject 
to sanctions had they not left the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reis resigned as head of the nuclear weapons program in June  
because of disagreement with Richardson over department 
reorganization. Moler, who briefly served as acting energy 
secretary, left when Richardson was named secretary last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post identified the other two Los Alamos  
employees recommended for disciplinary action as Robert S. Vrooman 
and Terry Craig, both former counterintelligence officers at the 
lab. Vrooman has retired but is a part-time consultant to a lab 
subcontractor and Craig now works in another section of the lab, 
the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecker, Vrooman and Craig could not be reached Thursday night  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab Director John Browne issued a brief statement saying he was  
considering what action to take. ``I intend to act as quickly as 
possible, but I must ensure fairness in this process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson cannot directly take action against the Los Alamos  
employees because they work for the University of California, the 
private contractor that has managed the lab in New Mexico since the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold said it is University of  
California policy not to identify individuals subject to personnel 
actions and that they might not even be identified if action is 
taken against them. 

</P>
<P>
	The internal DOE review was ordered several months ago amid  
criticism from Congress about the handling of the Lee 
investigation, which began in 1996 when he first became a suspect 
in the apparent loss of secrets concerning the W-88 nuclear 
warhead, one of the country's most sophisticated, in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a Taiwan-born computer scientists at Los Alamos since the  
1970s, was fired March 8 for security violations. He has not been 
charged and has denied giving any nuclear secrets to China or 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal investigation focused on why Lee had been allowed  
to remain at his top-secret job for nearly three years after 
becoming an FBI suspect and why the FBI was never told he had been 
given a waiver in 1995 to have his computer searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a total breakdown in the system and there's plenty  
of blame to go around,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Richardson said it was important to  
determine how mistakes were made ``so we can avoid them in the 
future.'' He said he expects some of the Los Alamos officials 
singled ought to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The IG office also examined allegations by Notra Trulock, former  
head of security at the department, that he had been blocked from 
bringing his concerns about the W-88 warhead matter to then-Energy 
Secretary Federico Pena and to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IG report said in conducting 82 interviews there were  
``conflicting versions'' of what happened and investigators ``were 
unable to reconcile the conflicting information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the IG could ``not establish with any certainty  
that any departmental officials, knowingly or intentionally, 
improperly delayed, prohibited or interfered with briefings to Mr. 
Pena or to the congressional intelligence committees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE report said that Hecker failed to follow through on a  
request by senior DOE management to develop a plan limiting Lee's 
access to secrets while under investigation. Lee was not removed 
from his sensitive jobs until late 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Vrooman was accused of not removing Lee from his position after  
being told by an FBI agent in 1997 that such a move no longer would 
jeopardize their investigation, according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig allegedly failed to adequately search records that showed  
in early 1995 Lee had given a written waiver to have his computer 
searched. That contributed to reluctance by the Justice Department 
to approve a computer search that finally took place last May. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lee's computer was examined it was discovered he had  
shifted thousands of files of top-secret nuclear computer codes 
from a highly secure computer system to an unclassified system with 
access to the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Many Teen Moms Have Older Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just 7 percent of sexually active teen-age  
girls are sleeping with much older men -- but those relationships 
account for nearly one in five teen pregnancies, a new study finds. 
</P>
<P>
	By looking at all teen sex, not just liaisons that lead to  
childbirth, the new data refine earlier research that found most 
teen mothers had older partners. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, two-thirds of these girls are having sex with boys  
close to their age, according to the study published today in 
Family Planning Perspectives, the research journal of the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, teen girls who are having sex with older men --  
particularly those six or more years older -- were less likely to 
use contraception and less likely to have abortions than their 
peers involved with younger men. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, they make up a disproportionate share of the teen  
mothers, facing an increased risk of poverty, welfare and dropping 
out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with a relatively small number of young  
women,'' said Jeannie Rosoff, president of Guttmacher. Still, she 
added: ``If I had my 15-year-old going out with an older guy, I 
would probably be pretty panicked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly four in 10 girls ages 15 to 17 have had sex at least  
once, government surveys find, but this is the first look at the 
age of their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Women of all ages tend to have older sexual partners -- more so  
for older women than for teen-agers, as age differences become less 
significant with age. 
</P>
<P>
	This study, which used data from a 1995 government survey of  
families, found that 64 percent of sexually active girls ages 15 to 
17 had partners who were within two years of their age. Another 29 
percent had sex with partners three to five years older. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of girls with men six and more years older than they  
are used contraception, compared with three-quarters of girls with 
boys close to their own age. And girls with younger boys who got 
pregnant were nearly twice as likely to abort than girls with older 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is why teen-age girls who are with older men seem  
more willing to get pregnant -- and to carry those pregnancies to 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Many suggest that men are taking advantage of their younger,  
more vulnerable partners. That theory, backed by data released in 
1995, sparked a controversial call to crack down on statutory rape 
and predatory men who lure teen-age girls into sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Power differences, particularly between younger girls and  
older guys, lead girls into risky situations, like unwanted sex or 
involuntary sex or sex with no protection,'' said Bill Albert of 
the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterns of contraception may offer a less nefarious  
explanation. Earlier studies have found that as men get older, they 
are less likely to use condoms. That is usually offset by their 
female partners, who start using birth-control pills and other 
methods of contraception as they get older. 
</P>
<P>
	So a man in his early 20s may not want to use a condom, even  
though his teen-age partner has not yet begun using an alternate 
method of birth control, said Laura Duberstein Lindberg, who 
studies these issues at the Urban Institute but was not involved 
with this research. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're getting a gap in life experiences,'' she said. ``She  
has to struggle all that much more to insist he uses a condom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that would not explain why these girls are less likely to  
abort or why they are more likely to tell researchers that their 
pregnancies were intended, said Lindberg, speculating that they may 
have more confidence in their older partners' ability to provide 
for them and their future children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is more likely to be employed or educated than teen dads,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope the study will clarify earlier work that found  
most teen-age mothers had older partners -- data seized by some 
lawmakers who blamed predatory older men for the problems of teen 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the 1996 welfare reform law called for states to  
step up prosecutions of statutory rape, and some members of 
Congress have cited this data in arguing that girls should be 
required to get parental consent for abortions or birth control. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy makers may still want to focus on the relationships  
between teen-age girls with older partners, despite their small 
numbers, because of their greater likelihood of ending up with 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guttmacher Institute receives most of its funding from large  
foundations, though a small amount comes from Planned Parenthood of 
America. Its public policy institute focuses on reproductive health 
issues and publishes the journal. Independent researchers review 
articles before publication.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Buys Thai Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The New York investment bank Goldman  
Sachs was the most successful bidder at the last auction held by 
Thailand to liquidate the holdings of failed finance companies, the 
agency announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Sector Restructuring Authority, set up two years  
ago to liquidate the failed institutions, said Thursday it sold 30 
of 35 loan packages for an average of 23 percent of outstanding 
principal value in Wednesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	They were valued at a combined $3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The FRA is responsible for the liquidation of 56 finance  
companies closed by the government after the economic collapse of 
mid-1997, which grew into the Asian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	FRA chairman Amaret Sila-on said that with new investors, the  
assets that have been sold ``can be productively serviced, creating 
thousands of jobs, providing new life to viable projects and 
accelerating Thailand's economic recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. unit ASO 1 paid $547 million for its  
purchases. Goldman Sachs, in partnerships with other firms, was a 
big buyer in two previous auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winning bidders were Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. unit  
Global Thai. Winning Thai firms were Kiatnakin Finance PCL, 
National Finance PCL, and The Pavilion Fund, affiliated with the CP 
Group.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Parents Key to Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While politicians have focused on Hollywood  
and Washington to make schools safer, a national education forum 
broadcast by satellite put the spotlight on parents Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents listen to their children frequently and carefully when  
they are young; we urge all parents to talk with their children 
just a much or more when they are high school students,'' said 
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering viewer calls, Riley and Attorney General Janet Reno  
also put forth recommended policy changes they said would enhance 
the safety of children. 
</P>
<P>
	But the national forum in the wake of the April shootings at  
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., was intended to focus on 
parents. President Clinton echoed the theme, saying in videotaped 
remarks that ``no influence on a child is more important'' than 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take a position and begin to parent again,''  
Virginia Markell, president of the National Parent Teacher 
Association, said at the Thursday night forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Baumgartner, who was in the studio audience, said children  
need more than metal detectors, adding that the children in her 
Methodist youth group in Fairfax County often tell her things they 
won't tell their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to have a relationship in order for the young people  
to really share what's going on in their lives. (Violence) comes 
down to dealing with conflicts,'' said Baumgartner. 
</P>
<P>
	Also fresh in the country's consciousness are the shootings of  
day-traders in Atlanta and the attacks on young children and their 
caretakers at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the incidents were ``another compelling argument  
for the passage of hate-crimes legislation and common-sense gun 
laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-minute program, ``Safe Schools, Safe Students: What  
Parents Can Do,'' was being televised from the Freedom Forum's 
Newseum in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, a series of school shootings has  
prompted increased school security and efforts to identify and help 
troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts took on added urgency following the April 20  
shootings at Columbine. Two students wearing black trenchcoats 
gunned down 12 classmates and a teacher before shooting themselves. 
Copycat threats and shootings that followed in schools nationwide 
has led to tightened security. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we prepare for the start of a new school year, we must do  
all we can to ensure that schools remain safe,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department is offering parents free safety guides  
it has published for schools. And since 1992, the department has 
held monthly satellite town meetings and special events such as the 
school safety program. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, the forums are broadcast to roughly 400 to 500 TV  
stations across the country -- mostly local cable-access channels, 
public television affiliates, and Channel One, the 
advertising-supported news show beamed into 12,000 schools.

<HEADLINE> Life on Earth Traced Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some oily material extracted from 2.7  
billion-year-old Australian rocks is providing the oldest known 
biological evidence of life on Earth -- a billion years earlier than 
had previously been found. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, reported in today's edition of the journal  
Science, pushes back evidence of life to the Archean era, the 
period from the beginning of Earth to about 2.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unknown that complex molecules can survive such a long  
period of time on Earth,'' said lead researcher Jochen J. Brocks of 
the University of Sydney and the Australian Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The molecular fossils we report are the oldest preserved  
biological molecules in the world,'' Brocks said in response to 
questions via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We opened up a window into a time when almost nothing was  
known about life on Earth and provide a tool that will multiply our 
knowledge about this shadow land,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This age should provide a new calibration point for molecular  
clocks and the universal tree of life,'' Brocks and his fellow 
Australian researchers said in their paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings were greeted with enthusiasm by other scientists.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've done a spectacular job,'' said John Hayes of  
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who did 
research into evidence of early life in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``They perform analyses of such quality and diversity that they  
assemble of body of evidence that, when you put it all together, is 
compelling,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	And Andrew H. Knoll of the Botanical Museum at Harvard  
University called the report ``a pretty exciting paper. It really 
opens doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really admire about these guys is they heard the  
conventional wisdom that said this couldn't be done, and they 
searched for and found'' the evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most rocks as old as the ones studied have undergone a process  
called metamorphism, an intense geological heating that changes 
them and which scientists believed would destroy any organic 
compounds they contained. But the shales studied by this team were 
well-preserved and still contained the biological chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found evidence of organic compounds called  
lipids in the sedimentary rocks located more than 2,100 feet deep 
in northwestern Australia's Roy Hill Shale and Marra Mamba 
Formations. The rocks formed a seabed 2.6 billion to 2.7 billion 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipids are produced by living organisms and finding them  
indicates the presence of eukaryotes -- life forms with cells that 
have a distinct nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of their complexity, eukaryotes were thought to have  
developed relatively late in Earth's history. This discovery pushes 
the date for their appearance back to the earliest part of 
geological time. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers noted that a similar report several years ago  
had been discounted by scientists who assumed the rocks had been 
contaminated with more recent chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure that wasn't the case this time, they put their rock  
samples through several rinses in solvents to remove any possible 
contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocks were then ground and chemicals, including sterane, a  
hydrocarbon of biological origin, were extracted. Steranes derive 
from sterols, a component of certain living tissues, the best known 
of which is cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biomarkers we report are the oldest known that'' can be  
shown to have originated in the areas where they were found and 
were formed at the same time as the rocks in that area, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are more than a billion years older than those from the  
... Barney Creek Formation, previously the oldest 
well-characterized molecular fossils,'' they reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Brocks said the finding will help scientists who are trying to  
calculate back to the common ancestor of all living things. 
</P>
<P>
	In this effort scientists came up with widely different values,  
he noted, with some calculating the origin of eukaryotes to 1.7 
billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we found that eukaryotes already lived 2.7 billion years  
ago, hence proving many molecular clocks wrong,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some evidence for the existence of what may have  
``possibly'' been bacteria even earlier, Brocks added.

<HEADLINE> Streaking Mystics Eye Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year ago, the Washington Mystics couldn't  
wait for their humbling inaugural WNBA season to end. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, riding a franchise-record five-game winning streak, the  
team that limped to a forgettable 3-27 record in 1998 is eyeing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics (11-17), who have four games left and are within  
reach of the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot, have made a 
stunning turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really do believe that we are going to win,'' coach Nancy  
Darsch said. ``We do believe that when it's a tight game that we'll 
find a way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics made the most of a bad situation following their  
dismal debut last summer. Those losses yielded the top pick in the 
WNBA draft, which they used to select forward Chamique Holdsclaw, 
who led Tennessee to three consecutive NCAA titles from 1996-98. 
</P>
<P>
	By teaming Holdsclaw with guard Nikki McCray, the league's  
fourth-leading scorer last year, Washington got what it lacked in 
its rookie season: the ability to score from the perimeter or from 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Darsch, the team's third coach in two years, quickly gutted the  
Mystics and remade the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four players from the inaugural season remain on the  
roster. Holdsclaw led a group of newcomers that included several 
refugees from the defunct American Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Holdsclaw and McCray leading the way, no one expected  
such a rebound from a team that didn't win back-to-back games for 
the first time until July. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only a few people left from last year, so this is  
pretty much a new start,'' said Holdsclaw, who has averaged 21.2 
points and 8.4 rebounds during the five-game streak. ``This team 
goes into every game as underdogs and we go out and play that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, who has averaged 20.4 points and hit 12 of 27 3-pointers  
during the resurgence, said opponents err if they assume the 
Mystics boast only two offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest difference is that we have system now that allows  
everybody to shoot the ball. ... It's not always just me and 
Chamique scoring,'' McCray said. ``And we actually have better 
players here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdover center Murriel Page leads the WNBA in field goal  
percentage. Newcomer Andrea Nagy, a point guard with ABL 
experience, is a ballhandler who can run the floor. The bench is 
stronger and deeper and players are willing to accept specific 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's more committed,'' Holdsclaw said. ``We're playing  
with passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-game streak includes victories over three teams in  
front of the Mystics in the East -- Detroit, Orlando and 
division-leading New York, which has dropped three games to 
Washington this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other victories came against last-place Cleveland, including  
an Aug. 8 win in which the Mystics held the Rockers to 45 points, a 
WNBA low this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to finish strong and finish on a high, whatever  
that may be -- if that's the playoffs or not,'' Darsch said. 
``There's too many factors involved right now to put must-win 
pressure on ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mystics are suddenly growing accustomed to winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot,'' McCray said.  
``We want to finish this season strong.''

<HEADLINE> Catfish Still in Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter remained in  
critical condition after regaining consciousness three days after 
hitting his head on concrete steps at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, 53, who pitched in the majors 15 years and earned five  
World Series rings, was conscious, alert and responding to doctors' 
commands today, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Hertford, the tight-knit Perquimans County  
community where Hunter lives, anxiously awaited word on changes in 
his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing you learn about this place, this area, is how much  
baseball means around here,'' said Steve Lane, who owns an Internet 
service and who moved to Hertford from Providence, R.I. ``People 
here look at him and think of how much he's meant to this 
community, and it's like everyone wants to change places with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Hunter, diagnosed last year with Lou Gehrig's  
disease -- a gradual, irreversible deterioration of the muscles -- 
suffered brain bruising. He likely will require rehabilitation 
because he already was weakened by the disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would be premature to even think about that,'' said Dr.  
Paul Cunningham, a trauma physician and professor of surgery at the 
East Carolina University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``His prognosis is still somewhat guarded. We're being hopeful  
as we can be, but we're taking things one day at a time,'' said 
Cunningham. He said no surgery was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokesman Doug Boyd said Hunter regained consciousness  
Wednesday after being unconscious much of Tuesday. He began 
responding to commands -- ``wiggle your toes and that sort of 
thing,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Hunter and other relatives, gathered in the hospital ICU,  
declined to talk to the media. ``The family is very private right 
now,'' Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter left Hertford to play for the Kansas City Athletics in  
1965 and moved with the club to Oakland in 1968. He became the 
first multimillionaire baseball player when he signed with the 
Yankees in 1974. Beginning in 1971, Hunter strung together five 
straight, 20-victory seasons and won the Cy Young Award in 1974. He 
retired from the Yankees in 1979 and returned to Hertford, where he 
easily returned to life on his 400-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``To show you what kind of guy he was and always has been, I  
remember in 1976, I was in high school and it was the year of the 
baseball strike,'' said Russell Lassiter, owner of Carolina Trophy 
&AMP; Engraving. ``Jimmy stayed here and came out and pitched batting 
practice for us. Here was the guy who was the best in the business 
out pitching baseball practice to a bunch of high school kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it was just like he was one of us.''  
</P>
<P>
	A diabetic who required thrice-daily insulin injections, Hunter  
announced last fall he had ALS, a neurological disease that 
interferes with signals the brain sends to muscles, causing the 
muscles to degenerate over time. There is no cure. 
</P>
<P>
	ALS has robbed Hunter of use of his right arm and diminished his  
upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter fell Sunday while climbing steps to his home after saying  
goodbye to a friend. He was taken first to an Edenton hospital, 
then transferred early Monday to the Greenville hospital, which 
serves the East Carolina medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had some bad knocks before, but this is the worst,'' said  
Tommy Harrell, who lives next door to the Hunters. ``The only thing 
people can do right now is pray for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Keith Vaughan, minister of The Hertford Baptist Church,  
said the church received calls from people in several states who 
said they were praying for the former pitching great. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Helen asked for prayers, that was a very sincere  
request,'' Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hunter issued a statement Wednesday expressing gratitude  
for Hunter's friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outpouring of love and support for us and for Jimmy is a  
tremendous encouragement to us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have asked what they can do. The greatest thing  
you can do for us at this time is to pray for Jimmy and all the 
thousands who suffer from ALS.''

<HEADLINE> Government Eyes Regulating Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The advent of casket stores, Internet sales of  
coffins and keen competition in the cemetery and funeral industries 
is prompting federal regulators to consider expanding a 15-year-old 
rule governing funerals. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral rule was issued to protect grieving family members  
from unnecessary costs and purchases at funeral homes. Now the 
Federal Trade Commission is looking at casting a wider regulatory 
net to include other providers of funeral goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission now will review public comments submitted on the  
matter over the past months. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say rampant consolidation in the industry and  
more aggressive selling tactics warrant further regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have cemeteries telling people they have to buy a marker or  
vault from them'' to be buried on the grounds, says Lisa Carlson, 
author of ``Caring for the Dead'' and executive director of the 
Funeral and Memorial Societies of America. ``That kind of 
manipulative stuff should be outlawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some consumers have experienced the problems firsthand. Willie  
and Juanita Roach have owned the burial plot they are to share at a 
local cemetery for decades. But on a recent visit to the cemetery, 
they were surprised to learn they owed an extra $5,000 for their 
plot and had to buy an expensive vault to be buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have entertained cremation even though we've already got a  
marker down,'' says Mrs. Roach of Westminster, S.C. Adding 
confusion to the matter: Willie Roach's mother personally knew the 
cemetery owner when she bought the burial site in 1956. The site 
these days is owned by a national chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Cemetery owners brush aside anecdotes and say there has never  
been a conclusive finding that cemeteries engage in fraudulent 
business practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, cemeteries sell their goods and services before a  
death, says Robert Fells, general counsel for the International 
Cemetery and Funeral Association. Because of that, cemeteries must 
make all price information available. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you don't have the problem, you don't need to extend the  
law,'' Fells said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Hemeyer, a spokesman for the Houston-based Service  
Corporation International, which operates 3,824 funeral service 
locations, 520 cemeteries and 198 crematoriums, says the cemetery 
industry is regulated enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer complaints about cemeteries usually deal with  
maintenance or interment mistakes -- matters that have nothing to do 
with the funeral rule, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral rule currently requires funeral homes to disclose  
prices for goods and services and prohibits them from forcing 
consumers to buy bundles of services. Funeral directors also cannot 
misrepresent local cemetery requirements, such as telling people 
they must have a body embalmed. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, people can buy caskets -- even heavy monument markers  
-- online. They can shop at coffin retailers or buy vaults, 
monuments and caskets at cemeteries. The rule does not cover these 
other providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials also say the trend of large chains buying up  
local cemeteries and funeral homes may be shifting the old ways of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, they're changing procedures and conduct,''  
Chris Riggall, spokesman for Georgia's Secretary of State's Office, 
which oversees for-profit cemeteries. ``Frankly, when you have a 
company that may be 2,000 miles away, they don't have the same type 
of service priorities that the local folks may have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increased corporate ownership of cemeteries has caused a ``sea  
change'' in the way services are marketed, says Steven Sklar, 
director of the Maryland's Office of Cemetery Oversight. 
Salespeople seek out customers, using telemarketing and other 
tactics, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't just sit there and wait for people to come in,''  
says Sklar, whose position was created two years ago and who now 
handles 900 consumer inquiries a year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a survey by the AARP, formerly the American  
Association of Retired Persons, 43 percent of Americans over the 
age of 50 have been solicited about purchasing their funeral and 39 
percent have been solicited about buying burials before death. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, also  
is studying the issue and is expected to report by fall.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy Gets Blanket TV Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The shooting at a Jewish Center in Los Angeles  
had all the elements of a TV news thriller -- panicky parents 
worried about their children and a massive police search for a 
gunman who had slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the cable news networks blanketed the story, giving  
rise to concerns about encouraging copycats and the possibility of 
unwittingly helping the suspect before he was captured. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC went into crisis mode upon first  
word of the attack, which came Tuesday on a slow news afternoon. 
The networks are driven by intense competitiveness and the 
knowledge their ratings soar during big news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that is simply natural for the cable  
operators to do,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of the Joan 
Shorenstein Center on Press and Politics at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated incidents of gun violence this year have made it a  
topic of concern to many Americans and justified the extensive 
coverage, said John Moody, Fox News Channel vice president for 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Fox News Channel probably would not have pre-empted its  
prime-time programming for the story if suspect Buford O'Neal 
Furrow had not still been at large, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN felt it was an important story but tried not to ignore other  
news, said Sid Bedingfield, executive vice president of CNN USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of encouraging copycats ``is something we're concerned  
about,'' Bedingfield said. ``But on the other hand, you can't not 
cover the story. You can try to cover it responsibly and with 
perspective. But I don't think it helps to ignore the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frequently during coverage, the news networks showed footage of  
police searching the neighborhood and a hotel where they believed 
Furrow might be hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of National Information Officers Association said  
he was concerned broadcasters in Los Angeles went too far when 
there was a chance the suspect was watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may expose a weakness or may expose an officer to a suspect  
who may decide to go out in a blaze of glory,'' said Don Kelly, a 
Baton Rouge, La. police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles TV reporters, in comments aired over the images,  
said they were taking care not to show police activity that could 
endanger officers. But there were discrepancies: One station said 
it was withholding the number of the hotel room where the gunman 
was mistakenly thought to be holed up, another station reported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedingfield said CNN frequently broke away from live shots that  
it thought might show too much. ``It's tough to do,'' he said, 
``and we weren't always entirely successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moody said he didn't believe showing police officers surrounding  
a hotel put the officers in danger, even if the suspect was 
watching.

<HEADLINE> Ill. GOP Leaders Flock to Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Republican leaders in Illinois flocked  
to the side of GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush on 
Thursday as he made several campaign stops en route to Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of state officials endorsed Bush, the governor of Texas,  
during a Statehouse rally. Gov. George Ryan put his powerful 
campaign apparatus in Bush's corner. ``Without question, he is the 
best candidate available,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Govs. James R. Thompson and Jim Edgar gave their support,  
too -- along with the attorney general, lieutenant governor, state 
treasurer and a flock of legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	The first official votes in the presidential race won't be taken  
for months, and Bush has offered few details to flesh out his theme 
of ``prosperity with a purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson said there is no reason for GOP leaders to wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me there is such a great gulf between Bush as a  
candidate and all the rest of the Republican candidates that it 
would be defying common sense, I think, to take that alternative,'' 
Thompson said. Others in the crowded field for the Republican 
nomination include Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan, Gary 
Bauer Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes. Bush is competing against 
them in the Iowa straw poll Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made sure to discuss farm issues during his 20-minute  
speech to several hundred people in the Illinois' Capitol rotunda. 
He condemned any diplomatic policy of withholding food from other 
countries, stressed the importance of free trade and called for 
emergency aid to struggling farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, he reassured farmers that despite coming  
from an oil state, he supports the alternative fuel ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bush told Missouri farmers that his  
``compassionate conservatism'' would offer money but no miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty simple logic,'' he said. ``If we rely upon people  
elsewhere to provide us food, we've got a national security risk. 
The next president has got to make sure agriculture is viewed as a 
mainstay of national policy, not a stepchild.''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett's Roll Impresses Gordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) -- Unless he wins nine of the last 14  
races, Dale Jarrett probably won't be considered as successful as 
Jeff Gordon was a season ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Gordon tied Richard Petty's series record by winning  
13 times, and although Jarrett figures to fall short of that, his 
point total actually is higher than Gordon's at this time a year 
ago. Jarrett's 20-race total of 3,199 points is 117 more than 
Gordon had at this time in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've got things clicking better than we had last  
year,'' Gordon said. ``It seems like they got it together sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They certainly had everything in order last Saturday, when  
Jarrett led 116 of 160 laps while winning the Brickyard 400. 
Jarrett increased his lead in the standings to 274 points over Mark 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, trying to become only the second driver to win three  
straight titles, is 507 points behind in sixth place as he gets 
ready for the Frontier at the Glen on Sunday. He has taken a 
realistic approach to the balance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not even thinking about him,'' Gordon said of Jarrett.  
``We're just trying to win races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tied with Jarrett and Jeff Burton for the series lead with four  
victories this year, Gordon still has a good chance to be the top 
winner on the circuit for a record-breaking fifth straight season. 
He's trying for his third straight victory on the 2.45-mile Watkins 
Glen International and fifth in a row on NASCAR's two road courses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon can't count on victories to get him back in the race  
-- unless Jarrett has an unexpected rash of low finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just kind of biding their time early in the season  
getting those top fives, and then when it all started to click, 
they started winning races,'' Gordon said. ``He's on a pretty good 
roll right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett agrees, but remains humble and wary of possible  
pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want anybody to shake me to wake me up.'' he said.  
``It's as good as it can get right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 top-five finishes in his last 12 starts and 16 overall,  
Jarrett has been in position to win virtually every race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he doesn't think he'll be able to match Gordon's 1998  
run that tied Petty's 23-year-old record for most victories in a 
season, Jarrett plans to try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that maybe we'll win the rest of them,'' he said.  
``We've had the kind of breaks that we saw those guys get through 
the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon failed to finish in just two of 33 races in 1998, when he  
beat Martin -- who had some late-season difficulties -- by a 
staggering 374 points. Gordon was only 72 ahead points ahead of 
Martin last year when the cars came to New York's Finger Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon has been off the track at the end five times this  
year, to just once by Jarrett. And Jarrett also has experienced far 
fewer difficulties than Martin and third-place Bobby Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had good racing luck,'' conceded Jarrett, who hasn't  
finished out of the top 10 in five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know how to win a championship,'' Gordon said. ``They've  
been right there, second or third many times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett has been no worse than third in points at the end in  
each of the last three seasons. In 1997, his 14-point deficit to 
Gordon was the second slimmest in series history. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the difference now is Jarrett's willingness to settle  
for points-enriching finishes rather taking all-or-nothing gambles 
if he's close at the end of any race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made a lot of things happen whenever we weren't the best  
car, and you have to give the crew a lot of credit for that,'' 
Jarrett said. ``They don't give up. They keep working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a winner 44 times in the last four-plus seasons,  
recognizes that as a key factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're championship caliber,'' he said of Jarrett's team.  
``They know when to get a top five, and when they're capable of 
winning they go out there and win.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defense Fund Collects $2.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donations to President and Mrs. Clinton's  
legal defense fund have slowed in recent months and organizers say 
they will not be able to cover all the bills by the end of the 
president's term unless the pace picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust has raised $6.3 million in a year and a half, but the  
Clintons' bills so far total $10.5 million and are still rising, 
the fund's trustees said Thursday. So far, the fund has paid $4.5 
million toward those bills for legal expenses of the president and 
Mrs. Clinton. The fund also has spent hundreds of thousands of 
dollars on mailed solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of the year, the fund collected $2.4  
million, much of it around the time of Clinton's acquittal in the 
Senate impeachment trial Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``The contributions were very intensive for the year all the way  
through March,'' said the fund's executive director, Anthony 
Essaye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since then, there's been no question, since it's been out of  
the news, ... with other campaigns starting to kick up, ... we've 
started to see a downturn. And I expect that will continue,'' said 
Essaye. 
</P>
<P>
	Major donors already have contributed $20,000 apiece to the  
Clinton fund over the past year and a half, including Hollywood's 
Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen; Los Angeles grocer Ron Burkle, 
who last year traveled with Clinton to Africa, where Burkle's 
grocery chain does a lot of business; and Eli Broad, chairman and 
chief executive officer of SunAmerica, a specialist in retirement 
funds that got regulatory approval last year for its purchase by 
commercial insurance giant American International Group. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of 1999, 57 donors including clothing  
designer Ralph Lauren gave $10,000 apiece, the maximum allowed 
annually by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. David Pryor, the trust's founder, said he wants to  
``make certain this first family does not leave the White House 
with an enormous debt on its shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons earned more than $500,000 last year and the first  
lady looked at a $1.7 million seven-bedroom colonial this week in 
New York, where she is considering running for the Senate. In June, 
she checked out a $3.8 million estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Essaye said it is ``probable'' that the defense fund will not  
cover the legal bills by the time the president leaves office if 
donations continue at their current level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to ameliorate this burden,'' said Essaye.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons can seek government reimbursement for some of their  
legal costs stemming from Kenneth Starr's criminal investigation of 
the president and first lady.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talks Expected To Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rising economic tensions between the United  
States and its major trading partners will not prevent the 
successful launch of a new round of global trade talks later this 
year, the Clinton administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Susan Esserman, who is leading  
the U.S. team preparing for the negotiations, conceded that serious 
differences remain over negotiating goals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is pushing for a limited agenda focusing on  
tariff cuts on manufactured goods, agriculture and services while 
Europe wants more areas covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, a follow-up to the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of trade  
liberalization, are scheduled to start in December at a meeting of 
the 134-member World Trade Organization in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``America, as the world's largest exporter, has much to gain  
from a new round of negotiations,'' Esserman told a group of 
reporters Thursday. She insisted that differences over the items to 
be discussed would be resolved before the Seattle meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Some trade analysts were not as optimistic, given growing  
protectionist sentiments in this country triggered by record trade 
deficits and rising trade tensions between the United States and 
its major trading partners, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is deep disagreement between the United States, the  
European Union, Japan and the developing nations over what ought to 
be included in the next round,'' said Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert 
at the Institute of International Economics, a Washington think 
tank. ``I don't see a smooth road ahead at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hufbauer said that part of the problem was growing foreign  
unhappiness with the administration's objections to including U.S. 
trade barriers in such areas as America's restrictive anti-dumping 
laws and high protections for textiles and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration, in an effort to pre-empt U.S. opponents,  
has been taking things off the table that other countries want,'' 
Hufbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman said the administration would block any effort to  
include anti-dumping regulations as part of the upcoming 
discussions. The administration has used these regulations, which 
allow higher tariffs for U.S. industries threatened by imports, as 
the primary mechanism to provide relief for U.S. steelmakers in the 
wake of the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite differences, Esserman said consensus was forming around  
U.S. efforts to limit the upcoming round of talks to three years, 
preventing a repeat of the Uruguay Round, which dragged on for 
nearly eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two areas of negotiations -- agriculture and services -- are part  
of the so-called built-in agenda, meaning that countries agreed as 
part of the Uruguay package to re-open talks in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Esserman noted a recent agreement among trade ministers of the  
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, made up of the United 
States and other Pacific Rim nations, that the new talks also 
should aim to further cut tariffs on manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
	More progress could come in outlining the goals for the talks  
when President Clinton meets with other APEC leaders in New Zealand 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also is expected to have discussions with Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin while at APEC. Esserman refused to speculate 
on whether the two leaders would be able to strike a final 
market-opening trade agreement that would clear the way for China's 
membership in the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries came close to a deal in April. Since then,  
discussions have broken off because of China's unhappiness with the 
mistaken NATO bombing of its embassy in Yugoslavia. A final 
agreement by lowering Chinese barriers would represent a boon for 
U.S. businesses and farmers hoping to break into the world's 
largest market.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Mondesi Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Raul Mondesi apparently regrets his outburst  
against the Los Angeles Dodgers' management. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after demanding a trade during a profanity-filled tirade,  
the outfielder was back in the lineup Thursday and the team issued 
a statement in which Mondesi apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of his anger Wednesday was directed at manager Davey  
Johnson and general manager Kevin Malone. Mondesi didn't speak with 
reporters Thursday, choosing to let the statement speak for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to apologize to Kevin Malone, Davey Johnson, my  
teammates and, most importantly, to Dodger fans for the comments I 
made yesterday,'' the statement said. ``In what has been a 
frustrating season, I let my emotions get the best of me. 
</P>
<P>
	'' I am thankful the fans in Los Angeles have stood behind me  
throughout my career and I will continue to play hard for the 
Dodgers. I am truly sorry this has been a distraction for my 
teammates and the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His attitude was much different Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of all this,'' Mondesi said then. ``I told my agent  
to get me ... out of here as soon as possible. I can't take this 
anymore. I've had to deal with this all year. I told them to trade 
me because I don't want to ... be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mondesi said he was no longer willing play for Johnson  
and Malone, referring to both with profanities, he went 1-for-5 
Thursday in a 10-5 win over Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under contract through 2001, Mondesi had stressed that Malone  
had better move him soon because he no longer considers himself a 
member of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They try to put all of our problems on me,'' Mondesi said.  
``They're trying to say that all this ... is my fault. That's the 
way they feel, fine. Just get me out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tirade was in response to Mondesi being benched for the  
second straight day Wednesday after arriving late to the team 
stretching session Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old was used as a pinch hitter against the Expos on  
Tuesday and Wednesday nights, and remained in Wednesday night's 
game after grounding out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi entered June hitting .286 with an NL-leading 18 homers  
and 44 RBIs but has slumped to a .248 average with 24 homers and 67 
RBIs. During one stretch in June and July, Mondesi went 112 at-bats 
without a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi was the 1994 NL Rookie of the Year, and has won two Gold  
Gloves. In 1997, he became the only player in Dodgers history to 
hit at least 30 home runs with at least 30 stolen bases during a 
single season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is earning $8.5 million this season, and is owed $9.5 million  
next year and $11 million in 2001, the final guaranteed year of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone did not accompany the Dodgers on their road trip, which  
ended Thursday. When informed of Mondesi's comments, he expressed 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone declined to comment on Mondesi's future with the  
ballclub, although he intimated that enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a lot of things that have happened with Raul  
this season, and we've tried to be supportive and help him through 
them,'' Malone said. ``Everyone has worked very hard to help Raul, 
but we really don't know what else to do at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to bringing a winning team back to the fans of  
Los Angeles, and this isn't about individuals. We need to make this 
into a team of 25 guys who are all on the same page trying to win. 
Anyone who isn't on the same page isn't going to be here. Sometimes 
you have to make hard decisions, and we're prepared to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Moorad, Mondesi's agent, was on vacation, but released a  
statement through his office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Raul and I have talked at length about his frustration,''  
Moorad said. ``It was our hope that these issues would not come to 
a head during the season. I'm sure the Dodgers will do what they 
believe is in the best interest of the organization during the 
offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson made it clear that as far as he's concerned, the matter  
has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mondy, a lot of times, gets some bad advice and he's  
very emotional,'' Johnson said Thursday. ``He's probably got a lot 
on his plate. We've turned the page. I don't have a doghouse.''

<HEADLINE> Barry Sanders Spotted in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- There's been a Barry Sanders sighting in  
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Free Press reported today that Barry Sanders was  
spotted at Detroit Metropolitan Airport shortly after 8 p.m. 
Wednesday getting off a Delta flight from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recently retired running back's father, William Sanders,  
said he hasn't heard from his son yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to call him,'' he told the newspaper, ``because  
he knows I want to talk to him. He's probably going to call me. I'm 
just going to play it by ear. I know he's back now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams Sanders and a friend, Allen Hughes, who happens to be  
in the Detroit Lions' front office as director of security, spent a 
couple of days together in Wichita where the elder Sanders now 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	And, every once in a while, the two men even talked about Barry  
Sanders, who quit the Lions and football, and went to Europe for a 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hughes, who has been a guest in the family home since  
Monday, said he never pressured the elder Sanders to try to get his 
son to come back to the team. He did not have to -- Sanders had 
already promised his friend even before the visit that he would do 
anything he could to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes told The Associated Press he came to visit in response to  
a long-standing invitation -- and not at the urging of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not down here to try to convince anyone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said he did not even tell anyone he was coming, except  
for one coach who he told so he wouldn't be considered absent 
without leave. He said he decided to take a few days off during 
training camp and planned to stay in Wichita another day or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not been instructed as far as I know by anybody here,''  
Schmidt told the Free Press. ``It was a matter of him letting 
people know Mr. Sanders wanted him to come out, and what's the 
harm? It just makes sense to do it. Jocko has a relationship with a 
lot of players and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lions publicist Bill Keenist said Wednesday that Hughes was  
visiting Sanders as a Lions official, but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he advised his son not to quit three years  
ago when he was considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time he didn't ask me, he just quit,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said his son called to tell him about his decision to  
retire only so that he heard it directly from him rather than the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was disenchanted with the direction the team was going. He  
was tired of losing,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders announced his retirement July 28, the day before  
the team reported to training camp at Saginaw Valley State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Sanders said his desire to quit football outweighed  
his desire to play. When camp opened July 29, Sanders was in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders quit needing just 1,458 yards to break Walter  
Payton's career rushing record.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What constitutes religion? And who decides?  
Those are among the intriguing questions raised by the long-running 
struggle between gay activists and the Boy Scouts of America, in 
which some of the nation's biggest church bodies are participants. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 4, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the scouts  
violated state anti-discrimination law by excluding avowed 
homosexuals from leadership positions. The case involved an 
assistant scoutmaster ousted because he was co-leader of a gay and 
lesbian group at Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled that the government's interest in ending  
discrimination outweighs the scouts' constitutional claim of 
freedom of association, that a private group is free to decide whom 
to include and exclude from membership. The decision produced 
predictable hallelujahs from gay-rights supporters and lamentations 
among cultural conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, the court plunged into some murky religious  
matters, including many churches' traditional opposition to 
same-sex behavior and their right to use scouts in youth work. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, New Jersey amended its Law Against Discrimination to  
forbid exclusion based on sexual orientation. The law covers any 
``place of public accommodation,'' from stores and restaurants to 
hospitals and schools. Other states have similar statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The law exempts ``distinctly private'' groups and the  
educational facilities of ``a bona fide religious or sectarian 
institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices decided the BSA does not qualify as ``private''  
because it's too big and does public recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	More troubling for some churches was the court's holding that  
the BSA is not religious enough to be exempt. The scouts, according 
to the ruling, do not ``endorse any specific set of moral 
beliefs,'' which the scouts dispute, or ``espouse any one 
religion,'' which they acknowledge. The ruling noted that the 
organization boasts of ``close association'' with ``virtually all 
religious bodies'' in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court may eventually need to settle these  
issues. Only last year, California's Supreme Court defined the BSA 
as a private club that can legally bar not only homosexual leaders 
but atheists, whom the scouts said violated their religious 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New Jersey case, religions were arrayed on both sides.  
The justices cited a brief against the BSA, filed by the Episcopal 
Church's diocese of Newark, and Unitarian Universalists, Quakers, 
Reform Jews and Reconstructionist Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	These groups said the anti-gay policy was disingenuous because  
the scouts welcome as troop sponsors some churches with liberal 
views on homosexuality. For instance, ``many openly lesbian and gay 
persons have been ordained as priests in the Episcopal Church.'' 
(True, though the Episcopalians' stated policy against same-sex 
behavior went unmentioned). 
</P>
<P>
	A radically different view is held by the scouting liaison  
offices within the Mormon, Roman Catholic and United Methodist 
churches. These are the BSA's top three religious backers, 
sponsoring 51,700 troops and other units with nearly 1.2 million 
scouts. They filed a legal brief in the case along with a fourth 
large denomination, the Lutheran Church -- Missouri Synod. 
</P>
<P>
	These churches contended that though the BSA is non-sectarian  
and interfaith, it is also dedicated to ``inculcating religious and 
moral beliefs, such as duty to God'' under the Boy Scout oath. The 
scouts hand out awards for boys' religious activity. Many churches 
consider scouting as part of their youth ministries. In Mormonism, 
it is a virtual department of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Forcing the Boy Scouts to appoint gay leaders, the brief argued,  
puts churches in an ``untenable position'' if they sponsor troops 
and oppose homosexual conduct. Religious freedom is at stake, the 
churches said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever scouting's status, religious rights aren't what they  
used to be. At one time, U.S. Supreme Court doctrine held that the 
government needed a ``compelling'' reason before it could impose 
any substantial burden on the First Amendment guarantee of free 
exercise of religion. The Supreme Court tossed out its strict 
standard in 1990. Congress re-imposed it in 1993, but the Supreme 
Court invalidated that law four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, an unusually broad alliance of 80 denominations and  
religious organizations is making another bid to revive the strict 
standard, through the Religious Liberty Protection Act, which 
passed the House last month and is awaiting Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	Could employers or landlords use religious claims to  
discriminate against homosexuals under the legislation? An 
amendment to bar that was defeated by a 55 percent majority in the 
House, and some proponents fear a similar amendment in the Senate 
would kill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	If the courts can require the BSA to embrace homosexuality,  
could churches some day face the same demand? The Washington 
lobbyist for the Southern Baptist Convention, Will Dodson, said 
that's a ``tremendous threat'' in light of the New Jersey ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual  
lobby, says the movement has no interest in seeking legal limits on 
internal church policies. And Mark Chopko, chief counsel for the 
U.S. Catholic Conference, doubts the New Jersey case ``will have 
great implications for religious bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another seasoned First Amendment lawyer, Marc Stern of the  
American Jewish Congress, is not so sure. ``This is part of a 
growing judicial trend to be impatient with blatant discrimination 
against gays,'' he said. ``And it's not clear whether notions of 
church autonomy are sufficiently strong to withstand that.''

<HEADLINE> Big Crops Projected Despite Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While farmers' fields parch in the East, much  
of America's heartland has had sufficient rain and that means 
bumper crops and little help for depressed commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's soybean crop is shaping up to be the biggest on  
record, and the corn harvest would be the third largest, the 
Agriculture Department reported Wednesday. Big crops of cotton and 
rice are expected across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of tighter world supplies and improved exports, USDA  
expects a modest increase in prices for some commodities -- 20 cents 
a bushel for soybeans and 5 cents a bushel for corn -- from what was 
forecast a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher prices could save the government as much as $1  
billion in crop subsidies, but many farmers still wouldn't recover 
their cost of production, so the rosier projections are unlikely to 
slow a drive in Congress to pass a major bailout of the 
agricultural economy. The Senate last week approved a $7.4 billion 
package of farm assistance; the House has yet to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time where there is nowhere to hide,'' said Doug  
Wilson, who grows corn and soybeans in north-central Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is most acute in the Northeast -- the entire states  
of New Jersey, Connecticut and West Virginia as well as most of 
Maryland -- have been declared disaster areas. But Ohio and parts of 
Indiana and Illinois have been short of water, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's soybeans are healthy, but his corn was hurt by July's  
heat wave, he said. ``What scared me the most was where it looks 
like we are, a mediocre crop with a mediocre to poor price,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest impact of the drought could be on dairy farmers.  
Milk prices are expected to rise as much as 50 cents per hundred 
pounds because of strong demand for cheese and declining milk 
production in the parched Northeast. Cows make less milk when it's 
hot, and pastures are drying up from the lack of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastern peach crops have been largely untouched by the drought,  
although the fruit is smaller than normal. Pennsylvania is expected 
to produce 68 million pounds, 3 million more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's production forecasts reflect field conditions Aug. 1.  
Even as they were released Wednesday, rain fell from the northern 
Plains across the Midwest, which could increase crop yields and 
depress prices, especially for late-developing soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we're sitting here, the soybean plants out back have gained  
another bushel or two,'' said Joe Victor, a commodity analyst with 
Allendale Inc. of McHenry, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The soybean harvest is forecast at 2.9 billion bushels, up 4  
percent from last year. Corn production is expected to dip 2 
percent this year to 9.6 billion bushels, but that is 4 percent 
above 1997's harvest. Most corn and soybeans are used for animal 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said it expected the average price of corn to range from  
$1.70 to $2.10 this year. Soybean prices should average $4.10 to 
$4.90 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton production is expected to be up by a third from last year  
when there was a severe drought across the South. 
</P>
<P>
	The rice crop is expected to be a record 21 billion pounds, up  
12 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat production is down 9 percent, as many farmers switched to  
other crops they thought would be more lucrative this year. But 
world wheat stocks are rising because of a big crop in China this 
year, so USDA doesn't expect prices to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see much of anything that would change our net farm  
income,'' said USDA economist Larry Salathe.

<HEADLINE> Cooper Chosen for National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Cynthia Cooper, already a  
two-time Olympian, will make it three in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper is among five players who will be added to the U.S.  
women's national basketball team on Saturday, USA Basketball 
confirmed Thursday. The 10-member team, which begins training next 
month, will form the nucleus of the 2000 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw, Yolanda Griffth, Natalie Williams and  
DeLisha Milton also will be named to the 10-member team. Lisa 
Leslie, Nikki McCray, Katie Smith, Dawn Staley and Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield were chosen in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All but Griffith have either world championship or Olympic  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper won a gold medal with the U.S. Olympic team in 1988 and  
was on the American team that won the bronze in 1992. She was 
selected most valuable player in the WNBA in each of the league's 
first two seasons and led the Houston Comets to the league 
championship both years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, Williams, Milton, Leslie, McCray, Smith, Staley and  
Bolton-Holifield were on the U.S. team that won the gold medal in 
the 1998 world championships. Leslie, McCray, Staley and 
Bolton-Holifield played on the 1996 Olympic team that also won the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual 12-member Olympic team will be announced next summer.  
Various players will be given a chance to train with the national 
team before the final two slots are filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Fortner, who guided the United States to last year's world  
championship, will coach the Olympic team. She most recently 
coached in the Pan American Games, where a U.S. team that had been 
together only two weeks won the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The national team will assemble Sept. 7 and play in the Olympic  
Cup in San Diego Sept. 9-12. Australia, Brazil and Poland also will 
participate in that tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-game college exhibition tour is scheduled in the fall, and  
the team will face a number of international opponents in the 
winter and spring. The players will disband when WNBA training 
camps open in May and reassemble in August after the WNBA season 
ends.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Look at $1.7M NY Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGEMONT, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton looked at a  
seven-bedroom colonial house this week that would cost $1.7 
million, about $2 million less than a house she checked out in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	The house, sheltered from the street by trees and rocky walls,  
is within walking distance of fashionable Scarsdale in southern 
Westchester County. The neighborhood is 22 miles north of Times 
Square and a half-hour by rail from Grand Central Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	The house has neighbors nearby and some weren't pleased Thursday  
at the prospect of having the first lady and would-be senator in 
their midst. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I moved here was because it was quiet,'' said  
Steven Bongiorno, a Manhattan public relations man who lives about 
a mile away. ``If she moves here, it would mean a major lifestyle 
change in what is really a sleepy hamlet: parking, press, TV, news 
conferences, you name it. ... We're talking about a major 
logistical nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a run for the U.S. Senate, must  
move to New York by Election Day 2000 to be eligible. Some say she 
should move as soon as possible to deflate any carpetbagging 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edgemont house, with a $25,000 annual tax burden, is no  
starter home. But it would be easier to swing than the $3.8 million 
estate the first lady viewed in June. The Clintons earned $504,109 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1900, the house sits on three acres -- a large parcel  
for southern Westchester County -- and has 12 rooms, including seven 
bedrooms and two dining rooms. Like the Clintons' current home, 
it's a white house. 
</P>
<P>
	It has a barn and a two-car garage but no pool. There's an  
elevator and a flagpole for Old Glory. And for husband Bill's 
hobby, four golf courses sit within a mile and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Doernbeg Real Estate in Scarsdale, which has the listing, would  
not say who the owners are. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgemont, part of the Town of Greenburgh, is known for top-notch  
schools. Town Supervisor Paul Feiner said the police force was so 
good ``Mrs. Clinton won't need the Secret Service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house was open for viewing Wednesday. When Mrs. Clinton  
arrived, other customers had to wait outside. The first lady and 
several Secret Service agents looked around, then Mrs. Clinton 
apologized to the people waiting on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the door Wednesday night said in French  
that Mrs. Clinton ``doesn't like it.'' The first lady's 
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said she did not know if Mrs. Clinton, 
who was in Washington on Thursday, had bid on the house. 
</P>
<P>
	She confirmed, however, that the Clintons have narrowed their  
house hunt to Westchester County and are down to ``several options 
... more than two.''

<HEADLINE> Former Dolphin Clayton Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former Miami Dolphins wide receiver  
Mark Clayton was arrested for failing to pay over $12,000 in child 
support and for driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton, who played with the Dolphins from 1983 through 1992,  
was arrested Wednesday while conducting personal business at the 
South Satellite Broward County Courthouse, according to a release 
issued by the Broward County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton was taken to the county jail after Broward's Support  
Enforcement Division records showed he owed $12,441.25 in unpaid 
child support. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from jail Thursday after paying $6,639.75 in  
back support payments and posting a $500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the remaining child support is not paid, Clayton will be  
notified by mail, his license may be suspended, and a warrant may 
be issued for his arrest,'' according to the sheriff's office 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old retired NFL star lives in suburban Pembroke  
Pines. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Dolphins' leading receiver in 1984, 1988, 1989 and  
1991 and still holds the team record for receiving yards in a 
season (1,389 in 1984) and most receptions (86 in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton also holds Dolphins career records for receptions (550)  
and touchdowns (81).

<HEADLINE> Hastert Stumps for GOP Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- Taking the battle over a proposed $792  
billion tax cut to the public, House Speaker Dennis Hastert urged 
taxpayers to support the GOP plan or else watch Democrats use the 
money ``to make government bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now is the time to take advantage of a projected federal  
government surplus, Hastert told about 150 blue-collar and 
management employees gathered Wednesday inside the ITW Shakeproof 
auto parts plant in this northwest Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should be able to make the decisions on how you spend  
those dollars. Whether it's for your kids' education, whether it's 
to save, whether it's to invest, or you know, if you decided to 
take a vacation, that's your business,'' Hastert said. ``It's not 
some bureaucrat in Washington that should make that decision for 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert chose the plant in his congressional district to jump  
start a grassroots push for the GOP tax package approved by the 
House and Senate last week on a largely partisan roll call. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders decided not to send the measure to the White House  
until after lawmakers return from their August recess for fear that 
President Clinton would veto it and dominate the public-relations 
war in Congress' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they have dispatched members to their districts to  
spread the message. Hastert plans a 10-day, seven-state trip next 
week to stump for Republican congressional candidates and the tax 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	His message seemed to strike a chord with many in the factory,  
who applauded repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The working people are the ones that made the excess, so why  
not give the money back instead of letting the government waste 
it?'' asked Pat Williams, a 36-year veteran of the plant who 
nevertheless was skeptical that she would ever see the benefits of 
the plan. ``It's never quite what they promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he worried the tax cut could jeopardize federal  
government programs down the line, 29-year plant veteran Gary 
Miller replied: ``That's later. We can deal with the problems 
later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert warned the workers not to believe Clinton, who argues  
the government surplus Republicans want to tap is needed to pay for 
Medicare, farm programs and other spending critical to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees the surplus as a great opportunity to make government  
bigger,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has said he would veto the tax bill, has indicated  
he does not want a confrontation with Republicans over spending 
this fall, and Hastert said, ``We're ready to sit down and talk 
with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the public TV program ``Nightly Business  
Report,'' Clinton said Wednesday there was room to negotiate a tax 
cut only after the budget priorities he has laid out have been 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position is send me a Medicare proposal; let's figure out  
what we've got to spend on other things, and what we've got to do 
to pay the debt down, and let's give the rest back to the 
taxpayers,'' Clinton said. ``Then I will be very flexible about how 
we do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill includes a 1 percent reduction in all income-tax  
rates, an easing of the tax paid by many married couples, a capital 
gains tax cut, elimination of the inheritance tax on large estates 
and a slew of tax breaks for businesses.

<HEADLINE> Red Hat Continues To Sizzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Shares of Red Hat Inc. continued to sizzle  
Thursday, closing 40 percent higher on its second day of public 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year-old vendor of Linux operating software went on the  
block Wednesday, and soared 300 percent above its $14 offer price, 
closing at $52.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Red Hat shares 
closed Thursday at $72.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's performance was the biggest price leap in at least  
two weeks among IPOs, which recently have hit a wall of investor 
nervousness about small, money-losing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat's share price Wednesday gave the Durham, N.C.-based  
company a market value of $3.8 billion -- even though Red Hat had 
sales of just $11 million and lost money last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat is the first Linux-only company to go public. Linux is  
an eight-year-old computer operating system that is a favorite of 
tech types because of its stability. Recently, it has become a 
player in the server market, used to manage the computers that run 
large networks. 
</P>
<P>
	While Linux software can be downloaded free over the Internet,  
Red Hat Linux 6.0 -- which includes a manual and some extra software 
tools -- sells for $79.95.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Candidacy Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the big political forces in Ohio --  
organized labor -- has taken a hard look at TV talk show host Jerry 
Springer and decided he could be just the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	With fame and wealth at his disposal, Springer as the Democratic  
Party's nominee could make next year's race against freshman Sen. 
Mike DeWine competitive and interesting, labor leaders said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something needs shaken up before we get the plain old,  
money-inherited, plaid-shirted DeWine again,'' said state AFL-CIO 
President William Burga. 
</P>
<P>
	The most experienced Democrats in Ohio have taken a pass on the  
chance to run against the first-term Republican. Only Richard 
Cordray, a former state representative with little statewide name 
recognition, is exploring a candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer hasn't said whether he wants to give up a life of fame,  
fortune and flying chairs, but has issued a statement saying he's 
considering it and will decide by Labor Day. In the meantime, he's 
out of the country and not available for comment, his office said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Steelworkers' state political director, Dan Martin,  
said Springer would arrive with the same irresistible political 
asset as millionaire publisher/presidential candidate Steve Forbes: 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a chance with this guy,'' he said. ``He can raise  
money and what he can't raise, he's got. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd be our Forbes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Martin said his labor friends in Cincinnati remember Springer as  
a pro-labor Democrat during terms as councilman and mayor, and 
serious, though unsuccessful candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible Springer candidacy was discussed at the Ohio  
AFL-CIO's most board meeting last week, and ``there was no 
opposition,'' said Martin, who participated in the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he would stir this party up and get people thinking that  
they could participate, they could run, too,'' Burga said from 
Columbus, Ohio. ``I think it's good that Springer's stirring the 
pot up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a Springer candidacy was first floated by an  
old friend in Cincinnati, Hamilton County Democratic Party Chairman 
Tim Burke. 
</P>
<P>
	The welcoming words from labor have been the friendliest  
response so far. 
</P>
<P>
	At an invitation-only breakfast with selected reporters, Senate  
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said ``I think he is a joke,'' and 
suggested Springer would be unwelcome in the Democratic caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, said Wednesday that he would not  
appear on the same campaign stage with a candidate Springer. ``He 
hurts people. He abuses damaged, vulnerable people for his own 
purpose. I think what he does with his TV show is despicable.''

<HEADLINE> Richter Leaving Conan O'Brien Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Richter, sidekick to Conan O'Brien on NBC's  
``Late Night,'' has a performing itch he just has to scratch. He 
plans to leave the show in May to pursue other TV and film roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happening here is the regular old entrepreneurial  
urge,'' Richter said at the end of Wednesday night's show. ``I sort 
of need to take this step for my own peace of mind and own sense of 
self-worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old said his true goal was ``to become Ned Beatty. I  
want to be a comedy character actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely know this is a risk,'' Richter said. But he  
added, ``It's not like I went to bed as a boy dreaming of being a 
sidekick on a late-night television show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richter was hired as one of the show's first writers in 1993,  
and was given the sidekick job when O'Brien and the show's original 
head writer, Robert Smigel, noticed how well the two men played off 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm losing a great co-worker and a good friend,'' O'Brien  
said, ``but you don't hire someone as talented as Andy Richter and 
not expect them to move on at some point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on a replacement.

<HEADLINE> FAA Unveils plans To Reduce Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being hammered by airline executives for  
delays this summer, the Federal Aviation Administration has 
developed a plan to help reduce such inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, in a letter to the airlines, said it will soon have  
its command center in Herndon, Va., start coordinating traffic 
flows in bad weather, eliminating conflicts between local centers 
spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FAA will let the center minimize the use of  
extra buffers that are otherwise routinely established between 
planes in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has also pledged to develop a policy in which  
airplanes held on the ground because of bad weather will be given a 
specific projected departure time. Such information can then be 
relayed to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline passengers, who have suffered through hundreds of delays  
this summer, should start seeing the effect of the changes within 
the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the FAA said a long-term improvement hinges on the  
continuation of the agency's $13 billion modernization program, as 
well as congressional approval of a plan to renew the agency for 
another five years. Included in that ``reauthorization'' bill, now 
stalled in the Senate, is language that would let the FAA start 
charging fees for some of its services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we and the airlines developed is a short-term program  
that we believe will have the effect of reducing the delays,'' 
Eliot Brenner, the agency's chief spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all agree that what's needed over the longer term is the  
FAA's steady program modernizing the system, which is why the 
long-term reauthorization is so important to us,'' Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, airlines have united in protest about air  
traffic delays, saying they are costing them money and contributing 
to rising passenger discontent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group,  
estimates the more than 308,000 air traffic control delays last 
year cost the industry $4.1 billion -- up from $3.9 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never have the on-time record we want unless the (FAA)  
can ensure that their system keeps up with growth,'' Jim Goodwin, 
chairman of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., said in Chicago 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, which runs the air traffic control system and is  
responsible for ensuring passenger safety, contends that only 3 
percent of air traffic problems are attributed to equipment 
troubles. It says three-quarters of all delays are caused by bad 
weather, especially in the summer, when thunderstorms are common. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the agency is in the midst of a long-awaited  
program to upgrade its computers and displays in en route centers 
and facilities controlling traffic near airports. The FAA is also 
studying technology that would free pilots from the limits of the 
existing system of aerial highways and let planes fly routes picked 
by the pilots, a concept called ``free flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to American Airlines President Donald Carty, which  
mirrored letters sent to other airline executives, FAA 
Administrator Jane Garvey said the agency benefited from the 
carriers' suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FAA is committed to do its part to follow through on the  
action items on which the airlines and we have agreed,'' Garvey 
wrote. ``Those actions, along with individual airline efforts to 
review and amend internal policies and procedures as appropriate, 
will lead us toward the improvements we are both seeking.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Top Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- Running back Edgerrin James, the  
surprise first-round pick of the Indianapolis Colts, ended a 20-day 
holdout Thursday when he signed a seven-year contract valued at $49 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Leigh Steinberg, announced the signing and the  
financial terms of the contract. James, who took a physical before 
signing, joined the Colts for their afternoon practice at 
Rose-Hulman Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Miami star was drafted fourth overall in April's  
draft, two picks ahead of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams. He 
missed 25 practices, a scrimmage and the Colts' opening exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts had no immediate comment on the signing.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract included a $9.5 million signing bonus and an  
additional $350,000 bonus for making the roster, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes $1.15 million in reporting bonuses over the  
life of the contract and four tiers of bonuses based on 
performance, Steinberg said. James would earn the first bonus by 
rushing for 701 yards this year. The final year of the contract 
will be voided if James reaches certain milestones within the first 
six years. They include playing in 35 percent of the offensive 
plays this upcoming season and 45 percent in future years. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' contract, by contrast, is heavily loaded with  
incentives based upon performance. His seven-year deal with an 
optional eighth year includes an $8.84 million signing bonus and 
will be worth between $11.1 million and $68.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing signals a dramatic change for James, who has spent  
summers harvesting watermelons to raise money for his family, which 
got by with the aid of food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	After he became the fourth overall pick in the draft, James  
remarked, ``It's a big world out there and a lot of people don't 
know about being poor. Growing up, I was one of those that knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James passed up his senior year of college eligibility at Miami  
to help his 2-year-old daughter and his mother, a cafeteria worker 
at Immokalee High School who raised six sons on her own and never 
earned more than $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	James did participate in the team's minicamp and voluntary  
summer camp and workouts. However, he was not able to report to 
training camp until he was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-year starter at Miami, James finished his career as the  
school's second leading rusher with 2.960 yards while making only 
17 starts. He tied the Miami school record of 35 touchdowns, 32 by 
rushing and 3 on pass receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	James' signing leaves three first-rounders who have not agreed  
to terms. Heading the list is Cincinnati quarterback Akili Smith, 
the third overall selection.

<HEADLINE>  Security High at Jewish Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jewish leaders around the nation boosted security measures and  
worried about copycat crimes following the shooting attack by a 
white supremacist on a group of children in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't feel like an isolated incident, it feels like  
somehow a little bit of a wave,'' Rabbi Shea Hecht of the National 
Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education in New York said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack reminded Bill Coleman of Akiba-Schechter Jewish Day  
School in Chicago of the string of shootings in the Midwest last 
month. The shooter, a white supremacist, targeted blacks, Jews and 
Asians, and killed two people before turning the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were injured in Tuesday's attack at the North Valley  
Jewish Community Center, including three young children and a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, turned himself in Wednesday in Las  
Vegas and told authorities he wanted the attack to be a ``wake-up 
call to America to kill Jews,'' said an FBI source, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish leaders said most of their community centers and schools  
step up security when major crimes occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things happen to the Jewish community anywhere in the  
world, as a Jew, it makes your hair stand on end,'' said Rabbi Brad 
Bloom of Temple B'nai Israel in Sacramento, Calif., one of three 
synagogues damaged by arsonists in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League in San Francisco sponsored seminars  
on security for religious groups. Tight security runs counter to 
the way religious people operate, said Jonathan Bernstein, director 
of the league's Central Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to open their institutions to anyone who wants to  
come in,'' Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Valley in suburban Grenada Hills remained closed  
Wednesday, guarded by police and security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and children nevertheless resumed their preschool and  
day-care classes, assembling next door at St. Andrews and St. 
Charles Episcopal Church. Children were sheltered there on Tuesday 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents who ordinarily would have dropped their children  
off and left decided to stay for the day's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good because my father's here,'' said 10-year-old Abby  
Dreyfuss. Her dad, Jonathan Dreyfuss, said he was confident she 
would be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here are very good people and I'm sure they'll take  
the steps necessary to make this place safe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Lieberman Giladi, an associate vice president of the  
organization that runs the center, said it was important for the 
children to return so they could see that their friends are all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see each other face to face,'' said Ms. Giladi,  
whose 5-year-old son saw two bleeding victims. ``He wanted to talk 
about his friends, talk about what happened, talk about why this 
man did this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another father, J. Eliad, said his daughter saw the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``She told me the bad guy came here and shot everybody,'' he  
said. ``It's very hard to deal with the questions that she asks 
you.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Barricaded Homeowner Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man who barricaded himself on his 14-acre estate  
for nine months in a fight over whether he had to repay a bank loan 
was sentenced Thursday to four months in prison for contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sweeney, 59, was arrested peacefully in February 1998. His  
ancestral home that once belonged to his great-grandfather -- a 
secretary of the Navy, postmaster general and U.S. ambassador -- was 
sold at auction after he defaulted on the $1.6 million loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sickened by the court and its actions,'' Sweeney said  
after the sentencing. ``Is it over? No way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney will remain free pending appeal. He was convicted of  
contempt of court in a nonjury trial in April after ignoring a 
federal order to vacate his home because he defaulted on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle has attracted the interest of activists who claim  
they were swindled by the federal government, along with a handful 
of antigovernment volunteers who helped guard the estate during the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney claims his refusal to leave his property wasn't illegal  
because the federal eviction order wasn't properly served.

<HEADLINE> Citadel To Dump Boneyard Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Say goodbye to The Boneyard.  
</P>
<P>
	Citadel's athletic department will end one of the school's more  
recent traditions when it takes down the ``Welcome To The 
Boneyard'' sign behind one end zone at Johnson Hagood Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's dig beneath part of the stadium for the remains of  
the crew of the Confederate submarine Hunley hit a little too close 
to home, athletic director Walt Nadzak said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to be seen as insensitive or disrespectful,''  
he said. ``I think most people will understand that we don't want 
to offend anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers are sprucing up the place for The Citadel's home opener  
Sept. 11 against Delaware. Before they finish, Nadzak said, the 
sign will come down. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Hurteau of The Citadel's Brigadier Foundation said he  
mentioned to Nadzak that the school didn't need the obvious jokes 
anticipated when a wartime cemetery sits atop your Boneyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are so quick to criticize us anyway,'' Hurteau said.  
``We don't need to give them anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sign went up before the 1988 season when Citadel coach  
Charlie Taaffe brought the wishbone offense to the Bulldogs. As the 
team used it to run to three NCAA Division I-AA playoff spots and 
run past high-powered opponents like South Carolina, Navy, Arkansas 
and Army, a ceremony grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Spike's Boneyard,'' Citadel coach Don Powers said.  
The mascot, a snarling Bulldog, would tack up a new bone every time 
The Citadel beat an opponent for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pretty proud of getting to put South Carolina or  
Arkansas up there,'' Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
	For a month this summer, scientists, archeologists, researchers  
and equipment converged at the stadium to excavate beneath a room 
where Citadel boosters and alumni enjoy lunch before games. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered 27 Confederate dead, including four thought to  
be part of the Hunley's crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Glenn McConnell, R-Charleston, instrumental in the recovery  
effort, said possibly two to four Confederate soldiers remain under 
light poles and support beams. A cemetery of widows and children 
may be located there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorial Stadium, later renamed Johnson Hagood Stadium, was  
built by the city in 1947 as the home field for The Citadel and 
several Charleston high schools. A monument to the soldiers was 
moved to Magnolia Cemetery, and the contractor also was asked to 
move the graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials don't know why the contractor moved only the  
headstones, leaving 39 soldiers in the ground. The stadium was 
given to The Citadel in 1963, and it wasn't until 1990 that 
historians realized several Confederate sailors were underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathon Leader, deputy state archaeologist for the state  
Institute of Archeology and Anthropology, said it was ``absolutely 
great they did this. I just hope they don't lose their connection 
to the wishbone, which has accomplished great things in football.''

<HEADLINE> Kmart Reports Higher Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp., the nation's third-largest retailer,  
said its operating profits jumped 44 percent in the second quarter, 
thanks to stronger sales at its discount department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart reported profits of $134 million, or 26 cents a share,  
excluding a one-time charge of $230 million related to the 
bankruptcy of Builders Square. In the second-quarter last year, 
Kmart had profits of $93 million, or 19 cents a share, excluding 
non-recurring charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were a penny a share higher than Wall Street  
expectations, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the charge, Kmart lost $96 million, or 15 cents a  
share, for the 13 weeks ended July 29, compared with a gain of $80 
million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with our second quarter performance,'' said  
Kmart Chairman and CEO Floyd Hall. ``In terms of sales growth, 
expense ratios and operating performance, this is the best second 
quarter and first half Kmart has achieved since 1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter totaled $8.8 billion, up 8 percent from  
$8.1 billion in the year-ago period. Sales at Kmart stores open at 
least one year were up 5.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart's stock rose 37 1/2 cents to $14.31 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart said that leases to 110 former Builders Square locations  
may become Kmart's responsibility under deals Kmart made when it 
sold the company. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Kmart lost $29 million, or 1  
cent a share, compared with net income of $127 million, or 26 cents 
a share, for the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $16.9 billion vs. $15.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Furrow Tied to Hate Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The man suspected of wounding five people  
at a Jewish community center in California has a long history with 
anti-Semitic hate groups operating in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, has ties to the Aryan Nations; had  
a relationship with the widow of the founder of The Order; and 
subscribes to the Christian Identity religious movement, which 
considers whites a superior race. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow surrendered Wednesday in Las Vegas and allegedly told  
authorities he wanted Tuesday's shootings to be ``a wake-up call to 
America to kill Jews.'' He is also charged with killing a postal 
worker the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	The sparsely populated northeastern corner of Washington and the  
panhandle of northern Idaho are hotbeds of the Christian Identity 
religion. Richard Butler, head of the Idaho-based Aryan Nations, 
said Furrow attended a few services at his church about five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A book found in a van believed abandoned by Furrow, titled ``War  
Cycles, Peace Cycles,'' was written by Richard Kelly Hoskins, ``one 
of the principal ideologues of Christian Identity,'' said Mark 
Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which 
tracks hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard-line Identity adherents believe that in order for Christ  
to return to Earth, the globe must be swept clean of satanic forces 
-- meaning Jews, homosexuals and a whole laundry list of other 
enemies,'' Potok said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's a belligerent religion. It's a religion that demands  
that its followers take up the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also believed to be an Identity member is Eric Rudolph, the man  
accused of the Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic and Atlanta 
Olympic bombings, Potok said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Christian Identity groups also are tied to the recent  
arsons at three synagogues in Sacramento, Calif., the murder of a 
gay couple near Redding, Calif., and other violent crimes across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow's actions also suggest he is a believer in the Phineas  
Priesthood, a shadowy sect of Christian Identity named for a figure 
in the Old Testament who killed a mixed-faith couple. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is violently opposed to marriages between Jews and  
gentiles and the charging of interest by banks, and seeks the 
extermination of Jews, said Michael Reynolds of the Southern 
Poverty Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we see here with Mr. Furrow would be acting out of a  
calling as a Phineas priest,'' Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, four men identified as members of the Phineas  
Priesthood set off a series of bombs at a newspaper office and a 
Planned Parenthood clinic in the Spokane area as covers for two 
bank robberies. Three men were sentenced to life in prison without 
parole and the fourth got 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was not a member of the notorious group called The Order,  
a neo-Nazi group that acquired $4 million through bank robberies 
and armored car heists in the early 1980s, but he lived for a while 
with Debbie Mathews, widow of the group's founder, Robert J. 
Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews was killed in 1984 in a shootout with federal agents on  
Whidbey Island, north of Seattle. His group also was involved in 
the 1984 murder of Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-radio host in Denver.

<HEADLINE> Pratt &AMP; Whitney To Cut 1,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Pratt &AMP; Whitney, which makes engines for  
some of the nation's top fighter jets, plans to transfer its 
military engine operations from Florida to Connecticut in a 
sweeping restructuring that includes 1,500 job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp., also said  
Thursday that it would move its jet turbine manufacturing operation 
from North Haven, Conn., to its East Hartford plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Pratt plans to move its Connecticut repair business  
to company facilities in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The 
restructuring is to be completed by next year. The Florida cuts 
will be centered at facilities in West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made considerable progress transforming Pratt into a  
lean organization, reducing costs and improving our ability to 
respond to customers,'' said Pratt president Louis R. Chenevert. 
``However, we see continuing competitive pressures which make it 
critical that we eliminate excess floor space and more closely 
match our cost structure to changing business conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. defense spending has declined, Pratt has been hit hard  
by a fall in demand for its military engines, including powerplants 
for the F-15 and F-16 fighters. The company also makes engines for 
commercial aircraft, but has been outbid by competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Nisbet, an analyst for Newport, R.I.-based JSA Research,  
Inc., said Pratt was wise to consolidate and cut costs as the 
market shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation should help the company hold down costs on its  
military and domestic contracts, Nisbet said. If anything, he said, 
the move should strengthen Pratt's link with the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials met with top Air Force and Defense Department  
officials and assured them there would be no disruptions in crucial 
military contracts, company spokesman Mark Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said 1,000 salaried employees will be among those  
trimmed from the payroll, most of them in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt workers were told of the restructuring in a series of  
plant meetings Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us don't understand why it's cheaper to go some place  
with higher living expenses and things like that,'' employee Carol 
Rinaldi said as she drove out of the West Palm Beach parking lot 
after learning of the moves. ``We have a hard time seeing the 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company currently employs more than 4,000 people in Florida.  
More than 1,000 employees will remain in West Palm Beach with the 
engine testing and space propulsion businesses based there, Pratt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 Florida employees will be offered jobs in  
Connecticut, and most of the 1,300 North Haven workers will have an 
opportunity to transfer to East Hartford, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees whose jobs are cut or who decide against moving will  
receive severance packages and help finding a new job. Sullivan 
said the number of layoffs necessary would not be known until it is 
clear how many employees will follow their jobs to new locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan said the moves are the second phase of a restructuring  
announced in 1998, with a goal of ultimately reducing 3,500 workers 
from the payroll. The first phase eliminated 2,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., also owned  
by United Technologies, announced plans to relocate its West Palm 
Beach-based flight test and S-76 helicopter operations to an as-yet 
undecided location. The company has 520 employees in West Palm 
Beach.

<HEADLINE>  Packers' Freeman Signs 1-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers have signed All-Pro  
wide receiver Antonio Freeman to a one-year tender offer, the team 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal means Freeman will be able to report to training camp  
and play for the Packers while the team and Freeman's agent, Joel 
Segal, continue to work on a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio wants to be here,'' coach Ray Rhodes said. ``I'm just  
happy they worked something out. We're going to take our time 
getting him ready to play and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman will be in camp Friday as the Packers prepare for their  
Saturday preseason opener against the New York Jets. Freeman won't 
be ready to play in that game but could see preseason action, 
Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased and excited to have Antonio in training camp,''  
general manager Ron Wolf said in a statement. ``Meanwhile, the 
parties will continue to negotiate on a long-term contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman held out through the first two weeks of training camp  
while reportedly seeking a contract worth more than $6 million 
annually, which could have made him the game's highest-paid 
receiver. Talks reportedly stalled over the amount of Freeman's 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he also signed to play for the Packers' tender  
offer of $1.153 million. Freeman then set career-highs with 84 
catches for 14 touchdowns and a league-best 1,424 yards despite 
suffering a broken jaw late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay placed its franchise player tag on Freeman after the  
season, meaning the team had the right to match any offer made to 
him. Added urgency was placed on the negotiations last week when 
Robert Brooks, the Packers' starting flanker last season, announced 
his retirement after seven injury-plagued seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want him in here before training camp,'' Rhodes said. ``It  
gives him enough time to get him ready for the season opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers have been auditioning wide receivers to play  
alongside Freeman. Veterans Bill Schroeder, Derrick Mayes and Corey 
Bradford are all expected to make the team, while Jahine Arnold and 
rookie Donald Driver are among the leading candidates for a final 
roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay players have not criticized Freeman for his holdout,  
and last month Rhodes said he understood and supported his wide 
receiver's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Moore received a five-year contract extension from the  
Lions last month that pays him $5.6 million annually. Freeman's 
contract is expected to include a signing bonus of more than $10 
million. Moore got a signing bonus between $8 million and $9 
million from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who said he only wanted to play in Green Bay, never  
seemed comfortable with his holdout. He visited his teammates 
during minicamps during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my family, man,'' he said at a June minicamp. ``I'm not  
going to turn my back on my teammates.''

him. Added urgency was placed on the negotiations last week when 
Robert Brooks, the Packers' starting flanker last season, announced 
his retirement after seven injury-plagued seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want him in here before training camp,'' Rhodes said. ``It  
gives him enough time to get him ready for the season opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers have been auditioning wide receivers to play  
alongside Freeman. Veterans Bill Schroeder, Derrick Mayes and Corey 
Bradford are all expected to make the team, while Jahine Arnold and 
rookie Donald Driver are among the leading candidates for a final 
roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay players have not criticized Freeman for his holdout,  
and last month Rhodes said he understood and supported his wide 
receiver's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Moore received a five-year contract extension from the  
Lions last month that pays him $5.6 million annually. Freeman's 
contract is expected to include a signing bonus of more than $10 
million. Moore got a signing bonus between $8 million and $9 
million from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who said he only wanted to play in Green Bay, never  
seemed comfortable with his holdout. He visited his teammates 
during minicamps during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my family, man,'' he said at a June minicamp. ``I'm not  
going to turn my back on my teammates.''

<HEADLINE>  Security High at Jewish Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jewish leaders around the nation boosted security measures and  
worried about copycat crimes following the shooting attack by a 
white supremacist on a group of children in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't feel like an isolated incident, it feels like  
somehow a little bit of a wave,'' Rabbi Shea Hecht of the National 
Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education in New York said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack reminded Bill Coleman of Akiba-Schechter Jewish Day  
School in Chicago of the string of shootings in the Midwest last 
month. The shooter, a white supremacist, targeted blacks, Jews and 
Asians, and killed two people before turning the gun on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were injured in Tuesday's attack at the North Valley  
Jewish Community Center, including three young children and a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., 37, turned himself in Wednesday in Las  
Vegas and told authorities he wanted the attack to be a ``wake-up 
call to America to kill Jews,'' said an FBI source, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish leaders said most of their community centers and schools  
step up security when major crimes occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things happen to the Jewish community anywhere in the  
world, as a Jew, it makes your hair stand on end,'' said Rabbi Brad 
Bloom of Temple B'nai Israel in Sacramento, Calif., one of three 
synagogues damaged by arsonists in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League in San Francisco sponsored seminars  
on security for religious groups. Tight security runs counter to 
the way religious people operate, said Jonathan Bernstein, director 
of the league's Central Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to open their institutions to anyone who wants to  
come in,'' Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Valley in suburban Grenada Hills remained closed  
Wednesday, guarded by police and security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and children nevertheless resumed their preschool and  
day-care classes, assembling next door at St. Andrews and St. 
Charles Episcopal Church. Children were sheltered there on Tuesday 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents who ordinarily would have dropped their children  
off and left decided to stay for the day's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good because my father's here,'' said 10-year-old Abby  
Dreyfuss. Her dad, Jonathan Dreyfuss, said he was confident she 
would be protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here are very good people and I'm sure they'll take  
the steps necessary to make this place safe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Lieberman Giladi, an associate vice president of the  
organization that runs the center, said it was important for the 
children to return so they could see that their friends are all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see each other face to face,'' said Ms. Giladi,  
whose 5-year-old son saw two bleeding victims. ``He wanted to talk 
about his friends, talk about what happened, talk about why this 
man did this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another father, J. Eliad, said his daughter saw the gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``She told me the bad guy came here and shot everybody,'' he  
said. ``It's very hard to deal with the questions that she asks 
you.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meeting With Jewish Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was to discuss the Los  
Angeles Jewish center shootings with a delegation of American 
Jewish leaders at the White House, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The private, late afternoon meeting today was scheduled before  
Tuesday's shootings, but hate crimes will be on the agenda, 
spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv did not comment on whether the president believes the  
woundings of five people at the Jewish center was a hate crime. The 
suspected gunman, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., told the FBI he 
intended the shootings as ``a wake-up call to America to kill 
Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said today the ``shootings appear to  
have been motivated by hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes represent an attack not just on individual  
victims, but also on the victims' communities. They tear at the 
very fabric of a people's life,'' she said at her weekly briefing 
for reporters at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno renewed the Clinton administration's commitment to stiffer  
gun control, and then went further. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we must seriously explore the possibility of  
requiring the licensing of all handguns,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is common sense, pure common sense, to ensure that guns are  
only in the hands of those who know how to safely and lawfully use 
them and have the capacity and the willingness to do so,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv would not address Reno's remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Clinton said it is ``deeply disturbing'' to think  
the shootings were motivated by religious hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that this latest incident will intensify our  
resolve to make America a safer place, and a place of healing 
across the lines that divide us,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton last week reiterated his appeal to Congress to pass a  
hate crimes bill that would make it easier for the Justice 
Department to investigate and prosecute such offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the measure last month and added it to a  
still pending spending bill. The House Judiciary Committee held a 
hearing on the measure last week. Critics say a federal law is 
unnecessary since states prosecute hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Booms Alters Economic Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The continued success of the American economy  
is rewriting the rules about economic expansion, unemployment and 
inflation, President Clinton says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you really get in trouble trying to predict what's  
going to happen in the global economy where already we've defied 
all the predictions,'' Clinton said in an interview for a 
syndicated business program on public broadcasting stations. 
</P>
<P>
	When he took office, the standard rule was that a couple of  
consecutive quarters of low unemployment meant inflation would 
follow, Clinton noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the threat of inflation remains a bugaboo, the  
sustained economic expansion of the past five years has not brought 
significant price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that the laws are being rewritten,'' Clinton said in  
the ``Nightly Business Report'' interview. The interview was taped 
at the White House on Wednesday for broadcast Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, that doesn't mean that the laws of economics have been  
repealed,'' Clinton said. ``It just means that our ability to 
predict is not as great as it would have been in a more stable 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it is unrealistic to expect the stock market to  
repeat its stratospheric rise of recent years -- to a Dow Jones 
average about three times what it was when he took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're just not going to have that every five years,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is not worried about small losses in the market,  
as long as what he called the ``fundamentals'' are in order: a 
government commitment to pay down debt, make long-term investments 
and expand markets while remaining fiscally responsible.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Reuse of Medical Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A piece of metal broke off a catheter and  
lodged inside the heart of a 32-year-old Kansas woman earlier this 
year -- and reignited a simmering medical controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	The catheter was disposable, supposed to be thrown away after  
its first use. Instead, critics contend it was resterilized and 
reused six times, a process they argue stressed the device until it 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Unknown to most patients, every day hospitals recycle disposable  
medical devices. They range from simple products like surgical 
clamps to complex cardiac catheters, bronchoscopes, even 
angioplasty balloons. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say this so-called reprocessing is a safe way for  
hospitals to save thousands of dollars. They argue that many 
devices are called disposable only so manufacturers can sell more 
of them, and correctly note that even brand-new catheters can 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics point to the Kansas injury and laboratory  
discoveries of dried blood or tissue in supposedly resterilized 
devices. Some products, they say, simply are too fragile or have 
too many nooks and crannies where contamination could lodge to be 
safely reused. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that put patients at big risk?  
</P>
<P>
	``The honest answer is no one can tell you,'' says Sen. Dick  
Durbin, D-Ill., who contends the government doesn't have a good way 
to track the practice's safety, and thus is pushing the Food and 
Drug Administration to crack down. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern isn't new. In 1997, the FDA said it was  
investigating reports of infections and other complaints with 
reused medical devices -- and two years later, the agency still is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA's recent testing of recycled angioplasty balloons discovered  
they can harbor dried blood after attempted cleaning, and that 
repeated uses can stretch the balloons so they don't inflate 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last spring, the FDA learned of the Kansas injury, which  
disposable device makers used to lobby for curbs on reprocessing. 
</P>
<P>
	But new catheters have been known to break, too, and companies  
that reprocess medical devices argue that saving hospitals from 
having to repurchase catheters that cost $1,000 each is important. 
</P>
<P>
	When a device can be safely reprocessed, ``to throw it away is  
an unforgivable waste of scarce health care resources,'' Pam Furman 
of the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors told a recent 
meeting on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Reusing disposable devices is legal, although hospitals assume  
any liability -- but the growing fight in Washington over the issue 
leaves consumers in the middle wondering what to think. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent health experts say consumers shouldn't panic,  
because reports of patient problems are so rare that there's no 
evidence recycled devices are a big risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just be absolutely amazed if this is a major public  
health problem and the (leading hospitals) have failed to realize 
it,'' says Dr. William Jarvis of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC, he notes, has had to investigate very few outbreaks  
linked to reused devices in the past decade. But it is about to 
study the issue in Brazil, where poverty means devices are reused 
hundreds of times more often than here, to better understand of how 
much reuse products can stand, and how best to sterilize them. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin, in contrast, has asked Congress' General Accounting  
Office to investigate reused devices here, and last week won Senate 
approval for $1 million for FDA to better monitor the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would ask at this point'' if your doctor plans to use  
reprocessed catheters or other very complex devices, Durbin said. 
``I think it's a legitimate concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Device recycling's increase is inevitable because of growing  
health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	And the FDA suggests the issue, like much in medicine, may boil  
down to evaluating reused devices on a case-by-case basis: Some may 
be fine to reuse 10 or 12 times as long as they're reprocessed 
under certain standards, while other devices might be too risky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not saying it's safe. ... We're not saying it's unsafe.  
We don't know. We're still looking at this,'' said Larry Spears, 
FDA's director of medical device enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Stay tuned, he says, because FDA will announce by October how it  
plans to further address the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to regulate based on risk,'' he said.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> CDC Unveils Anti-Tuberculosis Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In an effort to finally stamp out tuberculosis in  
the United States, federal health officials have unveiled a plan 
that calls for new methods of treating and preventing the sometimes 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's TB rate is at an all-time low of seven cases per  
100,000 people, but doctors worry that drug-resistant strains of TB 
may be spreading. That, combined with complacency and global TB 
outbreaks, could cause a resurgence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're interested in seeing tuberculosis become a disease of  
the past but it's not yet,'' said Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, deputy 
director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB 
Prevention. ``We have to be mindful that the disease is still with 
us and in some parts of the country we are not seeing the national 
decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberculosis is an airborne disease spread only through  
prolonged, close-quarters contact. In most cases, it is easily 
cured. But if the disease goes undiagnosed or untreated, it can be 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, TB cases in the United States have decreased 31  
percent, reaching a record low of 18,361 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But between 1992 and 1997, the number of TB cases increased six  
percent among people born in another country. And drug-resistant 
strains were reported in 43 states and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The outline released Thursday by a federal advisory council to  
the CDC is similar to a strategic plan to eliminate TB released in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	A TB vaccine exists, but it has proven ineffective in adults.  
The report said a new vaccine is crucial, as are long-term sources 
of private and public money to support vaccine research. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifapentine, the first new anti-TB drug in 25 years, was just  
approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration. And few 
pharmaceutical companies are involved in TB drug development. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that strategies targeting high-risk groups --  
including people with HIV and prison inmates -- have been poorly 
applied and that treatment measures are often underused or 
inadequate. Among the underused methods of treatment cited was 
directly observed therapy, which many experts have called the best 
way to eradicate TB. 
</P>
<P>
	In directly observed therapy, health workers make sure patients  
take each dose of medicine during their months of treatment. 
Patients may be required to take medicine daily or several times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Lung Association puts the costs at fighting TB at  
more than $900 million. In a statement released Thursday, the group 
urged Congress to approve $320 million to support the battle.

<HEADLINE> Playoff Ticket Prices Up 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While World Series ticket prices will remain the  
same this year after doubling last season, fans will pay as much as 
40 percent more to attend the league championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland became the first team to announce its postseason  
ticket prices, saying Thursday the top price of a ticket for the 
league championship series will be $85. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a 42 percent increase from last year's top of $60 and 70  
percent above the $50 charged for the best seats in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland is charging up to $50 for the first round division  
series, an increase of 35 percent from $37 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the World Series, box seats will remain at $150 and $120,  
with reserved seats at $100 and $85, bleachers and general 
admission at $40 and standing room at $25. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, teams charge higher for premium seats. The New York  
Yankees charged $700 a seat for the front-row Legends Boxes last 
year and $300 for their box seats with waiter service. The Yankees' 
postseason ticket plan for this year has not been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, most Series box seats cost $75, while reserved seats  
were $50 and general admission $30. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner's office told teams its league championship  
ticket prices should range from $40 to $75 this year. Last year, 
the commissioner's office set specific prices, saying box seats 
should sell for $60, reserved seats for $45 and general admission 
and bleachers for $30. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's top price is higher because Jacobs Field has many  
high- and low-priced seats with relatively few in the middle range. 
The Indians are charging $70 for lesser box seats for the league 
championship, while reserved seats will cost $45 and $35, with 
standing room and general admission at $25. 
</P>
<P>
	For the division series, the commissioner's office gave teams a  
range of $17 to $35, a slight change from last year's range of 
$17.50 to $30. Cleveland is selling tickets for $50, $40, $35, $25, 
$20 and $15. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Bowl tickets cost $400 (luxury suites) and $325 last year,  
a $50 hike. Ticket prices for January's game in Atlanta have not 
been set, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBA and NHL, teams set their own postseason ticket  
prices. The top tickets for the NBA Finals this year cost $2,700 
per game in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Stanley Cup finals, Dallas had a top price of $350 and  
Buffalo had a high of $111.

<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The son of G. Gordon Liddy, the former  
Watergate burglar turned radio host, is considering a run for an 
Arizona congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix attorney said this week he is ``testing the waters''  
after some Republican Party members expressed concern about the 
GOP's ability to retain the seat the incumbent Rep. Matt Salmon 
plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came to me and I've agreed to look at it,'' Liddy told  
The Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Liddy met Tuesday with Salmon in what Tribune sources described  
as a courtesy call and chance to get Salmon's assessment of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon has been helping another Republican, Goldwater Institute  
executive director Jeff Flake, by arranging ``meet and greet'' 
sessions between Flake and potential donors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a pretty darn good field, but there's always room  
for more. Kind of like Jell-O,'' Salmon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon's congressional district includes Tempe, west Mesa and  
parts of Scottsdale, Chandler and Phoenix. It has a Republican 
majority, so competition is likely to be fiercest among the GOP 
hopefuls. Liddy lives outside the 1st Congressional District, but 
residency is not required to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Liddy moved to Scottsdale about a year ago after three years as  
deputy counsel with the Republican National Committee. But the 
37-year-old concedes his father's notoriety could both help and 
hurt him. 
</P>

<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama's Republican presidential straw  
poll, advertised as ``The Bellwether of the South'' and the first 
up after Iowa's, may simply be an indicator of how little interest 
presidential candidates have in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no presidential candidate has committed to appear at the  
GOP's Alabama straw poll Aug. 28 in Birmingham, and several of the 
top names already have said they aren't coming -- Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush, former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, publisher Steve 
Forbes, Arizona Sen. John McCain and conservative activist Gary 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Bush and Dole said the candidates are  
participating in the Iowa straw poll Saturday because it is a 
political tradition, but aren't going to any others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The straw polls don't generate delegates. They are not the  
most efficient way to campaign,'' Dole spokeswoman Chris Hawes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, state GOP Chairman Winton Blount and members of  
the party staff are going to Iowa this weekend to try to stir up 
interest among the candidates and national media, party executive 
director Chris Neeley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if no candidates show up, the party will go ahead with the  
straw poll for 3,000 people because it will produce money and 
membership lists for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Blount announced Alabama's first straw poll in March, calling it  
``the South's first stop in the road to the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not working out that way, in part because Iowa has  
become a make-or-break event for some candidates.

<HEADLINE> No Owner, but Penguins Sign Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins don't have a new owner  
yet, but are quickly getting most of their unsigned players under 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Ian Moran was the latest to reach terms, signing a  
two-year contract worth $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Robert Lang reached terms this week on a contract worth  
$1.95 million and forward Alexei Kovalev signed for $4.6 over two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins general manager Craig Patrick is operating under a $30  
million player personnel budget drawn up by Mario Lemieux, who has 
yet to close on his purchase of the bankrupt team. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick earlier signed defenseman Jiri Slegr to a $2.3 million,  
two-year contract and defenseman Sven Butenschon to a $385,000, 
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Matthew Barnaby was awarded a $1 million salary Thursday  
after taking his case to arbitration. Center Martin Straka is to

<HEADLINE> Millenium's Final Friday the 13th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Margaret Downey wants you to limbo under a  
ladder, waltz with a person costumed in a black-cat outfit and 
break as many mirrors as you can. 
</P>
<P>
	And she says the more superstitious you are, the better -- it is,  
after all, the last Friday the 13th of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Friday the 13th is complete bunk, it's nonsense,'' said  
Downey, organizer of the Anti-Superstition Carnival in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar events were planned in Los Angeles and Buffalo, N.Y.,  
part of an effort organized by the Buffalo-based Center for Inquiry 
International to debunk superstitions associated with Friday the 
13ths. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of our bread-and-butter event,'' said the center's  
Chris Mooney. ``We have this sort of residual fear of Friday the 
13th, and it would be a good thing to try and clear this up a 
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, Downey is opening up the carnival to the public for  
the first time. The past two years, it was attended only by members 
of the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	To poke fun at the superstitions, organizers will hold limbo  
dances under a ladder, toss mirrors and play superstition trivia 
games -- all in the name of helping friggatriskaidekaphobes, or 
those who fear Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 members of the anti-superstition Friday the 13th club  
were to meet today, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll meet, go under our ladders, open our umbrellas rain or  
shine, throw around some salt and knock on wood,'' said club member 
Murray Saltzman, 68. He might show up at the carnival tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds interesting. I guess it's not bad luck to attend to  
two of these events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Fredericksburg, Va., the Somerset Golf Club has taken a  
drastic step to mollify golfers who insist their longest drives 
inexplicably vanish from the 13th fairway and balls drop out of 
nowhere on the 13th green. 
</P>
<P>
	Hole No. 13 has been eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, that will do the job,'' head pro Don Kramer said,  
pointing to a paper 14 taped over the 13 on a sign near the tee. 
The succeeding holes have been renumbered so golfers now play 
through the 19th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer claims Somerset is the first course in the country to  
eliminate a 13th hole. And as far as National Golf Foundation 
spokeswoman Judy Thompson knows, he's right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has come up and said it's stupid,'' Kramer said. After  
all, he said, many hotels have no 13th floor and some airlines skip 
the 13th row. 
</P>
<P>
	Some look to Norse mythology for the source of 13 phobia.  
According to the myth, an evil god crashed a party attended by 12 
other Norse gods and killed one of them. Others say 13 became a bad 
omen because there were 13 diners at the Last Supper. 
</P>
<P>
	President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the superstition so  
seriously, he would have his secretary sit down to make 14 when it 
appeared 13 people would be dining at the White House, said Thomas 
Fernsler, a professor at Mansfield University in Mansfield, Pa., 
and an expert on things 13. 
</P>
<P>
	At Somerset, rumors about the 13th hole could be rooted in the  
local legend that a unit of Confederate soldiers experienced freak 
accidents while crossing the land during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	David Swales isn't sure, but he has his own tale of the  
inexplicable from hole No. 13. The course's management consultant 
was walking across the green in April when a ball hit him on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was nobody else on the golf course that I could see,''  
Swales said. ``It was pretty weird.''

<HEADLINE> Steeler's Stewart Relearns Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The fullback and tight end stay on the field  
more, the backup wide receivers come on the field less. First down 
isn't always a Jerome Bettis carry. Third down isn't automatically 
a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	This new Pittsburgh Steelers offense is much different to  
quarterback Kordell Stewart, who is spending training camp learning 
his third offense in four years -- and learning why everything went 
so wrong last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first glimpse of how well Stewart is assimilating new  
offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride's system will come when the 
player formerly known as Slash plays the first quarter Friday night 
against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Stewart himself doesn't know what to expect -- either from  
himself or Steelers fans, who grew increasingly agitated as Stewart 
failed to lead a single touchdown drive during a winless final 
month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's No. 10 jersey was by far the Steelers' biggest selling  
merchandise item a year ago, but those sales have nose dived as 
dramatically as his quarterback rating did last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the response is going to be,'' Stewart said.  
``Hopefully, it will be positive, but I have no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart likes that he is throwing the deep pass much more than  
he did a year ago, when coordinator Ray Sherman never did seem 
comfortable running a system left over from the Chan Gailey days. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Steelers coach Bill Cowher is letting Gilbride  
install his own system, rather than asking him to adapt to an 
offense that was already in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have more options with his offense,'' Stewart said. ``It  
is more open than it was last year. As far as the actual routes in 
the passing game, that is something I like more. You give guys more 
of an opportunity to get open. As opposed to two, now there are 
three or four trying to get open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are no more than three receivers on the field at any  
time. Gilbride has scrapped the third-down offense that often 
called for Bettis, the team's most reliable weapon, and tight end 
Mark Bruener to come off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Learning a new offense always takes time, but Stewart seems to  
be grasping it quickly, Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can all see what it is going to be,'' Cowher said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even if Stewart doesn't always see it every day.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some days I go out and I hit the passes,'' Stewart said.  
``Then, all of a sudden, you have your off days. The main thing I 
want to work on is being consistent. If I can get the consistency 
level up to par, I think that is when we will be OK as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart often seemed agitated and confused in training camp a  
year ago, but has displayed no such signs this summer. Cowher has 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure we expedite this process as quickly as  
possible without any undue pressures on him,'' Cowher said. ``From 
a standpoint of direction, this is a direction we all need to go. 
That is a very positive sign.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Casinos Win $8.5B in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A trio of new megaresorts in Las Vegas helped  
Nevada casinos win $8.5 billion from gamblers in fiscal 1999 -- a 
7.9 percent gain over the previous year and the strongest growth in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Gaming Control Board said Thursday the opening of the  
Bellagio in October, Mandalay Bay in March and The Venetian in May 
gave casinos their best fiscal year since fiscal 1994, when 
winnings were up 10.4 percent. During that period, the Luxor, MGM 
Grand and Treasure Island opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does appear that when they build these new properties, the  
type we have had come on line, it does tend to create an increased 
demand in the Las Vegas market,'' said Russ Guindon of the control 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown of the $8.5 billion total won in the 12 months ended  
June shows that slots accounted for $5.5 billion, or about 
two-thirds. The average during the '90s has been about 62 percent, 
and for fiscal 1999 the slot win hit a high of 64.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarter slots accounted for 45 percent of all the money won by  
slots, followed by $1 slots with 26.2 percent of the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Table games accounted for $3 billion of the total, led by  
blackjack which accounted for 35.4 percent of the live game win, a 
slight increase over the prior year's percentage. Baccarat 
accounted for nearly 17 percent of the 1998-99 table game winnings, 
about the same as the year before.

<HEADLINE> Russia Expects Better Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia expects a better harvest this year compared  
to last year's drought-reduced crop, but still plans to import 8.9 
million to 9.5 million tons of feed grain, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's grain harvest of 53 million tons was the lowest in  
decades, prompting Russia to seek food aid from the United States 
and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Agriculture Minister Anatoly Mikhalev said at a  
news conference Thursday that Russia wouldn't have to import grain 
for human consumption this year, and the harvest was expected to 
reach around 66 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent analysts have previously forecast this year's grain  
harvest as only marginally better at 56 million tons as a result of 
a cold snap in May followed by weeks of drought in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, locusts have hit central Russia and Siberia,  
devastating crops there. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem which may affect the harvest is a sharp rise in  
gasoline prices and fuel shortages in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered Cabinet members  
Thursday to take urgent steps to provide farms with sufficient 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We responded inefficiently to fuel price hikes,'' Putin said.  
``We must harvest grain, otherwise we will be forced to buy it.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Squabbling Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Whoever first described Tom Lehman as  
golf's version of Everyman had no idea just how accurate he was. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sick of this,'' Lehman said, ``I could just barf.''  
</P>
<P>
	Anybody within a par-5 of the PGA Championship on Thursday had  
to feel pretty much the same way. The squabbling over how to spend 
profits from next month's Ryder Cup continued so loud for so long 
it threatened to give charity a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
	And it disrupted the final major of the golfing season as surely  
as the lightning that crackled over the horizon in late afternoon 
and forced a 47-minute delay of the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, at least, it didn't matter whose side you were on.  
The battle pitting the PGA of America and Ryder Cup captain Ben 
Crenshaw against a dissident faction within his own team has 
degenerated into one of those fights where it's a shame that 
somebody has to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days ago, Jim Awtrey, chief executive of the PGA of America,  
emerged from a closed-door meeting with Crenshaw and the team and 
boasted that ``everybody was on the same page.'' So naturally, a 
day later, Crenshaw ripped it to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can't show up and play for your country and this is  
not reward enough,'' Gentle Ben thundered, ``that's when my heart 
bleeds for the game of golf. It's sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then, in an impetuous moment, Crenshaw raised the ante by  
identifying the dissidents at Tuesday's failed peacemaking session 
-- David Duval, Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson. The 
last name was the only surprise; the first three had staked out 
their positions publicly for a while now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said 10 words, maybe 20 words,'' Duval said. ``Then I sat  
and listened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't back down from his assertion, first made in Golf  
Digest magazine, that the players should be able to direct some of 
the $17 million in profits from the Ryder Cup to charities of their 
choice. But Duval did admit that characterizing the event as an 
exhibition might have been a poor choice of words. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, though, didn't back down from anything he'd said. Just  
the opposite. Asked why he kept referring to the Ryder Cup as an 
exhibition, he fixed his questioner calmly and asked a question of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a winner's check?''  
</P>
<P>
	Though Crenshaw was clearly winning in the court of public  
opinion, it must have occurred to him sometime around the middle of 
the afternoon that this was how ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' got 
started. So he tried to eat his words before the players made him 
walk the plank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I misspoke,'' Crenshaw said.  
</P>
<P>
	That was almost certainly a misstatement itself. What he  
probably meant to say was that he should have kept his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was frustrated,'' Crenshaw went on. ``It was my mistake. I'm  
from a different generation. The Ryder Cup means quite a lot of a 
lot of us. I want to continue to see that from both sides of the 
Atlantic. I probably got upset because I felt people weren't as 
excited about it as I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a generation gap, to be sure, but it is less about age  
and more about an event that has grown from a sparsely attended, 
money-losing animal in Crenshaw's heyday to an overhyped, 
pressure-packed cash cow today. 
</P>
<P>
	The money has swelled to the point where the PGA, a  
not-for-profit operation, has gone out of its way to stress how 
responsibly those profits are distributed -- without offering to 
show anybody the books. The players, meanwhile, talk less about 
flag and country than they do about charitable tax write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting each other to stake out the higher ground, they've only  
succeeded in raising the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey griped about magazine reports the Ryder Cup would bring  
in gross revenues of $63 million and a $17 million profit for the 
PGA, but has done nothing to disprove them. Included in that 
operating budget are administrative costs of about $40 million, and 
you'd almost certainly lose money betting there aren't performance 
bonuses tucked somewhere inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents, meanwhile, have promised to donate any proceeds  
they receive to charity. But that overlooks the considerable 
write-offs people in their tax brackets covet. And then there's the 
question of the donations themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	For playing in the President's Cup, an event similar to the  
Ryder Cup, the PGA Tour donated $100,000 to charity on behalf of 
each player who made the team. O'Meara directed a share of his to 
the Lake Highland Preparatory School, which at least one of his 
children just happens to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	There is more than enough time to get the lawyers and  
accountants together to slug it out before the Ryder Cup actually 
begins. At the moment, the behavior on both sides is headed down 
such an unseemly road it makes you wish they would just shut up and 
play -- a suggestion that Lehman, still hoping to make the Ryder Cup 
team, offered at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all be ashamed of ourselves,'' he said, ``to bring  
this up now.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. To OK Autogrill-Marriott Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italy's Autogrill, which controls Europe's  
largest restaurant group catering to travelers, said Thursday that 
U.S. antitrust authorities had pledged to approve its planned 
purchase of Host Marriott Services Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill SpA last month offered to buyout Host Marriott for the  
equivalent of $529 million in cash, at $15.75 a share. Host 
Marriott's board unanimously approved the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust authorities said they have no plans to oppose the  
acquisition and will formally approve the deal shortly, Autogrill 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethesda-based Host Marriott, a major presence in U.S. airports,  
is the U.S. leader in restaurant concessions, operating in almost 
200 locations. It has concessions in 18 of the nation's 20 largest 
airports and has the rights to the Burger King, Pizza Hut and 
Starbucks brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill, controlled by the apparel retailer Benetton, said the  
merger of the two companies would make it the world's biggest 
restaurant operator catering to travelers. It would have activities 
in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill has 652 restaurants and bars in Europe. It recently  
won the rights to use the Burger King brand in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans to operate in five main areas: highway restaurants,  
airports, shopping centers, railway stations and quick-service 
urban outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the combined sales of the two groups reached an  
equivalent of over $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Autogrill said that Host Marriott shareholders have until Aug.  
26 to tender their shares. The Italian company said that its offer 
is conditional based on the tendering of at least two-thirds of 
Host Marriott's shares.

<HEADLINE> Co-Workers Mourn Slain Mailman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At the post office where Joseph Ileto worked,  
the flag flew at half-staff. And his co-workers wept when they 
learned that the man suspected in the Jewish community center 
shooting confessed to his slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	A substitute carrier who took the routes of sick or vacationing  
co-workers, the 39-year-old Ileto had just started walking a mail 
route in the city's Chatsworth section when he was gunned down in a 
driveway and left to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Postal  
Service spokesman David Mazer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto had worked for the Postal Service for two years. His  
colleagues ``really liked him. He seemed to be a happy-go-lucky 
kind of guy, always smiling,'' Mazer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were no witnesses to his slaying Tuesday,  
authorities said he was shot to death by Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. 
about an hour after the white supremacist opened fire in a nearby 
Jewish community center, wounding three boys, a receptionist and a 
teen-age camp counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was charged by federal prosecutors Wednesday with murder  
and illegal possession of a firearm in Ileto's death. Authorities 
have not specified what they think the motive was. 
</P>
<P>
	At his mother's home in suburban Monterey Park, sister Raquel  
Ileto said her brother was a devoted family man who cared for their 
mother and was willing to help when his siblings needed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't come any nicer,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United  
States when he was 14, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the shooting was a hate crime, ``I want justice done,'' Ms.  
Ileto said. ``It's sad that there are people out there that think 
that way.''

<HEADLINE> Barney Loses Lawsuit Over Lookalikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- It's not easy being purple -- especially  
when you're surrounded by wannabes. Just ask Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled Wednesday against Lyons Partnership, which  
licenses Barney products and accused Morris Costumes of renting and 
selling purple, Barneylike animal costumes under different names. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons sought an injunction preventing Morris Costumes from  
renting or selling the costumes, as well as $300,000 for 
infringement of its copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Graham Mullen ruled that a Duffy the Dragon  
costume didn't infringe on Barney's copyright but two other 
costumes did because they were more similar to Barney. But he said 
Morris Costumes didn't infringe willfully, so Lyons couldn't 
collect damages in its 1997 lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen denied the injunction request, noting that Morris  
Costumes had already stopped marketing the Hillary and Purple Dino 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons has sued or plans to sue at least 700 costume shops and  
other retailers in 20 states, claiming copyright infringement. 
Lyons said the costumes will tarnish Barney's image if people 
wearing them are seen smoking, drinking and swearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been photographs in newspapers of a person in a  
bogus Barney costume with the head off smoking a cigarette,'' Lyons 
spokeswoman Kelly Lane has said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no beef with Barney,'' said Jay Bilas, the lawyer who  
helped represent Morris Costumes. ``But the people behind Barney 
acted like bullies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barney is a 6-foot, grinning, green-spotted purple dinosaur who  
sings and dances for preschoolers on the top-rated PBS show 
``Barney and Friends.'' About 12 million people see the show each 
week.

<HEADLINE> Streaking Mystics Eye Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year ago, the Washington Mystics couldn't  
wait for their humbling inaugural WNBA season to end. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, riding a franchise-record five-game winning streak, the  
team that limped to a forgettable 3-27 record in 1998 is eyeing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics (11-17), who have four games left and are within  
reach of the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot, have made a 
stunning turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really do believe that we are going to win,'' coach Nancy  
Darsch said. ``We do believe that when it's a tight game that we'll 
find a way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystics made the most of a bad situation following their  
dismal debut last summer. Those losses yielded the top pick in the 
WNBA draft, which they used to select forward Chamique Holdsclaw, 
who led Tennessee to three consecutive NCAA titles from 1996-98. 
</P>
<P>
	By teaming Holdsclaw with guard Nikki McCray, the league's  
fourth-leading scorer last year, Washington got what it lacked in 
its rookie season: the ability to score from the perimeter or from 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Darsch, the team's third coach in two years, quickly gutted the  
Mystics and remade the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four players from the inaugural season remain on the  
roster. Holdsclaw led a group of newcomers that included several 
refugees from the defunct American Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Holdsclaw and McCray leading the way, no one expected  
such a rebound from a team that didn't win back-to-back games for 
the first time until July. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only a few people left from last year, so this is  
pretty much a new start,'' said Holdsclaw, who has averaged 21.2 
points and 8.4 rebounds during the five-game streak. ``This team 
goes into every game as underdogs and we go out and play that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, who has averaged 20.4 points and hit 12 of 27 3-pointers  
during the resurgence, said opponents err if they assume the 
Mystics boast only two offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest difference is that we have system now that allows  
everybody to shoot the ball. ... It's not always just me and 
Chamique scoring,'' McCray said. ``And we actually have better 
players here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdover center Murriel Page leads the WNBA in field goal  
percentage. Newcomer Andrea Nagy, a point guard with ABL 
experience, is a ballhandler who can run the floor. The bench is 
stronger and deeper and players are willing to accept specific 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's more committed,'' Holdsclaw said. ``We're playing  
with passion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-game streak includes victories over three teams in  
front of the Mystics in the East -- Detroit, Orlando and 
division-leading New York, which has dropped three games to 
Washington this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other victories came against last-place Cleveland, including  
an Aug. 8 win in which the Mystics held the Rockers to 45 points, a 
WNBA low this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to finish strong and finish on a high, whatever  
that may be -- if that's the playoffs or not,'' Darsch said. 
``There's too many factors involved right now to put must-win 
pressure on ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mystics are suddenly growing accustomed to winning.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot,'' McCray said.  
``We want to finish this season strong.''

<HEADLINE> Code Cracker Worries Cryptographers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *BY JEFF DONN   	
</P>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- A developer of one of the most  
widespread computer encryption systems said Thursday he has 
designed a computer that could crack open a file encoded using the 
most common form of data encryption in only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	If built -- at an estimated cost of about $2 million -- such a  
computer could jeopardize the privacy of the bulk of electronic 
commerce as practiced today, according to cryptographers at the 
conference where the design was shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Most highly sensitive military, banking and other data are  
protected by stronger encryption keys beyond its reach. The 
commonly used weaker keys, though, would become ``easy to break for 
large organizations,'' said cryptographer Adi Shamir of the 
Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	He developed both the new computer design and helped invent the  
widespread coding system -- known as RSA public-key encryption -- 
that it attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamir spoke at the opening of a two-day conference of more than  
120 cryptography experts from around the world at Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer scientists said his work underscores the growing  
vulnerability of the most commonly used short form of RSA keys, 
which consists of just 512 bits. The key -- a sequence of 1s and 0s, 
or bits -- unlocks the secret coding of a computer transmission so 
it can be deciphered. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamir dubs his idea for the computer Twinkle, which stands for  
The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine and also refers to the 
twinkle of its light emitting diodes. The 6-by-6-inch optical 
computer would measure the light from diodes to perform 
mathematical calculations solving 512-bit RSA encryption keys 
faster than ever -- within two or three days. An effort in February 
to solve shorter, easier 465-bit keys took hundreds of computers 
and several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamir first informally showed a prototype of his device at a  
conference in Prague, the Czech Republic, in May. He publicly 
outlined its workings at length for the first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twinkle is a little out there, but it looks like it's  
buildable to me,'' said Seth Goldstein, an expert in computer 
architecture at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized crime, friendly and unfriendly governments, research  
institutions and others might take an interest in such a project, 
conference participants suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, users of 512-bit keys ``should be worried,'' said  
Christof Paar, a computer engineer at Worcester Polytechnic 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the current state of the art, it is not secure,'' added Bob  
Silverman, a research scientist at Bedford, Mass.-based RSA 
Laboratories, a division of RSA Data Security, which Shamir 
co-founded but where he no longer works. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer keys, such as 1,024-bit, are already employed for many  
sensitive communications. But, out of intelligence and other 
concerns, the U.S. government requires special permission to export 
software with the longer keys. The most popular browsers are 
normally set to just 512 bits. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Snow, a technical director for information security at the  
National Security Agency, spoke to the conference Thursday about 
weak quality assurance in commercial security products, but 
declined to answer press questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer keys are harder to set up and take more computer power to  
operate. Such power may be scarce in the wireless telephones, home 
appliances and other computerized conveniences of the future, 
cryptographers said.

<HEADLINE> Clark Charged in Minor League Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	O'FALLON, Mo. (AP) -- Former major league star Jack Clark was  
charged with assaulting a police officer following a bench-clearing 
brawl during a minor league game that resulted in 14 suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, manager of the River City Rascals of the Class A Frontier  
League, turned himself in to O'Fallon police Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm Fichman, manager of the Johnstown (Pa.) Johnnies, was  
charged with failing to obey a police officer. He was arrested 
following Tuesday night's brawl after he refused to leave the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were released after posting $300 bond.  
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to Ozzie Smith Sports Complex in suburban St.  
Louis after the brawl began. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Fallon Police Chief Steve Talbott said the 20-minute fight  
started after Johnnies batter Justin Headley was struck in the back 
by a pitch from Randy Eversgerd in the top of the the eighth. 
Rascals batters Jim Schmidt, Aaron Jawawroski and Dan Graham had 
been hit earlier by Landon Hessler. 
</P>
<P>
	Rascals general manager Pat Daly said there was a lot of tension  
in the game because the two teams are fighting for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires called the game after the fights, giving the Rascals a  
9-4 victory and putting them two games ahead of the Johnnies. 
</P>
<P>
	No serious injuries were reported to police. No other charges  
were expected, Talbott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams played again Wednesday night in O'Fallon. But they  
were without Clark and Fichman, who were suspended by the league, 
along with six members of each team. The terms of their suspensions 
varied but were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1985-87, said  
Wednesday he had apologized to police. He said there were so many 
people on the field that he didn't realize he was swinging at an 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Eversgerd was suspended, as was Graham, his team's catcher. Also  
suspended from the Rascals were infielder Dustin Rogelstad, 
outfielder Kevin Pitts, shortstop Jason Rakers and catcher Bill 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Hessler was suspended along with three of his teammates and two  
of his coaches: pitcher Brian Jollise, designated hitter Gabe 
Memmert, center fielder Mike Pilger, batting coach Tom Tornincasa 
and pitching coach Tom Donovan.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Cameras Forge Era of Voyeurism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forget ``Candid Camera'' -- you might be on  
``voyeurcam'' right now, or even on ``bathroomcam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, many of your private moments could be playing on the  
Internet or someone's VCR, thanks to technological advances that 
have allowed tiny, affordable video cameras to fall into the hands 
of people with a penchant for peeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke detectors, exit signs, cellular phones, stuffed animals --  
almost anything can hold a hidden camera, spawning a troubling new 
market in voyeurism, with Internet entrepreneurs selling videotapes 
for home viewing or charging for sneak peeks on their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is hard to stop. The cameras are hard to find, and  
authorities are not always sure what to do about them when they do 
find them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay, a former college athlete who spoke on condition that he not  
be identified further, knows all about it: A video of him changing 
in a locker room showed up on an Internet site advertising tapes of 
``hot younger dudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's ridiculous that it's so easy to just put this on  
the Internet,'' he said. ``It's obviously a violation of privacy 
and they use us to sell videos -- of us -- for their monetary gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay is one of 28 people who filed a lawsuit in Cook County  
Circuit Court last month against the makers and distributors of the 
videotapes, which were made in locker rooms at Northwestern 
University, Illinois State, Eastern Illinois and the University of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs want unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	``What you have going on all over the place now is people who  
are just kind of planting cameras everywhere they can find in 
places that are at least theoretically public and then using them 
however they want,'' said Lauren Weinstein of Vortex Technology in 
Woodland Hills, Calif., who has been involved with the Internet 
since its first nonmilitary uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``That can be something as disruptive as someone who is hiding a  
little video camera with mirrors on their shoe and shooting 
pictures up skirts in the mall or people who put cameras in private 
places to try to get their jollies or to sell them,'' said 
Weinstein, who moderates an online discussion group called the 
Privacy Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes of Jay and the other athletes came to light when  
someone making a hidden-camera tape in a locker room got scared off 
and left behind a bag with his camera and tapes with names like 
``Voyeur Time'' and ``Straight Off the Mat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What legal recourse Jay and others like him have is unclear.  
Laws vary from state to state. Prosecutors are sometimes reluctant 
to bring charges without laws specifically targeting surreptitious 
videotaping or posting such tapes on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	People are left with little recourse when tapes are made in  
secret, marketed in niche magazines or Web sites and then ``sold 
from some offshore island somewhere,'' Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than give up, Jay said he plans to make people aware  
of what's happening. He said he's more careful now when he changes 
in a locker room. He looks for bags pointing toward the showers and 
lets others know what happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone's son or daughter can be on the Internet; anyone's  
brother or sister can be on the Internet,'' he said. ``That's 
rather disgusting when you think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of Harvard University Law  
School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said inexpensive 
hidden cameras are part of a ``third wave'' of technological 
advances that are changing how we live -- the first two being 
inexpensive computer processors and inexpensive computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	He said society must recognize that small-camera technology  
exists and decide what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Act early or you may lose your chance,'' he said. ``You may  
end up in a world you do not want.''

<HEADLINE> Geneva Convention Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- International figures today marked the 50th  
anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Conventions and appealed 
for atrocities and war crimes to be made a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. chief Kofi Annan and Prince Hassan of Jordan were among  
those who signed a declaration urging combatants to respect the 
treaties, which protect civilians, the injured and prisoners during 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	The four conventions were signed in the Alabama Room at Geneva's  
town hall on Aug. 12, 1949, and have since been adopted by 188 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's participants went to the same room today to sign the  
appeal, which calls on all nations to work to eradicate war and to 
ensure that those who are not fighting, especially civilians, are 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal called for a respect for human dignity and insisted  
that war should not be treated as inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced that disregard for these principles sets the  
stage for war and that respecting them during wartime facilitates 
the restoration of peace,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said civilians have more and more become targets during  
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flagrant violations of international humanitarian law --  
the wholesale expulsion of an entire people from their native land, 
summary and arbitrary executions, mutilation, rape ... have taken 
place not as the effect of war but as the essence of warfare,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Annan added, the Geneva Conventions were being given more  
life and relevance by the creation of the international tribunal 
for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan said, ``Human rights are the common possession of all  
members of the human family, regardless of differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremonies are being treated not as a celebration but as an  
opportunity to mark the successes of the treaties and to look at 
how they can be improved. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reference to the anniversary, Pope John Paul II on  
Wednesday noted ``that minimum protection of dignity guaranteed to 
every human being under international human rights laws is too 
often violated for military or political purposes.''

<HEADLINE> Daewoo To Keep Only Car Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's ailing Daewoo group will  
be allowed to retain only its automobile-related operations after 
its restructuring is completed, a top government official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All Daewoo units that can be separated from the group will be  
spun off and sold by the end of this year,'' Lee Hun-jae, chairman 
of the Financial Supervisory Commission, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is a government agency in charge of South Korea's  
corporate and financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Its decision means that the second-largest South Korean  
conglomerate must sell or spin off most of its money-making units 
to repay its total debts of about 57 trillion won ($48 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Subsidiaries expected to be affected by the decision include the  
group's cash cow brokerage, electronic, telecommunications and 
construction units. They would be spun off and put up for sale by 
the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's remarks came amid concerns that a slow-paced restructuring  
of debt-ridden Daewoo is eroding foreign investors' confidence in 
the South Korean economy as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's battered economy was bailed out by the  
International Monetary Fund in late 1997 after jittery foreign 
investors rushed to convert their stocks into cash and swiftly 
withdrew from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo narrowly escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever  
bankruptcy when creditors agreed in June to delay repayment of $8.3 
billion in short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion 
in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo put up $8.42 billion of stock and real estate  
as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubts persisted over Daewoo's commitment and its ability to  
sell off dozens of affiliates within six months. 
Government-controlled creditor banks are pressuring Daewoo to sell 
all profitable subsidiaries except its core Daewoo Motors Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo originally had planned to submit its restructuring plan  
to creditor banks by Wednesday. That plan was postponed until this 
weekend after Daewoo refused to set a timetable to sell or spin off 
some of its key profitable units. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Daewoo signed a memorandum of understanding with  
General Motors Corp. of the United States to form an alliance in 
auto manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo hopes that the move will lead to a deal to infuse fresh  
outside capital into its core car business.

<P>
	GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- General Mills Inc. said Thursday it  
has purchased Milwaukee-based Gardetto's Bakery Inc., a 
family-owned company that makes and sells baked snack mixes and 
flavored pretzels nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills, which did not disclose the terms of the deal,  
will now have a stronger presence in vending machines, convenience 
stores and other non-grocery outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We plan to build the Gardetto's brand with innovative  
marketing, expanded distribution and development of new snack 
varieties,'' Steve Sanger, General Mills chairman and chief 
executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills will continue production at the Gardetto's plant  
in Milwaukee, and expects to retain most of the company's 235 
employees. Gardetto's Bakery had $100 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	John Gardetto, 64, president of the snack company his father  
founded in 1932, plans to retire.

<HEADLINE> BET Plans Web Site Aimed at Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to draw more black Americans to the  
Internet, cable network operator BET Holdings announced an 
ambitious new Web site today with backing from four major media and 
technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new site, to be called BET.com, is the latest effort to  
narrow the ``digital divide'' between whites and minority groups, 
who have lagged behind others in their access to and usage of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	BET Holdings, which operates the Black Entertainment Television  
network and three other cable channels as well as several 
magazines, intends to make the new site a leading online 
destination for blacks, a ``portal'' that Web surfers can use as 
their home base to jump to other Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture will receive $35 million in backing from its four  
partners, including Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three major media players involved: USA Networks Inc.,  
the American arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and AT&AMP;T Corp.'s 
Liberty Digital, the online media company run by cable magnate John 
Malone. Liberty owns a minority stake in BET. 
</P>
<P>
	BET's chairman and founder, Robert Johnson, called the new  
venture a ``unique social and economic opportunity for African 
Americans.'' He said he believed it was the largest amount ever 
spent to launch a product aimed specifically at blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failure of any community to avail itself of the resources  
of the Internet will limit its ability to succeed in the new 
millennium,'' Johnson said. ``BET is bringing its media channels, 
content and brand resources together with those of our partners to 
create an online destination that will educate, enrich, empower and 
entertain African Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new site, which will launch in November, will offer a  
variety of news, entertainment, finance and free messaging 
services. It will also sell items aimed at black buyers including 
clothes, books, music and gifts.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Hit by Supply Glut / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of long-term Treasury bonds tumbled and  
yields rose to a 22-month high Thursday after a fresh infusion of 
30-year securities glutted the market, dragging down demand for 
bonds already in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggravating the price action, the Chicago Board of Trade was  
forced to shut down early because of a power outage, triggering a 
last-minute wave of selling. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32  
point, or $7.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.27 percent, the highest since 
Oct. 28, 1997, when it closed at 6.28 percent. On Wednesday, the 
yield closed at 6.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices tumbled as the U.S. government brought $10 billion in new  
30-year bonds to market, meeting tepid demand from investors. The 
30-year auction saw weaker sales than a $12 billion sale of 10-year 
notes on Wednesday and a $15 billion sale of five-year notes on 
Tuesday. Still, it fared better than the last 30-year auction six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader secondary market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities ranged from unchanged to 1/32 point lower, and 
intermediate maturities ranged from 1/16 lower to 1/4 point lower, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.76 percent with a  
discount of 4.64 percent, down 0.13 percentage point from late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.06 percent while the discount was 4.86  
percent, down 0.03 percentage point. One-year yields were 5.20 
percent with a discount of 4.94 percent, up 0.02 percentage point 
from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 28/32 to 113 19/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.82 percent from 5.76 percent on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Liberty Mutual To Cut 1,500 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Liberty Mutual Group plans to cut 1,500 jobs and  
reduce expenses by more than $150 million by the first quarter in 
2000 as it realigns its commercial insurance operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Mutual president and chief executive officer Edmund F.  
Kelly blamed the cuts on industrywide stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commercial property and casualty industry has been in a  
prolonged period of price deflation,'' Kelly said Thursday. 
``Industrywide results have been extremely poor, and there is no 
sign of relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization will create a single account business unit  
from the Wausau Insurance Companies, which Liberty owns, and

<HEADLINE> Byrne, Stronach Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Thoroughbred trainer Pat Byrne has settled  
a lawsuit that charged owner Frank Stronach with fraud and breach 
of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne will receive most of the $84,000 in unpaid training fees  
he sought from Stronach, Lexington lawyer Laura D'Angelo said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, filed last month in Fayette Circuit Court in  
Lexington, Byrne had sought up to $384,000 in damages -- the 
training fees plus a $300,000 contract termination fee that he said 
Stronach tried to avoid paying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was in both parties' best interests to try to come  
to a resolution, as opposed to going forward with litigation,'' 
D'Angelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Byrne gave up his public stable, including 1997  
Horse of the Year Favorite Trick and champion 2-year-old filly 
Countess Diana, to train exclusively for Stronach, the Canadian 
industrialist who last year bought Santa Anita racetrack in 
Arcadia, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relationship quickly soured. Byrne's lawsuit alleged  
that Stronach repeatedly failed to live up to the terms of their 
contract by sending many of his top horses to another trainer in 
New York and by failing to give Byrne a promised chance to select 
which 2-year-olds he wanted to train. 
</P>
<P>
	By November, when Byrne trained Stronach's Awesome Again to a  
victory in the Breeder's Cup Classic, the suit alleged that the 
trainer had only 15 horses in his stable, down from a high of 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne also charged that Stronach put off informing him that he  
wanted to terminate their contract until January to avoid paying 
the $300,000 termination fee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Stronach then proposed a new contract  
under which Byrne would train 12-15 of his horses and would be 
allowed to reopen a public stable. Byrne agreed to the deal, but 
Stronach allegedly never sent him any horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached on Thursday at his barn in Saratoga, N.Y., Byrne  
referred all questions about the settlement to D'Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since splitting with Stronach earlier this year, Byrne has  
rebuilt his public stable. It now includes 40 horses, three of whom 
have won at the Saratoga meet.

<HEADLINE>  Utah Tornadoes Rare, Not Impossible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tornadoes can form anywhere if the right atmospheric conditions  
exist -- from the Midwest to the Rockies and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they touch down in Kansas or downtown Salt Lake City,  
twisters need several ingredients found only in large 
thunderstorms: Warm, moist air near the ground, cool air aloft and 
winds that speed up and change direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Some regions of the United States are more vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
	The Midwest is in an area where warm, wet air from the Gulf of  
Mexico collides with the fast-moving and cooler winds from the 
Rocky Mountains or Canada. Twisters are most likely to occur there 
in the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, meteorologists in Salt Lake City watched the same  
conditions develop over their state. A severe thunderstorm watch 
was issued at 12:48 p.m.; the twister touched down about seven 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw what was going on,'' said David Toronto, a  
meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ``But to look at it 
and say there's a tornado and it's going to hit downtown -- we 
didn't have that information because of the rapid development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remained on the ground for about five minutes, he said. The  
tornado was classified as an F2 tornado -- one with wind speeds 
between 113 and 157 mph. Its wind speed was probably on the low end 
of that range, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes are rare in Utah. Thirty-two have been reported in the  
last 25 years, said Tim Shy, a researcher at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Oklahoma recorded 1,326 over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown areas also offer no special protection, he said. There  
just happen to be more rural than densely urbanized areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get a `Wizard of Oz' mentality that they occur in  
the middle of nowhere,'' Shy said. ``There have been enough 
counter-examples here recently, as Oklahoma City, Nashville and 
downtown Miami got hit in the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether a tornado strikes a building or a barn, the most  
dangerous aspect is the debris carried by high winds. Researchers 
have discounted theories that pressure differences cause structures 
to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	``The damage comes from wind and flying debris, and we saw that  
downtown today,'' Toronto said.

<HEADLINE> CNN, CNBC Battle on Floor of NYSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN and CNBC are heading to the floor of the New  
York Stock Exchange as they continue their pitched battle for 
business viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after CNN quietly announced it would produce a daily  
show from Wall Street's epicenter, CNBC said it would do the same 
thing -- and it will be first. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC's ``Business Center'' will uproot from its New Jersey  
studio starting Monday for a new desk at the stock exchange. The 
6:30 p.m. EDT financial wrap-up show, starting 2 1/2 hours after the 
exchange shuts down for the day, competes with CNN's higher-rated 
``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go to the source of what we're reporting on for the  
final word of the day,'' said Bill Bolster, CNBC president. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime this fall, CNN will premiere ``Street Sweep,'' a new  
business show broadcast from the stock exchange daily starting at 
3:59 p.m., or one minute before the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moneyline'' will continue to be broadcast from its New York  
studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition between the two networks has been particularly  
intense this summer. While CNBC is the leading business network, 
``Moneyline'' consistently outrates ``Business Center'' and is 
extraordinarily attractive to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC expanded ``Business Center'' to an hour after popular  
``Moneyline'' host Lou Dobbs quit and cut into its rival's 
audience, but CNN has remained in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Stock Exchange first allowed live TV reports from  
the trading floor in 1995, requiring networks to use robotic 
cameras to minimize congestion. Twenty-two television stations are 
accredited to report there, said NYSE spokesman Robert Zito 
</P>
<P>
	Now the exchange is making space for desks so CNN and CNBC can  
deliver full shows there, although ongoing live shows won't be 
allowed during the midst of trading. The networks will pay a 
nominal production fee, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we want to do is tell them to go away,'' Zito  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are reports CNBC is spending more than $1 million to  
quickly make the ``Business Center'' shift. Bolster wouldn't 
dispute the figure, but said he didn't know the exact amount. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC wasn't necessarily racing to be first on the floor, but was  
watching its competitor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had always been our strategic plan,'' Bolster said. ``When  
Lou Dobbs left, we saw that opportunity and we just accelerated the 
whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN believes ``Street Sweep'' will be able to take better  
advantage of its location because more people will be at the stock 
exchange as the bell sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's better than being there a few hours later ``when the  
janitors are sweeping up,'' said Steve Korn, vice chairman of the 
CNN News Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're at the head of the pack and leading the  
race,'' Korn said. ``We're not looking behind us. We're looking 
ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Anderson Reports To Falcons' Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Jamal Anderson drove through the gates  
of Furman University in a stretch limousine -- an appropriate mode 
of transportation for the All-Pro running back. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he had just agreed to a five-year, $32 million  
contract with the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, big money!'' screamed teammate Calvin Collins, spotting  
Anderson's behemoth of a car pulling up to the student dormitories 
where the Falcons are housed during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a holdout during the first two weeks of camp,  
demanding a new contract that would make him one of the 
highest-paid running backs in the NFL. Nine months of negotiations 
finally came to an end Wednesday with nearly four hours of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took concessions on both sides to get it done,'' Reeves  
said. ``Now we're ready to move forward and put it behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will get a signing bonus of $7.5 million, becoming the  
highest-paid player in Falcons history. He also agreed to move from 
Salt Lake City to Atlanta so he can take part regularly in the 
team's offseason workout program. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who set a franchise record with 1,846 yards rushing  
and an NFL mark with 410 carries as Atlanta advanced to the Super 
Bowl last season, planned to join the team for a light workout 
today at Furman. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't play in Friday night's first exhibition game against  
Detroit. Anderson said he will probably need about two weeks to 
reach peak condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's missed some time, but we know he can make it up because  
he's a veteran and the system hasn't changed,'' Reeves said. 
``He'll be ready for the season opener against the Vikings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said he wanted to complete a deal by Friday, knowing  
that marks a month to go until the Sept. 12 contest against 
Minnesota, a rematch of last year's NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A month is plenty of time to get ready,'' he said. ``You  
really don't need to be in training camp for five or six weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson's whirlwind day began with an early-morning appearance  
on an Atlanta radio station before he joined his agent, Jim Sims, 
for the 2 1/2-hour drive to Greenville. By the time the contract was 
announced at an early-evening news conference, Anderson looked 
tired and frazzled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a bit shellshocked,'' Sims said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Anderson managed to display a bit of the wit that made  
him one of Atlanta's most popular athletes. He promised to unveil a 
new version of his ``Dirty Bird'' dance and joked that Reeves 
agreed to the deal when challenged to a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for Hollywood, I won't be able to do any feature  
films during the football season,'' the 26-year-old Anderson said. 
``But I'm happy it's over with. I want to play and it's great to 
see my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides had basically agreed on the length and value of the  
contract, but it took a face-to-face meeting to agree on the 
signing bonus and structure of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Sims arrived at the hotel in their limo, while  
Reeves and general manager Harold Richardson pulled up a few 
minutes later in a green Buick. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who has final say in contract matters, sat in on the  
talks for over an hour before returning to Furman for the afternoon 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson remained behind to continue negotiating with Anderson  
and Sims. Finally, shortly after 5 p.m. EDT, the three men emerged 
from the meeting room and began the triumphant trek to Furman, 
about 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson emerged from his vehicle at the player dormitories,  
pumping his arms in the air just as three of his offensive linemen 
-- Collins, Ephraim Salaam and Bob Whitfield -- pulled into the 
parking lot on a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw him today, it was a great sight for sore eyes,''  
linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``To get in here now, it's still 
early, and I think the days he missed won't hurt him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson will become one of the highest-paid running backs in  
the NFL, according to his agent. He still trails Denver's Terrell 
Davis, who has a nine-year, $59 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his  
current contract, refused to report for the start of training camp 
July 29 without a new deal. He has since accumulated $70,000 in 
fines -- $5,000 per day -- which Reeves said ``will be settled among 
us.''

tendon Wednesday, and likely is lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City coach Gunther Cunningham said Brown's leg ``rolled''  
during a drill Monday, causing the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Browning, a third-round pick of the Chiefs in 1996, started the  
first eight games last season before a back injury forced him out 
of the lineup for the rest of the year.

was the 22nd player selected in April's NFL draft.

<P>
	The 6-4, 195-pound Jackson has played in the NFL for eight  
seasons -- five with the Cleveland Browns and three with the 
Baltimore Ravens. He had 38 receptions for 477 yards and no 
touchdowns with the Ravens last season.

<P>
	Dimitrius Underwood won't be playing pro football, at least not  
for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said Wednesday that Underwood doesn't want to play, so  
the Vikings are looking for the best way to cut ties with the 
first-round draft pick who went AWOL after his first pro practice 
on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the rookie pass rusher blamed his disappearance on  
inner turmoil over sports and religion coexisting in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that Dimitrius chose not to pursue football, but we  
wish him well,'' said team owner Red McCombs, adding that the 
outcome ``wasn't what anyone wanted.''

                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie fullback Shawn Bryson is out for the season with a torn  
anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Wade Phillips said Bryson will undergo surgery on his left  
knee and will be placed on injured reserve. He is expected to spend 
the next 6-8 months in rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryson suffered the injury during practice Tuesday when he made  
a cut during a run upfield.

</P>
<P>
	Seven-time Pro Bowl tackle Richmond Webb might miss the start of  
Miami's season because of a contract stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson predicted that Webb will wait until  
just before the season to sign, meaning backup Brent Smith would 
start the opener Sept. 13 at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis signed veteran quarterback Steve Walsh and released  
quarterback Stoney Case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts are the sixth NFL team for Walsh, who was drafted by  
Dallas in the 1989 supplemental draft, traded to New Orleans in 
1990 and later played for Chicago, St. Louis and Tampa Bay. The 
6-foot-3, 215-pounder signed a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked real good in the workout, better than I  
anticipated,'' coach Jim Mora said of Walsh, who had his first 
training camp practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Case played four seasons in Arizona and appeared in four games.  
</P>
<P>
	Walsh has played in only 65 games during his NFL career, with 38  
starts. He completed nine of 19 passes in five games for Tampa Bay 
last season.

<HEADLINE> Cooper Chosen for National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Cynthia Cooper already has won  
two Olympic medals in basketball. Next year, she'll try to make it 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper and four others will be added to the U.S. women's  
national basketball team on Saturday. The 10-member squad, which 
begins training next month, will form the nucleus of the 2000 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw, Yolanda Griffth, Natalie Williams and  
DeLisha Milton also will be named to the team, USA Basketball 
officials confirmed Thursday. Lisa Leslie, Nikki McCray, Katie 
Smith, Dawn Staley and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield were chosen in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	All but Griffith have either world championship or Olympic  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper won a gold medal with the U.S. Olympic team in 1988 and  
was on the American team that won the bronze in 1992. She was the 
most valuable player in the WNBA in each of the league's first two 
seasons and led the Houston Comets to the league championship both 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, Williams, Milton, Leslie, McCray, Smith, Staley and  
Bolton-Holifield were on the U.S. team that won the gold medal in 
the 1998 world championships. Leslie, McCray, Staley and 
Bolton-Holifield played on the 1996 Olympic team that also won the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The full 12-member Olympic team will be announced next summer.  
Various players will be given a chance to train with the national 
team before the final two slots are filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nell Fortner, who guided the United States to last year's world  
championship, will coach the Olympic team. She most recently 
coached in the Pan American Games, where a U.S. team that had been 
together only two weeks won the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The national team will assemble Sept. 7 and play in the Olympic  
Cup in San Diego Sept. 9-12. Australia, Brazil and Poland also will 
participate in that tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-game college exhibition tour is scheduled in the fall, and  
the team will face a number of international opponents in the 
winter and spring. The players will disband when WNBA training 
camps open in May and reassemble in August after the WNBA season 
ends.

<HEADLINE> Teens Unload at Vermont Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANDOLPH CENTER, Vt. (AP) -- Isaac Evans-Frantz recalled how he  
came out as a homosexual in the seventh grade, only to face scores 
of his peers questioning and harassing him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so overwhelming to me,'' said Evans-Frantz, a junior at  
Brattleboro Union High School. ``It was the first time I realized 
that being gay in society wasn't going to be easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The youth spoke Thursday at a forum that is the only one this  
year devoted to teens and education, the Education Commission of 
the States said. Gov. Howard Dean organized it in response to the 
shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and to a 
rash of bomb threats at Vermont high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still struggling with the issue,'' he said. ``There is no  
one right answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly universal message was that teen-agers need two things  
above all else: to be heard and respected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe respect is everything,'' Husain Karim, a sophomore  
at Burlington High School, said. ``If you have respect for yourself 
and others, why would you feel the need to hurt others? 
</P>
<P>
	``I strongly believe that teachers could be the main source of  
accomplishing this,'' he said. ``There's some times I see my 
coaches and teachers more than I see my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Evans-Frantz, some of those turned out to be allies: a  
teacher who didn't yell at a classmate who used the term faggot but 
forced her to look up its meaning in the dictionary; a school nurse 
who posted a notice of a gay youth support group; and a science 
teacher who did nothing more than post a small pink triangle, a 
symbol of solidarity for gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Wow, this guy really cares. This is a safe place for  
me,''' Evans-Frantz said, bringing tears to many eyes and a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although teen-agers want to be heard, they also want some  
guidance, said PJ Lewis, who just graduated from Essex High School. 
She told how she was in foster care for five years and found an 
advocate in her social worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``She gave me options about what would happen to me,'' Lewis  
said. ``She helped me decide what would happen rather than just 
putting me somewhere and saying that's where you go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean listened intently throughout the session, breaking in  
occasionally with an observation or a response. His goal for the 
conference was to find ideas that can be offered to schools around 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Dean, a father of two teen-agers in public schools  
himself, said that teen-agers have to understand that adults cannot 
always do the right thing, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand that we're more like you than you think  
we are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why it's important for adults and teen-agers to try to  
get know one another better, Evans-Frantz said. He asked why 
teachers don't simply wander into the cafeteria at lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers could come in and ask us, `How's school going for  
you? What do you like? What don't you like? What should be 
different?''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Condemn Clinton Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Independence activists condemned a  
conditional U.S. offer of clemency for 11 islanders convicted of 
sedition, saying it only underscored Puerto Rico's colonial status. 
</P>
<P>
	``These conditions are inviting a confrontation,'' said Luis  
Nieves Falcon, leader of a campaign to free 16 Puerto Ricans linked 
by U.S. prosecutors to a wave of U.S. bombings in the 1970s and 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are shameful demands,'' said Lolita Lebron, who in 1979  
was pardoned by President Carter for a 1954 shooting attack on the 
House of Representatives. ``The president has insulted the dignity 
of the Puerto Rican nation and those who fight for its liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Wednesday that the members of the  
Armed Forces of National Liberation would be freed if they agreed 
to renounce violence, don't meet other independence leaders and 
obey a ban on using weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven prisoners would be released immediately if they agree;  
two would have to serve more prison time; and three would have the 
unpaid balance of their criminal fines canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also required that the prisoners sign  
statements requesting commutations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president reviewed the matter and obviously concluded that  
the sentences imposed for the crime committed were out of 
proportion to sentences for similar offenses for others,'' Attorney 
General Janet Reno said today in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions were applauded by Puerto Rico's pro-U.S.  
statehood governor and congressional representative, who long have 
insisted the prisoners renounce violence before obtaining freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe (Clinton) did this in the most prudent and just  
manner possible,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that every one of these people understand that  
they committed a crime,'' declared Resident Commissioner Carlos 
Romero-Barcelo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieves Falcon has led a petition drive for the ``political  
prisoners,'' as the activists are commonly known here, and he and 
fellow supporters had gathered at San Juan's cathedral Wednesday to 
celebrate their anticipated release. The mood soured when they 
learned of Clinton's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an injustice,'' said a tearful Clarissa Lopez,  
daughter of Oscar Lopez, one of those ineligible for immediate 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	While the independence party won less than 3 percent of the vote  
in a December plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status, the 
campaign to free the prisoners has received broad popular support. 
</P>
<P>
	But the short-lived 1998 release of Antonio Camacho Negron, a  
member of a Puerto Rico-based guerrilla group, the Macheteros, 
showed why some prisoners may reject the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho Negron was paroled after serving 10 years for the 1983  
robbery of a Wells Fargo armored truck in West Hartford, 
Connecticut, to fund guerrilla attacks. He was returned to prison 
after missing interviews with his parole officer and meeting with 
other independence activists in violation of his parole rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's 3.8 million islanders are U.S. citizens. They can  
serve in the military and receive billions from Washington but pay 
no federal taxes, cannot vote for president and have only a 
nonvoting delegate in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Disciplined Urged in Nuke Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, citing a  
``total breakdown in the system,'' recommended disciplinary action 
Thursday against a senior official and two other employees of the 
Los Alamos nuclear laboratory because of failures in the China 
espionage investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson did not identify the three but said their  
``responsibilities were clear and they failed to meet their 
responsibilities'' in the investigation of alleged spying by a Los 
Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	While the internal investigation also cited ``systemic problems  
in the Energy Department's management of counterintelligence 
matters,'' no action was taken against any department headquarters 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson cannot directly take action against the employees  
because they work for the University of California, the private 
contractor that has managed the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 
New Mexico since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	But his recommendation was expected to carry much weight.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from lab official, nor the  
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson ordered the internal review several months ago amid  
sharp criticism about the handling of the Lee investigation, which 
began in 1996 when he first became a suspect in the apparent loss 
of secrets concerning the W-88 nuclear warhead, one of the 
country's most sophisticated, in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a Taiwan-born computer scientists at the Los Alamos lab  
since the 1970s, was fired March 8 for security violations. He has 
not been charged and has denied giving any nuclear secrets to China 
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal investigation focused on why Lee had been allowed  
to remain at his top-secret job for nearly three years after 
becoming an FBI suspect and why the FBI was never told he had given 
a waiver to have his computer searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a total breakdown in the system and there's plenty  
of blame to go around,'' Richardson said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Wants Probe of Wholesale Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sen. Barbara Boxer said Thursday she would  
ask the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether big oil 
refiners are trying to drive small independent gasoline stations 
out of business by overcharging them. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer wants the commission to investigate a run-up in the  
wholesale price of so-called ``unbranded'' gasoline -- fuel that is 
sold to independent dealers after the needs of company-owned 
stations and franchise holders are met. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks wholesale unbranded fuel has cost more than  
``branded'' gasoline, or that sold under a refiner's brand, Boxer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with reporters, she said she suspects oil  
companies are overcharging independents in an attempt to corner the 
retail market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very suspicious that we have a higher price at the  
wholesale level for unbranded gasoline and these (independents) 
will be run out of business,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of independent dealers operating in California has  
fallen in recent years from around 2,000 to about 200, Boxer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Atlantic Richfield Co. said the high price for  
unbranded was a result of a decline in gasoline stocks caused by a 
series of refinery breakdowns along the West Coast. Less gasoline 
is left for sale in the unbranded market after companies' dealers 
are supplied, said spokesman Richard Verches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident they will find there is no collusion and gas  
prices truly are a function of the marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically branded gasoline costs more than unbranded. That's  
because branded fuel often includes special additives and is 
accorded higher retail value because of consumer regard for the 
brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	The average wholesale price for unbranded this week was $1.10  
per gallon, compared to $1.07 for branded, according to figures 
gathered by Boxer's staff from the California Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Such price inversions are rare, but have occurred before when  
gasoline was scarce, said analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg 
Survey. A similar inversion occurred during the Gulf War, when some 
independents were nearly driven out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbranded can, in scarce conditions, cost more than the  
branded gallon. We're going into our fifth month of supply 
tightness,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is more severe in California, because of the state's  
more strict pollution rules, said Jay McKeeman, executive vice 
president of the 400-member California Independent Oil Marketers 
Association in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a result of California fuel policy and the  
ability to make the California formulation of gasoline,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In essence, we've created a situation where only the major oil  
companies can produce this material,'' he said. ``Number two, 
California is isolated from other fuel markets logistically and by 
this fuel formulation, so it's not real easy to get alternative 
supplies into California.''

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hurts Trade Show Retailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Buddies Mark Tilles and Rich DiLeo drove  
11 hours from California, sleeping in their car, to make it to the 
world's largest trade show for outdoor retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling businessmen, who make hot dog holders and fly  
swatters, hoped the convention would be their big break. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the two stood outside a yellow police line near a  
flattened tent Thursday and watched a bulldozer carry away debris 
left by Wednesday's deadly tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Salt Palace Convention Center, meanwhile, hundreds of  
other exhibitors were setting up their booths, preparing for the 
opening of the show, delayed until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going on with the show, and we're losing our stuff,''  
DiLeo grumbled. ``This is a show that could make or break a small 
company. These are potentially million-dollar contracts for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Outdoor Retailers Market, held twice a year in Salt Lake  
City for the past four years, allows manufacturers of everything 
from fishing poles to kayaks to peddle their goods to stores. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, 860 exhibitors had reserved 2,550 booths and 17,000  
retailers and visitors were expected. The tented pavilion held 700 
booths. Organizers didn't know how many were damaged by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibitors were given 20 minutes Thursday afternoon to rush into  
the tent and gather and mark their property so emergency workers 
could remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went great for us,'' said DiLeo, despite a television and  
videocassette recorder that bounced on the asphalt. Much of their 
merchandise escaped water damage and was, for the most part, where 
it they had left it Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilles, DiLeo and other exhibitors had been setting up their  
booths in the pavilion when the tornado hit downtown. Ventilating 
ducts in the pavilion began slamming against the ceiling and the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran to the door, and the entire crowd was behind us,''  
DiLeo said. ``The tornado was right out there -- you could see all 
these things churning in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiLeo and Tilles latched onto each other and grabbed a pole.  
Other exhibitors grabbed one another in desperate bear hugs, trying 
to fight the force of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, DiLeo managed to grab a few newspaper articles  
about his product -- a patented fly swatter called the Buzzwacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilles left empty-handed, 1,600 samples of his Cowboy Hank's Hot  
Dog Holders still inside the tent. 
</P>
<P>
	The only person killed in the storm, Allen Crandy of Las Vegas,  
was struck in the head by debris. He had been inspecting booths in 
the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilles, of El Cerrito, Calif., first released his product a year  
ago, selling to vendors here and there. DiLeo, from Berkeley, 
Calif., began marketing his fly swatter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For both men, the convention was a chance to break into a bigger  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Many exhibitors whose booths were not damaged offered to share  
space with those who weren't so lucky. It will mean less space, but 
it is better than the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to hurt, but we're not going to let this keep us  
down,'' said DiLeo. ``We didn't come this far to have a tornado 
take us out.''

pick me up in 14 different pieces and put me back together'' -- 
three-time U.S. Open champ Hale Irwin on Garcia, his playing 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	SUPER GROUP: Garcia, Irwin and Phil Mickelson.  
</P>
<P>
	OH, BABY: Amanda Brynn Mickelson, born the day after daddy lost  
the U.S. Open by one shot to Payne Stewart, slept through his 
birdie on the 18th hole. Mickelson finished with an even-par 72. 
</P>
<P>
	RAIN, RAIN, GO AWAY: With rain falling throughout the day at  
Medinah, golfers donned rain suits and popped their umbrellas. Play 
was suspended for 47 minutes late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	SUPER SUB: First alternate Jerry Kelly, who learned an hour  
before he teed off that he was a starter, shot a 3-under 69. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Russia Plans Push Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets and helicopters attacked  
Islamic rebels in southern Russia for a sixth day today, and a 
general said a ``massive operation'' would be launched soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian forces have been using their superior firepower to  
hammer away at the militants in the Caucasus Mountain region of 
Dagestan. But ground troops have been reluctant to fight the 
separatist rebels, who are holding several villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the commander-in-chief of Russia's  
airborne forces, said Russia had launched 200 sorties against the 
rebels since the fighting began, and the ``best-trained contingent 
of airborne and special-purpose troops'' were being airlifted to 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels say they remain well-entrenched and claim a  
helicopter shot down Wednesday was the eighth Russian aircraft they 
have hit since the fighting began last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians acknowledged losing a helicopter Wednesday, saying  
one soldier was killed and nine were wounded. Three of the wounded 
were generals in the Interior Ministry. Moscow says it has lost 
only three helicopters in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian Defense Ministry official, Gaidar Gadzhiev, said some  
militants were attempting to flee the region after coming under 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has been making the same claim for several days,  
yet the rebels continue to put up strong resistance in several 
villages in the Botlikh region near Dagestan's border with 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Dagestani Interior Ministry, eight rebels were  
killed Thursday, while Russian forces suffered no losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin met acting Prime Minister  
Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin and said he was confident the rebels 
would be subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall be able to overcome this problem gradually, without  
haste, just as it was planned,'' Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin, who was appointed to the job Monday, has promised swift  
action, saying the insurgents will be crushed within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to win a clear victory over guerrilla groups,  
but we will do everything to free the villages and wipe out the 
gunmen,'' said Lt. Gen. Igor Zubov, the deputy interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a ``massive operation'' would begin soon, adding that  
``the territory will be fully sanitized.'' He did not give 
additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Dagestan announced it would censor war coverage in  
the local media. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan's State Council, the republic's executive body, said  
all reporting on the conflict would have to be approved by the 
ministry of information before it could be published or broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dagestan fighting is the biggest challenge to Russian  
authority since the 1994-6 war with Chechnya. The rebels 
infiltrated from lawless Chechnya, which has had de facto 
independence since the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are being led by two prominent commanders from the  
war in Chechnya, Shamil Basayev and Khattab, who uses only one 
name. Many of the rebels belong to the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect 
and are seeking an independent Islamic republic in the mostly 
Muslim regions of the Caucasus Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they do not appear to have broad support among ordinary  
residents in Dagestan, unlike in Chechnya, where the vast majority 
of the population supported secession from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan's moderate political and religious leaders are working  
in tandem with the Russian military, and have been recruiting 
volunteers to fight the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the number of rebels has varied widely, but a  
Russian official on Wednesday put the figure at about 1,200. 
Dagestan's Interior Ministry said 6,000 civilians had fled the 
fighting.

	The rebels are being led by two prominent commanders from the  
war in Chechnya, Shamil Basayev and Khattab, who uses only one 
name. Many of the rebels belong to the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect 
and are seeking an independent Islamic republic in the mostly 
Muslim regions of the Caucasus Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they do not appear to have broad support among ordinary  
residents in Dagestan, unlike in Chechnya, where the vast majority 
of the population supported secession from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan's moderate political and religious leaders are working  
in tandem with the Russian military, and have been recruiting 
volunteers to fight the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of the number of rebels has varied widely, but a  
Russian official on Wednesday put the figure at about 1,200. 
Dagestan's Interior Ministry said 6,000 civilians had fled the 
fighting.

<HEADLINE> Barney Loses Lawsuit Over Lookalikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Sorry, Barney.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled Wednesday against Lyons Partnership, which  
licenses Barney products and had accused Morris Costumes of renting 
and selling purple, Barneylike animal costumes under different 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons sought an injunction preventing Morris Costumes from  
renting or selling the costumes, as well as $300,000 for 
infringement of its copyright. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Graham Mullen ruled that a Duffy the Dragon  
costume didn't infringe on Barney's copyright but two other 
costumes did because they were more similar to Barney. But he said 
Morris Costumes didn't infringe willfully, so Lyons couldn't 
collect damages in its 1997 lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen denied the injunction request, noting that Morris  
Costumes had already stopped marketing the Hillary and Purple Dino 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney is a 6-foot, grinning, green-spotted purple dinosaur who  
sings and dances for preschoolers on the top-rated PBS show 
``Barney and Friends.'' About 12 million people see the show each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons has sued or plans to sue at least 700 costume shops and  
other retailers in 20 states, claiming copyright infringement. 
Lyons said the costumes will tarnish Barney's image if people 
wearing them are seen smoking, drinking and swearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been photographs in newspapers of a person in a  
bogus Barney costume with the head off smoking a cigarette,'' Lyons 
spokeswoman Kelly Lane has said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no beef with Barney,'' said Jay Bilas, the lawyer who  
helped represent Morris Costumes. ``But the people behind Barney 
acted like bullies.''

<HEADLINE> Saints Add Win Experience With Clay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- For the past six years Willie Clay has  
been on playoff teams. Now he's with the New Orleans Saints, the 
team that last season had the NFL's worst pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Clay's streak possibly continue?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think so,'' the safety said Thursday. ``When I look at this  
team I see a strong defense that was on the field for a long time 
last year. All we need to do is get a little better and we can turn 
that 6-10 to 10-6. That's our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clay, 5-foot-10, 200 pounds, admits another one of his streaks --  
80 consecutive starts, dating back to the end of the 1993 season 
with the Detroit Lions -- is in danger. But he is expected to push 
free safety Rob Kelly aside for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want a fair chance and that's what the Saints promised  
me,'' Clay said. ``I've done a lot of things in this league, and I 
definitely think I'm capable of doing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by the Detroit Lions in the eighth-round in 1992, Clay  
jumped to the New England Patriots in 1996. He has 24 career 
interceptions, including two in the playoffs, and has scored four 
touchdowns. He qualified as a Pro Bowl alternate the past two 
seasons, and was a starter for the Patriots for 54 games, including 
the 1998 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a personality contest,'' coach Mike Ditka said.  
``We've got to get better. Clay is here for that reason only, 
because we're trying to get a little better. If Willie Clay is the 
answer to making us a better football team, why wouldn't we sign 
him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being cut by New England was a shock, Clay said. He also  
expressed doubts that his $1.906 million salary against the 
Patriots' salary cap was the reason for the move, although that's 
what New England claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay's strained relationship with Patriots' coach Pete Carroll  
was also reported to have been a factor for cutting him loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows, I just hope this turns out to be a good move for me  
and the Saints,'' said Clay, who will earn the full salary he would 
have made with New England if he meets all his incentives, 
including five interceptions and seven big plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides pushing Kelly, Clay is expected to add experience and  
leadership to the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I'm unhappy with anyone. He just gives us more  
experience,'' defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian said. ``Right 
now, Sammy Knight and Rob Kelly are our starters. Do we have 
experience behind them? No. If there's a player out there who can 
improve our team, then we should try to sign them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clay practiced with the second team on Wednesday and looked  
sluggish, something both Clay and coaches blamed on his lack of 
training camp work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's smooth,'' Ditka said. ``He knows what he's doing. I just  
watched him backpedal and do some things but I thought he looked 
pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clay, who will not play in New Orleans exhibition game against  
Miami Friday night, watched the Saints walk-through on Thursday 
from the sidelines. He remained on the field for some individual 
work that included running sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to learn this system, going to mean a  
lot of hard days and long nights,'' Clay said. ``But the main thing 
I need is just repetitions. If I get enough of those, I think I'll 
be ready in two weeks. That's my goal, anyway.''

<HEADLINE>  Rockies Pitcher Astacio Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo. (AP) -- Colorado Rockies pitcher Pedro  
Astacio was arrested Thursday when he turned himself in to police 
following an alleged altercation with his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio, acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 18, 1997,  
for infielder Eric Young, faced charges of third-degree assault and 
domestic violence, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Lt. Joe Carns said a 911 call came in at 10:57 p.m.  
Wednesday. A woman said her estranged husband had been arguing with 
her and she advised him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said he struck her in the face,'' Carns said.  
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, later identified as Astacio, had left his suburban  
house by the time officers arrived, but turned himself in about 4 
p.m. Thursday. He was taken to the Arapahoe County Jail for booking 
and to arrange bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the case would be handled by the county  
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies had no formal statement on the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	Astacio is 12-9 with a 4.88 ERA and leads the team in victories.  
He ranks fourth in the NL with 149 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio pitched the entire 1998 season in the Rockies rotation  
without missing an assignment, and set a personal best with 34 
starts and topped 200 innings for the third straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ninth in the NL with a career-best and club-record 170  
strikeouts and became one of only three pitchers in Rockies history 
to win 13 games in a season.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Focuses on Islamic Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Facing criticism that Russia hasn't acted quickly  
enough to quash an Islamic rebellion in the south, President Boris 
Yeltsin promised on Thursday that the militants would be wiped out 
steadily but ``without haste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's acting prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was chastised  
Wednesday by members of Russia's upper house of parliament, who 
said Russia should act more resolutely to stamp out the rebels who 
invaded several villages in the Caucasus region of Dagestan last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers warned that the hostilities in Dagestan resemble  
those at the onset of Russia's botched war in the breakaway 
republic of Chechnya in 1994-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin said he was confident the rebels would be defeated,  
though he admitted that ``along with Chechnya, (Dagestan) is the 
most difficult region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall be able to overcome this problem gradually, without  
haste, just as it was planned,'' Yeltsin said before his meeting 
with Sergei Shoigu, minister for emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Russian aircraft again fired on Islamic rebels, and  
more troops and weapons were sent to southern Russia. The militants 
maintained their hold on several villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoigu said his ministry was preparing to start relief  
operations in Dagestan once the fighting had stopped, but the 
conflict so far has shown few signs of abating. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin dismissed media reports that the Kremlin may use the  
fighting to introduce emergency measures, which in turn could 
result in the postponement of December's parliamentary elections. 
Yeltsin's allies are not expected to fare well in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Putin admitted that a state of emergency was a  
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may talk about the introduction of a state of emergency  
when it's necessary,'' he said after meeting at the upper house, 
the Federation Council. Under Russian law, the Federation Council 
must approve the call for a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, most political factions appeared ready to approve  
Putin as prime minister in a vote Monday, despite their anger over 
the abrupt Cabinet reshuffle -- the fourth in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin met with leaders from the ultranationalist Liberal  
Democratic Party on Thursday, telling them he did not plan to make 
any major rearrangements in the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	If parliament rejects Putin's nomination three times, Yeltsin  
would be required to disband the legislature. But the Communists 
and other hard-liners who dominate parliament do not appear 
interested in a confrontation with Yeltsin as elections draw near. 
</P>
<P>
	Most observers believe the current political shakeup is part of  
a Kremlin effort to undermine a political alliance led by Moscow 
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential candidate who teamed up 
last week with a bloc of powerful regional governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's inner circle is believed to be vying to preserve its  
grip on power after the presidential election, after which Yeltsin 
is required to step down. Luzhkov almost certainly would not give 
Yeltsin's entourage the influence it wants if he were elected.
