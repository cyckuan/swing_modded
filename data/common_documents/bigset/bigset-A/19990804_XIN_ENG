<HEADLINE> U.S. Allows Direct Flights to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that it will allow direct charter flights to Cuba from New York
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The flights will be limited to certain categories of U.S.
residents, including journalists, government officials and
once-a-year humanitarian visits to family members, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the move did not represent an easing of
sanctions against Cuba, the spokesman said the practice is
consistent with the current policy of the administration and a ban
on tourism remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the process that has been put in place for
some time where we are trying to improve people-to-people contact,
and doing it in such a way as not to provide benefit to the Cuban
regime, which is precisely what the embargo is designed to
prevent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The flights will be "only available" to travelers licensed by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department in
addition to the existing general license, he added.
</P>
<P>
On January 5, the Clinton administration authorized flights to
Cuba to improve "people-to-people" contact. Charter planes have
been flying from Miami to Camaguey and Holguin for several months.
</P>
<P>
The United States started its embargo in 1961 against Cuba
after the country's pro-American government was toppled in a
revolution.

WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday released 55 million U.S. dollars in federal aid to help
residents of nine Southern and Midwestern states cope with the
heat.
</P>
<P>
The money, provided under a program that is used more often to
help low-income people pay for heat during the winter, may be used
to buy air conditioners, fans and other relief.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made as Clinton flew to Chicago City,
where he planned to visit workers providing services to some of
the most vulnerable people suffering from the heat.
</P>
<P>
At least 221 people have died in 20 U.S. states including
Illinois and Missouri as a result of oppressively hot
temperatures since July 19. In Illinois alone, 99 deaths have been

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Approves State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Parliament on
Tuesday approved a 4.25 billion dinars (some 14 billion U.S.
dollars) budget for the fiscal year 1999/2000 starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was passed by a vote of 27 to 20 with one
abstention, projected state revenues at 2.224 billion dinars (some
7.339 billion dollars), and a deficit at 2.026 billion dinars
(6.685 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues were estimated at 1.761 billion dinars (5.811
billion dollars) and non-oil income at 463 million dinars (1.527
billion dollars), compared with 1.894 billion dinars (6.25 billion
dollars) and non-oil income of 550 million dinars (1.815 billion
dollars) for the past year respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, 222 million dinars (732.6 million dollars) will go
to the Fund for Future Generations, which was designed to
prepare for the time when Kuwait's oil passes its heyday.
</P>
<P>
The state's oil revenue in the new budget is calculated at a
daily output of 1.386 million barrels per day, Kuwait's current
quota within the framework of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues in the last and new budgets are calculated
at 10 dollars a barrel, down from 13 dollars in recent
years. Kuwait's crudes are currently selling at 13-15 dollars
per barrel after dropping below 7 dollars last year when
world oil prices plummeted to a ten-year low.
</P>
<P>
The 4.362 billion dinars (14.39 billion dollars) budget for
1998/99 carried a projected gross deficit of 2.163 billion
dinars (7.137 billion dollars) and a net deficit of 1.919
billion dinars (6.332 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists here expected an actual net deficit of 1.25
billion dinars (4.125 billion dollars) with expenditure of about
4 billion dinars (13.2 billion dollars) after spending curbs
were introduced.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Stand by Promise to IMF: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe said Tuesday that it will
 rigorously implement a number of policies to achieve the
macro-economic goals contained in its letter of intent to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said this at a
briefing after the disbursement of 193-million-U.S. dollar
stand-by credit facility for Zimbabwe by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the money would be used to rebuild Zimbabwe's
foreign exchange reserves and put its economy back onto a sound
reform track.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic goals as contained in the letter to the IMF
included the achievement of real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth of 12 percent in 1999, the reduction of inflation to 30
percent by the end of the year and an external current account
deficit of 6.3 percent of the GDP, which together with additional
external financing should allow gross reserves to increase to 16
months of imports by year end.
</P>
<P>
To meet these objectives, a number of policies would be
implemented including the maintenance of a tight fiscal stance and
the targeting of the budget deficit at 5.3 percent of the GDP,
which was equivalent to a primary surplus of 3.2 percent of the
GDP, Murerwa said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the minister as saying that
monetary policy and fiscal restraint would be used to contain
aggregate demand and maintain a competitive exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
New legislation to strengthen the regulation of banks which had
been passed by parliament would soon come into force and policy
guidelines to deal with distressed banks would be issued, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said that his government had no intention of imposing
widespread price controls, and that price controls on maize meal
were introduced only as temporary measures for socio-economic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The price controls would be lifted once the situation improves
and the exchange rate stabilizes, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the projected external financing gap would be financed
through disbursements from the World Bank with 140 million dollars
and the African Development Bank with 130 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Two Panels Named to Probe into How UNITA Evades Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Tuesday completed the makeup of two panels in
charge of investigating how Angola's rebel UNITA have been evading
sanctions and the 15-nation body is expected to offer
recommendations on counter-measures to strengthen sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
has been blamed by the Security Council for the breakdown of a
1994 peace accord designed to end a length civil war in the
central African country and for the resumption of fighting last
December.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the two panels, which have a six-month
mandate and will probably travel widely, was approved by the
Security Council in a resolution adopted in May.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Security Council's sanctions committee,
Robert Fowler who is the Canadian ambassador to the United
Nations, said in a letter to the Council president that one
six-member panel would probe UNITA's sources of revenue, funding
and petroleum supplies that enable it to wage war.
</P>
<P>
It will be headed by Anders Mollander, who was Sweden's
ambassador to Angola from 1992 to 1995 and now deals with African
affairs in his country's foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Other members include experts from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Britain
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
One focus of the panel will be diamond trade by UNITA, which
controls a number of diamond-rich areas in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Fowler told reporters last week that UNITA was estimated to
have raised between 3 billion U.S. dollars to 4 billion U.S.
dollars through diamond sales over the past eight years and that
this sum had probably grown as a result of wise investments.
</P>
<P>
The second panel named by Fowler, comprising four experts, will
investigate the sources of UNITA's military support. It will be
headed by Col. Otisitswe Broza Tiroyamodimo of Botswana, a deputy
brigade commander who formerly served with U.N. peacekeeping force
in Mozambique. The other three members are from South Africa,
Switzerland and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mollander will serve as chairman of the entire 10-member group
and Tiroyamodimo will be vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has claimed hundreds of lives over more than two
decades and the United Nations estimates that 1.6 million Angolans
are dispatched out of a population of about 11 million.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Bill Cutting World Bank Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Defying the veto threat by the
Clinton administration, the U.S. House of Representatives approved
on Tuesday a bill that would cut overseas spending and slash
funding for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The 12.6 billion U.S. dollar foreign operations bill, passed by
a vote of 385 to 35, would decrease the World Bank's lending
program for the world's poorest countries by 232 million dollars
and also cut off aid to foreign groups engaged in abortion-related
services.
</P>
<P>
The measure came up almost 2 billion dollars short of the
amount the Clinton administration requested. The Senate has
already passed a version of the bill with less severe cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration made clear the president would veto
the bill on grounds of both the funding shortfall and the abortion
amendment.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank was one of the bill's biggest losers. The
legislation would cut U.S. funding for its concessional loan
program to 576 million dollars, down from 800 million dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
The program is used to help desperately poor countries. Its
biggest borrower last year, for example, was Bangladesh which has
an average annual income of just 360 dollars per capita.
</P>
<P>
Assistance to Israel and Egypt remained broadly unaffected by
the bill as was funding for the Peace Corps. The bill also funded
anti-terrorism measures, narcotics control, economic and military
aid for Jordan and assistance for the countries of the former
Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
condemned "in the strongest terms" the killing of civilians in
Namibia's Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on behalf of the South African
government, Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma gave her full support
to a united Namibia and its government's efforts at resolving the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
She told state television that South Africa would condemn any
violent actions against a legitimate, democratic government.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between secessionist rebels and the government forces
erupted after rebels attacked the police station in Katima Mulilo
and a nearby airport in the wee hours of Monday in Namibia. The
rebels once occupied the state- owned radio offices in the town,
which was later recovered by police and the army.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma Monday declared an indefinite
state of emergency in the area as government forces are carrying
out a mop-up operation.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the town remained tense Tuesday afternoon as
occasional automatic gunfire could be heard, according to South
African state television, the SABC.
</P>
<P>
The television also said efforts were being made to evacuate
foreign nationals in the region as a new attack by the rebels
could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of casualties in Monday's fighting could not
be known, but there are speculations that up to 20 people might
have died.
</P>
<P>
Five rebels, five policemen and three soldiers were confirmed
dead.
</P>

<P>
LONDON August 3 (Xinhua) - Banking giant HSBC and Abbey
National announced Tuesday that they are planning services for
customers to manage their finances using their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
The new services are the latest in a series of announcements by
major banks that signal a move away from traditional
over-the-counter service to "remote" banking, via the telephone,
the internet and now television.
</P>
<P>
Abbey National's so-called "sofa Banking" interactive
television service will enable armchair customers to review
products, order literature and calculate their loan repayments
simply by using the remote control.
</P>
<P>
An HSBC spokeswoman said: "Customers and non customers will
soon be able to buy financial products off the shelf while
enjoying the comfort of their own sofas."
</P>
<P>
The interactive TV service will initially be available to
customers with Sky Digital only, but will eventually appear on all
digital services, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Part of the service will be one stop shop for financial
products, such as insurance. There will also be facilities for
customers to access accounts, pay bills and transfer cash, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Ambrose McGinn, Abbey National e-commerce director, said:
"Television banking is a global first, and we think its potential
is enormous."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission in East Timor to Stay One Month Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday authorized the U.N. Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET) to stay one month longer until September 30.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a council meeting following U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's request for UNAMET's extension last
week.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been mandated with the mission to
organize and conduct a vote in East Timor on its future -- to
enjoy special autonomy within Indonesia or to go independent.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has seen East Timor of 800,000 inhabitants as a
non-self-governing territory administered by Indonesia, which
annexed it in 1976, ending Portugal's nearly 400-year colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. agreed on May 5 to conduct a
ballot or popular consultation on East Timor's status.
</P>
<P>
The original voting date was set for August 8. Due to security
reasons and logistics preparations, it was first postponed to
August 21 or 22.
</P>
<P>
Annan delayed the ballot again last week until August 30.
Subsequently, he put off UNAMET by one month from the end of
August till the end of September.

<HEADLINE> Water Supply Cut to Israeli Cities Over Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- After the negotiations with the
Finance Ministry over wage increase broke up, Israeli water
workers Tuesday cut off the water supply to dozens of cities
around the country.
</P>
<P>
The shutoffs were first imposed by Mekorot Water Company's
workers overnight on a number of cities, including the coastal
cities of Tel Aviv and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv municipality water control headquarters were
reportedly inundated with complaints by disgruntled citizens, who
woke up in the morning only to find the water had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
Since a labor court had ordered that any shutoffs could not be
allowed to go on for more than four consecutive hours out of every
day, Mekorot workers resumed water supply to these cities hours
later.
</P>
<P>
Then, the workers continued their strike Tuesday afternoon by
cutting off water to other cities, including Jerusalem, for hours.
</P>
<P>
However, Mekorot workers council chairman Meir El-Ezra said on
Tuesday that the staff were trying not to cut water supply to
hospitals and Israel Defense Force camps.
</P>
<P>
Mekorot workers are demanding for a wage rise of 3 percent over
the next two years. They are also protesting government plans to
privatize the water company, which they say would put hundreds of
people out of work.
</P>
<P>
But Finance Ministry officials said that the wages of Mekorot
staff had posted a real 15 percent increase in the last five
years, and that they are currently demanding another irrational
wage increase, exploiting their control on the country's water
taps.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Index Rises In June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.3 percent in June, pointing to
continuation of the expansion through early 2000, the Conference
Board, a prominent research group, said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the index stands at 107.7 in June, up from
107.4 in May, posting increases in eight of the past nine month.
</P>
<P>
"The (economic) expansion is firmly on track," said Michael
Boldin, director of business cycle research at the Conference
Board. "But because of concerns about if and when the Federal
Reserve will tighten to fight inflation, some volatility can be
expected in the second half of 1999."
</P>
<P>
The report said seven of the 10 indicators that make up the
leading index rose in June. The most significant increases are
manufacturers' new orders of consumer goods and materials, money
supply in 1992 dollars and interest rates spread, it added.
</P>
<P>
The most significant negative contributor to the composite
leading index in June is manufacturers' new orders of nondefense
capital goods, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Ends Softer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency
rand ended softer Tuesday against the U.S. dollar in a range bound
session.
</P>
<P>
The session was characterized by players buying and selling
dollars on the bottom and top side of the range. The rand traded
in a narrow range of 6.1840 to 6.2200.
</P>
<P>
The rand was last quoted at 6.1930 per dollar from a previous
close of 6. 1900. The rand weakened to an intra-day worst level
of 6.2220 before midday, but traded below the 6.2000 psychological
level for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
The rand market showed signs of recovery late in the afternoon
and that that could be a sign of a slight correction.
</P>
<P>
The local market developed jitters Monday after the Reserve
Bank governor-designate, Tito Mboweni, commented that the central
bank would not intervene in the currency market. Mboweni is to
take over the reigns at the bank on August 10.
</P>
<P>
Dealers expected a slight firming in the rand after Mboweni's
inauguration.

<HEADLINE> Members of Saudi Prince's Entourage Barred from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has barred seven members of a
Saudi prince's entourage from leaving the country pending
investigation into two assault charges, the prosecutor general
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Maher Abdel-Wahed said two brothers-in-law of Saudi
Prince Turki Ibn Abdul-Aziz and four of his bodyguards - two
Americans, an Austrian and a Syrian - will not be allowed to leave
the country until the investigations were completed.
</P>
<P>
A friend of the Saudi family is also not allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
The move was the harshest one by the Egyptian authorities
against the prince and his entourage since 1983 when they moved
into the top floors of the Ramsis Hilton Hotel in Cairo after
falling out with his brother, King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
In June, an Egyptian police officer accused the prince's son,
the two in-laws, their Saudi friend and three bodyguards of
assaulting him in a cafeteria of the hotel while he was off-duty.
</P>
<P>
But the prince's son, Prince Abdul-Rahman, has not been banned
from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Also, a cook who had gone to the prince in search of a job,
claimed last month that one of the American bodyguards had
assaulted him in a hotel elevator.

<HEADLINE> New ITTF President Faces Uphill Battle  By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EINDHOVEN, Netherlands, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The 40mm ball proposal
was overruled and table tennis remains a sport hard to sell. Adham
Sherara, newly-elected President of the International Table Tennis
Federation, will find his road ahead is not smooth.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Sherara, who took over Chinese Xu Yinsheng to head
the world table tennis ruling body, said he would continue his work to
make the sport more spectacular. The 61-year-old Xu didn't seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
In the day-long ITTF General Assembly, Pierre Albertini,
President of the French Table Tennis Association, edged out his
friend Hans Giesecke of Germany to become the new ITTF Deputy
President, a position vacated by Sherara.
</P>
<P>
The 40mm ball proposal, which was predicted to have a major
influence on the future of table tennis, was overruled in the
voting. 84 of 124 ITTF members voted for the proposal with 30
against. 10 abstained.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal was defeated by only two votes," said Sherara. "It
was close."
</P>
<P>
Sherara, who introduced a "3-P Policy" of popularization,
participation and profit to table tennis, favors the proposal to
enlarge the ball size from usual 38mm to 40mm in order to reduce speed
and spin and make the sport more attractive.
</P>
<P>
Sherara said he was more confident today than yesterday on the
40mm ball proposal.
</P>
<P>
"I expected the proposal to be overruled this time and I thought
the voting could 50-50 because some people are not sure what the
change of ball size will bring about," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am more confident because it is just two votes away from
reality. I will try to convince those who are not sure," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said the proposal would be discussed during the
world team table tennis championships to be held in Malaysia in
February next year. "Hopefully it will pass," said Sherara.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to change the service rules suffered the same defeat
as the 40mm ball on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The most talked about and controversial aspect of table tennis
since the game was first played have been the rules relating to
service. Over the years there have been a host of ways developed by
players and coaches in an effort to gain the maximum advantage from
the service.
</P>
<P>
The proposal called for all players to serve in front of the
body, not level with the body and definitely not behind.
</P>
<P>
"The service rule change and the other proposal to make the ball
more visible by adding black and white lines to ball were defeated
easily," said Sherara, a language genius who speaks eight languages
including French, Italian, Spanish and Arabic.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader to Visit Egypt Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi will
fly to Egypt on Wednesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak,
an Egyptian official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be Gaddafi's first trip to Egypt since the United
Nations suspended air embargo on Libya in April, the official at
the Foreign Ministry said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official said Gaddafi will meet with Mubarak for the
day-long talks in the Mediterranean town of Marsa Matrouh, 500
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on bilateral issues and Libya's efforts to
restore normal ties with other countries following its surrender
of two Libyans suspected of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, the official said. The explosion
killed 270 people, most of them American or British.
</P>
<P>
During an Egyptian visit in March, Gaddafi and Mubarak agreed
to set up joint ventures in the fishery industry and land
reclamation projects.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to urge Libya to begin implementing the
projects, and also to boost trade exchange.
</P>
<P>
In April, the U.N. Security Council suspended the embargo on
Libya, which it imposed in 1992 in a bid to force the Northern
African country to surrender the suspects for trial.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Orders Kurdish Rebels to Halt Attacks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan Tuesday ordered his followers
to halt attacks on Turkish targets and withdraw from Turkish
territory to give way to the establishment of peace.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's appeal was disclosed to the Turkish press by his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was sentenced to death by Turkey's Ankara Security
Court in June, told the "mountain units" of the PKK to stop all
"armed struggle" and "withdraw beyond the borders" as of September
1 so that peace could be established.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer Dogan Erbas read a statement by Ocalan which said
that "In Turkey the fighting and violent atmosphere have formed an
obstacle blocking the development of human rights and democracy."
</P>
<P>
"The violence which has occurred primarily because of the
Kurdish problem plays a basic role in this. In order to get out of
the blind alley and find a solution to the problems, an end has to
be put to the violence," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason I am calling on the PKK to put an end to their
armed struggle as of September 1, 1999," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the PKK to withdraw their forces beyond the
boundaries in the interest of peace," it added.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by the Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and was brought to the Imrali prison on the Marmara
Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Its fighting
against Turkish government and civilian targets continues after
Ocalan was given the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between the Turkish security forces and the PKK
militants have claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> EU To Give Full Room For GlobalOne Telecom Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Tuesday that GlobalOne, a European-American joint venture,
will be allowed to provide all telecommunications services in the
15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU antitrust authorities have cleared the joint venture
created in 1996 by Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint
Corporation (US), but imposed a series of conditions reflecting
the lack of competition in the telecom sector then dominated by
national monoplies in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said a notice
about the intention has been published to invite "all interested
parties to comment before adopting a formal decision to this end."
</P>
<P>
The commission said its position is based on the market
developments since the creation of GlobalOne was approved in 1996,
and noted the other substantial competitors' entry into the
market, such as the joint venture between British Telecom (BT) and
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
"The home markets of GlobalOne's shareholders have been
completely liberalized and the market for global
telecommunications services now features a number of strong
competitors, especially the new BT-AT&AMP;T joint venture, which are
not subject to the same restrictions as GlobalOne," the EU
executive said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU antitrust authorities said the incoming decision will
enable GlobalOne "to be free to provide all telecommunications
services, including voice telephony, on both a resale and
facilities basis, in all the EU member states."

<HEADLINE> Uganda-Rwanda Ties Not Soured by Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Uganda and
Rwanda has not in the least been soured by the drastic differences
that emerged between the two rebel groups in the Congolese Rally
for Democracy (RDC), a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, state minister for regional cooperation, made
these remarks at a press briefing here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The difference is natural and expected. A mechanism has been
established to resolve this difference. Our relations have not
been damaged by it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is not supporting any of these two groups and Uganda is
not insisting that Wamba dia Wamba must sign the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda and Rwanda had been enjoying very good relations
and they are still doing what they can to bring to an end the
armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Uganda's pullout from the central African
country, he said that his government would honor and respect the
agreement it signed in Lusaka on July 10 and would pull out all
its troops within 180 days after the true implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
This year saw a split between what is known as RDC-Goma, backed
by Rwanda, and RDC-Kisangani, headed by Wamba and backed by
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
IIunga and his aides have rejected Wamba dia Wamba's leadership
and refused to recognize his legitimacy, which was the reason
given for a rebel failure to sign the accord in Lusaka that was
penned by President Laurent Kabila, his allies from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, and by Rwanda and Uganda.

In a speech, Chihuri said an additional 6,000 officers were
expected to join the force within the next three years following
the approval of central government for the force to increase its
manpower levels.
</P>
<P>
"This may greatly enhance our expectations of providing wider

"We will continue strengthening the neighborhood watch
initiative in commercial farming areas. The idea of sharing the
policing burden has borne much fruit since its introduction," he
told the Commercial Farmers Union in Harare.
</P>

Meanwhile, Chihuri said comparative statistics for the first
six months of 1998 and 1999 indicated that incidents of stock
theft had been kept at manageable levels considering the harsh
economic conditions which usually precipitated theft of stock.
</P>
<P>
From January to June 1999, 5,411 heads of cattle were stolen in
1999 compared with 4,622 stolen during the same period last year.
</P>

Chihuri urged farmers to record details of their work force,
train guards in use of firearms, maintain stock registers and
carry out regular stock counts to avoid late reports.

and Prosper Mugiraneza, former Minister for the Civil Service.
</P>
<P>
They were transferred to the ICTR detention facility in Arusha
in north Tanzania Saturday from Cameroon where they were arrested
and detained in April this year, the U.N. court said in a press
release reaching here.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily ethnic Tutsis and moderate
Hutus were massacred in the middle of 1994 in Rwanda. In November
that year, the United Nations Security Council set up the court
Arusha to try the chief architects of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The three accused, together with Casimir Bizimungu, a former
Minister for Health who is already in custody in Arusha, are
jointly charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu was arrested in Kenya and transferred to the
tribunal's detention facility in Arusha in February this year.
</P>
<P>
However, as part of a strategy to seek joint trials calculated
to show the 1994 genocide as a far-reaching conspiracy in the
government at the time, the prosecutor is seeking a decision of
the trial chambers to allow a joint indictment of these four
individuals with several former senior government officials, five
of whom are already in custody in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The five are Edouard Karemera, former Minister of Interior,
Andre Rwamakuba, former Minister of Education, Mathieu
Ngirumpaste, former Director General of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and President of National Revolutionary Development
Movement, as well as Joseph Nzirorera, former President of the
National Assembly and Secretary-General of the movement and
Juvenal Kajelijeli, former Bourgmestre of Mukingo.
</P>
<P>
The case is collectively referred as "the government case."
</P>
<P>
The total number of accused persons detained under the
authority of the tribunal is now 38, one of whom is in custody in
Texas, the United States, awaiting the result of an appeal
against his transfer to Arusha.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Emergency Food Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is to receive more
food aid from the United States, a press statement by the U.S.
embassy said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 90,000 metric tons of food assistance were to be provided
in response to the shortage of food in Ethiopia, which brings the
total American food aid contribution to the country so far this
year to more than 250,000 tons, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The food aid includes 10,000 tons of food assistance to replace
 previous food aid which was lost at the Port of Assab following
the onset of the Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that drought and unfavorable climate since
early this year had severely affected household food security in
many parts of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the U.S., Ethiopia has also received in the past
few months relief fund from Holland, Japan, China and Canada.

CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The price of cement stands at 200 Egyptian pounds
(58.82 U.S. dollars) per ton in Egypt, 50 pounds (14.71 dollars)
lower than the price last year due to excessive supply, the
country's Middle East News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to produce 22 million tons of cement this
year, up by 2 million tons from last year. In addition, the
private sector has imported 4 million tons of cement.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan on Monday decided to exempt a number of
imported electronic goods from custom duties and to lower custom
duties on other commodities in order to facilitate the supply of
certain goods at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
The move was also aimed at encouraging various sectors to
update their equipment, and at preventing smuggling and illegal
entry of such equipment into the country.
</P>
<P>
Custom duties on computer sets and related supplies were
exempted and those on mobile telephones, video cameras, still
cameras, wrist watches and neckties were lowered to 5 percent
instead of 30 to 35 per cent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili
said on Monday that Egypt will export to Portugal 30 million
U.S. dollars worth of cotton yarn, 5.88 million dollars of leather
products and 2.94 million dollars of ceramics.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying
that Egypt will also export to Portugal 12,000 pieces of children
clothes and 10 containers of household appliances, including
washing machines, gas cookers and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
He said Portugal's demand for Egyptian products is growing as a
result of exchanging visits by businessmen and efforts by the
Egyptian Trade Office to acquaint Portuguese consumers with
Egyptian goods.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will spend a total of some 1.194 billion
pounds (346 million U.S. dollars) in potable water and sanitary
drainage projects in Port Said governorate by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
The money will be spent on 68 projects, 48 of which are for
water treatment and 20 of which are for sanitary drainage.
</P>
<P>
And 50 percent of the capacity of these projects would serve
industrial zones, tourist villages and ships, said a report by the
Ministry of Housing and Urban Communities.
</P>
<P>
The projected Adiliya to Port Said water line would be
completed this year, with a total production capacity of 22,000
cubic meters per day at a cost of about 75 million pounds (21.7
million dollars), the Alam Al Yom newspaper quoted the report as
saying Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Helps Strengthen Police Security in Rwandan Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and donor partners are helping
strengthen police security in rural areas of Rwanda through a 5.5
million-U.S. dollar program, UNDP officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program is providing training and housing accommodations
for local police. However, the lack of adequate living quarters of
Rwandan police officers in rural communities has been a major
obstacle to their recruitment in the past, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern communities of Karago and Stainsyi, police
are now on the job as the result of new housing constructed
through the effort.
</P>
<P>
"Security means peace, peace means development and development
means prosperity," said Stephen Browne, UNDP resident
representative in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Having the communal police in place has clearly provided
security to the local community and has encouraged them to go
forward and to develop the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the
United States are among the donors that have provided funding to
the initiative.

UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Guyana's Constitutional
Reform Commission (CRC), with the assistance from the Untied
Nations Development Program (UNDP), has completed its work and
preparation for submitting its findings and reform proposals to
Guyana's Parliament, UNDP officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CRC was set up six months ago as a key reform measure
agreed to by the country's major political parties under the
Hermanston Accord.
</P>
<P>
The commission received more than 4,000 recommendations from
different segments of society, including both foreign and local
experts, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP was first external partner of the CRC, the officials
said, adding that the U.N. agency committed 127,000 U.S. dollars
to the reform process, coordinated donor support and helped draft
a proposal for the anticipated reform activities.
</P>
<P>
UNDP Resident Representative Richard Olver said that the UNDP

<HEADLINE> S. African Deputy President Urges to Revitalize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma called on the nation Tuesday to undertake the
task of revitalizing education.
</P>
<P>
Revitalizing education, which had been damaged by years of
apartheid rule, should focus not only on "lost" values from the
past, but perhaps more importantly on "seeking new ways to meet
new times", Zuma told a South African Council of Churches
workshop on education held here.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative that schools become centers of community and
cultural life, and that parents be encouraged to play a role as
important stakeholders in education, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
This revitalization required not simply recovery or
resuscitation, but a renewal, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was time for South Africans to pick up the pieces of their
damaged minds and souls and undertake the task of reconstructing
themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
There was a serious moral vacuum in society, he said,
stressing that " the loss of respect for human life and dignity
has reached endemic proportions today".
</P>
<P>
"If humanity is central to our thoughts and actions, if to be
fully human and true to ourselves are our starting points, then we
cannot go wrong in creating a better life for all our people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Apartheid, he said, had literally "messed up" people's morality
and distorted the values of society, changing people's outlooks in
such a way that many could no longer see themselves as human.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the Church, which had been active in shaping society
for so long in all spheres of life, should not now abandon its
task.
</P>
<P>
It was "the most qualified" to make society conscious of the
value system that should be underpinning the transformation
agenda, and particularly transformation of the education system.

<HEADLINE> Construction Grows Rapidly in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Promoted by an average of 5-6
percent of economic growth in the past three years, construction
has become one of the fastest growing sectors in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the Middle East Economic
Digest (MEED), construction will be further boosted in Egypt as
the government presses ahead with new infrastructure schemes and
private sector development projects mushroom.
</P>
<P>
The recent government figures showed that construction,
excluding the industry, electricity and oil and gas sectors,
accounted for 14.1 billion Egyptian pounds (4.15 billion U.S.
dollars) out of the gross domestic product of 253.1 billion pounds
(74.44 billion dollars) in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June
30.
</P>
<P>
The London-based MEED, which focuses on Mideast economy and
business, attributed much of the impetus for the expansion of the
construction sector to the government's promotion of new
development zones, the main of which are in the Suez Gulf and East
Port Said.
</P>
<P>
In the Suez development zone, work is proceeding rapidly on the
new port of Sokhna, which will serve the zone.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-registered Archirodon Construction (Overseas) is
building the quay walls for 60 million dollars, and the
European/U.S. Great Lake Group is carrying out the 105 million
dollars dredging contract.
</P>
<P>
Bids from six international groups are also under evaluation
for the contract to build and operate a water supply system for
the development zone.
</P>
<P>
Work is getting under way on the new East Port Said container
terminal. An international consortium led by Jan de Nul of Belgium
is carrying out the 211 million dollars dredging and breakwater
construction contract, and a 60 million dollars contract has just
been awarded to a joint venture of the local Arabian International
construction and Italy's Rodio for the quay walls job.
</P>
<P>
Ten prequalified international groups are also preparing to bid
for a contract to design, build and operate a road tunnel under
the Suez Canal to provide access to the East Port Said terminal
and the adjacent industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
The government is also looking to the private sector to invest
in new airport projects. Contracts have already been awarded for
airports that will serve new tourism destinations: Mersa Alam on
the Red Sea, El-Alamein on the Mediterranean and Ras El-Sidr on
the Gulf of Suez.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Recommends Probing Sale of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament Tuesday
afternoon recommended a thorough investigation into the closure
and sale of the Cooperative Bank.
</P>
<P>
This motion was tabled at the afternoon session and supported
by Prime Minister Appolo Nsibambi and some other members of
parliament, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The backers of the motion said that a special committee should
be instituted in order to investigate this matter. The closure
and alleged sale of the bank had exerted negative impact on the
society both politically and economically, they said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the government is transparent and
would stand the test of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda, central bank of the east African country,
closed the bank in May this year, convinced that the bank was
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula said that the closure of the
bank was timely because the bank directors had been robbing the
depositors' money.
</P>
<P>
The Cooperative Bank had some 110,000 depositors across the
country when it was closed.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan MPs are complaining about the slow development of the
country's economy. Some of them believe that the 7.8 percent
growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) as reported in the new
fiscal budget was exaggerated because there is little improvement
in common people's life.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Bigger U.N. Presence in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has recommended increasing a U.N. mission in Sierra
Leone to 210 observers from 70 to help implement a recently signed
peace accord between the government and rebels, a U.N. official
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his written report to the U.N. Security Council late Monday,
Annan said a larger U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra Leone
(UNOMSIL) would be needed, depending on a division of labor to be
worked out between the United Nations and a large Nigerian-led
West African force, known as the ECOMOG, that has been supporting
the Sierra Leonean government.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Agreement, signed on July 7 in Togo's capital of
Lome, requires the UNMSIL to perform significantly expanded as
well as new tasks in close coordination with the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the major disarmament and demobilization effort,
implementation of the Lome agreement would require substantial
numbers of peacekeepers throughout the country and the deployment
of additional U.N. military observers, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of UNOMSIL military observers would increase to
210," he said, adding that the proposed U.N. mission would be well
above the current strength of about 50 and the authorized strength
of 70.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG's mandate would need to be revised by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in consultation with the
United Nations, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Once there was an understanding on the task, strengths and
mandates of the ECOMOG and the U.N. special representative for
Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo of Uganda, Annan said he would submit
a more comprehensive report to the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> African Stowaway Youths Have Letter on Them </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The two African youths, who were
found dead in an airplane landing gear compartment at the Belgian
national airport, had a letter on them appealing for a better life
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The letter, found prior to Tuesday's autopsy by Belgian justice
authorities to decide the cause of their deaths, appealed to the
European leaders to pay attention to the youths in Africa that has
been plagued by civil wars.
</P>
<P>
The two youths, identified as Koita Yaguine, 15, and Tounkara
Fode, 16, said in the letter that they took the risk to try to
come to Europe for a better opportunity of education, recreation
and sports.
</P>
<P>
The two youths, from Guinea, were found dead Monday in an
under-the-wing landing gear compartment of a Sabena Airbus
A330-300.
</P>
<P>
A strange odor led airport re-fueling technicians to the
discovery of the bodies from the compartment.
</P>
<P>
The airport medical personnel said that the deaths could be
caused by the low temperature high up in the sky during the
flight.
</P>
<P>
The Sabena airliner initiated its flight from Conakry of Guinea
with a stopover at Bamako of Mali before arriving in the Belgian
capital.
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure where the two stowaways got into the
compartment though it is supposed to be routinely checked at each
airport before taking off.
</P>
<P>
At the cruise height of 10,000 meters, the ambient temperature
around the airplane can be 50 degrees or 55 degrees Celsius below
zero. Though it may be a bit warmer inside the landing gear
compartment, the lack of oxygen at that altitude is another deadly
factor during flight.
</P>
<P>
The chance is rare for anyone to survive such a stowaway voyage
though a Senegalese youth managed to survive a five-hour stowaway
flight from Dakar to Lyon of France on January 26 this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was wounded
Tuesday in Israeli shelling on south Lebanon villages, Lebanon's
state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mariam Srour, 60, was injured by shrapnels of Israeli shells
landed on her village of Mansouri just outside the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She was transferred to a nearby hospital in Tyre, the country's
southern coastal city. Doctors said she was in a stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli warplanes also blasted villages in
the Iqlim Toufah region on the edge of the occupied border zone
with air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports about casualties from the air raids
which have been confirmed by Israeli army, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, a total of 17 Lebanese civilians
have been killed and more than 100 wounded in conflicts between
Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Spurn U.S. Terrorism Charges Against Osama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
chief Mulla Muhammad Omar Tuesday said Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden is not a terrorist as the United States claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Osama bin Laden is not a terrorist," Omar said as reported by
Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press (AIP).
</P>
<P>
The United States accused Osama of masterminding the bomb blast
at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August and kept
pressing the Taliban to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, rejected the U.S. requirements, asking it
to offer evidence for its charges.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to presence of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia
during the Gulf War, Omar said the United States developed
personal enmity with the Arab millionaire for his opposition to
"the American aggression against holy Islamic places".
</P>
<P>
"It is a separate issue as to whether this contention (of
Osama) is right or wrong but it shows animosity between Osama and
the United States," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States considers us a hurdle for its supremacy and
hence was seriously following the issue of Osama or may be trying
to harm the Afghan people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Five Key Industries to Be Boosted in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 3 (Xinhua) - Five key industries in Thailand
are expected to be boosted as the country's Board of Investment
(BOI) has planned to set up a new panel to help regenerate the
economy, the Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted BOI Secretary-General
Sataporn Kavitanonda as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The five industries are steel and construction materials,
petrochemicals and petroleum products, textile, paper and pulp,
and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
Sataporn said that the panel, consisting of representatives
from the ministries of commerce, industry and finance and the Bank
of Thailand, will help enhance the industries' competitiveness in
overseas markets by granting them trade privileges, including tax
incentives, and helping restructure their corporate and debt
structures.
</P>
<P>
Sataporn said that if the five key industries were virtually
pushed through difficulties, they would help spur other economic
activities and eventually revive Thailand's overall economic
system.
</P>
<P>
The five industries, which had recorded high growth rates and
business prospects, with value of approved investment reaching 630
billion baht (17 billion U.S. dollars) two years ago, were among
the hardest hit during the economic crisis, which brought the Thai
economy to an eight percent recession last year.
</P>
<P>
Though having been in red since the economic crisis in
mid-1997, the five industries still have high business potential,
Sataporn said.
</P>
<P>
BOI's move coincided with its announcement that it had achieved
in helping boost exports of 660 business firms under its promotion
and support schemes, which were led by electronic and electrical
appliance industries and automobiles, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the firms on average increased by eight percent in
the first half of this year compared with the same period last
year, with overall value amounting to 12.7 billion dollars, or 48
percent of the country's total exports during the first half of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Clothing Exports to S. Africa Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Clothing Council and
the Zimbabwe Clothing Manufacturers Association Tuesday announced
the new quota system for clothing exports to South Africa, showing
a remarkable increase.
</P>
<P>
The two associations announced in a statement that the quota
for t- shirts, singlets, knitted or crocheted vests would increase
from 400,000 to one million, while that of men's or boy's
trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts would
increase from 320,000 to one million.
</P>
<P>
The new quota for all other tariff clothing headings would be
1,127,000.
</P>
<P>
The new quota system comes in the wake of discussions held
between South African Trade Minister Alec Erwin and Zimbabwean
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira and other trade
and industry representatives from both countries at the recent
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Congress held in Bulawayo,
Zimbabwe's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
While the new quotas had been a welcome development in the
clothing industry, they still fell short of what the industry had
been pushing for during previous trade discussions.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was seeking a free trade area to correct the imbalance
of trade between the two countries which is in favor of South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Govt Urged to Boost Business Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has been
urged to streamline the legal framework to enable the business
sector to function properly.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by President of Uganda National Chamber of
Commerce, Trade and Industry, Bonney Katatumba, in the Parliament
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Long process of acquiring visas is hindering foreign investors
from coming to Uganda and freight charges ought to be removed to
reduce the cost of imports, he was petitioning the committee on
tourism, trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Chamber representing the business expressed
concern about multi-national corporations like oil companies that
are hindering liberalization by forming cartels to limit other
countries from dealing in oil.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to the government to allocate specific areas fro
petty traders to carry out their businesses in an organized manner
in order to broaden the tax base.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Intensify Efforts to Reconcile Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government will
intensify its efforts aimed at ironing out the differences between
the main factions of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RDC) in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi made this
pledge during a press conference here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the faction of RDC headed by Emile IIunga met
 President Yoweri Museveni Monday and they discussed issues
regarding the reconciliation among the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
"This will help bring to an end the fighting in the DRC and it
is in the interest of Congo and the region," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that within RDC differences emerged. Uganda's
position is neutral first and foremost. We sincerely hope the
differences would be resolved properly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The RDC was split into two factions this year reportedly
supported respectively by Uganda and Rwanda. Their differences in
both strategies and tactics to be used against the DRC government
forces and allied forces have remained sticking point in their
reconciliation efforts.
</P>
<P>
They held reconciliation talks at Kabale District in western
Uganda after the signing of Lusaka cease-fire agreement on July
10.
</P>
<P>
There has been dispute as to who should sign the agreement on
behalf of all the rebel forces. Both Kisangani-based Wamba dia
Wambia and Goma-based Emile IIunga wanted to sign it. Their
dispute and failure to sign the agreement led to the postponement
of its implementation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the head of the other rebel group Jean Pierre Bemba,
whose Congolese Liberation Movement has been fighting notably in
the northwest of the vast central African country, signed the
cease-fire agreement in the Zambian capital of Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> France Backs British Candidate for NATO Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that it
backs the candidacy of British Defense Secretary George Robertson
for the post of secretary general of NATO.
</P>
<P>
``France supports the candidacy of Mr. Robertson. The United
Kingdom is one of our major partners in the definition of a
European defense in the framework of the European Union (EU), in
the spirit of Saint-Malo,'' said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain agreed in November 1998 to establish a
single European defense force at a summit between President
Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Prime Minister
Tony Blair in Saint-Malo, northwest France.
</P>
<P>
The other member countries of the EU also expressed their
support to the Franco-British proposal at the EU summit in
Cologne, Germany, in early June.
</P>
<P>
Robertson is expected to be formally designated by the NATO
member countries' ministerial council this week to replace Javier
Solana.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Still Hopes to Quit COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania still wishes to
quit the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) after
holding talks with a delegation from the regional organization
that left here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of COMESA Council of Ministers, Nicholas Biwott, said
here Tuesday that he and other leaders of the implementation
committee of the regional organization have visited Tanzania to
persuade the country not to quit its membership.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said he is optimistic that Tanzania will rethink its
decision of pulling out of the 21-member organization. "We are
confident that closer discussions will enable us to resolve the
matter," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Tanzanian Minister of Industries and Commerce, Iddi
Simba, told a press conference in Dar es Salaam in the same day
that Tanzania will stick to its position of pulling out of the
COMESA for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Simba said his country reached the decision of pulling out of
the COMESA after doing a research on how much Tanzania can benefit
from the regional economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is better for Tanzania to stick to smaller
blocs such as the 14-member Southern African Development Community
(SADC), and the East African Cooperation that comprises Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA was set up in 1994 with a vision to reach a zero
taxation rate for intra-region imports next year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's manufacturers have expressed concern that zero
tariffs would damage its local industries with the flooding of
imported goods from other COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Tanzania would like to trade with SADC and
EAC members rather than COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, the minister suddenly announced at the National
Assembly that Tanzania plans to quit the COMESA. His announcement
surprised the organization a lot as Tanzania has always been an
active member.
</P>
<P>
With an annual import bill of around 32 billion U.S. dollars,
the COMESA forms a major market place for both internal and
external trading.
</P>
<P>
The member countries are Angola, Burundi, the Comoros, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda,
Seychelles, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Foreign Exchange Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank's provisional gross gold and foreign exchange reserves
amounted to 35.7 billion rand (5.76 billion U.S. dollars) at the
end of July, compared with 35.1 billion rand at the end of June,
the central bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In U.S. dollar terms, gross reserves were virtually unchanged
at 5.8 billion dollars owing to the devaluation of the rand over
the month.
</P>
<P>
However, the use of foreign credit lines fell by about 200
million dollars to 2.5 billion dollars (15.2 billion rand),
boosting net reserves by a matching amount to 3.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The utilization of foreign credit lines at the end of June was
16 billion rand.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate to Investigate its President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's 109-member upper house of
 legislature voted Tuesday to allow three of its committees to
investigate allegations of its president Even Enwerem.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of "Tell", a Lagos-based weekly magazine,
alleged that the senate president was convicted for stealing in
1945 while serving as a revenue clerk under the British colonial
government and variously falsified his age for public office.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Judiciary and Ethics, Security and
Intelligence as well as Code of Conduct and Public Petitions were
ordered to investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem has consistently denied the allegations and on Saturday
 described it as part of a campaign to "bring me down and ridicule
the office."
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the committees, expected to complete their
work within seven days, coincided with the conviction of former
speaker of the lower house for perjury and forgery.
</P>
<P>
"Chief Enwerem is no longer a private and ordinary citizen and
any allegation impinging on this person is of utmost concern to
the senate and the entire nation," said Senator Idris Abubakar who
moved the motion for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
He said the Senate should not be seen to be sweeping the issue
under the carpet after the events of the past few weeks, a
reference to the resignation of the speaker of the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Information, Senator
Ibrahim Mantu said the decision to investigate the president,
third in the country's political hierarchy, was reached after a
meeting of the "political party cause".

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Needs Joint Strategies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An official of the South African
Agricultural Business Chamber (SABC) said in Harare Tuesday that
there is need for joint strategies in agriculture within southern
African countries if they are to survive in the economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the Commercial Farmers Union's 56th annual
congress, SABC executive director Johan van Rooyen said that
strategies would maximize the countries' impact in the world
economy while creating space for each other in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said governments in the region have a role to play in
formulating the strategies which also need some hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The director said there is need for an "Agribusiness Network:
Southern Africa" which incorporates farm producers and
agribusiness serving farmers and holds a biennial agribusiness
conference.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture and agribusiness are important in the region," he
said. "For this reason alone it is imperative that the
agribusiness community collaborate to formulate clear viewpoints
in order to be influential in regional infrastructural
strategies."

<HEADLINE> Resigned Nigerian Speaker Gets Symbolic Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Alhaji Buhari, resigned speaker of
Nigeria's lower house of parliament, was fined 2,000 naira (19
U.S. dollars) Tuesday after pleading guilty to forgery and
perjury.
</P>
<P>
An Abuja magistrate court made the decision, which surprised
hundreds of Buhari's countrymen who thronged the court to hear the
judgment in the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate later admitted he was influenced by last week's
"admission of guilt" by the former speaker.
</P>
<P>
"I was moved by the confession and compelled to temper justice
with mercy," the magistrate said, adding that his leniency was
justified by the former speaker's remorse.
</P>
<P>
The disgraced speaker resigned from the leadership of the House
of Representatives two weeks ago in a scandal that threw Nigeria's
democracy into turmoil only weeks after the end of long military
rule.
</P>
<P>
Buhari admitted that he was only 29, not 36 as he had claimed,
and was therefore too young to serve in parliament. He also
admitted that his claim to have an academic degree from the
University of Toronto was false.
</P>
<P>
The 360-member House of Representatives had voted the day when
the speaker resigned to forgive Buhari but President Olusegun
Obasanjo's government decided to prosecute him anyway.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the house ranks the fourth in Nigeria's
constitutional hierarchy. The convening of an elected National
Assembly on June 3 ended more than 15 years in which Nigeria's law
were made by military decree.

<HEADLINE> Capital Outflows from Kenya Slows Down in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The exodus of foreign capitals
from Kenya slowed in July as the market reacted to a new
government reform plan that put conservationist Richard Leakey to
head the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Figures issued by Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) Tuesday showed
that net capital outflows by foreign investors dropped to 531,407
U.S. dollars in July from 1.34 million dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners brought 67,090 dollars into the market but took out
598,497 dollars compared with inflows of 47,992 dollars and
outflows of 1.39 million dollars in June, according to NSE data.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said President Daniel arap Moi's announcement on July
23 that he would fully support Leakey in a campaign to rid
government of corruption and inefficiency had eased investors'
nerves.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a
205-million-dollar loan package to Kenya in 1997 in protest
against poor governance and corruption in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts say that the Leakey team could get the loan
talks back on track in the coming months if it starts implementing
anti-graft measures.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan shilling remained steady through July, trading in
the 72 to 74.50 range against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Canada's New Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- With a mid-term cabinet shuffle
completed Tuesday, the newly announced Canadian cabinet was sworn in
at around 2 p.m..
</P>
<P>
The "medium-sized" shuffle brings five new faces to the cabinet of
"continuity and fresh ideas," according to the Prime Minister's
Office.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of former Ontario Health Minister Elinor Caplan is
described by insiders as the most significant addition to the cabinet.
Ms. Caplan replaces Lucienne Robillard as Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration.
</P>
<P>
Bob Nault of Northern Ontario and George Baker of Newfoundland take
over portfolios respectively from Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart
and Veterans Affairs Minister Fred Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
Toronto's Maria Minna is appointed Minister for International
Cooperation, while Martin Cauchon assumes duty as Minister of National
Revenue.
</P>
<P>
David Anderson moves to the post of Minister of
Environment from his original duty as Minister of Fisheries. Minister
of National Revenue Herb Dhaliwal changes duty to become new Minister
of Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Leaving the cabinet are Veterans Affairs Minister Fred Mifflin,
Environment Minister Christine Stewart, Treasury Board President
Marcel Masse, international Trade Minister Sergio Marchi and Minister
for International cooperation Diane Marleau.
</P>
<P>
Many of the cabinet's most prominent ministers stay at their posts,
including Minister of Finance Paul Martin, Minister of Health Allan
Rock, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of
Transport David Collenette, Minister of Justice Anne Mclellan and
Minister of Industry John Manley.
</P>
<P>
The shuffle is reported by the local media to be a signal that
Prime Minister Jean Chretien has no plans to retire any time soon.
Rather, he is intent on revitalizing his government with a bold new
team and a more inspirational vision to lead the country into the new
millenium.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq Moving Anti-Aircraft Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon alleged on
Tuesday that Iraq had moved more anti-aircraft missiles into the
southern no-fly zone, possibly to enforce its challenge to U.S.
and British invading warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon described the move as fitting "a
pattern of Iraqi behavior.
</P>
<P>
"It's episodic," he said. "There's an ebb and flow to this
... Sometimes they're more aggressive at trying to -- or
appearing to try to -- ambush our planes, or preparing to do
that, than they are at other times."
</P>
<P>
Bacon said it might send a signal that Iraq was "not taking
the no-fly zone seriously."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has denounced the no-fly zones in both its northern and
southern parts, imposed by the United States and Britain since
the 1991 Gulf War, as violation of its sovereignty and said it
would challenge any Western warplanes invading its air space.
</P>
<P>
The United States has exchanged fires with Iraq nearly 110
times this year when Iraq's anti-aircraft system fired at U.S. and
British planes patrolling the two no-fly zones.

UNITED NATIONS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of the
worldwide flow of small arms comes from illicit trafficking,
serving warlords, drug traffickers, terrorists and other
criminals, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Allows More Direct Charter Flights to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that it will allow direct charter flights to Cuba from New York
and Los Angeles as part of its "people-to-people contact" policy.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time that direct flights were allowed to
Cuba from these two cities since the U.S. administration imposed
the embargo against Cuba in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The flights will be limited to certain categories of U.S.
residents, including journalists, government officials and
once-a-year humanitarian visits to family members, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the charter companies will decide when and how often
the new charter flights will operate.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the move did not represent an easing of
sanctions against Cuba, Rubin said the practice is consistent with
the current policy of the administration and a ban on tourism
remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the process that has been put in place for
some time where we are trying to improve people-to-people contact,
and doing it in such a way as not to provide benefit to the Cuban
regime, which is precisely what the embargo is designed to
prevent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The flights will be "only available" to travelers licensed by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department in
addition to the existing general license, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said New York and Los Angeles were chosen as
"gateway" based on a market study.
</P>
<P>
"The selection was based on current demand, demographics, and
the availability of customs and INS (the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service) personnel to process flights," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
On January 5, the Clinton administration authorized flights to
Cuba to improve "people-to-people" contact. Charter planes have
been flying from Miami to Camaguey and Holguin for several months.
</P>
<P>
The United States started its embargo in 1961 against Cuba
after the country's pro-American government was toppled in a
revolution.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Indian Train Tragedy Stands at 278 </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Monday's
train collision rose to 278 on Wednesday, General Manager of N. F.
Railway Rajendra Nath said in Gaisal, West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
"This is more or less the final figure. All the bogies have
been cut open and we do not expect to find very many bodies from
the debris any more," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said cranes were being used to access the interiors of the
badly damaged bogies and the debris would be cleared by Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The bodies have been kept at the North Bengal Medical College
and Islampur Hospitals for identification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety M. Mani said he
did not think sabotage was the cause of the train disaster, adding
that the exact cause of the tragedy would be established only
after the inquiry which will start Thursday and end on August 8.

<HEADLINE> "Special Relations" Claim Fails to Conceal Splittist Nature: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A signed article released by
Xinhua News Agency today said that Lee Teng-hui's recent remarks
on "special state-to-state relations" could not cover up the
nature of his splittism.
</P>
<P>
As the premise and foundation for development of cross-Straits
relations and the final reunification of China, the "one China"
principle is worth neither distortion nor denial, the article by
Li Yihu said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee Teng-hui has redefined relations between the two
sides as "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-state
relations", publicly confronting, and even denying the "one China"
principle.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that in spite of the word "special"
utilized in Lee's statement, his true nature of splittism can not
be concealed, because he has long followed the route of separatism,
and this time he just stripped off the mask.
</P>
<P>
The "two-states" claim could be rather harmful and dangerous,
the article warned, because it has not only destroyed the
foundation of political dialogue and negotiations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits, but also goes against the will of
most Taiwan people, who long for peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The process of pursuing the goal of national reunification is
the process of realizing the principle of "one China", which has
won approval from both the Chinese people and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The article once again urged Lee Teng-hui and the splittist
forces in Taiwan not to underestimate the firm will and ability of
the Chinese government and people to safeguard China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Islamabad Asked to Ensure Security of Americans in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABADD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States has asked
Islamabad to guarantee the security of Americans in Pakistan who
are worrying about possible attacks from some Islamic groups,
informed sources here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Several militant Islamic groups have threatened to target
Americans in Pakistan if the United States strikes bases in
neighboring Afghanistan that Washington believes to be used by
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident wanted by it.
</P>
<P>
The United States has accused Osama of masterminding the
bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa last August.
</P>
<P>
Saturday is the first anniversary of those bombings, which left
more than 200 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The United States fired cruise missiles at the alleged training
camps of Osama in Afghanistan on August 20 last year but, Osama
was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
Osama has denied his involvement in the U.S. embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
Jamiat-e-Islami, the biggist religious party in Pakistan,
recently held several large-scale rallies in which party leaders
called for attacks against Americans if Washington carries out new
strikes against Osama, who is regarded as a hero by many Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Pakistani government ruled out the
possibility of letting the United States use its territory to
launch attacks on Osama.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Military Numerical Weather Forecast System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
software for a military numerical weather forecast system with the
help of high-performance computers.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the system could provide meteorological
services for local wars under high-tech conditions, as well as for
choosing suitable times for satellite launchings and military
operations.
</P>
<P>
They said the operation of the system indicates a major
breakthrough in meteorological backup for the People's Liberation
Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Based on high-performance computers and high-speed regional
networks, the numerical weather forecast system collects and
process global meteorological observation data around the clock
and provide medium-term weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The system was jointly developed by military scientists from
the Headquarters of the General Staff, China Meteorological Bureau,
Chinese Academy of Sciences and some other units over three years.
</P>
<P>
The system has played an important role in meteorological
backup for military operations and satellite launchings during its
trial operation period, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> 1stWritethru: 9 Bodies Found in Philippine Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers Wednesday recovered nine
bodies of people who died in a huge cave-in following a landslide
Tuesday night in a housing subdivision in the northern
Philippines, the National Disaster Coordinating Center (NDCC)
said.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC also feared that 50 people might have been killed in
the tragic disaster which struck the six-hectare Cherry Hill
subdivision in Antipolo City in Rizal province.
</P>
<P>
The subdivision had about 400 concrete houses, more than 300 of
them have been occupied, said the NDCC.
</P>
<P>
According to the NDCC, more than 200 soldiers are working
round-the-clock to find survivors in the worst disaster to hit the
country this year, spawned by rampaging floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Four days of continuous rains flooded northern and central
Luzon island, including Metro Manila, killing at least 48 people
and injuring 32 others with many more missing.
</P>
<P>
The official list of missing persons was placed at 12 but this
did not include the people who were believed inside the 75 to 80
houses that were buried when an avalanche of boulders and mud
rolled over the subdivision.
</P>
<P>
Crumbled houses, twisted steel, giant boulders and mud have
made rescue efforts difficult, said the NDCC.
</P>
<P>
Besides the nine dead, there were 30 injured who were brought
to the hospitals by military rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are worried that the number of fatalities could
rise when rescue workers finish sorting out of the debris from the
devastated Antipolo housing area.
</P>
<P>
The search, rescue and retrieval operations were hampered by
heavy rains, but retrieval operations will continue until the
six-hectare subdivision has been cleared, the NDCC said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, various government agencies have said action would
be taken against people and agencies responsible for the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday that he will
on Thursday summon government officials tasked to monitor housing
projects and environment, and the local officials and ask them to
explain what caused the Antipolo landslides.
</P>
<P>
Observers blamed the conversion of the forest lands in Antipolo
into residential centers as part of the cause of the landslide.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said landslides have been occurring in many areas of
the country and now is the time to strictly enforce a ban on
illegal quarrying and illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
"We really need reforestation and tree planting to prevent
floods," said the president, adding that the only way the country
could put an end to landslides is to put an end to the denudation
of forests.
</P>
<P>
The southwest monsoon rain was spawned by what authorities
claimed as part of the La Nina phenomenon which the country has
been expecting since October last year.
</P>
<P>
At least 17,180 families or 82,591 people were displaced and
64.623 million pesos (1.6 million U.S. dollars) worth of crops and
infrastructure destroyed in the last four days of incessant rains.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has declared a state of calamity in Metro Manila and
three nearby provinces of Rizal, Pangasinan and Pampanga on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies have distributed ready-to-eat food, rice,
drinking water and blankets to flood victims who are temporarily
housed in public schools.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had to gradually release waters from three dam
sites -- Binga and Ambuklao in Benguet province and Angat in
Bulacan province.
</P>
<P>
Metro Manila and practically many parts of northern and central
Luzon island have been submerged following unabated rainfall the
past four days.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Larroza, Officer-in-Charge of the Philippine National
Police, warned Wednesday hoarders, profiteers and other
unscrupulous traders to refrain from taking advantage of the
ongoing calamity situation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some unscrupulous traders in these areas
have hiked prices of basic commodities by as much as 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological authorities predicted that monsoon rains
will still prevail over the western sections of Luzon island in
the next few days.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Return Bodies of Guinean Stowaway Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is to return the bodies
of the two Guinean youths who were found dead in an airplane
landing gear compartment, a local official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Koita Yaguine and Tounkara Fode will be
transported back to their country of Guinea and the Belgian
government will cover the cost for the transport, according to the
spokesperson of the Brussels municipal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
But the official did not say when the bodies would be returned.
</P>
<P>
The two Guinean youths, aged 15 and 16 respectively, were found
dead Monday in the right under-the-wing compartment for storing
landing gears of an Airbus A330-300. The airplane belongs to the
Belgian carrier Sabena.
</P>
<P>
A letter was found on them before Tuesday's autopsy that
confirmed that low temperature during flight caused their death.
</P>
<P>
The two youths appealed in their letter to the European leaders
to pay attention to the youths in Africa that has been plagued by
civil wars.
</P>
<P>
They said in the letter that they took the risk to try to come
to Europe the way they chose for a better opportunity of
education, recreation and sports.
</P>
<P>
The Sabena airliner initiated its flight from Conakry of Guinea
with a stopover at Bamako of Mali before arriving in the Belgian
capital Monday.
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure when the two stowaways got into the
compartment though it is supposed to be routinely checked at each
airport before taking off.
</P>
<P>
At the cruise height of 10,000 meters, the ambient temperature
around the airplane can be 50 degrees or 55 degrees Celsius below
zero. Though it may be a bit warmer inside the landing gear
compartment, the lack of oxygen at that altitude is another deadly
factor during flight.
</P>
<P>
The chance is rare for anyone to survive such a stowaway voyage
though a Senegalese youth managed to survive a five-hour stowaway
flight from Dakar to Lyon of France on January 26 this year.

<HEADLINE> Andorra Takes Steps To Prevent Cigarette Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Andorran authorities are
enforcing a number of legal and administrative measures aimed to
prevent cigarette smuggling, the European Commission said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The legal steps included the law on frauds in customs matters
and the law on the control of sensitive goods, as well as the law
modifying the Penal Code by introducing smuggling as an offense.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive arm said it had close
consultations with Andorra before Europe's principality took the
legal steps. Andorra's adoption of the new legislation is regarded
as the final step in a series of developments which started during
1996, when the small country was identified as one of the main
sources of smuggled cigarettes in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The commission said large quantities of cigarettes were
produced, or imported and stored in Adorra for smuggling into the
other places. Therefore, both EU member states and the EU as a
whole lost about 400 million euros (some 428 million U.S. dollars)
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, illegal cigarette activity was remarkably reduced
after the Andorran authorities showed a positive attitude, coupled
with high levels of cooperation and actions taken by the
neighboring member states, the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"To this extent, Andorra is no longer considered to be a major
source of smuggled cigarettes affecting the EU," it added.
</P>
<P>
The cigarette smuggling was organized on a large scale by
international criminal organizations. Recipients of the smuggled
cigarette consignments have included Andorra's near neighboring
countries such as Spain and France, but large-scale shipments were
also destined for the British and Irishi black markets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise 0.7 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods increased 0.7 percent in June, led by higher demand for
autos and electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
The department said June's gain followed a 1 percent increase
in May, a little less than what the government previously
estimated. But it marked the 10th increase in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
It is the transportation sector which helped bolster June's
overall performance with a 2.3 percent increase, the report said.
A rise in orders for autos and car parts more than offset a
decrease in orders for airplane and aircraft parts. Transportation
posted a hefty 9.9 percent gain in May.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile transportation category, factory
orders would have risen only 0.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the
category that includes household appliances and communications
equipment, jumped 2.4 percent in June, following a drop of 0.9
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
June's overall gain in factory orders came despite a steep 5.1
percent decrease in orders for industrial machinery and equipment,
the sector that includes computers. It was the second straight
monthly decline. In May, orders for industrial machinery fell 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The department's report also offered some positive signs for
the steel industry. Orders for primary metals, the category that
includes steel, rose 0.4 percent in June, following gains in April
and May. The steel industry has been one of the hardest hit by the
world financial crisis, suffering from a flood of cheaper imported
steel.
</P>
<P>
In june, orders for durable goods rose 0.4 percent while orders
for nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, increased 1.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the solid showing in overall factory orders in
June appears to be good news for the U.S. manufacturing sector,
which has been hard-hit and is now recovering from the global
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Arrests Hijackers of Cargo Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region have arrested 14 people of Myanmar nationality
for involvement in the armed hijack of a Panama-registered
freighter.
</P>
<P>
The ship, the Marine Fortuner, was returned today to Ms Liu
Jinxiu, its owner and chairman of the board of a Taiwan investment
company.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Bureau of Guangxi and the Fangchenggang
City government jointly held a press conference today to clarify
the armed hijack case and a ceremony to hand over the ship in
Fangchenggang City.
</P>
<P>
The ship left for Taiwan earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The ship left Nantong Port in east China's Jiangsu Province
March 1 this year, carrying over 6,000 tons of soda, and was
heading for India when it was hijacked by over 20 armed pirates on
March 17.
</P>
<P>
The International Maritime Bureau later issued a circular to
ports worldwide concerning the lost ship.
</P>
<P>
When the "Nuovo Tierra", a ship supposedly registered in
Honduras, put in at Fangchenggang for maintenance, the harbor
administration found that the technical data of the ship were the
same as those of the "Marine Fortuner". The administration then
detained the ship.
</P>
<P>
The public security department of Guangxi confirmed that after
a thorough investigation that the Nuovo Tierra was in fact the
lost ship.
</P>
<P>
The 14 crew members confessed that they had taken part in the
armed hijack.

<HEADLINE> Somali Town Changes Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Somali major faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid recaptured the town of Aw-Dhegleh, some 80
Kilometers south of the capital, from its rival Digil Salvation
Army (DSA) which occupied the farming town for only about one day.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, militiamen loyal to faction
leader Aidid recaptured the town with battle wagons and about a
hundred heavily armed soldiers and chased the DSA forces out of
the town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DSA spokesman, Asad Abdi Mohamed, who told reporters here in
Mogadishu Wednesday, has confirmed the fall of the farming town,
saying its only "a tactful retreat to the bush."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the town is now "no man's land".
</P>
<P>
While Hussein Hassan Diriyeh, who claimed himself as the head
of the town's security, said that town is calm Wednesday and under
full control of the Aidid's forces.
</P>
<P>
Diriyeh added that the DSA fighters have also attacked the
neighboring village of Barirreh, about eight kilometers east of
Aw-Dhegleh town, and was met with the defense of his forces.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources confirmed that at least eight civilians,
including six women were killed and a dozen of others were wounded
in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The warring sides exchanged verbal attacks after the fighting.
The forces of Aidid accused the DSA as bandits for killing
civilians, raping and looting in the town.
</P>
<P>
While, the DSA forces also accused Aidid's forces for the same
crimes. The DSA spokesman said Aidid's men have made a nuisance
in the region by killing a businessman in Badleh village after
looting 2.5 million Somali Shillings worth of about 220 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said that both sides have looted the town
and the nearby villages of Barirreh and Badleh.
</P>
<P>
The DSA spokesman has warned both local and international aid
agencies not to use the Km-50 airstrip, which is among their first
targets of attack, and that if the warning is defied, the
spokesman said, his faction won't shoulder responsibility of any
damage or losses.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Power Shortage to Be Relieved Soon: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will have enough power
early next year when two new generators out of the five under the
Owen Falls Dam Extension project start operation.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Uganda Electricity Board Generation
Manager Alex Mugoya during a tour of the project with the State
Minister for Energy and Mineral Development Francis Babu, Radio
Uganda reported Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The extra 80 megawatts of electricity generated by the two
generators are an addition to the 180 megawatts being currently
produced by the existing Owen Falls dam project built in 1954
which was upgraded from the original 150 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The minster said that the power shortage in Uganda is not only
due to insufficient capacity but there was need to improve
efficiency in transmission and distribution.
</P>
<P>
Illegal consumption should be uprooted if the demand is to be
met and load shedding to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
This is going to be addressed in the new electricity bill to be
tabled in Parliament soon, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Power shortage hinders Uganda's industrial development and
scares away some potential investors. The country is currently
producing 180 megawatts each year, some 80 megawatts short of
demand. The government is to extend the Owen Falls project and to
set up some more power plants in the lower reaches of the Nile
River.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Chief Urges Opposition to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Declaring general amnesty, the
supreme leader of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia, Mulla
Muhammad Omar, Wednesday urged the opposition to surrender.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar, Omar appealed to those still in the ranks of the
anti-Taliban northern alliance to lay down arms and abandon
opposition to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Omar said his militia were now very close to the final victory
in achieving the objectives of maintaining peace and security in
the whole Afghanistan, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In a latest major offensive launched last week, the Taliban
captured a few strategic towns, forcing the troops loyal to
opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood to retreat into the
Panjsher valley.
</P>
<P>
Announcing general amnesty, Omar said it was their "Islamic
obligation" to treat the opponents in accordance with Islamic
injunctions and tenets.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, he said, do not believe in personal revenge and
their operations were aimed at restoring peace and order and
enforcing a true Islamic system in the country.
</P>
<P>
Omar urged the Afghans to realize that they are being "used" by
those opposition leaders for their "vested interests and nefarious
designs."
</P>
<P>
He assured protection of life and property to those who
surrender to the "Islamic Emirate" which the Taliban have
established in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
If they continue to oppose the emirate, the Taliban leader
warned, it will be considered "a revolt."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmaker Condemns U.S. Congressional Bill (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the Foreign
Affairs Committee of China's National People's Congress today
strongly condemned and firmly opposed a bill submitted by Sherrod
Brown and some other members of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The senior lawmaker pointed out that the bill, which was
submitted to the House Committee on International Relations on
July 29, bluntly advocated "One China, One Taiwan" or "the
independence of Taiwan." This has severely infringed upon China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and openly tramples the
norms of international relations, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The bill "grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and
goes against the 'One China' policy adopted by previous U.S.
administrations," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The legislator stressed that there is only one China in the
world. "The government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legitimate government representing the whole of China and
Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory," he stated,
adding that this fact is universally acknowledged by the
international community, including the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taiwan issue is entirely China's internal
affair.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the Taiwan issue, the basic guideline is that the
two sides across the Taiwan Straits should officially end the
state of hostility and achieve peaceful reunification through
negotiations in line with the "one country, two systems" policy
and in conformity with the principle that there is only one China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is also the common aspiration and strong demand of all of
China's nationalities," he said, adding that such a principle also
"fully meets the fundamental expectations of the people in Taiwan.
"
</P>
<P>
According to the lawmaker, Lee Tung-Hui, heedless of the future
and interests of the majority of the Taiwan compatriots, openly
engaged in separatist "two states" rhetoric, which has been
commonly condemned by all the Chinese people, including the
Taiwanese and overseas Chinese worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Government Sells Four Lots of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Lands Department
sold four government lots for a total of 788.5 million HK dollars
(101 million U.S. dollars) at a public auction Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The auction, the third this year, attracted the participation
of mainly small and medium-sized land developers. Big developers,
however, stay on the sideline as the four lots are relatively
small.
</P>
<P>
Among a limited supply of coveted land in Hong Kong, the plot
at the Peak on Hong Kong Island was regarded as the most
successful sale at the auction, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
The 2,463-square-meter site that was designated for luxury
residence was sold for 134 million HK dollars (17.7 million U.S.
dollars), well above the opening price of 88 million HK dollars (
11.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The result demonstrated the developers' confidence with the
market potential of luxury residential lots, according to Charles
Lai, a property strategy consultant.
</P>
<P>
He said developers are quite cautious of investing in the
ordinary residential lots, referring to the sales of the two plots
at Tuen Mun of the New Territories, which were sold for 330
million HK dollars (42.3 million U.S. dollars) and 320 million HK
dollars (41 million U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Currently, it is impossible to have too high land and housing
prices, because many local employees are faced with salary cut and
could not afford high housing expenditure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lai said the sale of the lot at Cheung Chau of the New
Territories was a little lower than the market expectation and it
was sold only at the opening price of 4.5 million HK dollars (577,
000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said the government put the four lots on
the market in order to create and maintain a stable property
market.
</P>
<P>
The price indicates what the market wishes to pay, and the
market is now in a reasonable state, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
Land sale is traditionally a major source of government revenue
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended land sales at the end of June 1998 in
a bid to shore up sagging property prices hit by the Asian
financial crisis. Land auction resumed last April.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmaker Condemns U.S. Congressional Bill (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee's rhetoric was also opposed by the international community,
the Chinese official said, adding: "Lee, scolded by all, has
plunged himself into an isolated corner."
</P>
<P>
For the U.S. side, President Bill Clinton has time and again
reiterated the U.S. stance to stick to the "one China" policy and
expressed "three nots" in line with the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques, namely, not supporting the independence of Taiwan,
not supporting "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and not
supporting Taiwan's entry into any international organization
composed of sovereign states, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Even under such circumstances, Brown and others still openly
asked the U.S. to abandon the "one China" policy, and support "one
China, one Taiwan" or the "independence of Taiwan" in a bid to
support Lee and other separatists who are playing with fire, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Brown's move "bluntly interferes in China's
internal affairs and attempts to put barriers in the path of China
's reunification," and will "definitely raise the tension across
the Taiwan Straits, gravely damage peace and stability in the Asia-
Pacific Region, as well as the relations between China and the
United States."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the U.S. Congress, proceeding from
the overall situation of safeguarding peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific Region and the entire world, takes concrete measures
and put aside that bill.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the U.S. congressmen are fully aware of the
seriousness, the damage, and the risk they will take if they
support separatist activities in Taiwan that may split China," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are peace-loving. However, China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity can never be violated," he
pointed out, saying that "we will defend the state sovereignty and
territorial integrity of our motherland at any price."
</P>
<P>
"China's reunification will definitely be accomplished and
China is capable of realizing such a cause. Any one attempting to
split China is to pick up stone for squashing his own feet,"the
official said, adding that such action is doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seals Off Hebron after Shooting Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers sealed off a
divided Hebron in West Bank Wednesday after two Jewish settlers
were wounded in an ambush possibly carried out by Palestinian
militants overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers imposed a curfew on the Israeli-controlled
part of the city and set up roadblocks around the city, barring
Palestinians from entering and leaving the city.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers also carried out home searches and questioned
people.
</P>
<P>
Two settlers were lightly wounded when unidentified gunmen
opened fire on them Tuesday night while they were driving through
the downtown on the way home in the Jewish settlement of Tel
Romeida in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the first incident of its kind since
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office early last month.
</P>
<P>
Barak has warned of such terror attacks as the troubled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
Barak issued a statement Wednesday condemning the "very
serious attack" and demanding that the Palestinian National
Authority "act with the greatest determination" to capture the
militants.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is a flash-point of conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians since more than 400 Jewish settlers live among
120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to an interim accord signed by the Palestinian and
Isreal in 1997, Israel handed over 80 percent of the city to the
Palestinians but retains control over the rest part.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident also came as Israel and the Palestinians
are at odds over the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye
agreement, which was frozen by Barak's hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu last year.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to reach a comprehensive peace in the region in
about 15 months, Barak has promised to carry out the remaining
two stages of the interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
But he has been seeking to make some changes to the
implementation, proposing to postpone the final stage till after
the final-status talks is well under way.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have repeatedly turned down his idea, urging
him to carry out the agreement in full.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media also revealed earlier this week that Barak is
planning to put off the beginning of the troop withdrawal
stipulated by the agreement until October 1.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Jerusalem Post said Wednesday that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is weighing postponing a
scheduled regional tour because Washington is unhappy with Barak's
proposed delay in the implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
If Albright were indeed to delay her visit, set for next
week, it would be a setback for Barak, who has viewed the
trip as the key to an early resumption of talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Albright wants to see real progress on both the Syrian
and Palestinian tracks before she comes to visit, the Haaretz
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Washington does not intend to get involved in the current
Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the implementation of the Wye
accord, it said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Explanation on "Special State-to-State Relations" Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Taiwan Work
Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office
of the State Council today refuted the Taiwan authorities' written
explanation on "special state-to-state relations".
</P>
<P>
The official said the "Mainland Affairs Council" of the Taiwan
authorities issued a so-called "written explanation on special
state-to-state relations" on August 1.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee Teng-hui did not dare to openly advocate his "two-
states" statement amid strong criticism by Chinese people
worldwide and the pressure of the reiteration by the international
community of the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
So Lee tried to propagate "special state-to-state relations"
instead, in a bid to continue deceiving Taiwan people and the
international community, and his final target is still the "two
states" statement.
</P>
<P>
The official said the written explanation insisted that the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits have been divided into two states, and
China's sovereignty and territory have been cut apart based on Lee
's remarks.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the official said, the Taiwan authorities wanted to
cover up the splittist nature of their "two-states" statement with
the so-called "special characteristics."
</P>
<P>
As is known to all that the government of the People's Republic
of China is the only legitimate government for the whole of China,
and during cross-straits negotiations several basic points must be
insisted upon, that is, there is only one China in the world and
Taiwan is part of China, and China's sovereignty and territory can
not be split up, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the insistence upon the "two-states" statement is a
challenge to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a
challenge to the practical and long-term interest of the Taiwan
compatriots and to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
This act will be severely punished by history, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Subway Fire Kills Two in Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A fire in a subway station in the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku early Wednesday killed two workers and
injured four others, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The fire was believed to be set off by a welding operation at
the Meshadi Azizbekov station, Itar-Tass reported in a dispatch
from Baku, quoting Azad Samedov, deputy chief of the fire
department of Azerbaijan's Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The two dead workers are still being identified. Doctors of
the country's toxicology center are treating the four other
wounded, who were listed in grave conditions.
</P>
<P>
The fire has partially paralyzed the subway services with
trains operating only to the Narimanov station, about four
kilometers from city center. All stations in the residential
areas are closed, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's fire was the second one that hit the Baku subway
system since October, when a fire in the tunnel linking Ulduz and
Narimanov stations killed 289 people and injured about 200. The
fire was caused by a short circuit in a safety lock, Itar-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Baku metro system was also rocked by two explosions in
March and July. A total of 33 persons were killed and more than 50
wounded in those blasts.

<HEADLINE> Forestry Police Headquarters Established </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of a division of
China's armed police force specially trained to fight forest fires
was established here today, in accordance with a decision by the
State Council and the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force, the forest
police shoulder the responsibility of preventing and extinguishing
forest fires, as well as protecting forest resources.
</P>
<P>
The forestry police are mainly stationed in northeast China's
Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region and southwest China's Yunnan Province, to safeguard more
than 36.8 million ha of forest and 22 million ha of grassland.
They are also responsible for ensuring public security in forest
areas.
</P>
<P>
Although functional for 50 years, the forestry police did not
have a headquarters until this February, when the State Council
and the Central Military Commission decided to introduce a new
administrative system for the force.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sports Circles Condemn Lee's "Two States" Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- People from Chinese sports
circles gathered at a forum here today to condemn Lee Teng-hui's "
two states" statement.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two states" statement has fully exposed his ambition to
split up the motherland, and has enraged Chinese people both at
home and overseas, said Wu Shaozu, director of the General
Administration of Sports.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that cross-straits sports exchanges have made big
progress during the past 20 years. From 1989 to 1998, more than 2,
000 people from China's mainland have been to Taiwan for sports
exchanges, while more than 20,000 people from Taiwan have come to
the mainland for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "two states" statement is a serious setback
for the healthy development of cross-straits sports exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Leading athletes, coaches and officials of various sports
organizations also voiced their disapproval of Lee's "two states"
statement at today's forum.

<HEADLINE> Life, Health, Inviolate Citizen Rights: Xinhua Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua News Agency commentary
says today that Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong cult used people's
desire for health to spread superstition, and disturbed people's
ideas by claiming that Falun Dafa is the only way to avoid
calamity.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that from the uncovered facts, people
should have a clear understanding of the Falun Gong cult, which
defrauded practitioners and inveigled them into extremities.
</P>
<P>
"Life is the most precious thing for people, and health is the
guarantor of life," according to the commentary. Citizens have the
right to ask for help from the government and from other people.
</P>
<P>
The Party and the government always pay great attention to the
health of people, and also sets health as a key goal to be
achieved by socialism.
</P>
<P>
Since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the
average life-span in the country has been raised from 35 to 70,
and the infant mortality rate has been decreased from 20 percent
to 31.4 per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong cult took the opposite way and
said that disease is a "preexisting sin." He misled the Falun
Gong practitioners to superstition, and asked them to refuse to go
to the hospital. What he did severely infringed on the life and
health rights of the Falun Gong practitioners.
</P>
<P>
China has explicit laws protecting the health rights of
citizens. Li Hongzhi, however, performed a spiritual poisoning
act to lead Falun Gong practitioners into a dead end. He is the
real culprit.
</P>
<P>
The commentary calls on people to arm themselves with science
and leave no room for Li Hongzhi and other cultists.

<HEADLINE> Jalabert is to Leave Hospital Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Top cyclist Laurent Jalabert is
almost fully recovering and hope to leave the hospital Thursday, a
hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday, boosting his chances of
taking part in next month's Tour of Spain.
</P>
<P>
The French rider has been recuperating from cracks to the side
of the skull and right collarbone following a fall in a Spanish
regional cycling tour, said doctors at Madrid's Ramon y Cajal
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
ONCE-Deutsche Bank team director Manolo Saiz has not ruled out
Jalabert's chances of racing in September's Tour of Spain. He is,
however, unlikely to participate in this Saturday's San Sebastian
Classic.
</P>
<P>
The cyclist, ranked No. 1 in the world, fell while riding
Sunday during the opening stage of the week-long Castilla y Leon
regional cycling tour.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Discarded by Former Practitioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Many former practitioners say
that Falun Gong's claim to heal the sick is false, and vow never
again to have anything to do with the cult.
</P>
<P>
Gao Qingyin, deputy chief of the Falun Gong general
instruction station in the east China province of Anhui, revealed
that one fellow practitioner suffered from a brain hemorrhage in
the second half of 1994, and died soon after.
</P>
<P>
"During his illness, we called on the Falun Dafa Research
Society four times and asked for the help of Li Hongzhi," Gao said.
However, Li, the founder of Falun Gong, did nothing.
</P>
<P>
"Li's claim that one will be well with a single wave of hand
is nothing but cheating and tricks," said Gao, who broke from the
cult when the government banned it last month.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dequn, a professor of Chinese medicine in Anhui, also
woke up. "I should never have practiced Falun Gong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang picked up Falun Gong in 1994 when he was
engaged in some very difficult medical research. The mysterious
part of Falun Gong attracted Wang, who hoped to find some answers
in it.
</P>
<P>
However, once he joined the cult, he found himself totally
distracted from his work and medical research. "It's really
terrifying when I think of those days," he said.
</P>
<P>
University graduate Wang Weili in the city of Harbin, the
capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, attempted
suicide after she had been practicing Falun Gong for some time. "I
was ruined by Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong cult," she said.

BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Falun Gong cult,
Li Hongzhi, is a man with evil political ambitions, said Professor
Li Chongfu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) during
an interview with the Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
When Li Hongzhi said that no government can save the world, but
only his Falun Dafa can, he explicitly exposed his evil anti-
government purpose, professor Li Chongfu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li and his research group also discovered that Li
Hongzhi had ideas and actions compatible with his political
ambitions and purposes.
</P>
<P>
First, Li Hongzhi used terms such as "trueness, benevolence,
and forbearance" to execute control and make fools of people.
</P>
<P>
Second, Falun Gong has a large and tight illegal organization
as an instrument and base to realize its political purpose.
</P>
<P>
Third, Li Hongzhi said that he is the only master of Falun Dafa
in order to dominate and govern his followers.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Li Hongzhi used his Falun Gong cult to stir up
followers to attack the government, newspapers, and TV stations
with the purpose of pressuring the Party and the government.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li noted that Li Hongzhi's words and deeds show that
Falun Dafa is an illegal organization in every way.
</P>
<P>
"We also found that the ultimate political goal of Li Hongzhi
and his Falun Gong cult is to overthrow the socialist legitimate
political power and establish the so-called 'Falun world' with Li
Hongzhi as the ruler, which is also the key point of the Falun
Gong cult," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Hit By Lightening Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada's west coast city Vancouver
suffered a thousand lightening strikes Tuesday, with power outages
and a dozen forest fires reported during the storm.
</P>
<P>
Two main transmission lines to Vancouver Island from the
mainland were struck, knocking out electricity to much of the
island, as well as to several thousand homes elsewhere in the
Vancouver area, the local television said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Crews were called in to fight a dozen or so forest fires
sparked by the lightening storm, while helicopters were out
looking for any other signs of smoke, the local forest service was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A woman doing greens maintenance at a golf course in suburban
Burnaby was injured by a lightning strike six meters away. She
was taken to hospital after being knocked off a riding mower.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the storm appeared to be bypassing when it
veered suddenly, touching down on the golf course, where staff
didn't "have a chance" for quick evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver Island was already stormed Monday night, when the
islanders counted as many as 6,000 lightening strikes, according
to the television report.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader in Egypt for Talks on Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
arrived in Egypt Wednesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak
on bilateral relations and Libya's efforts to restore normal ties
with the rest of the world after seven years of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi crossed into Egypt's border town of Salloum earlier in
the day and was greeted at the border crossing point by Governor
of Matrouh Governorate Kamel Amer, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
This was Gaddafi's first trip to Egypt since April after Libya
handed over two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. The explosion killed 270 people, most
of them American or British.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will meet Gaddafi in the Mediterranean town of Mersa
Matrouh, 550 kilometers northwest of Cairo, the news agency said.
Mubarak arrived in the town earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to urge Gaddafi to press the implementation
of the joint ventures in the fishery industry and land reclamation
deals, which were agreed on during the Libyan leader's Egyptian
visit in March.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to discuss trade ties,
Gaddafi's efforts to convene an extraordinary African summit in
Tripoli next month, and efforts to lift the U.N. sanctions on
Libya instead of suspending.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council suspended the sanctions,
including an international flight ban, in April following Libya's
handover of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi came to Egypt by road instead of by plane as the
neighbors' air traffic remains frozen in their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi has accused Egypt and other Arab countries of doing too
little to support him in the confrontation with the West over the
Lockerbie issue.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes U.N. Committee for Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Wednesday criticized the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking contracts Iraq signed with
foreign companies under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A total of 457 Iraqi contracts worth 756 million U.S. dollars
signed under the fifth phase of the oil-for-food program are still
blocked by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, said an Iraqi Trade
Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said in a statement carried by the Iraqi
News Agency that Iraq held American and British representatives in
the United Nations committee of responsible for hampering the
endorsement of those contracts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the continuation of hampering the contracts
revealed the aggressive policy pursued by the United States and
Britain toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that those contracts comprise 95 for the industrial
sector and 72 for the health sector while the other contracts
cover the sectors of transport, oil, commerce, water and sewage,
irrigation, higher education and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to export has been raised to 5.2 billion
dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated Iraq's demand for putting an end to
the stringent embargo and that the oil-for-food deal should not be
exploited to prolong the embargo imposed on the country following
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Container Shipping Booming in South China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics indicate
that the Shenzhen Container Port in south China's Guangdong
Province is experiencing a prosperous period.
</P>
<P>
It has entered the world's top 20 ranks for related facilities
and transport capacity. Last year, it gained a 19th-place ranking,
based on a vigorous year-on-year growth rate of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum continued during the first half of this
year, with the port handling 1.28 TEU (ton equivalent unit)
containers, up 64.2 percent on the previous year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The port's booming business is attributed to the improved
numbers and operations of its international regular shipping
routes, which both rank first in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, 21 of the world's most prestigious shipping companies
have opened 33 regular shipping routes to the port. An average of
109 cargo ships berth at the port per month.
</P>
<P>
The port's throughput increased from 179,000 tons in 1994 to 1.

<HEADLINE> China Asks Paging Companies to Re-register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) and the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce (SAIC) released a notice recently asking paging providers
to re-register in order to put an end to serious radio
communications disturbances by paging services affecting aircraft
and sea communications.
</P>
<P>
Paging stations with working frequencies in accord with state
demand, and having approval from related departments, can re-
register in industry and commerce administration departments.
</P>
<P>
Those causing continued disturbance to the aircraft navigation
systems and over-water communications after technical upgrading
will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Those with working frequencies conflicting with state rules
will also be closed, said the notice.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiujun, a MII official, noted that the increasing number
of paging stations, the irrational locations of paging service
providers, and poor equipment have all contributed to the
disturbance of normal air traffic and over-water communications.
</P>
<P>
In August 1997, Shenzhen Airport was closed for two hours
because of electromagnetic disturbance from paging stations.
Similar hazards also occurred at the Beijing International Airport.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has witnessed the rapid development of
paging services, and by the end of this June, the country had
over 1,763 paging companies and more than 72 million pager users.
</P>
<P>
"But one-third of the providers are too small, and there are
too many of them," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that the MII encourages mergers among paging
companies, and that this should be the future direction for China'
s paging industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 80 pigs in Mozambique's
Maputo Province have died of African swine fever, while 220 are
infected with the disease since March this year.
</P>
<P>
Americo Conceicao, head of the Provincial Animal-farming
Services, revealed this here Tuesday, warning that tens of
thousands of pigs will be lost if no precautions are made, the
Noticias newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first case of swine fever was discovered in the pig farm in
the veterinary faculty in the University of Eduardo Mondlane. The
epidemic then spread to the suburban areas of capital Maputo and
nearby cities.
</P>
<P>
Swine fever broke out in the province in 1995 when the
pig-farming industry in southern Mozambique was almost destroyed.
</P>
<P>
African swine fever is very infectious with a strong resistant
virus. It could be infectious through blood, saliva, dung, dead
body, equipment and water. Once infected, blue spots can be
detected on the pig within four to 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expects 2-3 Percent GDP Growth for 2nd Quarter 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) for the second quarter of this year could grow by
between 2.0 and 3.0 percent, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is definitely going to be plus and not minus, between 2.0
and 3.0 percent, he told reporters after launching the second
National Economic Consultative Council (NECC II).
</P>
<P>
The 2-3 percent growth projection is a clear indication that
Malaysia's economy is recovering after a painful recession last
year when it contracted by 7.5 percent and by a lesser margin of
1.3 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Negara (state bank) said that the country was
already out of recession judging from the GDP growth of 1.4
percent recorded in the February to March period this year
compared with the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's quick recovery was attributed to the National
Economic Recovery Plan which stimulated business activity and to
the selective capital controls which insulated the economy from
financial instability.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of a massive outflow of funds from September
1, 1999 when the levy on the repatriation of foreign capital
expires, Mahathir said, "If they want to take their money out we
allow that."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia however has generated enough international reserves to
withstand the outflow, he said, adding his government had taken
measures to attract long-term foreign investments into the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The three baby Siberian tigers
which were successfully delivered through a Cesarean section over
a month ago are in good health.
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old mother tiger, "Erhuan," was considered too old
for labor in a natural birth, having been pregnant twice before
and giving birth to stillborns.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth birth of the baby tigers, veterinarians at
a local hospital decided to perform a Cesarean on her, the first
such operation to be performed on a tiger.
</P>
<P>
Nine dogs served as wet nurses for the three cub tigers after
their birth, and the young tigers are now gaining weight and
becoming stronger by the day, according to attendants at the city
zoo.
</P>
<P>
"The tiger cubs will be released into the jungles to adapt to
life in the wild when they grow older," said one attendant.
</P>
<P>
Listed as an endangered species by the World Wildlife Fund, the
Siberian tiger has been declining in number due to a deteriorating
natural environment, and only about 200 of them are now found in
China, less than 20 living in the wild.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Explore New Sectors to Overcome Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia must go into new
sectors in order to overcome the economic crisis, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New sectors which could contribute to economic growth must be
identified and explored, he said here when launching the Second
National Economic Consultative Council (NECC II), a new council to
formulate new development policy for the first decade of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
He said that for example, information technology (IT) could be
used to develop new IT based industries.
</P>
<P>
The country's Multimedia Super Corridor offers great potential
and training in this sector must be enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said an industry based on composite materials, which
are increasingly being used in automobiles and aircraft, could
contribute to the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the agriculture sector needed a new development
approach such as introducing large-scale estate management methods
in vegetable, fruit production and fish farming and adopting new
fishing techniques.
</P>
<P>
"The agriculture industry could be developed further with this
approach, not only in reducing food imports but also to export
surplus produce," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the agriculture sector had previously not been given
much attention as the country focused on developing the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The NECC II launched Wednesday will formulate proposals for a
new development policy which will guide the country's development
after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It will also look at strategies and targets on income
distribution, restructuring of human resources, shareholding and
taking into consideration macroeconomic factors, the main economic
sectors and foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The NECC II has 155 members drawn from political parties,
chambers of commerce, professional bodies, industry and business
associations, non-governmental organizations, minority groups,
youths, women and selected individuals.
</P>
<P>
The council has to complete its task by August next year.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, U.S.  Lift Visa Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government and the
United States of America have lifted visa acquisition in a bid to
strengthen the existing bilateral relationship between the two
countries, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The move will be effective immediately, the U.S. government
can issue ten-year, multiple-entry, no fee visas to Rwanda
citizens who qualify for a U.S visa," U.S Ambassador to Rwanda
George Staples was quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwandans still must pay 45 U.S. dollars application fee and
must still meet the qualifications set forth in the U.S
immigration law," he further noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, a visa gives a traveler permission to request
entry to the U.S. The immigration officer at the port of entry
will authorize the length of stay which is usually six months for
tourism or business trips.
</P>
<P>
"Travelers must request an extension from the department of
immigration in the U.S for stays beyond six months," Staples
indicated.
</P>
<P>
Applications for student visas must submit an original 1-20
form issued by educational institution, proof of funds available
to pay for one's studies and English language skills.
</P>
<P>
"Submission of fraudulent documents may result in permanent
ineligibility for a visa," Staples confirmed.
</P>
<P>
In the cabinet meeting held at the end of last month,
Vice-President Major General Paul Kagame said Rwanda will also
give free entry visas to their American counterparts who wish to
visit Rwanda for tourism and business.
</P>
<P>
Donald Kaberuka, Minister of Finance and Economic Planning,
highlighted that Rwanda appreciated the bilateral relationship
existing between the two countries through visa rifting and
open-sky agreements where aircraft fly freely in and out of the
two states.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Ozone Layer Protection Opens in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on
protection of the Earth's ozone layer opened today in this capital
of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Chinese and foreign experts and officials from
related departments of the United Nations, Sweden and China's
State Environment Protection Administration are attending the
seminar, and have warned that human beings cannot exist without
the ozonosphere.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed global protection of the ozone layer,
environment protection on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and ways to
decrease the production and use of Freon in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
To date, 168 countries have agreed to the Montreal Pact on
Ozonosphere Protection. It is estimated that the production of
Freon has reduced the ozone layer by as much as 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A UN official said that the various man-made gases are
destroying the ozonosphere, and this could lead to many diseases
such as skin cancer and cataracts, as well as do irreparable harm
to agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Human activities in Tibet have also caused some loss to the
ozone layer in summer and further protection of the natural
environment in this region remains an urgent task.

<HEADLINE> Noted Macao Businessman Refutes Separatist Remarks in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A well-known businessman in Macao
spoke strongly of the separatist remarks concocted by Taiwan's Lee
Teng-hui, noting that the remarks are unpopular among all Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, told
local media that the separatist remarks by Lee Teng-hui run
counter to the "one China policy" and reveal his attempt to split
the sacred territory of Taiwan from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The respected businessman pointed out that the remarks have met
with criticism among people throughout China and among Chinese
compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The criticism fully demonstrates that attempt to split the
motherland is unpopular, goes against the trend of history, and
will surely end in shameful failure," Ma Man Kei said.
</P>
<P>
"If Lee Teng-hui does not take back his separatist remarks in
time, he will leave infamy behind him," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government expects to resolve the Taiwan question
and achieve the reunification of the motherland by means of peace,
but it never vows to renounce the use of force, Ma Man Kei said,
adding that the use of force aims to cope with independent
activities in Taiwan and foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei warned, "Lee Teng-hui and his accomplices should not
underestimate the resolution, determination and capability of the
Chinese government and people to stop separation and safeguard
territorial integrity of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"(Lee Teng-hui) should not lead Taiwan and its 22 million
people to dangerous circumstances," said Ma, who also expressed
the hope that Lee Teng-hui and his followers can wake up to and
avoid danger at the last moment.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Sees Tax-Revenue Increase in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region registered a total of 3.567 billion yuan in tax
revenues in the first half of this year, up 23 percent compared to
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Steady economic growth, rising industrial production, and
gradual recovery of state-owned enterprises are seen as the main
contributors to the revenue increase.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical industry, the region's pivotal industry,
increased its output and sales by a wide margin during the period,
also prompting the increase.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the region recorded a 6.6 percent
increase in its GDP, up 2.5 percentage points over the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
With tax offices at various levels redoubling their efforts to
collect defaulted taxes, and strengthening control of tax-
collecting, the autonomous region succeeded in getting back 350
million yuan of revenues defaulted over previous fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang also received 287 million yuan of revenues by stemming
tax evasion and plugging tax-collecting loopholes in the first six
months.

<HEADLINE> Electricity Charges Up by 25 Percent in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Electricity Regulatory
Board (ERB) has announced the rise in electricity charges by
between 10 to 25 percent as from August 1.
</P>
<P>
Chief Power Engineer Kevin Kariuki told Xinhua Wednesday that
electricity charges range between 1.55 shillings per kilowatt-hour
(kwh) for those consuming less than 50 units to 13.80 shillings
for the consumption of between 3,001 and 7,000 units.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the 1.55 shillings per kwh is a life-line
rate specially for the needed, and that's why the electricity
charges differ greatly.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Regulatory Board, its Chairman
Moses Wetangula said domestic consumers would now pay a fixed
charge of 75 shillings (one U.S. dollar) a month.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate for off peak hours has gone down to encourage
heavy electricity users to opt for low rate production hours and
ease the load on the national power supply.
</P>
<P>
Large commercial and industrial consumers will now pay six
shillings per kwh and a low rate of three shillings per kwh
depending on supply voltage.
</P>
<P>
Wetangula said 144 industrial concerns including the largest
electricity consumers and individuals were called by the board to
a public hearing to air their views about the proposed tariff
increase.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Power and Lighting Company wanted a rise in charges in
order to make the power sub-sector attractive to private sector
investors and provide resources for expanding power generation,
transmission and distribution capacity, said the chairman.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Issues Presidential Decree to Confirm Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has issued a presidential decree to confirm the results of the
June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
"The decree is dated August 4, 1999," State Secretary/Justice
Minister Muladi said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said the president had to make a decision on the legal
status of the poll results, which have drawn controversy after 27
of the 48 political parties refused to sign them due to alleged
election fraud.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1999 General Election Law, if less than two-thirds of
the General Elections Committee (KPU) members sign, the results
cannot be declared officially valid.
</P>
<P>
The KPU, which include representatives from the 48 political
parties and five government representatives, handed over the case
to the head of state for a decision.
</P>
<P>
In an informal meeting with leaders of political parties which
won seats in the House of Representatives (DPR) and KPU leaders
Tuesday, Habibie said he has approved the poll results.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said the decree concerns the legalization of the
election results based on a certificate of tabulation on the vote
count submitted by the district election committees, provincial
election committees and the KPU.
</P>
<P>
The decree also asks the KPU and the Indonesian Election
Committee (PPI) to continue observing the various stages of the
election process until the general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president. It will
comprise the DPR members plus 200 appointed regional and interest
groups' representatives. The House itself will have 500 members,
462 of whom will come from the 48 political parties that contested
the election. The remaining 38 members will be military personnel
and policemen appointed by the Armed Forces leadership.
</P>
<P>
The PPI concluded the vote count on July 15, giving the bulk of
the 462 seats at stake to five major parties. The main opposition
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) won with 33.74
percent of votes, outnumbering the ruling Golkar Party, which
trailed with 22.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trailing in third place is the National Awakening Party with
12.61 percent, followed by the United Development Party (10.71
percent) and the National Mandate Party (7.12 percent).

<HEADLINE> Maradona, Kempes Set Sight on Chinese Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Argentina soccer star
Diego Maradona might make his comeback to competition for the
fourth time as he expressed his wish to be a coach-player in
soccer-crazy China.
</P>
<P>
Another heavyweight Mario Kempes, who led Argentina to the 1978
World Cup champions, also took fancy to Chinese soccer and made no
secret of his willingness to coach a club of the 14-team Chinese
professional soccer league, according to the Chines Sports Daily
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kempes, who paid his first visit to China with his agent
Horacio Fernandez last week, used the term "shock" to describe his
feeling about Chinese professional soccer league, which was
initiated six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Maradona did not know their visit until Kempes was leaving here
but he managed to get in touch with Fernandez through Beijing-
based Argentina Embassy to China, showing his willingness to play
and coach here.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who was also the agent of Maradona, stressed that
Maradona, 38, planned his return to soccer in China not for the
sake of money but for his liking for the Chinese soccer atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who led Argentina to the title of the 1986 World Cup
and finished runners-up at the 1990 Italy World Cup, had been
idolized by Chinese soccer fans for his unmatched skills.
</P>
<P>
During his spell with Boca Junior club of Argentina, the soccer
star paid his first visit to China in 1996 and played two matches
with local teams.
</P>
<P>
Maradona had managed to recover from a 15-month suspension from
the Italian league in the late 1980's and a second ban during the
1994 World Cup. However he failed doping test in 1997 which made
his later comeback short-lived and put an end to his playing
career.
</P>
<P>
Maradona tried the role of coach-player in Argentina after the
end of his playing career but it turned out to be unsuccessful.

trained in Japan. Then he leaned from a famous European coach, Zlatko
Condas, how to improve several skills. When Zlatko left Canada in 1977,
Sharara had the opportunity to coach the Canadian teams at
international competitions including the Commonwealth and world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Sharara became the Technical Director for the Canadian Table
Tennis Association and in short time was promoted to the CEO
position. Up to this time his efforts and contributions were as a
volunteer. He re-organized the association with a masterplan and
developed a strategy to accelerate the functions of the
administrators and the technicians alike. He became a director for
the Canadian Olympic Association.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 Sharara was nominated to be the North American Council
member for the ITTF and seven years later he moved from Vice President
to Deputy President. He was elected as ITTF President in
one-candidate voting on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The shareholders of the French banks Societe Generale and
Paribas have three days before voting on whether to support a take-
over bid by the Banque Nationale de Paris against the two banks,
or to support an independent alliance of the two banks. The half-
year merger battle between the three banks has benefited the
French newspapers the most with advertisement fees of some 150
million francs (25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
-- The bodies of two Guinean youths were found Monday in the
landing train of a passenger plane of the Belgian airline Sebena
arriving at the Brussels airport from Conakry and Bamako. The two
Africans were killed by a coldness of minus 50 degrees when the
plane was flying at the cruising altitude, after slipping into the
landing train to immigrate illegally to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Europe is expected to be at the head of global economic
growth in the year 2000 with an envisaged rate of expansion
between 3 and 4 percent in the euro zone. In France, the sales of
new cars increased by a record 25 percent in July over one year
ago, while Germany is expected to have a 3 percent economic growth
this year. Spain's unemployment has also dropped to the lowest
since 1981 due to a sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government has closed eight camps for young
scouts out of precaution against risks for the children, one year
after the accident in Perros-Guirec in the French Alps, in which
several scouts were killed during a mountain rambling. The
government has also warned parents against those associations
which use the label "scout" but know nothing about this field.

<HEADLINE> Civilian Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was killed
and an army soldier wounded Wednesday morning in south Lebanon
during conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas,
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a truck driver was killed by a roadside bomb
while travelling to Naqoura in the western sector of the
Israel-occupying border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There have been no groups claiming responsibility for the
bombing. Roadside bomb attacks, however, were usually adopted by
Lebanese guerrillas in fighting against Israeli troops and the
pro-Israel South Lebanon Army in the area.
</P>
<P>
Also in the day, a Lebanese soldier was wounded in an Israeli
shelling near the Hamra crossing point south of Tyre, the
country's southern coastal city.
</P>
<P>
The incidents raised to 18 the number of civilians killed in
south Lebanon since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla targets in south Lebanon by firing air-to-surface
missiles in an apparent response to earlier attacks launched by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damages in the
raid which has been confirmed by Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli and the SLA out of the
country.

<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Companies are being invited to pay hundreds of thousands of
pounds to sponsor Big Ben as it strikes midnight at the start of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- France and Germany on Tuesday refused to open their markets
to British beef even though the European Union embargo was lifted
at the start of this month. The British government warned that
delay could prompt EU legal action.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Farmers celebrating the lifting of the ban on Britain's 520
million pound beef export business this week are facing a fresh
disaster - their cattle might never be sold abroad because
European Union slaughter rules have made it "economic suicide" to
open new abattoirs to restart the trade.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Women are more likely than men to turn their left cheeks to
a camera or a portrait artist because this is the half of the face
that shows a person's emotional side, a study has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Members of the Royal Family will on Wednesday join Queen
Elizabeth to celebrate the Queen Mother's 99th birthday. Hundreds
of well-wishers are expected to gather and the Queen is due to
lead the tributes at a family lunch.

<P>
CSIR Director General R. A. Mashelkar said Wednesday that the

"The strategy is to stimulate higher levels of innovation
through a judicious system of rewards, ensure timely alliances for
enhancing the IP value," Mashelkar said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Bank to Ensure Y2K Compliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia has said it is
closely monitoring the financial institutions and has put in
measures to ensure that all principal customers and suppliers of
services to such institutions are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted public relations director
Kabinga Panda of the central bank as saying that it is mandatory
for all commercial banks to include in their Y2K progress reports
the relationship they have with their major clients.
</P>
<P>
"We have system in place to monitor the 2000 millenium bug
problem and at the moment almost all commercial banks are
compliant," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some commercial banks' major clients are Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank does not directly monitor the
commercial banks' major clients to ensure they are compliant, he
added.
</P>
<P>
A survey at some commercial banks' stands show that there could
be a problem with some giant clients since some may not be Y2K
compliant or may just fail to be compliant by the turn of the
century.

<P>
AMMAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has agreed to extradite
within days a Yemeni national to Sanaa who shot and killed a
Yemeni diplomat in Amman in June.
</P>
<P>
On June 5, Ahmad Mohammad Saleh stormed into the Yemeni Embassy
premises, shooting and killing consul Mohammad hmoud Mashidi and
wounding his deputy Fuad Zihairi, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan agreed to extradite the suspect since he is a Yemeni

The suspect was allegedly drunken when he stormed into the
Yemeni mission and shot the diplomats.

He has been under custody of Jordanian police since the
shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Sanaa has sought to get the suspect back for trial and Amman
responded positively to the request, Jordan Times said.

Both Jordan and Yemen are signatories to security-related and
anti-terrorist agreements under the umbrella of the Arab

<HEADLINE> China Improving Rural Credit Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
today announced a new set of regulations governing the management
of small loans to farmers by rural credit cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC, the country's central bank, said that
this new move aims at improving the services of rural credit
cooperatives, increase credit for rural households and
agricultural production, and simplify loan procedures.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, small loans to farmers are
defined as short-term loans of limited amount and are secured by
the farmers' credit.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations say these loans must be used for crop
planting, animal husbandry, and other agricultural production, or
for private economies that serve agricultural production, farm
equipment and machinery, or for small-scale water conservation
projects.
</P>
<P>
Those using the loans must be local households or self-employed
individuals with a good credit record and a steady income.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said this procedure is a practical step toward
solving the farmers' difficulties in obtaining loans, and is
expected to provide timely and convenient financial support to
agricultural production.

TOKYO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday as high-tech blue chips were sold actively amid
expectation that the dollar would remain weak.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 284.55 points, or 1.58
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 17,685.38.

The expectation that the dollar's weakness against the yen

<HEADLINE> Zambian Economy not Likely to Grow in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian economy is not likely
to grow in real terms in 1999, a economist has said.
</P>
<P>
Meebelo Mutukwa, former general manager for Gavmont Merchant
Bank, said this is because the productive sectors remain under
siege from the tripartite difficulties of fierce competition from
imports, high and rising domestic costs and a shrinking market,
making stagflation a reality.
</P>
<P>
This was drawn from strategic considerations for Zambia's
agriculture sector in light of liberalization and globalization,
Financial Mail newspaper Wednesday quoted Mutukwa as saying at the
recent 94th Zambia National Farmers Union Congress held in capital
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Mutukwa said he is perplexed with the sunny optimism Zambians
have continued to display in light of the persistent contraction
of the productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We have in our collective consciousness, attached our future
expectations of future prosperity to the privatization of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the flood of foreign
investment, the resumption of heavy drops of aid from donor
countries."
</P>
<P>
This should not be the case as a significant portion of new
investment into the mines will be book entries as over 90 percent
of the capital expenditure will be for imported machinery, spares
and expertise, said the economist.
</P>
<P>
He also said logistical difficulties ranging from time lags in
obtaining licenses, permits, serviced land telephone lines, low
effective market demand given the low and failing real incomes of
the Zambian consumer, more attractive tax and duty incentives in
neighboring countries and lack of resolution to critical issues
pose serious questions to the basis of optimism.
</P>
<P>
Mutukwa, however, said he was happy to note that the export
enclaves such as horticulture, floriculture, coffee and tobacco
under specific schemes that are significantly funded by
multilateral and bilateral funds at rational rates of interest
with repayment periods longer than one season have achieved
impressive results.
</P>
<P>
"This growth must be assessed further in the context of
international market access and reasonable price realization," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mutukwa also called on Zambian companies to focus on achieving
economies of scale through expansion or collaboration where they
could pull basic infrastructural to transport facilities to avoid
expenses on intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
In this way, optimal results would be achieved, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Eyes Ban on Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that he is considering imposing a complete
ban on illegal logging in central Rizal province after a landslide
hit a subdivision there Tuesday night and killed at least eight
persons.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a radio interview that this would be a
stop-gap measure while his administration carries out long-term
solutions to prevent the recurrence of similar disasters in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that without a massive reforestation and tree
planting program, the dredging and cleaning of drainage systems
would not be of much help to prevent flooding.
</P>
<P>
Search and rescue operations continue at the Cherry Hills
subdivision in Antipolo city, where about 50 houses were destroyed
by a landslide Tuesday night as heavy rains which started Sunday
continued pelting Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Presidential Palace said that 10 residents of
the collapsed subdivision are still missing, while 28 people have
been rescued in the debris and about 200 survivors were evacuated
to a nearby church.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado rushed to the scene Wednesday
morning to supervise the massive search and rescue operation
performed mainly by the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government said that flash floods on Luzon
Island starting Sunday have killed at least 35 people, submerged
nearly 300 villages and affected more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada declared Tuesday a state of
calamity in Metro Manila and the provinces of Pangasinan, Pampanga
and Rizal and ordered the release of 440 million pesos (11 million
U.S. dollars) from the calamity fund.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all government agencies to coordinate search,
rescue and relief operations to ensure the safety of residents in
the affected areas and safeguard the properties of residents who
abandoned flooded homes.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Larroza, officer-in-charge of the Philippine National
Police (PNP), warned Wednesday hoarders, profiteers and other
unscrupulous traders refrain from taking advantage of the ongoing
calamity situation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some unscrupulous traders in these areas
have hiked prices of basic commodities by as much as 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological authorities predict that monsoon rains will
still prevail over the western sections of Luzon Island in the
next few days.

<HEADLINE> 29 Public Firms Sold in Tanzania: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania sold 29 public
firms, earning 57.38 million U.S. dollars last year, Minister of
State Nassoro Malocho has said.
</P>
<P>
The government had planned to divest 50 firms last year, but
sales agreement were concluded for only 29, Malocho told the
National Assembly or parliament in the central city Dodoma
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to divest the state-owned firms
through the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission at a
rate of 50 a year, The African Wednesday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The privatization exercise, however, has been affected by heavy
 indebtedness of some parastatals.
</P>
<P>
"Many firms are in the red, unable to pay salaries to employees
and have huge liabilities," he said. "This scares away investors."
</P>
<P>
By last December, 270 out of 395 public firms scheduled for
divestiture have been sold and the remaining 125 are at different
stages of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to divest parastatal companies to create
more jobs and enhance national income.
</P>
<P>
The firms cover telecommunications, harbors, water and
sanitation, as well as petroleum refinery and railway sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed with World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to remove 50 companies from government control
annually.
</P>
<P>
During July 1997 to June 1998, a total of 52 companies and nine
non-core entities were divested, according to figures released by
the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission.

<HEADLINE> Devil Worship Alive in Kenya: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Devil worship is widespread in
Kenya with rituals of human sacrifice and nudity in prayers, the
Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted a report of survey as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report titled the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into
the Cult of Devil Worship in Kenya was recently released to
religious organizations but never made public, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by prominent religious leaders and
presented to President Daniel arap Moi in 1995, claims that the
tentacles of evil sects reached into schools, churches and even
government offices with an assistant minister and his wife cited
as known satanists.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that such groups, which are secretive,
destructive and deliberate, "generally" have the rituals including
the presence of snakes, drinking human blood, eating human flesh,
human sacrifice, sexual abuse and rape.
</P>
<P>
A group named Freemasons allegedly prayed at night, in the dark
and nudity, and walked backwards into their temple after
completing their rituals, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also makes recommendations including the
establishment of a special police unit to probe occult activities
like ritual killings and other crimes.

<HEADLINE> HK's Drinking Water Source Well Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The people of Hong Kong are now
reassured of the quality of the water they drink everyday, since a
recent survey showed that the water piped in through Shenzhen, a
neighboring boom town, is much clearer than ever.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong depends for 70 percent of its fresh water on
Dongjiang River water that comes in from Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
This latest water-quality report from the State Environmental
Protection Administration suggests that the quality of water
sampled from the river's mainstream can be classified as at the
national first and second degree level.
</P>
<P>
Peng Zhiliang, director of the Southwest China Environment
Research Institute under the administration, told Xinhua that the
river is actually one of the most well-protected in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the quality of reservoir water in
Shenzhen has been improved by a wide margin because of
environmental protection efforts made by the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The swelling population and fast urban construction in Zhujiang
River Delta area in Guangdong has contributed to growing water
contamination in the Dongjiang River.
</P>
<P>
The area was a large stretch of fertile farmland until the
1980s, but has been quickly developed and exploited because of its
proximity to Hong Kong, and the population has grown to more than
one million from some 100,000 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has reacted quickly to introduce
regulations and policies to deal with environmental problems in
this rapidly developing region. On the 83-km-long water conduit to
Hong Kong, there are now seven sewage treatment plants, including
several large facilities, with the combined daily capacity to
treat 115,000 tons sewage.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has used 280 million yuan to build a biochemical
sewage-treatment plant, which will come on line by year's end.
</P>
<P>
Silt dredging in Shenzhen reservoir also will be carried out
later this year. This project will take three years to remove one-
million cubic meters of sludge in the reservoir bed to reduce
organic pollutant in the water.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is working with Shenzhen on replacing outdated pipes
from 1964 to further reduce contamination, a project that is
expected to be completed by 2002 at a cost of five billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Efforts to Fight Low-price Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), China's price watchdog, has intensified efforts
to fight low-price dumping activities by issuing a 20-article
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation aims to crack down on low-price dumping,
rampant in recent years in business activities, in an attempt to
maintain a fair market for price competition, an SDPC official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is also necessary to enable relevant departments
and localities to use legal means in exercising macroeconomic
controls, safeguard the State's interests as well as the rights
and interests of businesses and consumers, stimulate domestic
demand, and lift the state-owned enterprises out of difficulties
within three years, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC, along with other governmental departments, had
already adopted several measures to prevent low-price dumping in
the industrial sector, and these efforts have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Low-price dumping began spreading as market competition became
stronger, the official said, stressing that the new regulation
will cover any low-price dumping activity in all areas.
</P>
<P>
The Price Law already states that low-price dumping activities
are illegal. This new regulation further differentiated between
dumping and reasonable price cuts.
</P>
<P>
The country's overall price indexes have been declining for
more than 20 months now, a result of sluggish demand. That's why
the SDPC is taking these measures to straighten out price
violations, the official concluded.

<HEADLINE> Two Turkish Soldiers' Release Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Wednesday that he hoped the two Turkish soldiers
held by Iran would be freed within "the next several days."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remark when asked to comment on repeated
Turkish requests for the release of the two soldiers, reportedly
captured on July 22 when Turkish forces tried to cross into Iran's
West Azarbaijian province, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Their speedy release will be "a sign of Iran's good offices,"
Kharrazi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This appeared to be the result of talks between Kharrazi and
his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem on the sidelines of the recent
Balkan summit in Sarajevo, during which the two sides reportedly
reached certain understanding in solving their rows.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that during the talks, Cem told him that the two
soldiers had violated the Iranian border unintentionally and
called for the release of them.
</P>
<P>
Cem reaffirmed that his country had no ill-intention against
Iran, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish soldiers' arrests came five days after a border
incident between the two countries, in which four Turkish
warplanes bombed an Iranian border post and several villages,
killing five people and injuring 10 others.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkish troops were trying to crack down
on separatist Kurdish rebels seeking shelter in Iran. Upon
Tehran's demand, Turkey has sent an experts delegation to the
border area to investigate the air raids and compile a report.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds with each other on
many issues; but this time neither of them seems to want the
border incidents to poison their overall relationship.
</P>
<P>
Both have stressed the need for "common understanding" to
strengthen bilateral relations in all fields despite the incidents.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the humanitarian aspect of the issue and
in view of the assurances given by the Turkish foreign minister
and other officials that the violation of the border was not
deliberate, the Islamic Republic of Iran is positively considering
the issue (of releasing the soldiers)," Kharrazi said.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on Ancient Chinese Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 263 Chinese and overseas
scholars and specialists today gathered in Jinan, capital of east
China's Shandong Province, to discuss the Book of Songs, one of
China's renowned five ancient classics.
</P>
<P>
The Book of Songs, China's earliest collection of poetry,
contains 305 verses on the politics, economy, war, religion, and
folkways of the Western Zhou Dynasty (11th century B.C.-771 B.C.)
and is of high historical and literary value.
</P>
<P>
Confucius (551 B.C.- 479 B.C.) is reputed to have worked on the
Book of Songs, and introduced it as a compulsory course for his
students; it has been part of Chinese higher education since the
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The Book of Songs has always been a topic for research in China,
and it was spread to overseas as early as 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one specialists from Japan, the United States, the
Republic of Korea, and Singapore attended today's symposium, the
fourth of its kind.
</P>
<P>
The previous three were held in Shijiazhuang and Beidaihe, both
in north China's Hebei Province, and in Guilin, a scenic city in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The five classics are the Book of Songs, the Book of History,
the Book of Changes, the Book of Rites, and the Spring and Autumn
Annals.

<HEADLINE> Smog Getting Thicker in Riau, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Smog in Pekanbaru, provincial
capital of Indonesia's Riau, has become thicker Wednesday, causing
visibility in the city to drop to only 100 to 200 meters, reported
the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The condition has forced the local people to wear masks and
motorists to turn on their lights while driving.
</P>
<P>
Most of the locals however preferred to stay at home, leaving
the streets deserted.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted some people as saying that what has been
happening is similar to what had happened in 1997 when forest
fires raged in many parts of the islands of Sumatera and
Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Ismanu, an official of the local communication office, said his
office has declared an emergency for land, sea and air
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The head of the local forestry and plantations office said the
smog has disrupted trips in the Malacca Strait.
</P>
<P>
The smog is dangerous to people's health, said Ekmal Rusdi,
head of the local health office.

<HEADLINE> Expert Predicts Positive Export Growth Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's exports are likely to see
a positive growth of more than 5 percent next year, today's China
Economic Times quoted an official with the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The overall impact of the global economic situation on China's
exports will be positive next year," according to Song Qun of SDPC
's institute of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Song added that China's export volume will experience a greater
increase in the latter half of this year, when measures such as
increased tax rebates and the intensified crackdown on smuggling
take effect.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that the export volume is likely to register an
annual decrease of less than 2 percent this year, and that trade
surplus will be around 15-20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's export volume hit 83.01 billion U.S. dollars in the
first half of this year, down 4.6 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Song pointed out, unfavorable factors still exist,
such as the enhanced trade protectionism of some Western countries.
</P>
<P>
He said optimistic prospect for larger exports to southeast
Asian countries was undermined by concerns that the rapid
appreciation of their currencies could negatively affect their
exports and decelerate the revitalization of their economies.
</P>
<P>
To offset these negative factors, Song suggests that China
further increase export tax rebates and credit, enhance efforts to
stem smuggling, and increase the number of private enterprises
allowed to engage in import and export commerce.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to transform the export structure by
increasing the proportion of value-added products in labor-
intensive industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Song also predicts that China's imports will maintain upbeat
growth next year, due to required lifting of restrictions as a
condition for entry into the World Trade Organization. He
estimates that import growth will be some 10 percent higher than
this year's figure.
</P>
<P>
China's import volume hit 75.01 billion U.S. dollars in the
first half, up 16.6 percent over the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Petroleum Products Drops in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Demand for petroleum products has
fallen this year in Zambia because of slow economic activities,
the weekly Financial Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The low demand has affected crude oil imports and sales on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the money spent on crude oil imports has
decreased to 23.3 million U.S. dollars in the first five months
this year compared to 37.3 million dollars during the same period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of the imported crude oil decreased to 182,488
tons in the first five months this year compared to 242,505 tons
during the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Zambia Association of Manufacturers as
complaining that the delay in selling Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) has caused a crisis on the Copperbelt in the
manufacturing sector because ZCCM owes billions of kwacha to the
companies supplying ZCCM and many of the suppliers are facing
threat of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
From January to November of 1998 Zambia imported over 500,000
tons of crude oil compared with 380,000 tons during the same
months of 1997.

MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams found three more dead
bodies Wednesday morning in the debris of houses destroyed Tuesday
night by a landslide in the central Philippines, the Philippine
News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This brought to six the number of deaths in the tragic disaster
which struck a six-hectare subdivision in Antipolo city in Rizal
province. Earlier, three boys were confirmed dead on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The collapsed Cherry Hill subdivision had about 400 concrete
houses, more than 300 of which had been occupied, said PNA.
</P>
<P>
Antipolo Mayor Angelito Gatlabayan said about 50 houses were
destroyed by tons of earth and gravel which rumbled with
terrifying impact, destroying vehicles and houses in its path.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) feared that fifty people
might have been killed in this tragedy brought about by incessant
rain that flooded a wide area on Luzon Island.
</P>
<P>
The OCD said that it was the worst to happen since the flood
started last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Residents said as early as Tuesday morning, they observed some
cracks but it was only in the evening that the tragedy struck.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado rushed to the scene Wednesday
morning to supervise the massive search and rescue operation
performed mainly by the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Heavy equipment, ambulances and rescue workers also rushed to
the scene.
</P>
<P>
PNA said that 28 people have been retrieved from the debris and
brought to the district hospital while about 200 survivors were
evacuated to a nearby church.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are looking for a certain Hiroshi Ogawa, a Japanese
who reportedly developed the subdivision.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government said that flash floods on Luzon
Island brought about by torrential rains starting Sunday have
killed at least 32 people, submerged nearly 300 villages and
affected more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada declared Tuesday a state of
calamity in Metro Manila and the provinces of Pangasinan, Pampanga
and Rizal and ordered the release of 440 million pesos (11 million
U.S. dollars) from the calamity fund.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all government agencies to coordinate search,
rescue and relief operations to ensure the safety of residents in
the affected areas and safeguard the properties of residents who
abandoned flooded homes.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Larroza, officer-in-charge of the Philippine National
Police (PNP), warned Wednesday hoarders, profiteers and other
unscrupulous traders refrain from taking advantage of the ongoing
calamity situation.
</P>
<P>
He directed all PNP regional directors in areas threatened by
rising flood waters to closely monitor all public markets and
retail outlets to ensure that prices of basic commodities will
remain within price control levels.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some unscrupulous traders in these areas
have hiked prices of basic commodities by as much as 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological authorities predict that monsoon rains will
still prevail over the western sections of Luzon Island in the
next few days.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Organizers Pressured to Change Athletics Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Organizing Committee
for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) was under pressure from the world
athletics ruling body to change the schedule for some of the most
popular track and field events.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) told SOCOG
last week it now required a rest day between the semi-finals and
finals of events of 400 meters and longer and two days' break for
races of 3,000 meters and above.
</P>
<P>
This would not be an easy task for SOCOG for it could affect as
many as 13 events.
</P>
<P>
Sports Commission chairman John Coates said Wednesday the SOCOG
would try to adhere to the IAAF ruling if possible without
altering the dates of any finals.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing if we can accommodate some of these policy
changes which are in the interest of the athlete ... without
changing the allocation of the finals."
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee Coordination Commission
chairman Jacques Rogge assured SOCOG in April that the IOC
executive board had the final say on Games scheduling and could
over-ride federations if any conflicts occurred.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has formally approved the entire Games schedule, while
the IAAF is the only federation yet to sign off on its program.

</P>
<P>
The proposal was made in a research report made available to
Xinhua by the Blanch and Swire Asia Co., Ltd., which sponsored the
research that began early this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the China Strategy and Management Research Society,
the Environmental Evolution and Natural Disaster Laboratory under
the Ministry of Education, Beijing Teachers University, and other
organizations contributed to the report.
</P>
<P>
China suffers the most frequent flooding of any country in the
world, occurring in all regions and causing greater economic
losses than any other natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, losses caused by
floods have been increasing during this decade.
</P>
<P>
For example, China's annual losses from all natural disasters
amounted to about 50 billion yuan (about 6.03 billion U.S. dollars)
before the 1990s. But now, floods alone cause billions of dollars
in property losses every year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, losses caused by the great
floods of last year were above 160 billion yuan (about 19.31
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
For many years, China has undertaken national mobilization
whenever severe floods occur, and experts say this has resulted in
a too heavy burden on the government resources and has greatly
disturbed normal national life.
</P>
<P>
They noted that if flood insurance were allowed to play a
greater role, the risk would be shared by the government,
enterprises, families, and insurance firms so that the entire
country would be much stronger and more efficient in the face of
the floods.
</P>
<P>
Flood damage is not independently insured in today's China, but
is one of the risks insured under comprehensive property liability
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the U.S., where the premium for flood insurance is
decided by the actual risk to the insured properties, China's
insurers charge a standard premium, which is the same as that for
fire risk.
</P>
<P>
Experts said this is not only unfair for both the insurers and
those insured, but also discourages the implementation of anti-
flood measures.
</P>
<P>
China also lacks a flood reinsurance system, which has
increased the risk to insurers in cases of severe flooding,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
They propose the establishment of special flood insurance to be
run by a commercial corporation, whose form is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that the government should regard flood
insurance as a non-profit business, and therefore offer tax
benefits and other preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Seize 44 Tons of Bhang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Police have seized 44.4
tons of bhang and arrested 27 suspects of illegal drug peddling
in a countrywide anti-drug operation.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who were arrested in separate cases, included
three Nigerians, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of
the police revealed, according to Wednesday's Kenya Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Police said most of the suspects were caught while travelling
in buses from western Kenya to Kenyan capital Nairobi, where drugs
are believed to be smuggled to other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jackbam, head of the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the police,
urged bus operators to check passengers' baggages before loading
them to reduce the risk of the buses being held for illegally
transporting drugs.
</P>
<P>
Jackbam also said that his unit has launched an awareness
campaign on the danger of drug trafficking and abuse in secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that many high school students used drugs
in Kenya, posing a serous social problem.
</P>
<P>
Bhang, a kind of narcotics made from hemp, was reportedly
planted in Mount Kenya, the second highest mountain in Africa.
Kenyan police have destroyed a number of plantations there in a
bid to eradicate its production.

<HEADLINE> China Initiating More Favorable Policies for Export Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China is committing itself to a
more favorable environment for its export-oriented companies by
reducing intermediary procedures and charges as well as lifting
restrictions on their trade, according to the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhigang, vice minister of SETC, said here today at a
working conference that China has raised the overall export rebate
rate by 5.51 percent this year, which is of crucial importance for
the export promotion.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 10,000 export companies in China with an
annual export volume of 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country will further implement its foreign trade reform,
and, by removing some restrictions on and certain procedures in
the export business, ease the burdens on export-oriented companies,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government will give qualified domestic
manufacturers access to foreign engineering contracts and labor-
export businesses, and improve regulations on foreign trade such
as increasing quotas for brand-name products.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Further Exploit Tourism Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to exploit new
scenic spots and tourism activities to attract more tourists from
both at home and abroad, according to municipal tourism
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital will further develop its tourism industry
by making good use of the conferences and business and trade
activities held in the city, and expand tourism by combining with
other industries including technology, culture, education, and
agriculture to employ both traditional and more recent historic
and scenic spots, and suburban resorts.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also build a comprehensive domestic tourism market
by setting up cooperative relations with the provinces, other
cities, and nearby areas with abundant tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that more and more investors and businesses
come to the city every year for trade negotiations and product
promotion, and this provides great opportunities to enhance the
local tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Tourism from abroad will focus on Japan, Taiwan, and western
European countries, Southeast Asia and the Republic of Korea, and
explore new markets in Russia, the Middle East, India, and South
America.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.05 million tourists visited Beijing in the first half of
this year, up 11.44 percent over the same period last year. The
growth rate for the number of tourists from Asia was 24 percent,
for America, 6.3 percent, Europe, 1.7 percent, Oceania, 5 percent;
while the number of visitors from Africa fell by 5.8 percent,
compared with the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 62.5 million overseas tourists came to China in 1998, up 8.
5 percent over 1997, and the figure for domestic travelers was 659
million, 2.4 percent more than in 1997 in spite of the impact of
the Asian financial crisis and serious flooding in China.

<HEADLINE> More People Escape Poverty in South China's Hainan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province will
redouble its efforts to help more poor residents pull out of
poverty in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent provincial meeting on poverty eradication,
the island province will spend 216 million yuan (about 26 million
U.S. dollars) this year to lift 100,000 poverty-stricken rural
residents out of their current plight, and increase their per
capita annual income by 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
By next year, the number of the province's poor population will
be reduced from the current 223,000 to below 90,000, and per
capita income of local rural residents will climb to 1,000 yuan.
Hygienic tap water and electricity also will become available in
the province's remote villages, which will all be connected by
highways to central cities.
</P>
<P>
Hainan used to be a part of south China's Guangdong Province,
and became a province in its own right, and also the country's
largest special economic zone, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The island province, now with a population of six million, had
2.02 million people living under the poverty line of 300 yuan per
annum in 1987. In the past 11 years, it has spent 1.39 billion
yuan on poverty-relief work, bringing 1.79 million poor people out
of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the central government have
always given priority to solving the problem of basic needs for
the poor, whose numbers have diminished by 10 million annually, on
average, over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference on poverty-relief, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin called on the nation to step up efforts to
resolve the basic problem of food and clothing for the country's
needy in the rural areas by next year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the impoverished population in the
rural areas dropped to 42 million from 250 million in 1978,
accounting for 4.6 percent of the total rural population, compared
with 30.7 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, China has inflated its poverty datum to 500
yuan per annum.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Piano Manufacturer Competing On World Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Many people think that China
will become a global piano producer in five years and the world's
second largest piano company, the Zhujiang Piano Group in south
China's Guangdong Province may make this come true.
</P>
<P>
It was the second slot in piano sales last year, with its
modern computer-aided-design technology and advanced production
line and its capacity to produce 120,000 pianos annually. It has
50 percent of the domestic market and accounts for 40 percent of
China's piano exports. It sold 30,000 pianos in the first six
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the United States in February of this year,
Tong Zhicheng, chairman of the board of the group, found himself
surrounded by foreign sales reps and dealers who came to take a
look at their exhibit. But things were not so rosy just a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The piano has a 300-year history in the West, but Zhujiang,
which is considered an old company in China, only started business
in the 1950s, producing a mere dozen pianofortes a year. The
industry grew after the country's opening up and reforms and the
instrument became one of the primary choices of young music lovers.
By 1987, Zhujiang's output had just topped 10,000 units.
</P>
<P>
It expects to spend 500 million yuan on technology to improve
product quality to compete with the West and has invited prominent
piano specialists for consultation.
</P>
<P>
The company's eight new models presented last year brought in
65,000 orders at a presentation show.

<HEADLINE> Howard Reluctant to Change Republican Referendum Wording </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Wednesday appeared reluctant to change the republican
referendum question after a recommendation that the wording will
include a reference to replacing the Queen with an Australian head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Howard said in an interview that the government would examine
the recommendation when it is tabled in federal parliament Monday
and would then make up its mind.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation by a cross-party committee of MPs is at odds
with Howard's preference for current wording which focuses on the
selection of a president by a two-thirds majority of parliament,
and makes no mention of the Queen.
</P>
<P>
The new question proposes that "the Commonwealth of Australia
become a republic with the Queen and Governor-General to be
replaced by an Australian president."
</P>
<P>
Howard said the wording of the question should truthfully
reflect what was being put to the Australian people.
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't contain words that, in a sense, prejudge the
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question itself should not be a vehicle for advancing one
or other side of the proposition," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Biggest Trade Partner Of Northern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China's Shaanxi
Province and the United States was worth 118 million U.S. dollars
in the first half of this year, an increase of 31.9 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
It accounted for over 13 percent of Shaanxi's total foreign
trade for the period, making the United States the province's
biggest trade partner, according to the Xi'an Customs office.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi increased its imports from the United States by a big
margin during the period. It imported 44.66 million dollars worth
of equipment and electronic devices from the U.S., up 80 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
But, exports to the States dropped because of a significant
drop in Hong Kong's transit trade and provincial exports overall.
Shaanxi exports mainly textiles, medicines, glassware, machinery,
and garments to the States.
</P>
<P>
Its processing trade was worth 19.81 million dollars, down 27.8
percent, while general trade stood at 92.54 million dollars, up 61.
5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Official Defends Anti-Corruption Organ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Inspector General Jotham
 Tumwesigye has defended the performance of the Inspectorate
against allegations that it has failed to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
The recent description of the organ as a dog which barks but
cannot bite was totally groundless, the official was quoted by
Wednesday's New Vision paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 50 newly-recruited officers of the Inspectorate
here Tuesday, the official said his organ had been performing well
in spite of constraints and numerous cases that come in every day.
</P>
<P>
Some government officials recently lashed out at the
anti-corruption organ for failure to address people's complaints
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Justice Julia Ssebutinde, who heads a commission of inquiry
into corruption into the police force, said that no police or
anti-corruption officers were found when the ordinary people were
suffering under the ruthless and indisciplined policemen.
</P>
<P>
She described this as a "sad and laughable" thing. Of date,
there has been an increasingly loud outcry for more efforts
against corrupt officials and asking the government to "put the
house in order."

<HEADLINE> Courier, Lareau Win Second Round in Canadian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- American Jim Courier eliminated
fourth-seeded Tim Henman of Britain 6-1, 6-7 (3-7), 6-4 in the
second round of the Canadian Open men's tennis tournament in
Montreal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In another upset, Canadian Sebastien Lareau defeated fifth-
seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Henman edged Courier in five sets at Wimbledon this year after
Courier ousted the Briton in five sets in Birmingham, England.
This is Courier's third win in four career matches against Henman.
</P>
<P>
Henman is ranked fifth in the world while Courier, a four-time
Grand Slam winner who has slipped in the rankings, is No. 46.
</P>
<P>
Courier, punishing Henman from the baseline, had little trouble
in the first set. But Henman slowly gained momentum on his serve
and forced a second set tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked British player won the last four points to win 7-
3.
</P>
<P>
The two players were then on serve in the final set until
Courier broke Henman in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
Henman has lost both his matches since making it to the semi-
finals at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Lareau, 26, ranked 116th in the world, played a solid first set,
losing on only one service break. In the second set, the players
were on serve when the match was halted briefly by rain. Lareau
came back to win the set in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, Lareau saved two break points in the fourth
game and three more in the eighth before breaking the Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
It was Lareau's third win over a top 10 player, after beating
Michael Stich in 1994 and Alex Corretja last year.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, 13th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was
knocked out by Zimbabwean Byron Black 6-4, 6-4 in first-round
action.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ferreira of South Africa entered the second round with a
three-set win over Mark Woodforde. American Vincent Spadea beat
Dutch lefty Jan Siemerink 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the third round.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Province Expects To Maintain Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, which has
been in the forefront of China's reforms and opening up, expects
to maintain its economic growth momentum in the later half of the
year, according to Huang Weihong, the director of the Provincial
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Huang told the 11th meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress yesterday that the
province will have a GDP growth rate of well over 9 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said the province had economic growth of 9.6 percent and a
GDP of 367.58 billion yuan from January to June and put 104.5
billion yuan into fixed assets during that period.
</P>
<P>
To reach this year's economic goals, the province will focus on
markets and increase domestic demand, urban and rural incomes, and
promote state-owned enterprise reforms, and improve the economic
order this year, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that exports of state-owned foreign trade companies
and overseas-financed businesses will be stable and that there
will be more support for private export companies and companies
starting new processing businesses abroad.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill, One of Worst in Sydney Harbor History: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The latest oil spill in Sydney
Harbor was one of the worst in the harbor's history and an
international embarrassment, Australia's Total Environment Center
(TEC) Chief Executive Jeff Angel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred as the tanker Laura D'Amato unloaded its
cargo of light crude oil at Shell's Gore Bay terminal Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
"I've been down and examined the site this morning and there is
thick, black crude oil washing up on Berry Island Reserve, so it
is not evaporating, it is in fact recontaminating the site," Angel
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty embarrassing that the Olympic city can't in fact
boast that it has a clean and green harbor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The TEC would urge the government to examine a relocation plan
to get the Shell facility out of the harbor, he said.
</P>
<P>
The facility should be closer to emergency materials to lessen
the risk of another disastrous leak, he said.
</P>
<P>
Angel said that two coves in the immediate vicinity of the
harbor had been affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
Gore Cove and Balls Head Bay were affected by crude oil lapping
back with the high tide, contaminating shell fish, crustaceans and
worms, he added.

MEXICO CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States overcame a
shorthanded deficit to edge Saudi Arabia 2-0 on Tuesday and
clinched the third place in the FIFA Confederations Cup soccer
tournament.

The victory capped a strong performance in the Cup by the U.S.

Paul Bravo opened the scoring for the United States in the 27th

</P>

The United States were reduced to ten men in the second half

Saudi Arabia's Abdullah Bin Shehan knocked a pass into the U.S.
goal with his arm at the 23 minute mark, and officials quickly

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese Encouraged To Help Protect Cultural Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua)-- The State Administration of
Cultural Heritage has new regulations that encourage overseas
Chinese to help with cultural relics protection.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are intended to protect the rights of overseas
donors and to ensure that their donations benefit China's cultural
relics protection, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese, international organizations, and funds that
help Chinese cultural relics protection can decide how their
donation is used, and to prevent interference with the donation.
</P>
<P>
People overseas have contributed a great deal in the first half
of the year and have helped finance the protection of the Mogao
Grottoes of Dunhuang and the 1,000-year-old Buddhist stone tablets
at Yunju Temple in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They have also helped rescue cultural relics that were smuggled
to foreign countries. Eighteen portraits of Buddhist saints from
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and a gilded bronze statue of Buddha
from Dali, a kingdom of ancient China were bought back thanks to
overseas Chinese donations, this year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Terminates Poorly-Performed Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday
terminated two special funds and reduced the allocation for
another due to their poor performance.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Adjustment Fund (IAF) and Special Scheme for Low
and Medium Cost Houses (SLMCH) were terminated with effect from
Wednesday, Bank Negara (state bank) announced.
</P>
<P>
The total allocation under the Rehabilitation Fund for Small
and Medium Industries (RFSMI) was reduced from 750 million ringgit
(197.368 million U.S. dollars) to 500 million ringgit (131.578
million U.S. dollars) also effective Wednesday, the central bank
said.
</P>
<P>
As of July 17, 1999, the IAF, which was launched in February
1991 with an allocation of 200 million ringgit (52.631 million
U.S. dollars), only saw 95 million ringgit (25 million U.S.
dollars) being disbursed while the SLMCH, which was launched in
May 1998 with an allocation of 1.0 billion ringgit (263.157
million U.S. dollars), saw only 168 million ringgit (44.21 million
U.S. dollars) being disbursed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The RFSMI, which was established in November last year with 750
million ringgit (197.368 million U.S. dollar) allocation, only saw
63 million ringgit (16.578 million U.S. dollars) being disbursed
as of July 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that to ensure an effective utilization
of the government's financial resources, the unutilized portion
from the IAF and the SLMCH as well as the 250 million ringgit
(65.789 million U.S. dollars) from the RFSMI will however be
rechanneled to the Fund For Small and Medium Industries (FSMI)
which has a higher utilization rate.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- An Argentine official on
Tuesday accused the World Trade Organization (WTO) of ignoring
agricultural subsidies made by the United States and other
European governments.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Larreche, president of the National Institute of
Agricultural Technology, said he was going to prepare a complete
report on this issue to state the position of the Argentine
government in time for the WTO "Millennium Round" summit that
opens in the U.S. this November.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO questions our statistical rates applied to the export
of some products, while the U.S. subsidizes soybean by 40 U.S.
dollars per ton. However, this organization (WTO) says nothing,"
Larreche said.
</P>
<P>
"And not to mention the European Union, which dedicates 350
billion dollars annually to subsidize agricultural products," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the WTO, "they are very strict on some things, but not so
strict on others," he complained.
</P>
<P>
If the internal problems faced by rural producers of Argentina
are added to the "dirty tricks practiced by each country to
subsidize agricultural products, the situation would become
unbearable," Larreche said.
</P>
<P>
Warning that subsidies endanger the agriculture competitiveness
of South American countries, he said Argentina strongly calls for
a end to such practice.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 3 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter
revealed Tuesday his optimism that an Asian boycott of the 2002
World Cup could be avoided and the family of FIFA will be united.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, in Mexico for FIFA's Confederations' Cup, confirmed
that he had met Asian Football Confederation(AFC) secretary
general Peter Velappan here to discuss the issue, saying he was "
very confident that the family of FIFA will be united" before the
draw for the qualifying tournament in Tokyo on December 7.
</P>
<P>
Velappan said after the Blatter's news conference that AFC had
not given up its demand for an extra berth after Asia was just
allotted four spots, including two for the co-hosts Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is likely to reach an "amicable" solution to the
row.
</P>
<P>
"We are progressing with a lot of determination," Velappan said.
"Given the good will between all the parties we are very
optimistic."
</P>
<P>
The AFC has threatened to boycott the 2002 premier soccer event
if FIFA does not meet its demand and the entire delegation of AFC
walked out of a July FIFA congress in Los Angeles over the issue.
</P>
<P>
AFC has said it would decide in October whether to go ahead
with their boycott of the championship which is for the first time
to be staged in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Insects Threatening Chinese Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A large number of insects have
damaged about 99.6 million mu (100 mu is 6.7 hectares) of forests
in China in the first half of this year, or 10 million mu more
than for the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is also 214 times the amount of forested area affected by
fires, according to Li Yuchai, the deputy director of the State
Forestry Administration. He says that this is 5 billion yuan (6.2
billion U.S. dollars) worth of damage every year. Not only forest
belts in 26 provinces and autonomous regions are destroyed but
also afforested areas of major cities, Li says.
</P>
<P>
The insects include the pine moth, weevils, and beetles, many
of which come in from foreign countries, and some newly planted
trees are especially vulnerable to them. There is also an
increasing number of tree seeds affected by disease.
</P>
<P>
Li has asked China to pay more attention to this and to
establish a monitoring system. China has 134 million hectares of
forest, but there are only 8.6 hectares for each Chinese on
average, compared to 71.8 hectares per capita on average in the
world.

<HEADLINE> E.Timor's Ballot Registration Period Extended to Aug. 6 </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has agreed on the recommendation from the U.N. Mission
in East Timor (UNAMET) to extend the autonomy ballot registration
period to enable eligible voters to come to registration centers.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET Chief Ian Martin told reporters in Dili, capital of East
Timor, Wednesday that the ballot registration period will extend
from August 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
The registration period in 14 remote areas will be open until
Sunday (August 8), Martin was quoted by the Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, more than 393,000 East Timorese inside and
outside the territory had registered for the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The registration will be followed by an appraisal, the
campaigns, two-day cooling off, and the direct ballot on August
30. An estimated 400,000 East Timorese are expected to go to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is organizing a direct ballot in East Timor to enable
the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging autonomy
offered by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the U.N.

ALMA ATA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan issued a statement
Tuesday calling on the conflicting parties in Afghanistan to end
military actions and resume peace talks, according to Interfax
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the latest rekindling of large scale
fighting in Afghanistan had fueled the tension in the country,
gravely hurt peacemaking efforts of the international community
and violated the Tashkent Declaration reached last week in the Six
Plus Two meeting.
</P>
<P>
The resort to force could not resolve the Afghanistan issue,
the statement said. It urged both sides to end military actions
and to return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks were held on July 19, in Tashkent, the Uzbek
capital, involving the governing Taliban, an opposition alliance,
the U.N. special envoy for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, and the
Six Plus Two group countries, which includes Afghanistan's six
neighbors -- China, Pakistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and
Tajikistan -- as well as the United States and Russia.

The participants signed a declaration, appealing to both Afghan
sides to end the war and realize national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Another Doping Incident Shadows Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Drugs took the place of
sports at the center stage of the 13th Pan Am Games here today as
another titlist tested positive and had her gold medal stripped of.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel has been
confirmed to fail a drug test after her sample B test also
returned positive.
</P>
<P>
This marked the second doping incident overshadowing the 13th
Pan American Games following the Canadian men's roller hockey
goalie Steve Vezina failed a drug test two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The PASO Executive Committee decided to reward the women's high
jump gold medal to Solange Witteveen of Argentina, the silver
medal to Luciane Dambacher of Brazil and the bronze medal to
Nicole Forrester of Canada.
</P>
<P>
In another decision of the Executive Committee, Ray Martinez,
member of the Mexican baseball team, was taken out of competition
after he refused to receive a drug test following his team's third-
place playoff loss to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Arrendel, only aged at 21, took Estonozolol, an anabolic
steroid which was called "Ben substance" because the disgraced
Canadian sprinter used it, to post a personal best jump of 1.93
meters to grab the country's sole gold medal since the beginning
of the Games.
</P>
<P>
In today's Pan Am Games, Canada's medal torrent in the swimming
pool continued here today as the home favourites repeated
yesterday's hat-trick performances with three more gold (men's
400m medley, women's 200m freestyle and women's 200m breaststroke)
to their credit.
</P>
<P>
F. Sanchez of Venezuela picked up his country's fourth title
during the Games by setting a meet record to win the men's 100m
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
The American men's 4X200m freestyle quartet event saved the day
for the traditional powerhouse, winning their second swimming gold
after ten events had been decided.
</P>
<P>
In total, Cuba had a harvest Tuesday which saw them land four
golds, three silvers and one bronze, the hosts Canada following
closely with a 4-2-3 record.
</P>
<P>
But the United States still topped the medals tally with a
total of 199 medals, 76 of them golds.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifying Construction Work On Large Energy Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's first major energy
project to join coal mines, a railway, a power station, and a port
is two-thirds of the way through and is expected to be completed
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The main work of the Shenhua Project is developing the Shenfu
Dongsheng Coalfield in the northern part of Shaanxi Province and
the southern part of Inner Mongolia, the Baotou-Huanghua Railway,
and Huanghua Port, according to an official in charge.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 90-billion yuan project is important for
energy development in central and western China and for ensuring
energy supplies in the eastern and southern parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The Shenfu Dongsheng Coalfield now has an annual production
capacity of 16.8 million tons and the 172-km Baotou-Shenmu Railway
and the 269-km Shenmu-Shuozhou Railway have already been completed.
The Shuozhou-Huanghua Railway is expected to link up with the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway by 2000 and to go on to Huanghua Port by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Work at Huanghua Port is also going smoothly and some 846
million yuan has been spent on its first phase, which involves
nearly 10 million cu.m. of earth and stone. By 2002, the port will
have four 35,000-ton deep-water berths that can handle 30 million
tons of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the project's annual coal production and shipping
capacity will be 50 million tons, the official says.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Raise Oil Price Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
announced on Tuesday that it will raise the country's oil prices
for the fifth time this year to keep in line with the
international crude prices and the current dollar prices.
</P>
<P>
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has insisted that the rise
should not exceed 10 percent despite the prediction of some
specialists that the price hike would be around 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Parente, Minister of Civil Affairs of the Presidency,
told a press conference that the rise will come "in the next few
days", but he specified that the price of diesel fuel will remain
unchanged as the other petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel fuel is not to be affected because of an
agreement reached last week to bring an end to the truck drivers'
strike, which practically paralyzed the country for two days.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will have to adjust its oil prices due to a recent
agreement forged with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under
which it will import at least half its domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had lifted its domestic petroleum prices by a total of
47 percent in February, March, April and June, and the figure will
jump to 56 percent with the latest rise.
</P>
<P>
The South American oil consumer imported crude at 9.42 U.S.
dollars a barrel till the end of last year, but this week it has
had to pay almost 20 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Fiscal Income Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's fiscal income
fell to 4.07 billion U.S. dollars in July, down 7.2 percent from
the same month last year, the Economic Ministry declared Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to official analyses, the drop is due to the economic
recession caused by the devaluation of Brazil's currency at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months of this year, there was also a drop
of 5.1 percent in fiscal income compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the drop in July's fiscal income was due to
the loss in the collection of the Value Added Tax (VAT), which
fell by 18.5 percent against the same month last year.

<HEADLINE> 3 Filipinos Killed, Many Buried in Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Three children were killed, more
than 25 people were injured and about 100 still missing and feared
buried alive under the debris of their houses in a disastrous
landslide at a mountain side housing area in the northern
Philippines Tuesday night, according to a report of the Philippine
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The report said that tons of earth and gravel rampaged down
into the six-hectare Cherry Hill Subdivision in Antipolo City in
Rizal province shortly after 7 p.m. at the height of a heavy
downpour.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Antipolo City Mayor Angelito Gatlabayan
as saying that more than 50 out of about 400 houses in the
subdivision were destroyed by the landslide.
</P>
<P>
Rainwater accumulated at the top of the mountain flowed down
into the subdivision, apparently softening the ground that held
the foundation of the houses, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Heavy equipment, ambulances and rescue workers have rushed to
the scene. As of 3 a.m. Wednesday, 25 people had been retrieved
from the debris and brought to the district hospital while about
200 survivors were evacuated to a nearby church.
</P>
<P>
Flash floods brought about by torrential rains starting Sunday
hit Metro Manila and nearby provinces, killing at least 28 people,
submerging nearly 270 villages and affecting more than 200,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada declared Tuesday a state of
calamity in Metro Manila and the provinces of Pangasinan, Pampanga
and Rizal and ordered the release of 440 million pesos (11 million
U.S. dollars) from the calamity fund.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all government agencies to coordinate search,
rescue and relief operations to ensure the safety of the residents
in the affected areas and safeguard the properties of the
residents who abandoned their homes.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Produces Over 3 Mln Barrels of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 3.378 million
barrels of crude oil in the fiscal year 1998-99 which ended in
March, a reduction of 252,000 barrels as compared with the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, the output of natural gas was
1.724 billion cubic-meters in 1998-99, a drop of 74 million
cubic-meters as compared with the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of April this year, foreign investment in the oil
and gas sector coming from Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia,
Japan, Thailand and the United States had reached 2.3 billion U.S.
dollars in 46 projects, accounting for 32.39 percent of the 7.108
billion dollars' total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Myanmar's crude oil and natural gas production is
still self-insufficient and the country has to import 280,000 to
300,000 tons of crude oil and 100,000 to 150,000 tons of diesel
oil annually, the official statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 300,000 Tourists Visit Myanmar in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 292,282 foreign
tourists visited Myanmar in the fiscal year 1998-99 which ended in
March, of whom 172,007 came by land routes through border points.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, the number of tourists who
visited Myanmar in the fiscal year increased by 27,160 as compared
with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Despite some rise in the number of tourists, Myanmar's tourism
business climate is still unfavorable as partly impacted by the
Asian financial crisis. Hotels occupancy rate is low with most of
the rooms left vacant.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, there were 523 hotels with 14,714 rooms in
Myanmar, while there were only 39 hotels with 1,240 rooms 10 years
ago in 1988, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted the open-door economic policy in 1988,
foreign investment in the sector of hotels and tourism has reached
1.1 billion U.S. dollars in 30 projects.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of its tourism industry, Myanmar has
signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation with other
member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
The country targets to boost the number of tourist arrivals to
500,000 in the current fiscal year of 1999-2000.

Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 People's Daily
</P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> Salary Increase to Spur Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Sharp increases in salaries of
civil servants will help spur domestic consumption, according to a
top financial researcher in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jia Kang, deputy director of Financial Research Institution
under the Ministry of Finance, was quoted by today's China Daily
as saying that the increase will stimulate domestic demand for
consumption in the short term, and perfect the income distribution
system in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Jia also warned the public against unrealistically high
expectations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government is considering increasing
salaries of civil servants by some 40 percent, the biggest
increase in history.
</P>
<P>
There are about 10.9 million civil servants in China. If their
monthly wages are increased by an average 120 yuan (about 14.4 U.S.
dollars), the total increase will be an astonishing 16 billion
yuan (about 1.9 billion U.S. dolalrs), the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to judge how much of the increased income will
go into the market even though the country has lowered bank
deposit rates again and again, and some of the restrictive
policies hindering consumption have been cleared," Jia added.

<HEADLINE> Three Events Named as Backbone in SEA Games Medal Tally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's chef de mission for
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games Mochammad Hindarto named
three events as the backbone in the country's efforts to earn as
many gold medals as possible, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto named taekwondo, pencak silat and karate as the sports
which had the biggest possibilities to contribute golds for the
contingent, which aims to retain the overall title by winning 70
gold medals.
</P>
<P>
In the SEA Games here two years ago, taekwondo contributed six
golds, karate 14 golds and pencak silat 15 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia and Thailand will fight really hard to retain the
overall title. The medal tally difference will not be really great.
Based on reports from our embassy in Bangkok, Thailand plans to
earn 67 of 235 gold medals on offer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 67 medals will likely come from swimming (15), boxing (7),
track and field (16), and karate with an estimated seven golds.
</P>
<P>
"If our track and field athletes manage to contest with the
Thais, I believe we can beat them," Hindarto said during the
farewell ceremony on Tuesday to pray for athletes' success in the
biennial event from August 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto also named Malaysia as another threat.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysian athletes competed in last year's Commonwealth Games
and they aim to finish second in the 2001 Games in Kuala Lumpur,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
SEA Games training director Imron ZS said that 452 athletes and
officials would leave on Wednesday on two flights using national
carrier Garuda Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Canada Keeps Momentum in Pan Am Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada's medal torrent
in the Pan Am Pool continued here today as the home favourites
repeated yesterday's hat trick performances with three more golds
to their credit.
</P>
<P>
F. Sanchez of Venezuela picked up his country's fourth title
during the Games by setting a meet record to win the men's 100m
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
The American men's 4X200m freestyle quartet event saved the day
for the traditional powerhouse, winning their second swimming gold
after ten events had been decided.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Curtis Allen Myden rewrote men's 400m medley Pan Am
record as he swept to victory in four minutes 15.52 seconds,
ripping more than three seconds off the previous old mark of 4:18.
55.
</P>
<P>
American Eric Donnelly finished a well-beaten second at 4:17.86,
with another Canadian Owen Von Richter third at 4:19.62.
</P>
<P>
Jessica Deglau took the women's 200m freestyle event by
clocking 2:00.65, Jamaican J.A. Atkinson placing second in 2:01.11
and American Talor Benel third in 2:03.18.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200m breastroke event, Lauren Van Oosten,
cheered by a delirious sold-out home crowd, beat off strong
American challenges to finish top.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was 2:30.36, with two Americans A.J.
Mcreynolds and Katie Yevak following closely as the second and
third respectively.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Sanchez showed his determination to attack the
record from start to finish, touching in 53.33 to shave 0.12
seconds off the old mark set by Nesty Anthony eight years ago in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
In today's last relay event in the Pan Am Pool, the United
States overtook the early pace-setters Canada on the second leg
and never looked behind afterwards, clocking 7:22.29 to win the
gold.
</P>
<P>
Brazil took the silver with a time of 7:22.92, with Canada
wrapping up the day with a bronze.

<HEADLINE> China Releases New Strain of Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China has officially released the
first Quality Protein Maize (QPM) hybrid strain - Zhongdan 9409 - ,
declaring it a significant agricultural breakthrough that will
ease the country's increasing food demand in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The yield potential of the new QPM strain reaches about 11 tons
per hectare against the present average yield of 4.96 tons, today'
s China Daily quoted agricultural scientists responsible for the
research as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It performed very well in several experimental demonstrations
in Hebei, Shaanxi, Henan and Guizhou provinces," said Zhang Shihua,
head of the research team under the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) during a news conference here hosted
by CAAS Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maize is an important crop after rice and wheat in terms of
acreage but ranks second in terms of total production and yield in
China.
</P>
<P>
Yet, statistics provided by CAAS indicate that as the need and
consumption for animal protein increase rapidly in China, it is
expected that the demand for maize, which is used to feed
livestock, will also increase.
</P>
<P>
QPM maize has been considered an excellent option for such
strategic goals since its utilization efficiency in feeding pigs
and other livestock is 30 percent better than normal maize.
</P>
<P>
China embarked on QPM research in the mid-1970s at CAAS and
nine provincial research centers. The planting area of these QPM
hybrids has been extended to 334,000 hectares in total.

<P>
The sources added that the government's industrial policy was
based on a multi-pronged strategy which features the promotion of
export-led industries, provision of a comprehensive network of

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Serbian Prime Minister Calls for Stable Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Yugoslavia's
Republic of Serbia Mirko Marjanovic said Tuesday that a stable
economy is the top priority of his government, the official Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the flood-hit Batocina in central Serbia,
Marjanovic said the government would work to stabilize prices and
currency, prevent further falls of living standards, rebuild
homeland and speed up reforms in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Yugoslavia has managed to maintain in general the
stability of the country's economy and market, despite serious
damages by NATO's air strikes and ongoing pressure from various
aspects.
</P>
<P>
"We are not able to restore in a short time all economic
facilities destroyed in NATO bombings but we can and must do that
in order to ensure the normal functioning of our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian prime minister said some people are keeping up
pressure on Yugoslavia in an attempt to sabotage efforts to
stabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the Yugoslav and Serbian governments are determined to
march forward along the best road for the people.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the deterioration of the living standards caused by
war must be halted, he said, so the stabilization of prices and
currency is the starting point to map out the country's economic
policy.

SHENYANG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A slightly sloping hill in the
suburbs of Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, that can
cause a vehicle to move up it without using the engine has
attracted three million visitors from all over the world in the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 80-meter incline of less than 10 degrees will cause a car
to continue up to the top even if the driver stops the car midway.
It used to be a section of highway, but in 1989, a driver who
happened to stop for a rest there discovered that his truck just
continued on.
</P>
<P>
Some people say that the strange phenomenon is the result of
gravitational or other magnetic force in the area and others
believe that it is just an illusion.
</P>
<P>
But, while the debates continue, local officials and villagers
have put 40 million yuan (8 million U.S. dollars ) into the area
to attract tourists and hope to spend another 30 million yuan on
hotels and entertainment facilities in the next few years.

<HEADLINE> French Striker Henry Joins Arsenal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal have announced the signing of their second new
striker within the space of 24 hours as they signed Thierry Henry
from Juventus for a reported 11 million pounds on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Henry arrived at Highbury fresh on the heels of Davor Suker,
who joined the Gunners from Real Madrid, to bolster their strike
force following the departure of Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
Henry, a French international who can also play on the wing,
played for Arsene Wenger at Monaco and has joined the club on what
Arsenal call a "long-term contract".
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old striker, who was France's leading scorer at
last year's World Cup with three goals in their run to the trophy,
also scored seven times in the Champions League two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
Wenger said: "Thierry Henry is a valuable addition to our squad.
</P>
<P>
"He is a young international striker who will be a great asset
to Arsenal Football Club. He has good experience of both club and
international football and will considerably strengthen our
firepower," he added.

LONDON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Wales snubbed Terry Venables and
gave Mark Hughes the chance to prove he is worthy of a long-term
contract to manage his country on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association of Wales, at a special full council
meeting in Cardiff, decided to turn their back on number one
choice Venables because of his pay demands and his insistence on a
12-month get-out clause.
</P>
<P>
Venables wanted a three-year contract to be reviewed after the
first year, 200,000 pounds a year wages plus two assistants which
would have pushed the total bill to more than 400,000 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Graf in Action at TIG Tennis Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Two players who engaged in a
dramatic three-set women's final at the French Open before taking
completely different paths at Wimbledon play their second-round
matches today at the $520,000 TIG Tennis Classic in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland will play her first
match since her shocking defeat in the first round of Wimbledon
when she faced American Chanda Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Steffi Graf of Germany, who beat Hingis at Roland
Garros before losing to American Lindsay Davenport in the
Wimbledon final, takes on American Amy Frazier tonight.
</P>
<P>
Hingis' surprising 6-2, 6-0 loss to Australian teenager Jelena
Dokic -- her worst Grand Slam result in five years -- came on the
heels of her setback in the emotionally charged French Open final
with Graf.
</P>
<P>
Hingis was booed off the court in Paris after the 18-year-old
repeatedly challenged calls and even walked over to Graf's side of
the court.
</P>
<P>
After her loss in London, Hingis took several weeks away from
the game to sort out her personal and professional life, even
taking a break from her coach and mother, Melanie Molitor. Hingis'
mother is back with her this week.
</P>
<P>
Hingis has won four titles this season, including the
Australian Open, and was the winner here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rubin handed Hingis one of her seven defeats this season in the
quarterfinals at the Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California five
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Graf also is competing in her first event since her loss to
Davenport in London, in what turned out to be the German's last
appearance at the All-England Club.
</P>
<P>
The German star, who has indicated she will retire at the end
of the season, has won 13 of her last 14 matches and brings a 16-5
record on hardcourts into this event. She is a four-time champion
at this event, winning in 1989-1990 and 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
In first-round action, sixth seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of
Spain faces Russia's Elena Likhovtseva, seventh seed Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa takes on American Lisa Raymond, and eighth
seed Nathalie Tauziat of France meets German qualifier Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, fifth seed Mary Pierce of France, last year's runner-
up, was upset by Japan's Ai Sugiyama, and Spain's Conchita
Martinez, the 1995 champion, lost to Australia's Barbara Schett.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the top seed, is one-third of the way toward
duplicating her California sweep of a year ago. She is 16-1 in her
last 17 matches in her home state, dated to last year, when she
swept all three summer hardcourt tournaments in California.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, Hingis, Graf and Venus Williams, fourth seed from
the United States, all received first-round byes in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> American Sprinter Mitchell Ban Upheld by IAAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Dennis Mitchell
was suspended for two years on Tuesday after the arbitration panel
of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) ruled he
was guilty of a doping offence, according to reports from Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said the 1992 Olympic 100 meters bronze medallist
would be suspended from April 1, 1998 -- the date of the original
test -- to March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
All performances achieved by Mitchell during that period were
declared void and he will miss this month's world championships in
Seville.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, 33, was tested at his Florida home and an analysis
showed abnormal levels of the banned hormone testosterone.
</P>
<P>
But an American hearing last December found Mitchell not guilty
of a doping offence and allowed him to continue competing.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, the world governing body, insisted on an arbitration
hearing for the case. The panel met at the IAAF's Monte Carlo
headquarters last month.
</P>
<P>
"The arbitrators have concluded that "the USATF's doping board
decision of December 12 and 24, 1998, was erroneous," the IAAF
said in Tuesday's statement.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was given a
hearing by an IAAF special committee over his life ban imposed by
the Canadian athletics federation, an official source said.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year old Johnson provided "new elements" to the
committee as he seeks to return to competition, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting of the committee is scheduled for August 16.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of both his Olympic gold medal and his 9.
79 world record in the 100 metres at the 1988 Games in Seoul after
he tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
Five years later, in January 1993, he failed another doping
test after an indoor 60-metres race in Montreal and was banned for
life by the Canadian federation.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in as many years that the U.S.governing
body has been overruled by the IAAF arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
Mary Slaney, the former double world champion at 1,500 and 3,
000 meters, also had an adverse testosterone test after the U.S.
Olympic trials in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The American governing body decided against a suspension but
the IAAF overruled that decision.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Haze triggered by forest fires in
Indonesia's Riau province last month began disrupting navigation
in the Malacca Strait, Chief of the Riau Office of the Forestry
and Plantation Ministry Darminto Soetono said.
</P>
<P>
"I have received a report that the haze has reduced visibility
in the Malacca Strait," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He put the blame on slash-and-burn practices for the haze.
</P>
<P>
Since forest and bush fires are rife in Riau during the dry
season, the local forest fire controlling agency has put the
province in Alert I category.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many parts of Riau province have been
covered by haze for nearly one month now and the vapors are
beginning to reduce visibility and irritating people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency in the
provincial capital of Pekanbaru Anwar said weather conditions in
Riau in general and Pekanbaru in particular have become
unfavorable because the haze is getting thicker and thicker.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the satellite, the province had 167
hot spots on July 20, 8 hot spots on July 21 and 543 hot spots on
July 22.

<P>
PARIS, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The athletics world ruling body
Tuesday began to examine the reinstatement application of
disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson who was making his last
bid to return to the field.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian runner and his advisers faced a three-man
subcommittee, led by IAAF General-Secretary Istvan Gyulai, which
will recommend to the body's council whether or not to allow
Johnson back into competition.
</P>
<P>
If the council, which meets in Seville on August 17, rules
against Johnson there will be no possibility of an appeal any more.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal and 100-meter
world record after testing positive for steroids at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics. He was given a life ban after the second positive test
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But the sprinter was thrown a life rope this year when Canadian
arbitrator Graeme Mew declared that national athletics authorities
had not made all of the runners' appeal options clear in 1993.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Can Learn From Australia: NZ Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer Bill
English has said as his country is lagging behind Australia in
economic performance, it could learn from the policies of the
Australian government.
</P>
<P>
"We have looked pretty carefully at what they (Australians)
do, and I think we can learn from things they do," the Dominion, a
Wellington-based Newspaper, Wednesday quoted the treasurer as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer, the second most important figure in the Cabinet
just after the prime minister, said the New Zealand government
would look at Australia's experience with tariffs, industry
development and corporate taxation. "Some of those we can learn
from. We're open-minded about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
But English said New Zealanders should take a longer-term view
of their economy rather than dashing across to Australia in
response to a temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistake to generalize from the current circumstances --
either when you're doing better or when you're doing worse. So I
don't go along with the fashionable view that because Australia is
moving faster than us now, New Zealanders should give up and
emigrate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Allegedly Fails Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's Javier Sotomayor,
the men's high jump world record holder, reportedly tested
positive in sample A following his gold medal-winning performance
in the 13th Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian national TV network CBC and Radio Canada reported
here today that the Cuban world and Olympic champion was the
latest doping offender, and obviously the most high-profile at the
Winnipeg Games after Steve Vezina, the Canadian men's roller hocky
goaltender, and Juana Rosario Arrendel, Dominican women high
jumper, took the banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
But when asked about the tricky question at a news conference
today, Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the Pan American Sports
Organizaion (PASO) Medical Commission, gave a discreet reply.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give the name. The case is still under study.
Sample B is in the process of being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait until the full confirmation comes out,
otherwise it will be against the PASO regulations."
</P>
<P>
He said the result of Sample B possibly comes out tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Dominican High Jumper Confirmed Positive in Sample B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Dominican high
jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped of the Pan Am gold
medal here today after her sample B test also returned positive.
</P>
<P>
This marked the second doping incident overshadowing the 13th
Pan American Games following the Canadian men's roller hockey
goalie Steve Vezina failed a drug test two days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We're very sad that the Dominican Republic athlete Juana
Rosario Arrendel made a mistake," Mario Vazquez Rana, president of
the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) said at a news
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The PASO Executive Committee decided to reward the women's high
jump gold medal to Solange Witteveen of Argentina, the silver
medal to Luciane Dambacher of Brazil and the bronze medal to
Nicole Forrester of Canada.
</P>
<P>
In another decision of the Executive Committee, Ray Martinez,
member of the Mexican baseball team, was taken out of competition
after he refused to receive a drug test following his team's third-
place playoff loss to Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We take it as a positive doping because he acted against rules,
" Rana said.
</P>
<P>
Arrendel, only aged at 21, took what was called "Ben substance"
to post a personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's
sole gold medal since the beginning of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big
mistake," Dr. Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medican
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the substance Ben Johnson has taken. It's extremely
important for us to know where she got it."
</P>
<P>
Estonozolol, which was found in Arrendel's urine sample, is an
anabolic steroid to increase power in speed, especially in the
competitions of high jump and 100-meter race.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the third athlete whose sample A tested
positive, who was reported by the Canadian TV network CBC and
Radio Canada to be Cuba's world record holder Javier Sotomayor, Dr.
Rosa's gave a discreet reply.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give the name. The case is still under study.
Sample B is in the process of being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait until the full confirmation comes out,
otherwise it will be against the PASO regulations."
</P>
<P>
Despite the doping incidents which occupied the headlines
instead of the Pan Am Games itself, Rana declared the Winnipeg
Games is "super clean".
</P>
<P>
There have been over 2000 cases dealt with since the beginning
of the Games, and only two of them turned out positive.
</P>
<P>
Rana continued to argue that there have never been a Pan Am
Games involving less than four positive cases, and it is almost at
the end of the competitions.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good result," Rana said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Disburses 150 Million Dollars to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has released
its first tranches to Russia under its restructured structural
adjustment loans, the bank announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the World Bank's approval of the restructuring of the
second Coal Sector Adjustment Loan (Coal2) and the Social
Protection Adjustment Loan on July 23, and the third Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL3), the bank disbursed 50 million U.S. dollars
under the Coal2 last Friday, and a further 100 million dollars on
Tuesday under SAL3, a bank statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two payments are the World Bank's first cash injections for
Russia since August 1998, when Moscow devalued the ruble currency
and defaulted on some domestic debt, wrecking the terms of a
rescue package agreed just weeks before.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said disbursements from the three loans may
reach 1.85 billion dollars over the next 18 months, including
about 1.1 billion dollars this year, if the government sticks to
its economic promises.
