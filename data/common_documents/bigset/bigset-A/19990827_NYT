SOSA SAYS MONDESI WILL CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As half of baseball's biggest story rolls through
town this weekend, Sammy Sosa also brings a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa does not know Raul Mondesi or his problems very well. They
grew up in the Dominican Republic, but now their careers seem
worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the success he has enjoyed the past few seasons,
including the epic home run chases with Mark McGwire, Sosa knows a
lot about frustration.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the pathetic showing of his Chicago Cubs, whose
53-69 record is even worse than the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Before his career took off with the Cubs in 1992, Sosa, 30,
spent six seasons in the Texas Rangers and Chicago White Sox
organizations, battling crushing expectations and breaking balls in
the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mondesi, who has known only success until this season,
Sosa struggled with hitting coaches and a language barrier. He felt
the glare of front offices waiting impatiently for his skills to
take over the game.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mondesi, who has been soundly booed since blasting the
Dodgers front office several weeks ago, Sosa often was angry. And
as often happens in baseball, he was painted with the broad brush
of another underachieving Latin player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were born in the same country, but we grew up in different
ways,'' Sosa said of Mondesi during an interview Tuesday in
Chicago. ``I had to make a lot of adjustments in my career. I had
to change myself, my personal ways. My reaction to things is
different now than it was a few years ago. I had to mature. I'm a
little more disciplined now. Everybody changes for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably Mondesi is not quite there yet. He's always had great
years for the Dodgers, he's always been hitting. Maybe that's one
of the reasons he hasn't made that change yet. Myself, I had to go
through a lot of tough situations. It's a lot different when you
have everything and when you have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi enters tonight's series opener against the Cubs at
Dodger Stadium with an excellent chance for his third consecutive
30-home run season. But his year was forever tarnished with the
string of obscenities he hurled at manager Davey Johnson and
general manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has apologized, Mondesi has not rescinded his trade
demand and the Dodgers will be looking this winter to find a team
that wants to take the final two years and $20.5 million of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did not know about Mondesi's tirade. He was too busy.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-10 victory against San Francisco on Thursday, Sosa hit
his 53rd homer, which gives him two more than McGwire. It was his
10th homer in the last 12 games, putting him nine games ahead of
last year's pace for 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much harder to do what he is doing this year because all
the attention is on the home runs,'' said former Cub Bill Madlock.
``When a team is in a race, it's exciting. When they're losing,
there is nothing else to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he finished four home runs behind McGwire in 1998, Sosa
enchanted a nation with boundless enthusiasm and good will. He
hugged McGwire the night last September when the St. Louis first
baseman broke Roger Maris' 37-year old record of 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire might be considered the king of swing, but Sosa is the
prince of power. Last year, his bubbly personality came out and no
babies went unkissed. When he carried the Cubs to the National
League wild card, Sosa was named the National League's Most
Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy this year after last year and everything I've been
through,'' Sosa said of all the attention. ``This is a piece of
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sosa also was beginning a four-year, $42.5 million
contract. Unlike Mondesi, who has been hurt by the criticism that
used to be aimed at Mike Piazza, Sosa embraced the challenge of
carrying a team.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last season, Sport magazine called Sosa,
``overrated.'' He remembered and it helped him overcome stereotypes
that often haunt Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, in this game, when you have success,
you could be from Mexico, the Dominican, Haiti, any country,'' Sosa
said. ``There are always going to be comments, there's always
someone who doesn't want you to have success in your career. It's
always going to be tough, there are always going to be people who
criticize you. That's the way life is. When the people criticize
me, it motivates me. That pushes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa credits many for his development, including former White
Sox teammates Ivan Calderson and Ozzie Guillen. They shared their
years of experience and perspective that he couldn't get from a
coach or manager.
</P>
<P>
   Another was Bill Chase, an American who owned a factory in the
Dominican and gave Sosa his first glove. Sosa calls Chase a father
figure and put him in charge of the Sammy Sosa Foundation, an
organization that provided more than 80,000 pounds of food and
water two years ago when the Dominican was ravaged by Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's most glaring weakness, swinging at bad pitches, has been
corrected with the help of Cubs hitting instructor Jeff Pentland.
Sosa often clashed with former White Sox batting coach Walt
Hriniak, but he clicked immediately with Pentland and the two do
drills during batting practice designed to keep Sosa's swing under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to be more of his own hitting coach and not rely on
me,'' Pentland said. ``He needs to recognize the things he needs to
improve on. I told him last year that he has a special gift to hit
the ball out of the ballpark. I said, `Whenever you get into
trouble, remember the gift you have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's early years were helped along by Latin scout Ralph
Avila, but the two have grown apart. Tom Lasorda also helped
nurture Mondesi, now 28, but the former manager blasted him after
the July 31 trade deadline for his poor play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have put Johnson, who has known him less than a
year, in charge of keeping Mondesi on track. But Mondesi, a loner
who was angered when the club did not re-sign fellow Dominican
Ramon Martinez last winter, stays pretty much to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he'll make it, he'll change,'' Sosa said. ``You have
to be professional on and off the field. You have to be around good
people who can help you, not people who will drive you the wrong
way. I don't think the people he has around him can teach him the
way that I was taught. When he finds somebody who is willing to
work with him and he's willing to listen, he will be a different
person.''

BANK UNAWARE LARGE SUMS WERE PASSING THROUGH QUESTIONABLE ACCOUNTS,
SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (TIGHTENS first 2 grafs; EDITS 4th graf to conform.) (Exclusive)

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Large sums of money were moved through accounts at the Bank of
New York for at least six months before the bank was aware of it,
according to individuals who have direct knowledge of an
investigation into Russian money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   They said Thursdaythat nine New York accounts that are part of
the inquiry became active before March 1998, much earlier than was
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   More than $4.2 billion that investigators suspect was tied to
organized crime and corporate embezzlement in Russia passed through
these accounts between early 1998 and March 1999. The bank did not
begin cooperating with a federal investigation of money laundering
at the bank until September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that money was filtered through the bank for at least
six months before any action was taken raises questions about how
well accounts and employees were supervised at the bank before the
investigation was begun and will undoubtedly concern regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Also it is not clear why the government allowed the accounts to
remain open so long after the investigation began. The accounts are
linked to Benex, a company incorporated in London, whose exact
activities are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year, British authorities who had initially
notified the FBI about the suspected money laundering operation in
June 1998 expressed concern that the probe was moving too slowly.
Federal and state bank regulators have declined to comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe as much as $10 billion may have been moved
by Russian organized crime and the country's political and business
elites through the Bank of New York in order to hide its origins.
</P>
<P>
   Some news reports have suggested that some of that money may
have been diverted from loans extended by the International
Monetary Fund to Russia in 1998 as part of a failed effort to stop
a series of bank collapses and the crash of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that Attorney
General Janet Reno was given a detailed briefing Thursday on the
scandal and that the Justice Department does not believe, at this
point, that IMF funds were involved in the suspected money
laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the amount of money involved is so great
that it almost certainly did not come only from the direct profits
of criminal activities. Other areas, beside the IMF, that
investigators are studying as potential sources for the money
include looted state assets and corporate corruption.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that the $4.2 billion
initially moved slowly through the Benex accounts, but then
increased to sometimes very heavy volumes before the bank began
cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of pages of records pertaining to Benex were obtained
through subpoenas sent to the bank, but it could not be determined
when those subpoenas were issued.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that the government
requested the accounts be left open from September, 1998, until
last week. The accounts were closed only after The New York Times
wrote about the investigation last week, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York
declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said Wednesday that no
`smoking gun' has been discovered implicating Natasha Gurfinkel
Kagalovsky, a Bank of New York executive who oversaw the bank's
Russian business and who has been suspended from her job pending
the outcome of the investigation. An investigator also said there
was no document discovered so far that directly linked Ms.
Kagalovsky to the suspected money laundering operation. But he
added that it was ``inconceivable,'' given her position, that she
was not aware of the large volumes of questionable money moving
through the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky's lawyer has declined to comment and she has not
been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank executive, Lucy Edwards, who worked in the bank's
London office has also been suspended since word of the
investigation was first published. Ms. Edwards has also not been
charged with wrongdoing and it has not been possible to reach her
or her husband, Peter Berlin, who ran Benex, the company whose
accounts are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the investigation said that the Bank of New
York claims it did not know that Ms. Edwards was married to Berlin.
They also said evidence has been found in Ms. Edwards' London home
indicating that she used the Bank of New York name for dealings
unrelated to her bank duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin, vice chairman of a large
Russian oil company called Yukos, is also being investigated in
connection with the suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Kagalovsky is a former vice chairman at Menatep, a
now insolvent Russian bank that once did business with Bank of New
York. Investigators are examining whether Menatep accounts were
laundered through the American bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky has declined repeated requests for an interview. In a
statement Wednesday, Menatep said that ``neither the institution
nor its esteemed former vice chairman can in any way reasonably be
implicated'' in charges of money laundering at the Bank of New
York.

FALLING FORTUNES PROMPT TOYS `R' US CHIEF TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a continuation of the turmoil at a company in disarray, Toys
``R'' Us Inc. said Thursday that Robert Nakasone, its chief
executive for just a year and a half, had resigned effective
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone's departure is the latest exit in a round of managerial
musical chairs at the large toy retailer, which has been struggling
with declining profits and market share as parents have fled its
giant stores to shop at discount stores and on the Internet.
Nakasone will be temporarily replaced by his predecessor, Michael
Goldstein, who is chairman and stepped down as chief executive in
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had differing views, and this decision has been made,''
Goldstein said in an interview Thursday. He would not elaborate on
what prompted the move, saying, ``He has resigned, and I do not
want to get into who shot whom or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and a toy industry executive close to Toys ``R'' Us
management said the action was prompted by the board.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which last year was overtaken as the world's
largest toy retailer by Wal-Mart, lost customers to discount chains
and online toy merchants like Etoys Inc. during the all-important
holiday selling season last year, in part because it did not have
the right product mix. As a result, the analysts said, Goldstein
and the rest of the board decided that the company required a chief
executive with a better sense of how many Furbys and Pokemons to
put on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said Nakasone declined to comment. The
company, which is based in Paramus, N.J., and operates 1,472
stores, announced his resignation after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nakasone was more of an operations guy,'' said Sean McGowan,
an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison who was briefed by Toys
``R'' Us executives after the announcement Thursday. ``The company
was not pleased with how they did last year for Christmas, and
there was some concern that if they didn't make a change now they
would begin 2000 without the right merchandise in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Though strategically timed, Nakasone's departure in some ways
could not have come at a worse point for the company. Just five
months ago, Bruce Krysiak stepped down as president and chief
operating officer only a year into the job. And earlier this month,
the company lost its backing from the venture capital firm
Benchmark Capital for its fledgling Internet unit, Toysrus.com.
Also at the time, Robert Moog, the founder of University Games, who
had been tapped to run the division, abruptly backed out of the job
and was replaced by John Barbour, a longtime industry executive.
Two months ago, Keith Van Beek, president for merchandising and
marketing, also left, with no explanation from the company.
</P>
<P>
   All of this comes as profits at Toys ``R'' Us have fallen as the
company has struggled to win back shoppers who defected to
Wal-Mart, which promises cheaper prices, and Etoys, which offers
the advantage of avoiding crowded store aisles and long check-out
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for those reasons, the company, which has been sprucing
up its tired, warehouse-like stores, reported a 25 percent drop in
second-quarter earnings earlier this month, though sales at stores
open more than a year rose 4 percent in the United States and 6
percent elsewhere around the world. The earnings shortfall was the
seventh consecutive quarterly drop for a company whose shareholders
have become fed up with its dismal performance. The stock has
dropped 5.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the declining profits and stock price, Nakasone's
strategy had been to renovate the chain's stores with wider aisles
and a more festive, shopper-friendly environment. He had also begun
to refocus the company on customer service after shoppers
complained that they needed a road map to navigate the stores and
often found workers who did not know where to find the Monopoly
games.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone also led the company's acquisition last month of
Imaginarium Toy Centers Inc., a move the company made to push it
more solidly into the educational end of the toy business. In
addition, he directed a reorganization last year in which the
company closed dozens of outdated stores, dismissed thousands of
employees and shed much of its bloated inventory to shift to a
just-in-time delivery system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldstein said that he had no plans to significantly shift the
company's focus. ``The strategic moves being made to position Toys
`R' Us for future growth, I endorse all of them,'' he said, adding
that he would work full time in his old job until a replacement
with a strong merchandising background was named, ideally by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone worked 14 years at Toys ``R'' Us and rose through the
ranks, spending four years as nt before stepping into the
top job in February 1998. He is considered to have keen knowledge
of the industry and had been the heir apparent before being tapped
to take over from Goldstein, who had been chief executive for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nakasone's abrupt departure took some in the industry by
surprise. ``I'm sort of stunned by it,'' said Chris Byrne, an
industry consultant and editor of the Toy Report, a weekly
newsletter. ``I think it means they are in turmoil and trying to
find their way. If they keep making false starts, Wal-Mart is going
to eat their lunch.''

JUDGE BALANCES COURT AND TV DUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ Louis Moore looked scared as he sat in Division 9 of
the Shelby County Criminal Court here on a recent summer morning.
Moore, a 19-year-old grill cook at McDonald's, knew he was going to
have to go before Judge Joseph Brown Jr., plead guilty for his
crime and hope that the judge would suspend his sentence and give
him probation instead of prison.
</P>
<P>
   That was nerve-racking enough. But Moore was worried further
because while this was his first offense, and his first visit to
court, he had seen Brown in action many times before, on the
year-old nationally syndicated television show ``Judge Joe Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid he is going to be hard and mean,'' Moore said,
``like he is on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's situation illustrates the things that so many people
applaud in Brown. He is admired for reaching young people with his
down-to-earth, tough-love approach to justice, which many believe
can turn around people like Moore before they fall into a life of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also highlights one of the things that others
criticize: He is the only judge on national television who is also
a sitting judge. Many critics argue that he cannot do both jobs
well.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, where Brown was a lawyer from 1974 until he became a
Criminal Court judge in 1990, those two opinions about him are
clashing furiously.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Supreme Court recently reviewed his court
attendance and denied his request to have a regular substitute fill
in while he is in Los Angeles taping his show.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Appeal newspaper has written editorials
criticizing his dual role, one of which began with this question:
``Which court matters more to Judge Joe Brown _ the one that serves
the Shelby Countians who elected him or the one created by the
television executives who hired him to entertain viewers from a
sound stage in Los Angeles?''
</P>
<P>
   Among voters here, the judge is popular, being re-elected last
year in a landslide to another eight-year term, for which he is
paid $102,240 annually. Neither the producers of the show nor the
judge would comment on his television salary.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes, including many community service events, he is
asked for his autograph. His street-smart style, exemplified by the
fact that he carries a pistol with him at all times, even wearing
it on a holster under his robe in the courtroom, makes him a highly
coveted speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he told a group of women who were former convicts that
by going to prison they had played into the hands of the rich,
white establishment. ``You are serving a great utility so that
economic prosperity for the haves and the good old boys can be
continued,'' he said. ``See, while we are acting damn fools being
black against white, which we should not be since we all ought to
work together, while we are distracted and polarized, what's really
going on is those people are ripping us off economically.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 52, who grew up in south-central Los Angeles and
graduated with honors from the UCLA Law School, has always been
controversial here. He came to national attention for his creative
use of alternative sentencing. It is a tactic he continues to use,
routinely giving writing assignments or making defendants read
``The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' as part of their sentences. And
most notably, he has let burglary victims take something from
thieves' houses to illustrate to them how it feels to be robbed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also gained national attention when he presided over
James Earl Ray's unsuccessful final efforts, before he died last
year, to win a trial in the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. The King family allied with Ray, who
confessed to the murder and then recanted days later. Brown was
eventually removed from that case after an appeals court found that
he was biased toward Ray.
</P>
<P>
   During the Ray case, the producers of ``Judge Judy'' saw a
profile of Brown on the ABC program ``Nightline.'' They contacted
the judge, and his show was born. Last season it had 5 million
viewers a day, second only to ``Judge Judy'' among the four
national television courtroom shows at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal and judicial ethics at New
York University Law School, said that although he did not doubt
that Brown was a good judge, he thought it was wrong for him to do
both jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge must choose between court business and show
business,'' Gillers said. ``It is not fair to the court system or
to the people of Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillers cited several reasons for his dim view of Brown's
serving in both venues. ``Inevitably, he will cut corners,'' he
said. ``In addition, he compromises the prestige of the court by
exploiting his position outside the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown disagrees, saying that argument represents a narrow
interpretation of the code of ethics, and he believes he is doing
nothing unethical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am enhancing the public's respect for the courts,'' he said,
``which is not as high as it has been. Judges have an obligation to
advise the public about the law and judicial procedures, and my
show does that. Through these shows, the public observes the
application of common sense by judicial officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Brown's courtroom, the concerns are more practical. For
Moore, it had taken a long time for his case to come up because his
lawyer had the hearing delayed while Brown was taping the show,
telling Moore it would be better to wait. Moore was not so sure,
saying, ``He's not real lenient.''
</P>
<P>
   When Moore finally sat down before Brown, the judge told him to
sit up straight. Moore explained that he had been helping a friend
move last year and was unaware that the friend's car was stolen and
that there was marijuana in it. Moore said police stopped them and
his friend ran, while he did not. Moore was charged with auto
theft.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sentenced Moore, an 11th-grade dropout, to two years
of probation in the judicial diversion program, ordered that he
complete his GED and take random drug tests as part of his
sentence. And then, in his signature style, he said gruffly: ``Quit
blowing that herb, and concentrate and focus. Step down, young man,
and get it together.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's no deal yet, but the decision to schedule
its 2001 football season opener against Cal State Northridge now
lies with Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to playing them,'' said Dick Dull, CSUN's
athletic director. ``At this point in time, whether it's going to
happen or not, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Byrne, Nebraska's athletic director, agrees to play the
game, which would be on Sept. 1, 2001, the Cornhuskers would pay
CSUN $400,000. That would be the largest payout in CSUN history.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that kind of money,'' Dull said, ``anyone in the world
would come out to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has three dates open for next season. Dull said he's trying
to fill the 2000 schedule as soon as possible, but most Division
I-A schools don't have any open dates.
</P>
<P>
   In another CSUN football development, Dull said there's no room
in the budget for a radio contract for the upcoming season, and he
doubts campus-based KCSN will broadcast the Matadors' games,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no football on radio this year,'' he said. ``I
basically have given up any hope of having it at all.'' &QL;

RESEARCHERS DEMONSTRATE COMPUTER CODE CAN BE BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An international team of researchers
demonstrated this week that it was possible to break the security
codes commonly used to protect financial transactions over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The actual feat involved finding the two prime factors for a
number about 155 digits long. The answer enables one to obtain the
key used to decode a particular piece of encrypted data.
</P>
<P>
   While the seven-month effort required a significant amount of
computing power _ involving 292 computers at 11 sites in six
countries _ it showed that the standard level of encryption for
Internet transactions, known as 512-bit encryption, was not secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said for a long time that 512 is not a secure
standard,'' said Burt Kaliski, chief scientist for RSA Research in
San Mateo, Calif., a part of Security Dynamics Technologies' RSA
Data Security Inc., which makes encryption technology and sponsored
a challenge to break the 512-bit code. ``I don't think this means
that overnight, Web sites will be attacked, but we need to make the
transfer to a larger key size.''
</P>
<P>
   The feat also raises questions about the government's policy of
export controls on encryption. The 512-bit system has become the
standard because, with some exceptions, it is the most secure
encryption allowed for export.
</P>
<P>
   Although higher levels of encryption exist, experts estimate
that 95 percent of Internet commerce uses the 512-bit standard.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the administration announced that the export
policy would be reviewed and an update announced within one year.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the under secretary of commerce for export
administration, said Thursday that the administration would make an
announcement by mid-September. He could not say, however, what
impact the recent demonstration would have on the encryption policy
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is intended to track market developments, but it's
too soon to come to a conclusion on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to factor a 512-bit number enables one version of
what is known as the RSA public key encryption system to be broken.
RSA, designed in the mid-1970s by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and
Leonard Adleman, is used extensively in software to protect
electronic data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   RSA and similar encryption systems are based on the fact that it
is immensely difficult and time-consuming for even the most
powerful computers to factor large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the factoring task took the researchers seven months,
they were using a relatively small amount of computing power,
mostly overnight and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a huge potential to speed this up a lot
more,'' said Arjen Lenstra, a computer scientist at Citigroup, and
one of the researchers involved in the project. He said that
harnessing the computational power available to government agencies
or major corporations could enable such codes to be broken in less
than one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft could do this over a Thanksgiving weekend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Shamir, a computer scientist at Weizmann Institute of
Science in Rehovoth, Israel, presented a paper describing a device,
not yet built, that could break a 512-bit code. But until this
week, the feat was only theoretical. Lenstra and Shamir are working
on a way to use the device to further speed the factoring process.

AFTER GETTING BOOT, USC RETURNS IN STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC's training camp is winding down, but a
disgusted coach Paul Hackett ended things prematurely Thursday when
he kicked the Trojans off the practice field midway through drills.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett had initially stopped practice and chewed out the team
about its sloppiness. Immediately after the lecture, tailback Chad
Morton fumbled a handoff.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. Hackett ordered the Trojans to hit the showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't in the mood to practice. We're not going to have a
bad practice,'' Hackett said. ``We're going to do it the right way.
Until we do it the right way, everybody is better off doing
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hackett said this, USC's players huddled together about 100
yards away, just outside the UC Irvine locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward, of all people, helped organize the
team's return to the practice field, where the Trojans started over
and practiced another 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a team leader. I'm not a team captain. I just didn't
want to see us go out like that,'' Soward said. ``That's not what
USC football is all about. We should never get kicked off the field
by the coach. I wanted to see who was laughing, who cared and who
didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of guys laughing and hoping the coach would call
practice. We're never going to win with that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who prevented the Trojans from packing it in were
linebacker Antuan Simmons, tight end Antoine Harris and strong
safety David Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to end camp on a sour note,'' Gibson said. ``I
think it tested the whole team in a way. That was important that we
regroup. There's always a positive in a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Trojans responded with one of their best
practices after they returned. When the practice finally ended _
about 30 minutes later than usual _ Hackett was pleased with the
entire episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has to be a standard that has to be met. Not the
coach's standard but the players' standard,'' Hackett said. ``It
goes beyond winning and losing. It's playing at a particular level
if you want to improve the team from where you were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have a change in that level and expectation. I got
fed up with it. Their response was, `Let's try it again,' and I
said OK. I thought their response was excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Steen out: Linebacker Jason Steen remains bothered by a
jammed neck injury and will miss the Hawaii game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Depth chart released: Hackett announced his two-deep with few
surprises. As reported Wednesday, Jason Grain replaced Zach Wilson
at right guard. Junior college transfer Markus Steele is starting
over Henry Wallace at weakside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   With Steen out, freshman Chris Prosser is No. 2 at strongside
linebacker, although Hackett hopes Prosser can still redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 tailback position was not cleared up. Frank Strong,
Jabari Jackson and Sultan McCullough are all listed as
second-string tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all in the hunt,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Captains named: USC named its team captains for the season.
Morton, Gibson and junior safety Ife Ohalete were selected. Morton
is USC's first two-time captain since 1903.
</P>
<P>
   __ Papadakis has surgery: Tailback Petros Papadakis underwent
successful surgery on his broken right foot at USC University
Hospital. He is expected to redshirt.

WRIGHT ANGLE WORKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He can fix your swing and fix your head. Isn't that what we all
want in a golf instructor _ if not necessarily in that order?
</P>
<P>
   Meet David Wright, Ph.D., PGA _ a Class-A teaching professional
who holds two doctorate degrees in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, the 1998 Teacher of the Year in the Southern California
PGA, has been preaching his Mind Under Par philosophy for 15 years,
the last two in half-day, one-day and two-day clinics at Pelican
Hill, the scenic and pristine seaside course located south of
Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean view from the Pelican Hill practice range is
spectacular. But chances are Mind Under Par students will be more
enthralled listening to the soft-spoken Wright, whose narrowed
focus on what is important in golf can have a dramatic impact on
play, confidence and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   If his low-key approach works for you, you'll be in good golf
company: Wright's clientele includes nearly 70 players who compete
on the PGA, LPGA, Senior PGA or Nike tours.
</P>
<P>
   Wright teaches, simply and convincingly, that how you start
determines how you finish. It's not a totally revolutionary
approach, but his definition of starting involves thinking and
nonthinking as much as posture, grip and alignment.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes focusing on the process rather than the result,
then judging results not by how close shots land to target but by
how close your swing !ital!felt to what you intended.
</P>
<P>
   Wright does not discount the importance of accuracy. Rather, he
stresses that you narrow your aim and raise your goals. But his
contention is shots will improve naturally as a result of your
staying in the moment, the process, when using a proper setup _
which Wright addresses in detail after attending to the mental side
of shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   His instruction is a combination of the mechanical and mental:
Work on the science of your swing on the range or in front of a
mirror, Wright said, but don't forget to work on your art on the
course.
</P>
<P>
   He contends proper breathing _ long, slow inhalations and longer
exhalations _ is critical to the relaxed state necessary for
success in a game so often affected adversely by stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breathing is the bridge between the physical and the mental,''
he said. ``If you're not breathing, it's not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing a golfer can do, Wright said, is be his or her
own best friend _ cheering the good shots, disregarding the poor
ones and rating self-approval over the perceived opinion of others:
</P>
<P>
   ``We get bogged down in how we're perceived by others and we get
stressed,'' he said, giving the classic first-tee jitters as an
example. ``We get taken out of control _ which is the definition of
stress. If you are driven by how you're perceived by others, you're
going to really struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his teaching on mechanics goes against widely held
theories. For example, Wright believes a proper shoulder alignment,
square to the target line, is seldom matched to a similarly squared
foot alignment.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrates convincingly to clinic participants that most
golfers have naturally open or closed stances _ then shows his
students how to easily determine their own individual stance and
proper ball position for that stance.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with instruction on proper spine angle, hand
position, grip and take-away, constituted the bulk of what seemed
like a small amount of morning information during a one-day clinic
last week. But when students combined that imput with Wright's
theories on breathing, narrowed focus and emphasis on process, they
found themselves hitting straighter shots and putts in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the wackiest part of Mind Under Par instruction, students
also learn how to intentionally hook and slice, hit topped and
dubbed shots. It's a drill designed to better understand the role
of hands and feet in bad shots _ to know the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   You'll come away thinking from a Wright clinic. You also have a
good chance of leaving with an improved mental and physical setup.
</P>

WORK ON KC'S UNION STATION PROGRESSES, BUT DOUBTS ABOUT DEADLINE
LINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK and LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On Union Station's construction site
Thursday, Kansas City Manager Bob Collins strolled through the
ornate Grand Hall. He passed pallets stacked with building
materials and watched workmen form a floor for a new cafe that's
already a month behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they're going to be done,'' Collins remarked.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Many who have visited the construction site
lately, including a bevy of city officials Thursday, wonder whether
the station will reopen on its scheduled Nov. 10 target date. Even
some tenants have their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Several facets of the job _ erecting entrance marquees,
carpeting a basement theater and installing light poles in the
former North Waiting Room, for instance _ were supposed to be
completed weeks ago. They aren't close to being done.
</P>
<P>
   Still, project officials, representing the station's owners and
main contractor J.E. Dunn Construction Co., say the building will
reopen on time.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the job, they say, is a matter of reaching certain
milestones and moving from one task to another, and the workers are
doing that. Also, they expect to increase manpower on Saturdays and
at nights as interior finish work proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is still a lot to do, we intend to do it,'' said
Andy Scott, executive director of the Union Station Assistance
Corp., which owns the station.
</P>
<P>
   David Ucko, president of the Kansas City Museum, the station's
new main tenant, added: ``We're relying on what Dunn is telling us,
and they say we'll be open on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Station, a landmark being transformed for the museum's
Science City, along with restaurants and offices, is one of the
nation's largest historic restoration projects. Its more than $250
million price tag is funded primarily by a first-in-the-nation
bistate cultural tax and from the region's second-largest private
fund-raising effort.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began in January 1998; the major work is almost
done.
</P>
<P>
   This includes erecting a new wing and two theaters west of the
North Waiting Room, forming and pouring an underground concrete
garage and driveway deck in front of the station, plus repairing
the ornate ceilings in the Grand Hall and waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday's tour, Kansas City Councilwoman Bonnie Sue Cooper
recalled having met relatives at the station years ago when it was
still a working train depot. Back then, the Grand Hall's walls and
ceiling were covered with dirt and soot. Now, the walls have been
cleaned and the ceiling's carved floral patterns have been
replastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this fantastic? My goodness,'' Cooper said, as she gazed
around the Grand Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the inside, however, Union Station looks far from
the last-minute, touch-up stage.
</P>
<P>
   In Science City's uptown section, metal frames for exhibit space
are in place but not the walls or furnishings. In the downtown
section, streetscape facades are up, but trimmings and signs
haven't been added.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kansas City Museum staff members are moving into
office space later this month, other finish work _ wall enclosures,
fixtures and furniture _ is missing.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, finish work is weeks behind the project's
original or updated schedules:
</P>
<P>
   - A raised floor for Forbes Cross' Ticket Cafe in the Grand Hall
was slated to be completed July 26. It's under construction.
</P>
<P>
   - New entrance marquees in front of the station were supposed to
be installed by Monday. Work hasn't started yet.
</P>
<P>
   - A basement theater was scheduled to be carpeted by July 19 and
painted by Aug. 2. Crews are still building concrete-block walls
for it.
</P>
<P>
   - Elevators around the Grand Hall were to have been completed by
Aug. 2; they're not done.
</P>
<P>
   - Light poles were to have been installed in the North Waiting
Room by Aug. 16. Today, there's only one.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Mary Williams-Neal couldn't hide her
skepticism as she surveyed the cluttered floors where Science City
exhibits eventually will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nov. 10 is not that far away,'' she said. Williams-Neal
doubles as Kansas City's representative on the Bistate Commission,
which oversees spending of tax dollars on Union Station. ``We've
got two months. We promised, and we're going to deliver on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others on the tour wondered aloud how the construction project
could be finished on time. But they stopped short of declaring that
it couldn't be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be amazed if they have it finished in two months, but
they will,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be scrambling,'' said Ed Wolf, the city's
public works director. ``They always are, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Ed Ford last toured the site three months ago. ``It's
come a long way since then, but...'' he said, leaving the rest of
his sentence unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the government officials' tour, restaurateur Rod
Anderson spent several hours in station meetings, where he learned
how much work still had to be done. Anderson is leasing three
spaces in the station for an upscale seafood restaurant, a soda
fountain and a coffee bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat on pins and needles,'' Anderson said Thursday,
``but I still believe it can be done.''

<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Rain did what no team has been able to do
here at the Little League World Series: slow Toms River, N.J., on
its march toward a second straight championship.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. championship game between Toms River and Phenix City,
Ala., was suspended with the New Jersey team leading by 2-0 in the
top of the second inning. It will resume at 11 a.m. Friday, with a
Toms River runner on first base and no one out.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Friday's game will face Osaka, Japan, in
Saturday's championship game. The Japanese team won the
international championship over Yabucoa, P.R., Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor, the Toms River star who has pitched five shutouts
in regional and World Series play over the last two weeks, did not
start Thursday night. Manager Mike Gaynor, Casey's father, started
Zack Del Vento instead, then removed him after he walked Phenix
City's first batter and replaced him with Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zack was throwing well, we would have kept him in there,''
Mike Gaynor said after the game had been called. ``But Zack just
wasn't throwing well all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might have been playing mind games with the Alabama
team by making the sudden switch, Gaynor said, ``Yeah, that may
have had something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor, who shut out Phenix City, 6-0, last Sunday, was
expected to be the pitcher when Thursday night's game resumed on
Friday. Under Little League post-season rules, a player can pitch
on consecutive days if he pitches only one inning on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The skies that had been threatening for two days finally opened
up about half an hour before Thursday night's game. Playing in a
steady drizzle, Toms River scored two runs in the top of the first
inning, capitalizing on two walks and two wild pitches by Colby
Rasmus, Phenix City's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus, who gave up the six runs to Toms River last Sunday,
walked the leadoff batter, Eric Campesi, who advanced to third on
consecutive wild pitches. Campesi then scored on a sacrifice by
Casey Gaynor. Rasmus also walked Jeff Burgdorff, who eventually
stole home to make the score 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the international championship, Japan avenged an earlier loss
by pounding Puerto Rico, 12-2. The team from Osaka is the second
straight Japanese team to win the international championship. Last
year Kashima reached the title game and lost to Toms River, 12-9.
</P>
<P>
   Osaka's victory came two days after it lost to Yabucoa, 3-1.
Thursday the Japanese team jumped all over the Puerto Rican team,
scoring seven runs on six hits in the first inning. And Japan did
its damage with two out, thanks to an error by the Puerto Rico
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst allowed the Japanese team to remove its best
pitcher, Kazuki Sumiyama, after he had faced only three batters.
That should make Sumiyama available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having two outs with no one on base, then giving up
seven runs, that took a lot out of the team,'' said Puerto Rico
manager Edwin Carrasquillo.

   DETROIT _ Back in the 1950s and '60s, Cadillac built cars with
all-American swagger. People aspired to get behind the wheel of a
Cadillac with yards of chrome and soaring tailfins. But Cadillac
has a problem: Those same people are almost the only ones still
willing to be seen driving a Caddy.

<P>
   For several years, Cadillac has been struggling to update its
image and its lineup. Friday, it is scheduled to introduce a badge
for its future cars and trucks. The badge, a stylized, sleeker
version of its traditional wreath-and-crest design, is a symbol of
Cadillac's effort to remake itself while clinging to its
prestigious heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Another embodiment of Cadillac's attempt to attract a new
generation of buyers can be found on a billboard in Times Square.
It is the Evoq, a silver, batmobile-like car with design elements
that will wend their way through the next generation of Cadillac's
lineup, appearing over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Evoq (pronounced ``evoke'') is the model for ``art and
science,'' the new strategy of Cadillac, a division of General
Motors Corp. Cadillac means to return to the art of gutsy designs
while equipping its cars with science that even Batman could love,
like a windshield with night-vision capacity. The new look is
modern and metallic _ more brushed aluminum than shiny chrome.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the strategy works and people gravitate to
Cadillac's new look, the division will probably flounder for the
next few years. Cadillac's first car truly showing the new design
flair will not be on the streets until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product is everything to making `art and science' live in
consumers' minds,'' said John Smith, Cadillac's general manager.
``It is a winning proposition _ now we just have to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this decade, each Cadillac offering was pitched to a
different target audience, and the resulting brand dissonance led
to disappointing sales results. The DeVille, for instance, used the
old standard ``Making Whoopee'' as background music for its ads,
while the new Escalade sport utility vehicle was advertised on
television by blasting the song ``Bad to the Bone'' by the blues
guitarist George Thoroughgood.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac spent much of 1997 deciding on its new strategy and
then began designing cars around it last year. This fall, it will
begin showing ads for all its cars using the ``art and science''
theme. The ads are by Cadillac's longtime advertising agency,
D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles, a unit of MacManus Group of New
York. Cadillac will try to keep its sales respectable until the
newly designed cars begin arriving in two years, when the 2002
Catera will be introduced, bearing a strong resemblance to the Evoq
concept car. After that, a new car is scheduled to appear roughly
every year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Smith said Cadillac's ad spending would be at the same
levels as in the last few years. Cadillac spent $93.1 million on
advertising in the first five months of this year, $187.7 million
last year and $247.6 million in 1997, according to Competitive
Media Reporting, a unit of R.C. Auletta &AMP; Co., which tracks
advertising spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac badge is getting its first new design since 1963.
Image consultants said the reworked badge could help the brand with
its transition from the old designs to the new ones. ``This new
symbol would serve as a useful bridge,'' said Clive Chajet,
chairman of Chajet Consultancy, a New York corporate identity
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed, saying that updating a classic brand is a balance
between modernizing to attract new buyers and risking offending
loyal customers. ``You have to be careful,'' said Eric Olson,
design director of Landor Associates, a New York brand and identity
consultant owned by Young &AMP; Rubicam. ``When you are into that age
group and that tax group, this is probably considered a major
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened Cadillac's attempts to revitalize the brand to that
of Scotch producers, whose products are now faithfully consumed by
older buyers. ``It is like Dewar's whisky is trying to go after
college kids,'' Olson said. ``Some of the new Cadillacs coming out
are quite fashion forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on Cadillac's new plan. Just three years ago, the
division made serious missteps _ even by its own admission _ in
marketing the Catera, a small, entry-level luxury car designed to
attract young buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Car magazines called the Catera's looks boring. In addition,
advertising in the fall of 1996 used animated ducks to try to
suggest that Catera was fun and different from the rest of the
stodgy Cadillac line: Ducks have appeared on the Cadillac badge
since at least 1908. But, Smith said glumly in a post-mortem,
``Consumers did not comprehend the connection to Cadillac's
heritage.'' Not only have the ducks nearly disappeared from the
Catera ads, they have even been banished from Cadillac's crest,
which was modeled after the family crest of Antoine de la Mothe
Cadillac, the French explorer who founded Detroit. The new version
of the badge has no crowns either, although it retains the crest's
aristocratic coat of arms.

LEWIS'S SON KEEPS HIM GROUNDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ UCLA junior Jermaine Lewis has lost his starting
tailback job to DeShaun Foster, but he's hoping for a more
important prize in coming weeks: custody of his 1-year-old son,
Khalil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to his mother (Tuesday) night and it'll probably be
joint custody,'' said Lewis, of Antelope Valley. ``You know, I
never thought anything would take the place of football _ it's been
good to me. But my son, he's my joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he became Khalil's primary caretaker last spring,
which limited his time for summer school and summer workouts. He
missed several practices last week to complete a sociology class
and found himself searching for motivation. This is, after all, his
fourth training camp. What was invigorating a few years ago has
become a grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not mentally prepared coming into training camp,'' said
Lewis, who was UCLA's second-leading rusher last year with 553
yards. ``The first couple days, I was going through the motions. My
mind was someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on his studies and his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine has gone from a boy to a man with that child,''
Bruins fullback Durell Price said. ``He's just grown up so much.
There's always a glow about him now. With his son, Jermaine's on
cloud nine.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: A thin offensive line became transparent
Thursday when the Bruins learned reserve tackle Josh Webb will miss
the season because of chronically sprained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had hoped Webb, a junior, could play sparingly until
linemen Oscar Cabrera and Jim Ghezzi returned from their
disabled-parking-related suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Webb's done and UCLA's desperate: Micah Webb is the
only reserve tackle for the Boise State and Ohio State games.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Bruins are one injury _ or one case of
dehydration _ from using true freshman tackle Bryce Bohlander, who
was expected to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Just for kicks: The muddled kicking and punting situations
have been resolved, for now. Freshman Nate Fikse will handle punts
and kickoffs. Walk-on Chris Griffith will kick extra points and
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most consistent and that's the thing that got him
the job,'' Toledo said. `Nate's percentages weren't as high as
Chris's.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Parking-placard update: Price and Ghezzi learned Wednesday
that their attorney, Robert Shapiro, had received another
continuance. Now they'll be arraigned Sept. 14 in Municipal Court
for their participation in the disabled-parking scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about the continuance after the scrimmage,'' Price
said. ``I want it to be over quick, but my lawyer knows what's in
my best interest.''

<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Opponents of independence for East Timor ran
wild in the streets of this tiny provincial capital Thursday,
firing guns, throwing rocks and setting fire to at least two
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the United Nations, which is organizing a
referendum on self-rule Monday, said he believed that four people
had been killed, either by anti-independence thugs or by panicked
policemen, and that many more had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke rose from the fires as the thugs, known as
militiamen, roared through the city in trucks. Shopkeepers pulled
down their shutters, and the streets became empty and silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be viewed as a final effort by armed militiamen to
destabilize the popular consultation in its final days,'' said U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst.
</P>
<P>
   The people of East Timor are to vote Monday on whether to become
an independent nation or an autonomous region within Indonesia,
which invaded the remote territory in 1975 and has battled a
separatist insurgency ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the Indonesian military, the armed militias have
sought to intimidate the territory's 800,000 residents or to derail
the referendum through violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the targets of intimidation Thursday were foreigners
here to organize or observe the vote. But Wimhurst said the
referendum would proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was the worst in the capital since the arrival of
U.N. officials in May, but other parts of East Timor have seen more
bloodshed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said that from 40,000 to 60,000 people had fled their
homes outside the capital and were living as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an increase in violence in the last week or 10
days,'' said another U.N. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Today was certainly not a day we like, but it may not
have been the worst. What was unusual about it was that it happened
here in Dili, but there have been worse days elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday that it
deplored the outbreak of violence in East Timor and blamed the
Indonesian government for failing to crack down on
anti-independence militias that have been blamed for most of the
recent killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia has a clear responsibility to provide security and
maintain order in East Timor, not only in the coming days but
throughout an orderly transition to East Timor's new status,'' said
a spokesman, James Foley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday began with rallies and motorcades on the final day of
pre-election campaigning by more than 10,000 independence
opponents. Mostly tough young men, they wound their way through
Dili in small trucks or on motorcycles, waving red-and-white
Indonesian flags and placards reading ``Otonomi'' _ advocating
autonomy under continued Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a rally, one militia leader, Eurico Guterres,
threatened to begin a campaign of violence if his side loses the
vote. ``If East Timor becomes independent, it will become a sea of
fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, members of a militia motorcade threw stones
and shot at the headquarters of the main pro-independence group. On
Wednesday, 10,000 supporters of independence had held their final
rally in a festive and peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Thursday's motorcades passed through the eastern edge
of town, scores of young men leaped from their trucks and stormed
through two villages. They set homes and vehicles on fire, fired
their mostly homemade guns and beat some residents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, militiamen shot in the direction of a group of
foreign journalists. A photographer for Reuters was shot in the
thigh and a photographer for The Sydney Morning Herald was beaten.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said he was threatened at gunpoint as he drove
past a militia checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign election monitor, Suzanna Bruz, said her office was
fired upon by members of a motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were attacked in our own house, and we are international
observers,'' she said. ``They were running in the street and they
shot at us, pa-pa-pa-pa, and we were screaming.'' She said nobody
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome, Wimhurst said, was the inability of
police to control the violence. Under procedures for the referendum
agreed to at the United Nations, the Indonesian police are
responsible for security during the campaign and on polling day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have got to take full account of the situation and
face their inability to control these localized outbreaks of
violence,'' he said. ``I believe they felt overwhelmed. We will be
discussing this situation fully with the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said police were very slow to arrive when violence
flared on the city's eastern edge and that when they did they
appeared to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw one man get shot,'' said a woman, Yenni Wahid. ``He was
running from the police and they tried to grab him. He got away and
they fired warning shots. He kept running. One guy pointed a gun
and all the journalists shouted, `No!' And bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses said they saw a police officer aim his rifle
point-blank at one young man and shoot him in the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   If the territory does vote for independence, the Indonesian
police and military forces here will continue to be responsible for
security during a transition period of three to six months, a
government spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to leave a vacuum here,'' the spokesman, Dino
Djalal, said. ``There has to be some continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military experts estimate that Indonesia currently has
8,000 police officers and between 12,000 and 15,000 troops
stationed in East Timor.

CHANCES OF BOEING STRIKE APPEAR TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ore., Kan.)  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, executives at Boeing Co. and leaders of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
the union representing the largest number of Boeing employees, have
been meeting regularly to trade ideas and work out disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-subtle goal of what both sides said was a new era of
cooperation between management and labor was to avoid a disruptive
strike at a time when Boeing, the world's largest aerospace
company, is recovering from some of the worst operational turmoil
in its history.
</P>
<P>
   But with Boeing poised to deliver its ``best and final offer''
to the machinists Friday for a contract to replace one that expires
next Wednesday, the likelihood that the company will be struck for
the third time in 10 years appears to be growing. ``Everything
we've put together for months about working together has all been
bogus as far as I am concerned,'' said Bill Johnson, a member of
the union negotiating committee and president of the Seattle local
that represents 31,000 of the 44,000 Boeing workers covered by the
contract. ``Nothing has come across the table that is going to
satisfy our members if they are going to buy into a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cassandralike warnings are not unusual as contract
negotiations head into their endgame, especially if the union
thinks, as now, that the company cannot afford a strike.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Boeing sounds more optimistic. ``We have been
making progress,'' said Peter Conte, a company spokesman. ``The
proposal as it is coming together will address all of the
employees' issues and many of the union's concerns upon entering
this round of bargaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Conte acknowledged that the company was painting green
lines around the entrances to its buildings to mark how close
pickets can stand. It is also certifying some managers for
technical work so they can help build its jetliners if the workers
walk out.
</P>
<P>
   The machinists' union represents about a quarter of Boeing's
total work force of 200,000 but nearly half the 100,000 at its
flagship commercial-airplane division. The union and the company
have been negotiating intensively at a hotel in the Seattle area
since Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   After the machinists receive the company's final offer, they
will present it to their members for a vote. If the proposal does
not receive a simple majority, a second vote, requiring a
two-thirds majority, will be held to decide whether to strike. A
walkout could come as soon as 12:01 a.m. next Thursday. (If the
strike vote fails, the company's offer is automatically accepted,
even though it lacks majority support.)
</P>
<P>
   The last time the machinists struck, in 1995, they were out for
69 days. The event rippled through the economy of the Seattle area,
because factory workers at Boeing receive some of the region's
highest wages. During that walkout, the union paid out only $17.6
million in strike benefits, compared with Boeing's normal payroll
of $325 million during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would also affect Wichita, Kan., where 11,500
machinists work for Boeing, making the fuselages for its
single-aisle 737 jets, and Portland, Ore., where the company
employs 1,800 members of the union.
</P>
<P>
   The workers covered by the contract earn more than $40,000 a
year on average _ not including overtime, which can swell wages to
more than twice that level during periods of particularly heavy
production. Although the union seeks a wage increase, neither side
will discuss the size of the demand.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, pay is not among the main issues, which the union
has identified as job security and health and retirement benefits.
A survey of its members by the union found that only 5 percent
thought that their jobs were ``very secure.'' More workers thought
that subcontracting work to outsiders posed a greater threat to
their jobs than did competition from Airbus Industrie, the European
consortium that, other than Boeing, is the world's only remaining
maker of large passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
   The machinists would like a say in future decisions by the
company to transfer manufacturing to outside suppliers. They also
want Boeing to increase retirement benefits, which the union says
average $16,200 a year after 30 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The union is also resisting the company's efforts to reduce
overtime by expanding production to seven days a week, from five,
and to raise the amount workers pay for health insurance, which was
the biggest issue in the 1995 strike.
</P>
<P>
   Conte, the company spokesman, said Boeing simply wanted to
explore how best to manage escalating health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our positions are subject to change up until the final
offer,'' he said. ``Those are among the positions that could yet
change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The machinists entered the negotiations with confidence, because
Boeing is only beginning to emerge from a costly foul-up two years
ago that forced it to halt airplane production for a month and led
to its first annual loss in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's stock price, which at first plunged, has since
recovered, rising 36 percent this year. But it is still not back to
where it was before the crisis began. Wall Street analysts think
that Boeing must improve its efficiency on the factory floor if it
is to increase its profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to see the work force actively increasing
productivity at the company,'' said Byron Callan, an aerospace
analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Some think that the union may be overplaying its hand,
underestimating Boeing's willingness to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a strike,'' Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's
president, said in an interview in June. ``We don't expect a
strike. I don't think the union wants a strike. But I think both
sides are perfectly willing to strike, or take a strike, if anybody
gets kind of stupid or forgets what the world's all about.''

LEVELING HOME RUNS AT SKEPTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire have been fending off
fastballs high and tight every night, plus whatever baseball's best
pitchers throw at them.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Curt Schilling  &UR; !ital! &LR; wish they
could handcuff the two best power hitters of our day as wickedly as
certain media types.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of a mound, these aces are firing from soapboxes, ruing
Home Run Derby Deux. They've been at it from Opening Day, supplying
the chin music that is practically drowning out a sonorous refrain.
The headhunters in sportswriting's starting rotation, they are way
off base.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Sosa and McGwire were marked men no matter what
kind of numbers they put up this season. As they're both on pace to
throw fresh dirt over Roger Maris' 62 home-run mark, they've given
people grist to grouse about the depreciation of records made to be
broken posthaste, the inflation of individual pursuits over team
excellence, the bankruptcy of our father's game, blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   For Sosa and McGwire, it was either bury Maris' milestone twice
and for all or be themselves buried.
</P>
<P>
   Guaranteed: If McGwire had achieved anything less than crossing
the 50-homer plateau for a fourth consecutive season, the
androstenedione question would have dogged him to distraction. And
it wouldn't have been just the headhunters in the media going after
him with glee.
</P>
<P>
   You know all those flashbulbs that light up Busch Field like a
Christmas tree every time McGwire swings at a pitch? They would
have been a single aromatherapy candle next to the glare that a
mediocre _ for McGwire _ season would have wrought.
</P>
<P>
   If the baseball purists believe the home run is ruining the game
by devaluing such sublime skills as bunting, advancing runners and
working for walks, well, they should stop whining long enough to
contemplate the stake that might have been driven into the heart of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what a blight it would have been to have the summer
swathed in controversy over whether or not an asterisk belonged
next to McGwire's 1998 home run total: 70 ( _ aided by
androstenedione).
</P>
<P>
   By publicly parting ways with andro and perpetuating the same
blistering pace as before, McGwire has done more to preserve the
integrity of baseball than any number of armchair historians.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Sosa, who wasn't expected to be sized for a
pedestal once, much less again.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa finished with 66 home runs after drafting off McGwire
_ remember, he held the home run lead only twice: for three innings
the first time and for under an hour the second _ the prevailing
opinion was we were about to see baseball's answer to Debby Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Sosa had lit up our lives for one summer. But would he end
up a one-year wonder like Boone, who never had another No. 1 single
after her first, in 1977?
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had plenty of doubters. For someone who achieved so much in
1998, Sosa came into spring training with a lot to prove. Namely
that an offseason spent rubbing elbows with the likes of President
Clinton and Hilary, Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner and Denzel Washington
hadn't turned him into a fat cat.
</P>
<P>
   If Sosa had put up the same numbers in 1999 as he did in 1997 _
36 home runs in 162 games _ the headhunters in the media would have
been relentless.
</P>
<P>
   They would have called his 66 home runs in 1998 an awful
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa would have been painted as someone who wandered into
history's hallowed halls by mistake. He would have been labeled a
fluke, a fraud and probably worse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is cementing his standing as a phenomenon. Sosa hit
home run No. 53 on Thursday, in his 126th game. He needed 135 games
to reach the same total last year. He is on pace to hit 68 home
runs. Given how many long-ball-lobbing pitching staffs the Cubs
have upcoming, starting with the Dodgers tonight, it doesn't take
much imagination to picture Sosa supplanting McGwire in the record
books.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine by us. Sosa was so gracious during McGwire's iconic
turn last year, we consider turnabout not only fair play but
entirely fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman, who used to clash with Sosa like
plaids do with polka dots, has called Sosa the team's ``hardest
worker'' and ``the easiest superstar to deal with in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are saying the long ball's popularity is the game's
demise?
</P>
<P>
   So what if the fans at Dodger Stadium leave after Sosa's last
at-bat tonight. We submit it's not just home run hungry fans who
are disinterested in the end result. Albert Belle could have stayed
with a winner in Cleveland, but he took the money and ran to the
White Sox. Roger Clemens departed Boston for Toronto, even as the
Yankees were calling his name.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball is losing fans and relevance, it's not the fault of
McGwire and Sosa. They are baseball's prize, not its problem. They
get a free pass from us.

AFTER NYC DENIES PERMIT, ORGANIZERS OF BLACK POWER MARCH VOW TO
PROCEED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS to defused in 3rd graf of optional trim.)  (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Thursday that the
city has denied a permit for a controversial youth rally in Harlem,
but the event's organizers angrily vowed to proceed with or without
the city's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the permit was denied because the organizers, who
he has called ``reprehensible'' for their anti-white and
anti-Semitic comments, failed to submit a proper application.
``They had an opportunity to properly apply,'' he said. ``They
haven't. So as far as we're concerned, it's over.'' The mayor did
not specify how the group's application was improper.
</P>
<P>
   Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the primary organizer of the event,
called the Million Youth March, said he will first seek to overturn
the city's decision in court. But if that course fails, he added,
the rally, scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 4, would proceed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the philosophy and the ideology of peace if
possible, but violence when necessary,'' Muhammad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's march, which followed a court order permitting the
rally, ended in violence and dozens of injuries as hundreds of
police officers and rally participants clashed.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Thursday that the objective of the rally was to
promote education and economic empowerment for black youths _ ``We
are not going for a war in the streets,'' he said _ he also
insisted on his ``God-given'' right to lead a rally of young blacks
in the streets of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be there,'' he said, emphasizing each word. ``For the
sake of my people, for the sake of our youth, I will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as firmly, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
promised that the city would act to prevent the rally from being
held without the required city permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group that talks about hurting people and hate,''
Safir said. ``There is no permit. If they attempt to march, they
won't be allowed to, and that will be the end of it.'' He did not
elaborate on what methods the Police Department would use.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events _ announcement of the permit denial, the
promised legal challenge, the charged words of confrontation _
mirrored the events leading up to last year's Million Youth March.
Once again, Giuliani dismissed the march organizers as marginal
hatemongers who are playing to the news media. Once again, Muhammad
accused the mayor of oppressing black people and pandering to Jews
who resent Muhammad's history of anti-Semitic remarks _ epithets so
extreme that he was suspended in 1994 from his position as
spokesman for the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like deja vu,'' Muhammad said in an interview outside
Sistas' Place, a jazz cafe in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn that is serving as the headquarters for the rally.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, several passing cars honked, the drivers sticking
out raised fists or calling words of support to Muhammad, who was
dressed in combat boots and black fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``These devils won't write that,'' he told one woman about these
signal of support, gesturing to three reporters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Thursday, Giuliani said the permit was
denied because Muhammad's group, the New Black Panther Party, had
refused to ``comply with the parameters'' of a federal appeals
court ruling last year that gave the organization permission to
demonstrate then for four hours on six blocks along a section of
Lenox Avenue known as Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion over the timing of the denial of the permit.
Asked when the decision was made, Giuliani said Thursday that it
was made ``about three or four days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the day before, when asked by reporters whether the march
should be allowed, Giuliani declined to answer, and he made no
mention of the permit having been denied. Nor did City Corporation
Counsel Michael Hess mention that there had been a decision when he
spoke late Wednesday afternoon with Roger Wareham, an attorney for
the march.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wareham, Hess said he wanted to work out an
agreement and avoid the necessity of going to court. In an
interview, Hess said the final decision was made Thursday, when the
mayor announced that the permit had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad said march organizers have agreed all along to abide by
the terms of that ruling. In their most recent letter to the city,
dated Monday, another lawyer for the march organizers, Jomo Thomas,
said they ``fully intend to function within the spirit'' of that
court decision. But in the same letter, Thomas requested additional
city permits for a 17-block parade to the rally site at 118th
Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conveners are only demanding equal treatment before the
law,'' Thomas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad said it was Giuliani and Safir who were defying the
ruling and ``now trying to rewrite the white Constitution of
America.'' He said the two were ``rattling the saber'' to confuse
and frighten those who might be inclined to attend the rally.
``They are wickedly wise,'' he said. ``They want to minimize this
new black power movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani on Thursday noted that Muhammad has lost the
backing of Harlem's leading politicians, who last year supported
the march even as they condemned Muhammad for his comments about
Jews and whites. On Wednesday, for example, the most powerful
political figure in Harlem, Rep. Charles Rangel, called upon blacks
to boycott the march.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I have to commend all of the political leaders in the
community for supporting the city's position,'' Giuliani said. ``I
think that it shows a great deal of independence and courage to do
that, and a willingness to take a look again at a set of facts in
which they had a different position last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, perhaps slightly uncomfortable at being the recipient of
Giuliani's praise, declined Thursday to support Giuliani's decision
to deny a permit for the march. ``The city has done this before and
the courts clearly overruled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rangel's call for a boycott _ and the likelihood that a
court will now decide the question of whether to grant a rally
permit _ largely defused any potential political fallout for
Giuliani, who is considering running for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's likely opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, announced
Thursday that she, too, opposed the march. But through a spokesman,
Mrs. Clinton declined to offer an opinion on whether the organizers
should be denied a permit.

A NEW CHALLENGE LOOMS FOR STEVENSON: EXPECTATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of curious fans crowded the court exit on Tuesday and
craned their necks to catch one more glimpse of the new It Girl on
the tennis scene, Alexandra Stevenson. She's the 18-year-old wonder
from Wimbledon who drew coos for her curtsies, raves for her serve
and stares from those stunned to find out her father is Julius
Erving.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been the same since. Her instant celebrity has meant
traveling through a gantlet of interviews, including a prime-time
sitdown with Barbara Walters. Her recognizable face has caught the
attention of smitten cab drivers and pizza-delivery guys, all of
whom ask for her autograph. Each request from a fan _ whether it's
in an airport or the mall _ is greeted with a smile as bright as a
half-moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I love attention,'' Stevenson said during the Pilot
Pen tournament in New Haven this week. ``I love acting and singing
and the stage. I love performing on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   But with stardom comes expectation. After Stevenson's surreal
ride through a kind draw at Wimbledon, where she became the first
woman to advance out of qualifying and reach the semifinals, she
has not won a tournament match in four events. Not exactly the
momentum desired coming into the U.S. Open, which begins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wimbledon was a fairy tale,'' Stevenson's coach, Craig Kardon,
said. ``She needs to get better. She needs time to develop. What
Wimbledon proved is that she has the talent. She has top-10
potential. Since Wimbledon, to me, there's been too much media, too
much hype. She needs to focus on tennis, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson had a sharpshooter's focus as she skipped through
Wimbledon and ignored the controversy swirling around her from
comments attributed to her mother, Samantha, and the revelation
about her biological father. Lately, her focus has been in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not distracted,'' said Stevenson, who turned pro at
Wimbledon. ``Not at all. Wimbledon was my first tournament out of
high school. I'm still learning a lot. I'm learning how to move
into the returns and really just playing these girls. They've been
out here a long time. I'm just starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people expect me to win everything now. Maybe
they're saying Wimbledon was a fluke or whatever. I mean, I'm just
starting. `Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and sometimes it
rains.' Remember? That was from `Bull Durham.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was a movie about an aging baseball player guiding the
development of a hard-throwing phenom. In this real-life case,
Stevenson is the powerful prodigy who can uncoil her 6-foot-1-inch
frame for a smoking serve. That is her weapon, and it worked well
for her on the grass courts of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On grass, it's easier for me: boom, boom, it's over,''
Stevenson said. ``On hardcourts, it's a totally different game.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardcourts of the U.S. Open require more patience and keen
tunnel vision in front of the rowdy crowds. She knows this from
experience. Last year, playing despite a fever, she lost in the
first round of the Open on a packed court located in the remote
reaches of the National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this time will be better,'' Stevenson said.
``Hopefully, I won't get the flu.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Stevenson is to re-create the magic of Wimbledon, she'll
have to get by a difficult first-round opponent. Stevenson, ranked
No. 43, will face the 11th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat. Considering the
surface and adversary, another fantasy ride through a Grand Slam
might be unrealistic. At least to everyone but the bubbling
optimist, Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready,'' Stevenson said. ``I know I'll have my focus. I
can't wait to win it. That's what I think about. The New York
crowds, they're the best. They're nice and loud, and they get you
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds around Stevenson in Flushing Meadows will be thicker
than ever before, but that's the way Stevenson likes it. She has
embraced celebrity.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   With more than 7,000 police officers looking on, a coalition of
left-wing opposition parties and labor unions marched on Brasilia,
demanding the resignation of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
the abandonment of a fiscal austerity program being overseen by the
International Monetary Fund, and a halt to the privatization of
state-owned companies. The so-called March of 100,000 appeared to

   Porfirio Munoz Ledo, who a decade ago helped found Mexico's
largest leftist party, known as the PRD, said he had accepted an
offer from a tiny leftist group, the Party of the Authentic Mexican
Revolution, to appear on the ballot in July 2000 elections as its
presidential candidate. The move appeared to heighten chances that
Munoz Ledo and his followers could abandon the PRD, whose
presidential candidate is his bitter rival, Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano of Mexico City. But Munoz Ledo said he had no
plans to do so.

   Negotiations over compensating slave laborers from the Nazi era

JUDGE RECONSIDERS ORDER FOR 14-YEAR-OLD'S ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KARINA BLAND  
 and CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A judge is reconsidering his order to let a
14-year-old girl have a late-term abortion after child welfare
officials questioned her competency.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Thursday, Judge William Sargeant of Maricopa County
Superior Court was handed a new report suggesting the girl is not
competent to decide for herself whether to have an abortion,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were in sharp contrast to an earlier report by the
girl's therapist, who described her as perfectly capable of making
such a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The new report was prepared by a psychiatrist who evaluated the
girl at the request of officials at the state Department of
Economic Security, which oversees Child Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   The hazel-eyed girl, a chronic runaway who has been in and out
of the care of state CPS since she was 5, attended the hearing. She
still insists she wants to have an abortion, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected today on whether she can go out of state
to have the abortion as planned, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the girl, who is 24 weeks pregnant, was granted
permission by Sargeant to go to California to terminate the
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Her court-appointed guardian supported her request after the
child said she had been raped. The girl also told the court that
she used myriad illegal drugs during her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   While child welfare officials debate whether the girl is
competent, some state officials are scrambling to stop the
court-ordered abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have strong reason to believe this is not over,'' Senate
President Brenda Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Burns asked state Attorney General
Janet Napolitano to issue an injunction to keep the girl from
undergoing the procedure, complaining that state law prohibits
public funds being spent on abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The girl would have to go to California for the abortion because
no Arizona physicians perform the procedure after 20 weeks. Only
California and Kansas perform late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the leak of this story to anti-abortion group from
Juvenile Court, where records typically are held strictly
confidential, has fueled the already boiling national debate over
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers are using the incident to further their views on
the subject. The Governor's Office has been flooded with calls,
mostly critical of the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   And a national abortion rights group has entered the fray,
asking the state Attorney General's Office to investigate who
leaked confidential information about the child and the judge's
order.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the 14-year-old girl has garnered so
much attention from state child welfare officials. She ran away
from home at age 8 and refused to return, claiming she was being
abused by her mother and her mother's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had disappeared from her home and was gone for 13{
hours before her mother called police. She was found at a friend's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The girl reportedly told playmates that she had run away to the
desert, where she had a cardboard fort, to escape a beating from
her mother's boyfriend. Neighbors in the area told reporters that
the child had been physically abused for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother died in January, and her body was found near
the Glendale Municipal Airport, according to police reports. The
39-year-old woman was last seen the previous day in the 7100 block
of North 80th Avenue in the company of a man. Glendale police still
are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's father is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police have a file on the child, with reports ranging
from running away to criminal damage to giving false information to
a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the girl's group home in June of 1998
after she ran down a hallway and threw her body against the wall,
punching a 10- by 10-inch hole in the drywall. She was arrested and
taken to juvenile detention. At the time, police confiscated a book
on witchcraft from her room.
</P>
<P>
   Little else is known about the troubled girl because the judge
has sealed her records, and spokeswomen for the DES, the courts and
even the governor said they can no longer talk about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they could say much before.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal laws deem confidential the dependency records
of juveniles. Maricopa County Presiding Juvenile Court Judge
Maurice Portley said he is outraged by the leak of information
about this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly unfortunate,'' he said. ``We want to respect their
(children in state care) privacy and give them the opportunity to
grow up healthy and without too many people learning too much
information about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Miller, head of the Arizona chapter of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, requested Wednesday that the
attorney general find out who leaked the confidential information.
Releasing such information is a Class 2 misdemeanor, punishable by
up to four months in jail and $750 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some public employee has taken their own beliefs and has
decided to pass it on to the biggest anti-abortion lobby in the
state to bring pressure on the judge and governor to change their
minds,'' Miller said &UR; Thursday. ``That is a violation of this young
woman's rights, certainly of the trust she should have in
government and certainly a violation of the trust all of us should
have in government.''
</P>
<P>
   The information was leaked to attorney John Jakubczyk, who
represents pro-life interests in Arizona, including Arizona Right
to Life, the state's largest pro-life lobby. Jakubczyk says the
girl's privacy is being protected. For example, while many people
know the girl's identify, including the media, her name has not
been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a nation who is caring about a child and a baby,''
Jakubczyk said, adding that people from across the country have
offered to adopt both the girl and her baby. ``They don't want her
hurt. They don't want the baby dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Francie Noyes, Gov. Jane Hull's spokeswoman, said more than 500
calls poured into the Governor's Office on Wednesday and almost 400
on Thursday after radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger
broadcast the number on her nationally syndicated show.
</P>
<P>
   Burns asked Napolitano on Thursday to seek an injunction to
block the abortion. She argued that taking the girl out of state
would violate a state law that forbids spending state funds on the
procedure unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Burns, R-Glendale, said that state funds are
being used to pay the costs of the abortion. The letter was
co-signed by nine GOP senators and two Democrats, including Senate
Minority Leader Jack Brown, D-St. Johns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to believe state monies are being used,
whether it's money for the abortion, transportation, or the
employees' salaries who will accompany her,'' Burns said. ``The
policy in this state has already been decided. It's our job to
enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano spokeswoman Pati Urias said the request was under
review.
</P>
<P>
   The statute also bans the use of federal funds on abortions,
although there is some question whether federal law would supersede
the state provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows the use of Medicaid dollars to pay for
abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the health of the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials have said the girl may have been raped. Because
she is 14, any sexual activity can be considered statutory rape,
which is covered by the federal exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police said Thursday that they will launch a criminal
investigation into the rape allegation. The Maricopa County
Attorney's Office on Wednesday told police the sexual assault may
have occurred in Glendale, said Officer Brian Wilkins, a Glendale
police spokesman. Police have not yet interviewed the girl. &QL;

INDIANS AND ORIOLES DISCUSS MAJOR TRADE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ohio)   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians and Baltimore Orioles are discussing a
trade that, if completed, would have repercussions for American
League playoff contenders. The Indians have been awarded waiver
claims on two Baltimore players, Scott Erickson, a pitcher, and
Harold Baines, a designated hitter, according to major league
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians and Orioles have until 1 p.m. Friday to work out a
trade for either or both of the players. If the two sides cannot
reach an agreement, the Orioles then would be expected to withdraw
Erickson and Baines from waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have dominated the AL Central this season, but with
the playoffs just over a month away, they are decimated by injuries
to players like the pitcher Jaret Wright, the infielder Travis
Fryman, the outfielder Wil Cordero and the catcher Sandy Alomar Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay, one of the Indians' most reliable pitchers, has
been placed on the 15-day disabled list, with Cleveland executives
saying publicly that he will recover in time for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But if Karsay's injury is more serious, then the Indians will be
starved for pitching in the playoffs. Erickson, who has a record of
10-10 with a 5.31 earned run average, is among the most dominant
pitchers in the league, though he seemingly allowed his problems
with Manager Ray Miller to affect his performance in the first half
of this season. He has pitched much better lately.
</P>
<P>
   Baines, who is hitting .326 with 24 home runs and 81 runs batted
in, is an established 40-year-old hitter who might bolster the
Indians' powerful lineup. The Orioles are believed to be seeking
the infielder Russell Branyan in return, as well as a minor league
pitching prospect; Baltimore might look to include catcher Charles
Johnson in the deal.  &QL;

RENO SAYS WACO DISCLOSURES DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 6th-8th grafs, bgng Reno said... No other
changes.)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that her
credibility has been damaged by new disclosures of the use of
``pyrotechnic'' tear gas canisters on the final day of the 1993
government standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Reno survived the political fallout of her first
major test in office, a fiery debacle at the Branch Davidian
compound after which about 80 people, including 25 children, were
found dead. Now, nearing the end of the Clinton administration, she
finds herself facing many of the same questions about the same
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and officials at the Justice Department and FBI, in
asserting that the government was not responsible for setting the
fire, have long denied that any tear gas canisters capable of
igniting a fire were ever used. But prompted by the disclosure this
week of government inventories listing weapons used in the assault,
FBI officials acknowledged on Wednesday that some pyrotechnic
canisters were used.
</P>
<P>
   The officials continue to maintain that the fire was set by the
cult members. They say that the pyrotechnic canisters were used six
hours before the fire started and had been aimed at a bunker 100
yards from the main building that was set ablaze. But Reno said she
was troubled by the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility,'' she said
Thursday at her weekly briefing with reporters. ``That's the reason
I am going to pursue it until I get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she had issued a policy against using incendiary
devices at the cult's Waco compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want those used,'' she said. ``I asked for and
received assurances that they were not incendiary.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``anybody that says they never make mistakes,
they never rely on information that proves to be inaccurate, I'd
like to meet them.``
</P>
<P>
   While the attorney general told reporters Thursday that she was
``upset'' and ``very, very frustrated'' about the latest
disclosures, some former officials who were involved in the 1993
internal reviews of the incident at Waco said they were not
surprised by the Justice Department's new difficulties, or that
questions linger over the destruction of the compound and the
deaths of the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, Reno and her aides undertook an examination
of Waco that was perfunctory and not critical, the former officials
said. The review assigned no blame for any mistakes by the
government and inexplicably contradicted major elements of the
attorney general's own account of what had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Thursday, some officials involved in the initial
investigation said the new information does not change their view
that David Koresh, the Branch Davidian leader, and his followers
set the fire. These investigators, including an independent arson
expert, said they believed the canisters were fired too far away
and too early to have caused the fatal fire.
</P>
<P>
   But some of these officials continued their broad criticisms of
the federal agents' decision to rush a compound where the
inhabitants were regarded as potentially unstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is six years later, and the government's position is
undercut by this fact, which when you get through with it may have
no impact whatsoever on the central question of who killed these
people,'' said Edwin Guthman, a former Justice Department official
in the Kennedy administration and Pulitzer-prize winning
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Guthman was one of three outside experts who produced a brutally
critical report for the Treasury Department of its role in the
botched Feb. 28, 1993, raid on the Davidians compound that led to
the 51-day standoff, describing mendacity and missteps before,
during and after the raid. One of the Treasury Department's
agencies, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, led the
initial raid on the Waco compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basic stuff,'' Guthman said. ``When you do these
things you've got to face up to it, be honest about it, and take
the consequences. But whatever the FBI did, they never faced up to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ruth, the former Watergate prosecutor who was another
outside expert involved in the Treasury review, said the latest
damage to the Justice Department's credibility was not surprising
in view of how it handled the Waco affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the time thought the Justice Department evaluation
was a whitewash in the sense that it didn't tell the full facts
about what was known,'' Ruth said. ``It clearly was written to
vindicate the attorney general, for some reason, who speaks well
for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this particular new information by itself bears
on the circumstances of the fire,'' he said. ``But what it clearly
shows is that the internal investigators didn't use the proper
types of investigatory techniques necessary to explore the facts.
That is completely unsurprising because the FBI over time has never
had the institutional ability to investigate itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday that 40 FBI agents, led by an FBI inspector,
would conduct the new inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth said it would be pointless for those agents to take a
new round of affidavits from those who were involved in the
incident and have already provided testimony to Congress and in the
resulting civil lawsuits. Instead, he recommended an inquiry by
agents from outside the FBI as the only way to produce a credible
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are 40 FBI agents doing interviews really going to restore the
attorney general's credibility?'' Ruth said. ``If they don't reopen
the whole thing now and actually use outside investigators, this
will be like the Kennedy assassination for the next 50 years. I
live in the West and the Midwest and this issue is keeping the
militia groups alive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jamar, the FBI special agent in charge at Waco, said
Thursday, ``The important thing that people have to understand is
that we weren't trying to hide anything.'' He said he did not
remember being asked about the incendiary devices and he thought
probably no one considered them important because they were fired
hours before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one dissent from the 1993 Justice review, by Dr.
Alan Stone, a professor at Harvard law and medical schools who was
one of the experts retained by the Justice Department. He concluded
that the FBI had helped drive cult members to mass suicide and then
misled officials in the review that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a different tack than the attorney general was the
treasury secretary at the time, Lloyd Bentsen, who ordered a more
vigorous review, prepared under the direction of Guthman, Ruth and
Willie Williams, the former Los Angeles police chief. That
ultimately led to a major shakeup at the Treasury's Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, including the removal of Stephen
Higgins as the agency's director and the suspension of five other
senior and lower-level officials. Because the Treasury report was
so thorough and critical, ATF has been able to put the incident
behind it, even though it resulted in the deaths of four ATF
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Reno won widespread praise for stepping forward after the
disaster at Waco and claiming ultimate responsibility for what had
occurred. It was early in the Clinton administration and the
president's advisers had persuaded President Clinton to avoid
making a public appearance concerning the matter, an effort to
reduce his accountability but, in the end, enhancing Reno's
stature.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice review was seen by many as a whitewash. Although
Clinton had promised a ``thorough and independent examination of
the affair,'' the main author of the Justice Department report,
Edward Dennis Jr., found no criticism of any Justice Department or
FBI officials was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find there is no place in the evaluation for blame and no
place for fault,'' he said at the time. He said ``mistakes were
made'' but did not identify who may have made them.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the Davidians had set the fire, based
on three things: an arson report analyzing the locations where the
blaze began; infrared pictures taken from an airplane when the fire
started that showed intense spots of heat erupting in different
spots in the compound at almost the same time, and the testimony of
some of the Davidians who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said in an interview Thursday that the report ``was not
intended to be a comprehensive, all-encompassing report.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said his report ``did not attempt to answer every
question that could be raised about'' Waco, but instead focused on
the questions of how the FBI negotiated with the Davidians, how the
fire was caused and how the attorney general made her decisions. He
concluded that Reno was adequately briefed by the FBI about the
issues she faced in ordering the tear-gas assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a case of the attorney general fiddling while
Rome burned,'' he said, adding that based on what has come out so
far, he remained comfortable with the report's conclusions,
particularly that the Davidians had started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tear gas used in the assault was liquid sprayed from
the barrels of tanklike vehicles. The use of at least two
pyrotechnic canisters became public in an inventory list of
equipment used in the raid that surfaced in a wrongful-death
lawsuit filed by survivors of the fire and family members of those
who died in the blaze, and which is scheduled to open in October.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI official said the inventory was an internal document
prepared shortly after the raid, and officials said Thursday that
it might not have surfaced earlier because investigators did not
attach significance to an incident that happened hours before the
fire at a different corner of the compound.

ABORTION CASE PITS PRIVACY AGAINST POLITICAL ADVOCACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 and CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A 14-year-old Arizona girl's personal agony over
abortion is quickly becoming a political cause celebre with
national overtones, prompting concerns that the girl's privacy is
being overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong,'' Sen. Sue Grace, R-north central Phoenix,
said Thursday after state and national political figures began
weighing in on the controversial case. ``It's a personal decision
between her and her guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad we're inserting ourselves into an individual's
health care decisions. If this were an individual who was going to
take her child out of state, would we get involved? Does this girl
have fewer rights than someone with parents?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy upon a tragedy upon a tragedy,'' said Eleanor
Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona Civil Liberties Union.
The girl's personal woes have been ``compounded by the violation of
her privacy rights, and the national spectacle being created,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull allowed the teenager, who is 24 weeks pregnant,
to go out of state for an abortion under a Maricopa County judge's
order. The teen's mother is dead, her father is in prison, and she
is in the care of a guardian. The girl was sent out of state
because abortions are not performed in Arizona after 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision prompted criticism from some legislative
Republicans, as well as from GOP presidential contender Steve
Forbes and U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The case thrusts Arizona back into the national abortion
spotlight only a year after a series of nightmarish incidents at a
Phoenix abortion clinic prompted headlines around the country. In
one case, a pregnant woman died on the abortion table. In another,
a doctor mistakenly delivered a full-term baby at the abortion
clinic, drawing rebukes from abortion foes.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also became a battleground on another front earlier this
month when New York's Center for Reproductive Law and Policy filed
a lawsuit challenging state restrictions on abortion funding for
poor women.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Forbes, an abortion opponent,
criticized the decision of Judge William Sargeant of Maricopa
County Superior Court to send the 14-year-old out of state, calling
it ``judicial activism run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes renewed his vow to appoint to the federal bench only
``judges who respect . . . the rights of parents and the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, meanwhile, called on state officials to challenge
Sargeant's ruling, calling it ``plainly wrong'' and a violation of
state law.
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, suggested
abortion opponents were making political hay with the issue before
all the facts are known. The case is supposed to be under seal, but
details have leaked out this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have a number of high-profile elected officials seizing
on this as a political football as opposed to looking at the
merits,'' Cummiskey said. ``Overall, none of us have been privy to
the case file or the facts of the case. We don't know what the
judge knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Miller, director of Arizona Right to Choose, blamed
lawmakers for ``trying to make this poor, unfortunate girl a poster
child for the next legislative session'' and more restrictive
abortion statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' Miller said of the debate, ``this is not
about a child. It is about a rabid anti-abortion agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, insisted
there is no abortion agenda for next year's legislative session.
She believes Sargeant dodged state law, prompting the political
efforts to block his order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing particularly difficult here is having an Arizona
judge recognize that nothing can be done under Arizona law, so he's
sending the child to another state,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, state law could be amended next year to keep the
law from being skirted.
</P>
<P>
   Burns acknowledged that, as the debate swirls, the girl ``does
end up being a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   The supercharged atmosphere is not new to Arizona. Republicans
were so divided over abortion in the mid-1990s that there was a
two-year moratorium on abortion bills. &QL;

EDITORIAL: SHORTCHANGING THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, August 27:
</P>
<P>
   In its zeal to hold federal expenditures down in order to
finance a tax cut, Congress seems to have forgotten its duty to
preserve a strong federal court system. As Chief Justice William
Rehnquist recently wrote to Congressional leaders, the amounts
provided for court operations in the House and Senate versions of
the judicial branch appropriations bill are inadequate to maintain
current services, much less cope with fast-rising federal
caseloads.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial branch had requested $4.1 billion for fiscal year
2000, a modest $300 million increase over current spending that was
designed to maintain the present level of court services. But the
Senate bill would provide $280 million less than that, an amount
that would force extensive staff cuts and furloughs, cutbacks in
court security and indigent defense services, and increased
litigation backlogs and delays.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, though an improvement, would still ``have a
noticeable adverse impact on court operations,'' Chief Justice
Rehnquist warns. It provides $100 million more than the Senate
measure, an amount probably sufficient to avoid staff furloughs,
but not enough to fill vacant positions, maintain adequate security
or avoid undue delays in hearing cases.
</P>
<P>
   For Congress to seriously harm court operations at a time of big
budget surpluses is irresponsible. If the budget ceilings Congress
has invented are too severe to adequately finance core government
functions, plainly those caps need to be rethought.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is still a chance for Congress to avoid
damage to the court system. A House-Senate conference committee
will convene after Labor Day to reconcile differences in the two
bills. The goal should be an affordable funding level that avoids
cutbacks and even allows for some needed improvements in court
operations, which account, after all, for only a tiny portion _
two-tenths of 1 percent _ of the federal budget. What the nation
cannot afford is an allocation that heedlessly compromises the
vitality and independence of the federal judiciary.

ERRORS FOUND IN TEST GIVEN TO WASHINGTON STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lowest score on a statewide writing test may go to the
people who graded the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state students in grades four, seven and 10 took the
standardized exams last spring in reading, math, listening and
writing. But when the writing tests were graded, an unusually high
number of students received a perfect score in one area.
</P>
<P>
   School officials this week acknowledged the writing test scores
were likely bogus and would have to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   They also promised to get to the bottom of the error and, if
needed, regrade all 450,000 essays.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake comes when Washington state is in the midst of a
massive overhaul of its education system, attempting to set
challenging _ and measurable _ standards for all students.
</P>
<P>
   While the error was unlikely to cause any practical problems in
state classrooms, some called it a potential psychological blow to
the state's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Frazer, spokesman for the state superintendent's
office, said the writing test was ``clearly a work in progress,''
and he didn't expect the grading problem to have a long-term
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to recognize that as you phase in a system
this comprehensive, there are likely to be adjustments to make
along the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scores in the other areas tested _ reading, math, and listening
_ were graded accurately and should be released next week , state
Superintendent of Public Instruction Terry Bergeson said in a
letter to school districts statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency and the company charged with scoring the tests
were still trying to figure out Thursday where the error occurred,
and had no immediate estimate how long it might take to fix.
</P>
<P>
   The corrected scores will be issued as soon as possible, both
agencies said, even if it means the essays written by an estimated
225,000 fourth, seventh, and 10th graders statewide need to be
re-graded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work around the clock to ensure the accurate scores
and information are delivered to the state of Washington,'' said
Maureen DiMarco, vice president of Riverside Publishing of Chicago,
which has a contract with the state to score the exams. The
Riverside subcontractor who scored the Washington tests, National
Computer Systems of Iowa City, did not return a phone call
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only error of its type that DiMarco knew of in the
history of Riverside, which develops and oversees scoring on such
tests for countless agencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Assessment of Student Learning has been mandatory
for Washington fourth-graders since the 1997-1998 school year. Many
seventh- and 10th-graders also took a pilot version of the test
last spring. It will become mandatory for them in the 2000-2001
school year.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and parents use the scores to see how students measure
up to tough new state standards, as well as pinpointing where their
performance needs to improve. The test is not meant to pit one
district against another, but to challenge each individual district
to raise its own scores and work toward meeting the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are an integral _ and high-stakes _ part of state
educational reforms that stress clear, measurable, and uniform
standards. The idea that the measurements themselves could be
flawed drew a mix of concern and resignation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Anciaux, parent involvement director for the Washington
State PTA, questioned whether the state had moved too fast in using
the test scores to gauge the performance of individual districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that gets people into bean counting, and when they
realize that there's going to be bean counting and there will be
rewards or consequences based on that bean counting, anything that
looks like an anomaly is going to cause people to be very upset
with that system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DiMarco of Riverside Publishing said that, in an odd way, the
discovery may raise public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we checked them and raised the flags there was a
potential anomaly there should reassure them that scores are
rigorously checked, the processes are rigorously checked,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent error turned up in the scores evaluating
``conventions'' such as grammar and punctuation, Frazer said.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually high number of students received a perfect score _
2 out of 2 possible points _ in that area, which could have
artificially inflated the number of students who met the overall
writing standards, state Superintendent Bergeson said in the letter
to districts.
</P>
<P>
   While Frazer would not release the actual figures, he said the
results indicated ``a significant enough increase for us to believe
that the numbers need to be scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was no surprise in the Everett school district, where
administrators had noticed an apparent ``mismatch'' between the
early state writing results and results from another standardized
exam, said Michael Power, executive director of curriculum and
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Power didn't see the flaw as cause for great concern. Although
accurate measurements will be ``absolutely critical'' in coming
years, he said, the state is still in a grace period of sorts when
it comes to the new exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any new assessment program, you're going to have bugs,'' he
said.

   LOS ANGELES -- Eight off-duty LAPD officers from the Devonshire
Division in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley brought smiles
Thursday to about 50 sick kids at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles as
they handed out teddy bears and offered encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scouts from Cadet Troop 1909 in Sherman Oaks and Studio
City, communities in the San Fernando Valley, joined the spirit of
giving by donating more than 1,000 books to the Mattel/UCLA
Children's Health Center's Reach Out and Read program and spending
time reading to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   And 14-year-old Jordan Justice of Agoura Hills, 30 miles
northwest of L.A., decided to give away most of his summer job
earnings from fixing computers _ $600 worth _ to the UCLA Child
Life/Child Development Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when, but I realized that I already have a lot,''
Jordan said, sitting with his mother. ``She buys me food and
everything. I don't pay any rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, Girl Scouts, a teen-ager, all caught the spirit
of giving _ which is so often and easily overlooked in an era
usually identified as greedy and selfish. It was an unusual
confluence of charitable giving that also included a donation
Thursday by Granada Hills residents to pay for computers at their
library.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Christopher Hall, fresh from two weeks in
intensive care in the Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases unit,
giggled with equal amounts of excitement and shyness as Officer
Christina Frus gave him a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do something like this, you just feel so great,''
said Sgt. Dan Mastro, 48, of Simi Valley, the 23-year Los Angeles
Police Department veteran who organized the visit with the help of
Councilman Hal Bernson's office, which donated the bears. ``It's
doing something for someone else, thinking about what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ with Ronald McDonald _ visited patients ranging
in age from 1 to 19, all of whom were suffering from diseases
including leukemia and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real humbling experience,'' said Mastro.
</P>
<P>
   For 14-year-old Jordan, the decision to donate to a hospital was
easy _ he said he wants to be a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   In return for his generosity, the Department of Pediatrics at
Mattel Children's Hospital at the University of California, Los
Angeles, will give the teen-ager a tour so he can meet the children
who will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Child Life/Child Development Services Director Cathy
Robinson-Learn said she's never seen anything like this donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there are children who donate things like their old
toys, but someone with the intention of working with the children
to make a special donation like this, that's pretty unique,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to buy toys for children in the Child
Development Program who are subjected to long stays at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For members of Girl Scout Cadet Troop 1909, their charity
brought the reward of smiles _ on their faces and those of the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts donated books and read to children in the Mattel/UCLA
Children's Health Center's Reach Out and Read program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really felt proud of ourselves,'' said Girl Scout Hayley
Watarz, 14, of Van Nuys. Doing for others helps restore trust in
the community they live in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got a sense of what it's like to give back,''
said troop leader Carolyn Castelli. ``It felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friends of the Granada Hills Library can feel proud, too.
Years of hard work paid off Thursday as members were able to give
the city $63,000 for a ``virtual library'' installed a year ago on
the promise they could raise the money to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, $53,100, came from a community-improvement
trust fund set up by the owners of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill as
part of a 1994 legal settlement with the city and county of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $10,000 was raised from used book sales, said
Friends President Evelyn Stanfield. The group has donated more than
$300,000 to the library over the past two decades.

CSUN GOES BACK TO BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A defensive back from Westlake High might start
Cal State Northridge's football season opener against Western
Oregon next week, but it won't be Jeremy Golden.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, a junior who led CSUN in tackles last season, is
academically ineligible and facing knee surgery to repair a torn
ligament. Travis Campbell, a freshman from Westlake who was one of
the Matadors' top recruits, is a backup at free safety behind
Hassan Abdul-Malik, who hasn't practiced since straining his
hamstring on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   If Abdul-Malik isn't ready for Western Oregon, CSUN will start
Campbell, Rahman Sparks or Cory Oggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I wanted to come here was because I wanted
to play as soon as I could,'' said Campbell, who is 6-foot-1 and
180 pounds. ``Half the guys who go to UCLA don't even get
(repetitions) for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, considered the top defensive back in the Marmonte
League the last two years, visited UCLA and Michigan on recruiting
trips in January. But he got the sense during those visits that he
was no longer considered an upper-echelon player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was basically a `backup' recruit,'' he said. ``Schools like
Michigan and UCLA, I wanted to go there. At Northridge, the coaches
wanted me. A lot of my friends and family wanted me to go to
UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell had 18 interceptions at Westlake, including six last
year, even as he played through a painful shoulder injury. He
hasn't been close to dominating since practice for the freshmen and
newcomers began Aug. 11, but Campbell has rarely been embarrassed,
either.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's secondary was shredded in a seven-on-seven drill Thursday
morning; the quarterbacks completed 19 of 22 passes to the
receivers. That was without Abdul-Malik and starting cornerback Mel
Miller, who was completing an independent study course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I think we're going to have a great secondary,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   __ There's a reason: Interim head coach Jeff Kearin isn't happy
with the players' performances over the past few days, but he's not
panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the dog days of camp,'' Kearin said. ``Fatigue is
starting to get the best of us.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN closes fall camp Saturday. The heat wave of the past week,
sending the temperatures above 90 degrees for morning practice,
seems to have taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin is more alarmed by the lack of healthy offensive linemen.
Starting center Julio Alcala is out indefinitely with a sore
Achilles' tendon. Geoff Watson, a backup at right tackle, has a bad
shoulder. Javier Ortiz, Alcala's backup, hasn't practiced for two
days because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcon Madjid, a freshman from L.A. Baptist, has a bad hip and
has been out all camp. Another freshman, Isaac Aronson, broke his
right hand early in camp and hasn't been able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither Madjid or Aronson are higher than third on the
depth chart, their absence has meant the other offensive linemen
have had to play more than usual in team scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely worried,'' Kearin said. ``We're not in great
shape there, simply because of guys being out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hurt offensive lineman is Ernie Fierro, a backup at
right guard. Fierro dislocated the ring finger on his left hand in
Wednesday night's scrimmage and had X-rays taken Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   __ Making progress: Backup linebacker Isaac Gardner, who
separated his right shoulder last Saturday, is supposed to be out
two to three weeks.

RARE ART BOOKS DESTROYED BY RAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It never occurred to T. Peter Kraus, the owner of
Ursus Books, that Thursday's torrential downpour would touch the
vast collection of rare art books stored at the rear of his shop in
SoHo. That's because the shop and its 100,000 or so volumes are on
the third floor of a building at 375 West Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But a clogged gutter on the roof and a few hours of heavy rain
were all it took to destroy thousands of books that Kraus and his
wife, Evelyn, had spent three decades collecting. Early Thursday
morning, sheets of water poured through the top two floors of the
five-story loft building, soaking several aisles of books about
artists like Goya, Delacroix, Pissaro and Toulouse-Lautrec, many of
them with original lithographs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the couple arrived at the store at 10 a.m., the
water had receded, leaving behind piles of bloated and water-logged
paper. ``It was a horrendous sight,'' Mrs. Kraus said. ``If you
love books, it's like seeing a lot of dead bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of the items were one of a kind, most were extremely
rare, Kraus said, particularly a 30-volume set by the French editor
Loys Delteil that catalogs 19th-century prints. The Krauses, who
run a second shop inside the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side,
also collect illustrated manuscripts and rare prints from medieval
times to the 20th century, but those were not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus estimated Thursday's loss at several hundred thousand
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although everything was insured, Kraus, 54, said the loss was
not a matter of money. ``You can't easily replace these books,'' he
said in an interview Thursday night after spending the day sorting
through the debris. ``They were things gathered from the four
corners of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next few days, he and his staff will sort through the
books to see what can be saved. In some cases, he said, a book can
be salvaged by tearing off its front and back covers and rebinding
the pages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and his wife said they were trying to put the loss in
perspective. ``The world is full of books,'' he said. ``My wife
keeps reminding me of the poor people in Turkey, and that there are
always people worse off than yourself.''

RICHARD BUTLER SPAWNS RACISM FROM HIS IDAHO COMPOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho _ At 81, Richard Girnt Butler knows he's in
his twilight days. He hopes the rest of the world is too.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years, Butler has preached about ``the great race war''
from his swastika- and crucifix-adorned pulpit here in the Selkirk
Mountain foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching the end-time period. I'd like to see the
final conclusion, but that's up to my Father,'' says Butler,
tromping across the United Nations and Israeli flags he uses as
doormats at the entrance to his chapel.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of creating a ``white homeland,'' the founder of
the Aryan Nations and the Church of Jesus Christ, Christian, Butler
has made the Northwest infamous as a spawning-ground for racism.
</P>
<P>
   Buford R. Furrow Jr., a former Aryan Nations security guard
charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five
in an attack on a Jewish day-care center, is the latest Butler
disciple to make news for racist violence.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Catholic priest sodomizes an altar boy _ and they've had
a whole string of them _ do you blame the church for it? The
pope?'' he asked in an interview at his office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While offering a safehouse for neo-Nazi pilgrims, Butler's
20-acre compound has also fostered disciples who engaged in murder,
robbery and racial assaults.
</P>
<P>
   According to civil rights groups, those with ties to Butler
include:
</P>
<P>
   _Members of The Order, who robbed armored cars and assassinated
Denver radio host Alan Berg in the 1980s;
</P>
<P>
   _Colville native Chevie Kehoe, convicted recently on homicide
charges;
</P>
<P>
   _Mark Thomas, Butler's former Pennsylvania state leader, who
robbed banks to fund a white revolution;
</P>
<P>
   _Nathan Thill, a skinhead and former Butler organizer in Denver,
who last November confessed to killing a man because the victim had
black skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over what people do,'' Butler says. ``I
don't espouse violence at all, but it happens. I'm not violent, but
I failed Hypocrisy 101 in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Furrow's alleged day-care assault, he says, ``I don't
favor hurting children, but I can't get worked up about the
wounding of some of my enemies, even though they're children.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, he changes the subject. ``I do get worked up about
white girls being assaulted and raped'' in violent crimes by
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups that have fought Butler over the decades now
wonder about the future of his organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center is suing Butler, hoping to
bankrupt him in a lawsuit for unspecified civil damages filed in
Coeur d'Alene in January.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed on behalf of Victoria Keenan, a Seattle
woman, and her son, Jason, who were shot at near the compound in
July 1998 by Aryan Nations security guards.
</P>
<P>
   In police reports, Keenan said the guards mistook her car's
backfire for gunfire after she stopped on the roadway and restarted
the car. The guards, according to police reports, barreled out of
the compound after her in a pickup truck, chased her two miles down
the road and shot at her car with assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Kootenai County sheriff's deputies documented bullet holes in
her car. Butler's security chief, Edward ``Jesse'' Warfield,
pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced in May to as many as
five years in prison. Two other guards remain fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok of the SPLC said the group is refraining from
comments about Butler pending a trial. In the past, the SPLC has
said Butler and his group did more to foment modern racism
nationwide, and to tarnish the Northwest in the process, than any
other neo-Nazi group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews and I are at war,'' Butler says. And he believes the
lawsuit is part of that war.
</P>
<P>
   The SPLC, headed by Morris Dees in Alabama, is known for having
used civil law to break the back of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harassment. The sole purpose is to bankrupt me,''
complains Butler, who says a less well-financed Aryan Nations legal
defense fund has been set up for him. ``I've had to spend $55,000
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Keenan, Butler would say only that ``allegedly, she
was shooting at our sign out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler bought the land off Rimrock Road about 10 miles north of
Coeur d'Alene for his compound back in 1972, when he was in
California working for Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   The road winds over hills, past horse farms, fields of fresh-cut
alfalfa and creeks where kids fish, a sea of tranquility
interrupted by the jarring red, white and blue Aryan Nations sign
at the foot of Butler's property.
</P>
<P>
   Passing beneath the two flags at the entrance, one the
Confederate stars and bars, the other a 13-star U.S. flag, the
driveway climbs past a meadow of flowers until it rounds a corner,
where a ``whites only'' sign precedes an empty guardhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds resemble any of the other small retirement ranches
nearby, except for the big brown stage in the middle of the
compound, and a big Nazi swastika on a corrugated roof.
</P>
<P>
   In Butler's Aryan heyday, the compound was a popular mecca for
racist sympathizers from around the world who assailed whole groups
of people, seeking to unify neo-Nazi forces.
</P>
<P>
   A ``who's who of the hate movement'' visited the place over the
years, including William Pierce, author of a book about a race war
called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City
bomber Timothy McVeigh; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam; and
Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance, who lost his house and
possessions to a SPLC lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, only seven or eight people were living on or
visiting the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Butler holds court at his desk, piled with papers, in a small
office next to the church. Gifts and framed documents hang on his
office walls, including several pictures of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his desk, his 5-year-old purebred German shepherd,
Fritz, instinctively growls at strangers. Fritz follows Butler
everywhere, sometimes joining another German shepherd, Eva, roaming
the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of a sharp-featured Hitler peers across the doorway at
a softer, glowing rendition of a Jesus with European features.
There are lots of swastikas, one made by a follower in prison from
folded Camel cigarette filters; another crocheted, and another made
of folded chewing-gum wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite gifts is a line of carved ``little
Klansmen.'' Behind his chair, above a whip sent by an admirer and a
Nazi helmet, is a tot's drawing, orange silhouettes of a Klansman
pasted on yellow paper, with blue crayon scribbling.
</P>
<P>
   It was made by the daughter of Christian, his receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even teach her that,'' Christian says proudly, ``she
just did it. It was pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his idol Hitler, Butler likes kids. A school once operated
on the property but no more, though kids sometimes attend church
with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Race is a religion with Butler. The 150-year-old ideology known
as Christian Identity, which has the hallmarks of a conspiracy
theory through which he believes that he and others of white
northern European descent are the true Israelites tricked out of
their birthright by Jews, and forced to live with other races.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can understand the message of his race-based
Christian Identity religion, Butler says. White people are like
radio receivers in their ability to hear the message, says Butler.
``Jesus said let those who have ears hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Butler's more startling hypotheses: Whites, not American
Indians, were the first in the Americas. And Albert Einstein was
brilliant only because he was taught by Germans.
</P>
<P>
   He dislikes televangelists and spits out the word
``Judeo-Christian'' to describe the followers of mainstream
Christian faiths. Even followers of the World Wide Church of the
Creator, white separatists, are heretics in that they have compiled
their own Bible instead of relying on the original, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How would Butler explain his reverence for Hitler and the
swastika to those thousands of World War II veterans lying in
Normandy graveyards, who died fighting what those symbols stood
for?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of World War II soldiers now realize the war was a war
against the white race and the white race lost,'' Butler asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, born in Bennett, Colo., on Feb. 23, 1918, is proud of
his own German extraction, and says the war should never have been
fought on the European theater.
</P>
<P>
   A profile of Butler by the SPLC says his father, Clarence, a
German-English machinist, did not hide his dislike for Jews or
communists from his son. When the family moved to East Los Angeles
after the Depression, Butler studied aeronautical engineering and
science at a city college. He then got a part-time job at 25 cents
an hour at an aircraft company that sent him to Bangalore, India,
to overhaul planes for the Royal Indian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and his wife, Betty, who died in December 1995, were
married in 1941. During the war, Butler said he enlisted in the
Army Air Corps and taught aircraft hydraulics to mechnics in the
China-Burma theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he never agreed with fighting Germany, and was
invigorated by newsreels of marching Germans. His racial activism,
he said, began after returning from the war when ``things just
didn't seem right'' and he became an admirer of Sen. Joe McCarthy's
movement about communism.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's activism was galvanized during a signature campaign to
expose communist teachers, when he met William Potter Gale, a
retired Army colonel who had served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's
staff, who introduced Butler to Christian Identity. Butler also met
George Lincoln Rockwell, a former Navy pilot who founded the
American Nazi Party.
</P>
<P>
   Through Gale, Butler said he met and studied under ``my
mentor,'' Dr. Wesley Swift, pastor of the Anglo-Saxon Christian
Congregation in Lancaster, Calif., whose Christian Identity
preaches that Eve mated with the devil, begetting Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Now Butler is preparing to pass the torch, but not in the
heavily mentored fashion in which he was ordained. Butler last year
appointed an heir apparent, Newman Britton, a longtime Aryan
follower from Escondido, Calif., and the latest in a string of
annointed successors who faded away over the years in philosophical
differences.
</P>
<P>
   His compound could disappear even without the lawsuit. In
January, one of Butler's two daughters, who don't share his
neo-Nazi or white supremacist beliefs, said she and her husband
would sell the 19-acre site, worth about $200,000, upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   When he bought the compound in 1972, Butler hoped it would be
the genesis of a white homeland, something his Christian Identity
beliefs claim white people have been denied. Even if the compound
doesn't survive, he's confident in his racist religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all pre-ordained. There's no way you can jump off of a
cliff and not proceed to the judgment that you will hit the ground.
You can't stop halfway.''

DRUG FIRM MAKES OFFER TO SETTLE NORPLANT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 4th and 10th through 12th grafs.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years of litigation, American Home Products Corp.
said Thursday that it had agreed to pay cash settlements to about
36,000 women who contended they were not adequately warned about
the possible side effects of the company's Norplant contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, American Home Products is
expected to pay out at least $50 million, according to Turner
Branch, one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs. Women who
choose to settle their lawsuits will receive $1,500 each, far from
the jackpot attorneys had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total disappointment,'' Branch said. ``But we didn't
get good results in jury trials in South Texas. I'm definitely not
jumping with excitement, but the settlement is voluntary. The women
can take it or not take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to the approval of the presiding Judge
Richard Schell of the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont division.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of any kind marked a strong reversal of strategy
for American Home Products and its subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, which still sells Norplant. The device, six silicone
capsules injected into a patient's arm, can prevent pregnancy for
up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Women who used the contraceptive had long complained that
Norplant's label did not adequately warn about severe side effects
like excessive menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea, dizziness,
mood swings and depression.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products had vehemently denied these contentions,
arguing that the side effects associated with Norplant were clearly
described on in its label. The company had been successful in its
defense of the contraceptive, winning three jury verdicts and 20
summary judgments and having 14,000 claims dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Norplant went on the market in 1991, it was hailed as a
``dream contraceptive,'' a breakthrough for women who could have a
simple, 10-minute insertion procedure and then not worry about
getting pregnant for five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug soon became the subject of controversy and
complaints. Many women said they had not been warned of the
severity of side effects caused by the changes Norplant made in
their hormone levels. And some women said the silicone used in the
Norplant inserts had caused scarring and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Some public health groups and women's advocates worried that the
contraceptive could become an instrument of social control, forced
on poor women and others whose fertility was seen as more of a
threat to society than a blessing. For unlike other contraceptive
methods, the presence of Norplant could easily be monitored by a
parole officer or welfare official.
</P>
<P>
   The question of social control of fertility was underscored by a
1991 decision by a judge in Visalia, Calif., to require a woman
convicted of child abuse to use Norplant as a condition of parole.
An appeals court later ruled the case moot when the young woman
violated her parole by using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of women also had health complaints. Some said they
had not been warned of the severity of side effects caused by the
changes Norplant made in their hormone levels. And some women said
the silicone used in Norplant inserts had caused scarring and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy surrounding Norplant, American Home
Products said Thursday that it had been used by more than 1 million
women in the United States and by nearly 5 million women worldwide.
According to the Associated Press, annual U.S. sales peaked in 1992
at $120.7 million but slid to $4.4 million through November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that American Home Products had offered
to settle the Norplant claims to improve its image and allow the
company to focus on its troubled operations. Over the last two
years, American Home Products has withdrawn three products from the
market, including the diet treatment fen-phen, and experienced
steep sales declines in its agricultural division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settling these cases was purely a business decision,'' Joseph
Mahady, Wyeth-Ayerst's president for North America, said Thursday
in a statement. ``Our legal success has come at a steep price
because lawsuits are time- consuming, expensive and have a chilling
effect on research.''
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has been no stranger to litigation. Its
liabilities over claims that fen-phen caused heart-valve damage
could exceed $3 billion. While analysts have been concerned over
those liabilities, many were relieved over the likely amount of the
Norplant settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American Home Products pays only $50 million to $75
million, that is a low sum,'' said Sergio Traversa, a
pharmaceuticals analyst with Mehta Partners, a research company in
New York. ``But for consumers to collect millions of dollars, they
have to prove permanent damages. Most of the side effects the
Norplant users complained about went away once they had it
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who filed lawsuits about Norplant before March 1 can
participate in the settlement, according to Audrey Ashby, a
spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst. She added that women who had filed
unrelated Norplant claims could also take part in the settlement,
if they wanted to drop their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Branch said that claimants should contact Wyeth-Ayerst in
Philadelphia to receive claim forms, which must be submitted in the
next four months.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., has come to be
regarded as one of the pharmaceutical industry's financial
laggards. With earnings last year of $2.47 billion, the company can
certainly afford to pay for the Norplant settlement, but its
performance has trailed many of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at most large pharmaceutical companies are expected to
swell 12 percent or more this year. American Home Products'
earnings will most likely decline, giving it one of the industry's
worst performances. Shares of American Home Products fell $1.8125
Thursday, or 3.8 percent, to $46.

EDITORIAL: RED FACES AT THE FBI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday August 27:
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation now concedes that it used
``pyrotechnic'' tear-gas canisters capable of setting the
disastrous fire that ended a standoff with the Branch Davidian cult
near Waco, Tex., in 1993. About 80 people were found dead after the
fire. The bureau insists that the canisters played no role in the
fire, which they say was set by the cultists themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation that the devices were used at all contradicts
six years of unqualified denials to Congress and the public by
Attorney General Janet Reno and other senior officials, adding an
embarrassing new element to one of the saddest chapters in FBI
history.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno, who admitted Thursday that her credibility had been
damaged, has ordered another inquiry into the events of April 19,
1993. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, is also talking about
reopening his Congressional investigation. These inquiries must be
thorough and speedy. Some Americans are still eager to believe that
the FBI deliberately murdered the cultists. Unanswered questions
can only reinforce these beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, officials have insisted that the FBI used
conventional, non-combustible tear gas to try to end the siege of
the cult's compound. Ten days after the incident, Ms. Reno told the
House Judiciary Committee that ``I wanted and received assurances
that the gas and its means of use were not pyrotechnic.'' As
recently as July 29, when asked about a continuing investigation
into the fire by the Texas Rangers, she reasserted her belief that
no incendiary devices had been used.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's about-face was apparently prompted by documents
produced in various civil lawsuits and by an interview earlier this
week in The Dallas Morning News with Danny Coulson, a former FBI
agent in Texas. Coulson said that two pyrotechnic grenades had been
used. Texas law enforcement officials backed up his recollections,
asserting that the Texas Rangers' investigation had also found
evidence that incendiary devices had been deployed. After a fast
review of its own internal documents, the FBI recanted six years'
worth of denials _ insisting, however, that the canisters had been
fired not at the wooden building where the cult members were
gathered, but at a nearby concrete bunker, where they caused no
damage.
</P>
<P>
   But even if that is true, questions remain. If Ms. Reno knew
that such devices had been used, why did she not tell Congress? If
she did not know, why did the FBI withhold the evidence from her?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the devices may have played no role in the fire is
beside the point. The point is that the FBI and the Justice
Department now look at best sloppy and at worst untruthful. That in
turn gladdens the hearts of conspiracy theorists everywhere.

SO FAR IN TALKS, NO PROPOSAL FOR LONGER WORK WEEK FROM BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Negotiators from The Boeing Co. spent Thursday in
intense negotiations on a new contract for 44,000 Machinists, but
so far the company hasn't offered one of its most controversial
ideas: a plan to create an alternative work schedule, according to
Boeing representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the contract talks, Boeing stressed
the need to stretch the workweek to seven days and 24 hours a day
in some parts of the company. The union almost immediately rejected
the idea, rallying its members around the cry: ``Seven day, no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing representatives have said the company needs to
explore the idea in order to streamline the production of
airplanes. Company representatives declined to comment last night
and could offer the idea Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our final positions will be explicitly detailed in the
best and final contract proposal when it is presented to the union
tomorrow,'' said Peter Conte, a spokesman for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   That offer will come Friday and will set off a process that
could either result in a strike that would cripple Boeing
production lines or a new contract that would resolve the company's
biggest labor headache for several years.
</P>
<P>
   If the company decides to back away from its proposal to stretch
the workweek, it could collect some support for its overall offer,
although perhaps not enough to secure its ratification, according
to John Scofield, who works at Boeing's Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably convince a lot of people not to strike,''
Scofield said.
</P>
<P>
   Scofield and other Machinists say they are ready to walk off the
job. They're angry over what they describe as Boeing's hardline
position in the talks so far.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have said they are not hopeful the two sides can
avoid a strike. Machinists are scheduled to vote on the company's
offer Sept. 1.

DAVID GRAHAM, 87, IS DEAD; ANTI-WAR DEBATER AT OXFORD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England)  (rk) 
 By   ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Graham, who as an Oxford undergraduate in 1933 played a
key role in the student debating society's much-denounced and
long-remembered vote against fighting for ``King and Country,''
died on Aug. 12. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Graham, who worked later for the British
Broadcasting Corp., was reported in Thursday's Daily Telegraph and
Wednesday's Times of London. Where he died and where he resided at
the time of his death were not immediately disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   He was the librarian of the debating society, the prestigious
Oxford Union. He drafted and seconded a motion affirming ``that
this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and
Country.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion was passed by a vote of 275-173 on Feb. 9, 1933 _
soon after Hitler came to power in Germany on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   As a University of Chicago historian, Charles Loch Mowat, wrote
two decades later: ``The resolution received worldwide notice out
of all proportion to its importance, as a sign of Britain's
pacifism and decadence which was an an encouragement to dictators
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   And a University of Toronto historian, T.O. Lloyd, observed
tolerantly in a 1970 book: `There was probably a considerable
amount of pacifist feeling behind this vote, for opposition to all
war was still strong'' in the wake of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the motion, The Manchester Guardian argued
similarly that ``the obvious meaning of this resolution'' was
``youth's deep disgust with the way in which past wars `For King
and Country' have been made, and in which they suspect, future wars
may be made: disgust at the national hypocrisy which can fling over
the timidities and follies of politicans, over base greeds and
commercial jealousies and jobbery, the cloak of an emotional symbol
they do not deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Britain of 1933, the motion also created fury and
indignation, notably on the Oxford campus, elsewhere in the press
and in parliament. A swarm of irate Oxford undergraduates stormed
into the Union and ripped the minutes of the ``King and Country''
debate _ which had included some spirited opposition eloquence _
out of the Union's minutes-book. But Graham managed to write the
``King and Country'' minutes all over again, drawing on his memory.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, The Daily Express thundered at the time: ``There
is no question but that the woozy-minded Communists, the practical
jokers, and the sexual indeterminates of Oxford have scored a great
success in the publicity that has followed their victory at the
Oxford Union.'' The Daily Telegraph of that day called on
``decently minded young Oxford'' to nullify the motion. The Times
of London said back then that the motion was the work of ``a little
clique of cranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, an Oxford-educated author, Keith Briant,
said in a 1938 book about his alma mater: ``Thanks to the publicity
which the press gave to this motion, it was remembered and used for
propaganda purposes in Italy at the time of the Abyssinian War. A
leading Italian newspaper bolstered the courage of its readers by
declaring that they need have no fear of British action as their
young men had refused to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was happening in Oxford?'' Briant went on. ``What was
causing young men to express such violent disgust with their own
country and its government? Oxford was not alone in its attitude,
although it may have given it earlier expression. All over the
country young men and women were growing restless at the failure of
the generation which was responsible for the death of their
fathers, to cope with the vital problems of the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday's Daily Telegraph, in its obituary of Graham, said:
``Contrary to what many in Britain believed, there has never been a
shred of evidence that Hitler was encouraged by the `King and
Country' motion, or even that he knew about it. He was most
certainly aware, however, of the British Establishment's lack of
appetite for facing up to his regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Telegraph also defended Graham as ``no pacifist but
an independent spirit fond of controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Times of London recalled: ``He also admitted to being
fed up with all the `Rupert Brookery.''' That was a reference to
the patriotic British World War I poet, Rupert Brooke (1887-1915).
``And the motion reflected a reaction to the first World War, in
which so many had suffered for their `King and Country.'''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was born in British India, the son of Sir Lancelot
Graham, a senior civil servant who was the first governor of Sind
province. David Graham wnet on to Britain, where he had aunts, and
to graduate from the British public school Rugby, where he was a
student leader. Then he spent time in Germany becoming fluent in
German.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after graduating from Oxford _ where he was in Balliol
College and tried in vain to become the union's president _ he
joined the BBC's staff, where his first assignments included
writing a radio adaption of Tolstoy's novel ``War and Peace.'' In
August 1939, the month before Hitler's Germany touched off World
War II in Europe by invading Poland, the BBC assigned him to its
German section. He was involved in its German-language broadcasts
to Germany and to German-occupied France all through the war.
</P>
<P>
   And it is said that a substantial number of his fellow Oxford
students who had voted in favor of the ``King and Country'' motion
went on, nonetheless, to fight for King and Country and against the
Axis powers in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, during the Cold War, Graham was an executive of
the BBC's Russian-language programming and later deputy chief of
the BBC's whole East European Service. His last post before he
retired from the BBC was chief of its Central Research Unit.
</P>
<P>
   In later years he was active in the Church of England and in the
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   He married Rosemary Harris in 1945 and she died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include a daughter and two sons..

BILL WOULD REQUIRE STATE TO INSPECT THEME PARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICIA FARRELL AIDEM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Theme parks such as Magic Mountain, located 25
miles north of Los Angeles in Santa Clarita, are the nation's most
elaborate playgrounds, drawing millions of thrill-seekers with
their white-knuckle rides, stomach-churning drops and high-speed
loops through twists of metal.
</P>
<P>
   But California's theme parks _ spotlighted this week by three
freak accidents _ are not subjected to any state oversight. In
fact, only rides at traveling carnivals undergo regular state
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very ironic contrast,'' state Assemblyman Tom
Torlakson, D-Martinez, said Thursday. ``We inspect elevators, we
inspect ski lifts, we inspect portable rides. Why not the big theme
parks?''
</P>
<P>
   Torlakson has sponsored a bill, scheduled for a Senate vote next
week, that would mandate regular state inspections and certified
training programs at California's theme parks. Florida and 32 other
states already have such programs in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to these parks for a thrill and escape,'' said
Torlakson. ``Yet they want in the back of their minds to know
they're going to be totally safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags California in Santa Clarita and Los Angeles' Universal
Studios already are subject to regular inspections by the Los
Angeles County Division of Building and Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would support any legislation designed to make sure things
are running as safely as possible,'' said Bonnie Rabjohn,
spokeswoman for Six Flags California's Magic Mountain. ``But it
needs to be said we wouldn't be in business if we weren't so
self-regulating when it came to safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, like the balance of
amusement parks statewide, undergo no such public oversight because
state law leaves the issue to local governments, and Orange County,
where they are located, has no inspection program in place.
</P>
<P>
   Torlakson said there's no question that regulations would make a
difference. But a similar bill he introduced last year was killed
in committee amid opposition from the amusement park industry.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, he is working with park officials, and has
garnered the support of Six Flags and Knott's Berry Farm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In seeking support, he cites a spate of amusement park
tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, a tourist was fatally injured at Disneyland
when a piece of metal tore loose from the Columbia sailing ship and
hit three people on the dock. The Disneyland incident was blamed on
poor training of the ride operator, something that would be
remedied with a certified training program, Torlakson said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend, in Northern California, 12-year-old Joshua
Smuphat plunged to his death from a ``free fall'' ride at
Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara. The cause is being
investigated as officials sift through contradictory witness
statements and fragmented recollections of those terrifying
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing this loud and clear from parents, from children's
advocates,'' Torlakson said. ``They're amazed that nobody is
looking over the shoulder (of) the industry. Nobody from the
outside is investigating accidents. There's no state inspector to
come in where Josh died, just the local police and that's just to
determine if there was a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   It was June 1997 when the issue of amusement park safety hit
home for Torlakson. A 17-year-old high school senior died at
Concord's Waterworld USA when a water slide collapsed. The girl,
and 24 teens who rushed onto the slide in hopes of breaking a
school record, were at fault, officials ruled. But that doesn't
mean the incident couldn't have been avoided, Torlakson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew the kids were coming, why didn't they have more
lifeguards?'' he said. ``They knew there was a record to break for
how many kids got on the slide. Why didn't they have turnstiles to
control the lines?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is saying the parks are inherently dangerous. Indeed,
only one in 7 million theme park ride passengers is injured to the
point of requiring hospitalization each year; one in 250 million
dies, according to the International Association of Amusement Parks
and Attractions.
</P>
<P>
   And 75 percent of those amusement park injuries are caused by
the riders themselves, Torlakson acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   What they are saying is that rides _ which each season become
more high-tech _ should be checked by an outside pair of eyes and
that the operators should have extensive training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that anyone would question that,'' said Tim
O'Brien, an editor at Amusement Business, a trade publication based
in Nashville, Tenn. (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: based in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not to say that I don't believe any of the rides at
any of these parks isn't safe. There's not a roller coaster at any
of these parks that have been involved that I would not go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond inspections, backers of mandated state oversight want
more extensive training for workers who operate fast-moving,
computer-driven rides that carry millions through loops,
gravity-defying curves and free falls.
</P>
<P>
   At Magic Mountain, ride operators undergo behind-the-scenes and
on-the-job training, then start first on the smaller rides before
taking on the more sophisticated ones, Rabjohn said.
</P>
<P>
   And before the park opens each day, every ride undergoes more
than 100 man-hours of inspections by teams of electricians,
carpenters, mechanics and engineers, Rabjohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, theme park insiders are baffled by this
week's spate of amusement park tragedies _ the 12-year-old's death
in Santa Clara on Sunday; the death the next day of a roller
coaster rider in Virginia; five injuries Monday at Knott's when a
plank fell from the all-wooden Ghost Rider roller coaster; and
Wednesday's terrifying ride, where 28 were left hanging for up to
four hours on the Boomerang roller coaster at Six Flags Marine
World in Vallejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole industry is kind of shaking its head in
wonderment and asking why,'' O'Brien said. ``I've been covering the
industry for 15 years; I've never seen anything like this. It's got
to be a coincidence. You can't point your finger to any one thing.
They're different rides, different parks, different manufacturers.
It's just a collection of very heartbreaking coincidences.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien called the maintenance and safety programs at larger
parks including Six Flags, Premier and Paramount ``impeccable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover the good with the bad, so I'm as objective as
anyone,'' he said. ``I find it mind-boggling for these tragedies to
happen with all the money and effort spent on safety.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he sees the recent accidents as coincidental, O'Brien
notes that attendance at amusement parks nationwide is highest in
the summer, and has been healthy all year thanks to a strong
economy and a year of relatively mild weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year rides are going 100 percent,'' he said.

CORRECTS SLUG LINE, BYLINE  
 SO FAR IN TALKS, NO PROPOSAL FOR LONGER WORK WEEK FROM BOEING

   SEATTLE _ Negotiators from The Boeing Co. spent Thursday in
intense negotiations on a new contract for 44,000 Machinists, but
so far the company hasn't offered one of its most controversial
ideas: a plan to create an alternative work schedule, according to
Boeing representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the contract talks, Boeing stressed
the need to stretch the workweek to seven days and 24 hours a day
in some parts of the company. The union almost immediately rejected
the idea, rallying its members around the cry: ``Seven day, no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing representatives have said the company needs to
explore the idea in order to streamline the production of
airplanes. Company representatives declined to comment last night
and could offer the idea Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our final positions will be explicitly detailed in the
best and final contract proposal when it is presented to the union
tomorrow,'' said Peter Conte, a spokesman for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   That offer will come Friday and will set off a process that
could either result in a strike that would cripple Boeing
production lines or a new contract that would resolve the company's
biggest labor headache for several years.
</P>
<P>
   If the company decides to back away from its proposal to stretch
the workweek, it could collect some support for its overall offer,
although perhaps not enough to secure its ratification, according
to John Scofield, who works at Boeing's Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably convince a lot of people not to strike,''
Scofield said.
</P>
<P>
   Scofield and other Machinists say they are ready to walk off the
job. They're angry over what they describe as Boeing's hardline
position in the talks so far.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have said they are not hopeful the two sides can
avoid a strike. Machinists are scheduled to vote on the company's
offer Sept. 1.

BARNMATES LONG SHOT OFTEN IS WINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Sunday's Pacific Classic is the sort of race
that has infuriated some bettors _ and lined the pockets of others
_ all season at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Richard Mandella has two horses, 8-5 favorite Malek and
8-1 Lazy Lode, in the field of eight. Trainer Bob Baffert has two
horses, 2-1 General Challenge and 10-1 River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, horses with the same trainer or owner are
coupled as a so-called ``entry'' for wagering purposes; a bet on
one is a bet on both, usually at stingy odds.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, racing law requires coupling only when horses
have the same owner. So Baffert's pair in the Pacific Classic will
have separate saddle-cloth numbers and separate odds. Mandella's
pair, too.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, when a trainer runs two horses in the same race,
the longer shot of the two will win, and a howl will go up from
fans who think the barn ``stiffed'' the obvious contender in order
to cash a nice bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Mandella said. ``You suspect larceny.''
</P>
<P>
   It has happened so frequently at Del Mar this summer that even
unsuspicious fans are beginning to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Uncoupled horses were entered by the same trainer 48 times in
the 248 races held at the San Diego County track through last
weekend. In 23 of those _ surprisingly close to half the time _ the
horse with the higher odds finished in front of the barnmate the
bettors considered stronger. The higher-odds horse actually won the
race 10 times, the lower-odds horse only six.
</P>
<P>
   Most startling are the statistics on Baffert: The nation's
leading thoroughbred trainer has saddled 13 uncoupled pairs at Del
Mar, and 10 times the higher-odds horse did better. The higher-odds
horse actually won the race six times, the lower-odds horse only
once. When Baffert sent out the post-time favorite and another
horse, that ``other'' horse has won five times, the favorite only
once.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff on that ``other'' horse can be huge: $21.60 for a $2
bet when Baffert's Tout Charmant upset Excellent Meeting and eight
others in the Del Mar Oaks last Sunday; $46 on a Baffert horse in a
race where he had a more logical 7-2 shot as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only Baffert. Trainers Mike Harrington ($85), Vladimir
Cerin ($49), Ian Jory ($41.20) and Barry Abrams ($26.80) have lit
up the tote board by beating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A bettor who played this angle all season _ backing the
``lesser'' of any trainer's two horses _ would have turned a
phenomenal 238-percent profit so far at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no angle works that well for long. And what good is a
winning angle to fans who don't use it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aggravation,'' said Bob Achen, a racegoer for 50
years, who phoned me from his Granada Hills home one day this week.
``When I'm playing the pick-six, it costs me a lot of money. I
always feel like I'd better throw in the `other' horse even if I
don't like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play $32 (pick-six) tickets. I can't afford to go throwing a
lot of horses in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer might be moderation. Don't automatically bet on the
``other'' horse. DO give him extra points when you're handicapping.
</P>
<P>
   It's not larceny _ ``the old hidden entry,'' as the cynics call
it. The trainer's name is right there on the program page, not
hidden at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply reasonable to trust the judgment of a sharp trainer
that his long shot can compete with his contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I run two horses, they're two GOOD horses,'' Baffert said
as he prepared General Challenge and River Keen _ or should we say
River Keen and General Challenge? _ for Del Mar's marquee race.
``Handicappers are putting bad lines on these horses, is what is
happening, making it look like one of 'em is a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually,'' Mandella said, ``the long shot is doing so good (in
workouts) that the trainer makes a late decision to enter him. An
improving horse is a dangerous horse. Maybe it's an indication you
should take an extra hard look at that `other' horse.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: The equine star of Pacific Classic day could be
Chilukki, who's in another race on the 12:30 p.m. card.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old filly, unbeaten in four starts for Baffert, will
face six horses at 7 furlongs in the Vinery Del Mar Debutante.
(Baffert does NOT have another horse in the Debutante.)
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Del Mar Handicap on turf will be headed by 1998
Horse of the Meet, Ladies Din, who was almost entered in the
Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Across the continent, meanwhile, Saratoga features the Personal
Ensign Handicap for fillies and mares today (with Bobby Frankel's
Keeper Hill challenging Banshee Breeze), and the Travers for
3-year-olds (Menifee, Ecton Park, Cat Thief, Lemon Drop Kid) on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Department of Idiocy: The California Horse Racing Board has
added four days to the thoroughbred schedule for 2000, satisfying
revenue-hungry track operators _ and perplexing the farsighted.
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue that longer breaks would improve the sport
believed they'd convinced the CHRB when dates were reduced by 11
days for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. The longest vacation in 2000 will be three days
between Santa Anita and Hollywood Park in April. Hollywood Park
will close on Christmas Eve for the first time since 1995.

entertained: no rousing number, no gorgeous soliloquy, no bravura
cameo qualifies without the audience's say-so. This is the glory of
live performance, that a catharsis can be so deeply absorbed that
spectators demand a timeout to express how they feel. By Peter

   APPLE-MONTREAL (Montreal) _ In Paris, the familiar eight-sided
red street signs say ``STOP.'' The Academie Francaise, guardian of
linguistic purity, utters not a peep of complaint. But in Montreal,
where these matters are deemed crucial to cultural identity, the
signs say ``ARRET.'' Eaton's department store, a Canadian tradition
for generations, is now just plain Eaton; the possessive ending was
amputated because the authorities ruled it too un-French. Twice in
the last two decades hard feelings have pushed Quebec close to
separation from Canada, with severe and lasting consequences for
Montreal, even if the city itself voted no. The issue still
percolates, never very far beneath the surface. But the visiting,
linguistically challenged American need not fear. Most of the

delight in encountering an American with a smattering of French. By

<P>
   !text!The worst mistake made by Jamie Tarses, who stepped down
Thursday as President of ABC Entertainment, didn't involve
programming strategy _ although trying to revive ``Fantasy Island''
last year probably comes close. Her biggest misstep was one of
simple hubris, when she agreed, two years ago, to open her doors to
Lynn Hirschberg of the New York Times Magazine, who took the
occasion to write Tarses' professional obit.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding depleted, as her '97-'98 fall schedule was
underwhelmingly received within both the industry in general and
the network in particular, Tarses told Hirschberg, ``I can't
exactly say it was fun while it lasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Tarses had been forced to feign enthusiasm. Last
month, she told the Television Critics Association: ``We are going
to end our erosion and, in a worst-case scenario, shrink (audience
loss) the least (of the major networks).'' Not exactly a rousing
battle-cry.
</P>
<P>
   A resignation statement found Tarses somewhat more sanguine:
``The sweeping changes in the entertainment industry dictated
necessary, competitive changes at ABC, and I feel that the time is
right to move on. ABC is well-positioned to turn the corner next
season, and with the creative team in place, they have all the
momentum to see the network to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses, whose introduction to the TV industry came during her
childhood, when she critiqued her father, Jay's, teleplays over
dinner at home in Woodland Hills, assumed the title of president of
ABC Entertainment in 1996, the first woman to ascend to such a
position and, at 32, one of the youngest. That's the trouble with
youth _ Tarses was considered a tyro at age 32; now 35, she exits a
network that has begun to forsake her demographic for more youthful
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   As her father had run-ins with network executives, Tarses
irritated her talent as well, ill-advisedly upsetting Steven Bochco
(``NYPD Blue'') when she withdrew a miniseries of his acclaimed
show ``Murder One.'' With David E. Kelley, she futzed around for a
long time before finding a good time slot for ``The Practice,'' now
an Emmy-nominated hit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Iger has said: ``I counseled Jamie, never be arrogant.
It's the worst trait you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting credit for helping shepherd such NBC hits as
``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Mad About You,'' Tarses told one
interviewer, as she assumed the ABC position in 1996: ``My
sensibility is the sensibility people seem to want to see. The
shows I helped develop are the shows I want to watch, that I will
show up at home for.'' Granted, she said this before uncorking such
forgettable flotsam as ``Hiller and Diller,'' ``Over the Top'' or
this year's ``Oh Grow Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses demonstrated a lot of dubious behavior in her trek to the
top _ such as reportedly trying to get out of her NBC deal to get
to ABC by threatening a sexual harassment suit at the Peacock
network. Also, giving a lame series (``Over the Top'') by her
former boyfriend, Robert Morton, a prime slot on ABC's schedule (it
promptly tanked). As Hirschberg wrote in 1997, observers' whispers
lamented, ``This is not how a network executive acted _ this was
how a girl acted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the profile ran, Tarses could've assuaged the whole
situation by simply accepting a healthy portion of humble pie. It's
quite possible everyone would have admired her candor and forgiven
her hubris. Instead, she acted defensive and evasive at that first
meeting, a posture that never abated in subsequent meetings with
the press.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has enjoyed some success of late _ ``Sports Night'' is a
critical if not yet an audience favorite, and its midsummer nights'
novelty ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' is a surprise hit, though
one that would be difficult to maintain as an ongoing series. But
the network's coming fall season, courtesy Tarses, offers a huge
question mark. ABC's new sitcoms _ ``Oh Grow Up,'' ``Then Came
You'' and ``Odd Man Out'' _ are as uninspired as their cliched
titles. ``Wasteland'' won't likely appeal to viewers outside the
twentysomething niche, and ``Snoops'' is being perceived as a rare
David E. Kelley misfire. The one series that has impressed industry
observers is ``Once and Again,'' a rare show highlighting
middle-aged characters, but the network is damaging the series by
withdrawing it from the schedule from October to January.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that is no longer Tarses' problem. One pities her
successor.

and, at 32, one of the youngest. That's the trouble with youth _
Tarses was considered a tyro at age 32; now 35, she exits a network
that has begun to forsake her demographic for more youthful
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   As her father had run-ins with network executives, Tarses
irritated her talent as well, ill-advisedly upsetting Steven Bochco
(``NYPD Blue'') when she withdrew a miniseries of his acclaimed
show ``Murder One.'' With David E. Kelley, she futzed around for a
long time before finding a good time slot for ``The Practice,'' now
an Emmy-nominated hit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Iger has said: ``I counseled Jamie, never be arrogant.
It's the worst trait you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting credit for helping shepherd such NBC hits as
``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Mad About You,'' Tarses told one
interviewer, as she assumed the ABC position in 1996: ``My
sensibility is the sensibility people seem to want to see. The
shows I helped develop are the shows I want to watch, that I will
show up at home for.'' Granted, she said this before uncorking such
forgettable flotsam as ``Hiller and Diller,'' ``Over the Top'' or
this year's ``Oh Grow Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses demonstrated a lot of dubious behavior in her trek to the
top _ such as reportedly trying to get out of her NBC deal to get
to ABC by threatening a sexual harassment suit at the Peacock
network. Also, giving a lame series (``Over the Top'') by her
former boyfriend, Robert Morton, a prime slot on ABC's schedule (it
promptly tanked). As Hirschberg wrote in 1997, observers' whispers
lamented, ``This is not how a network executive acted _ this was
how a girl acted.''
</P>
<P>
   After the profile ran, Tarses could've assuaged the whole
situation by simply accepting a healthy portion of humble pie. It's
quite possible everyone would have admired her candor and forgiven
her hubris. Instead, she acted defensive and evasive at that first
meeting, a posture that never abated in subsequent meetings with
the press.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has enjoyed some success of late _ ``Sports Night'' is a
critical if not yet an audience favorite, and its midsummer nights'
novelty ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' is a surprise hit, though
one that would be difficult to maintain as an ongoing series. But
the network's coming fall season, courtesy Tarses, offers a huge
question mark. ABC's new sitcoms _ ``Oh Grow Up,'' ``Then Came
You'' and ``Odd Man Out'' _ are as uninspired as their cliched
titles. ``Wasteland'' won't likely appeal to viewers outside the
twentysomething niche, and ``Snoops'' is being perceived as a rare
David E. Kelley misfire. The one series that has impressed industry
observers is ``Once and Again,'' a rare show highlighting
middle-aged characters, but the network is damaging the series by
withdrawing it from the schedule from October to January.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that is no longer Tarses' problem. One pities her
successor.

ANALYSIS OF RESIGNATION OF JAMIE TARSES FROM ABC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: David Kronke is the Los Angeles Daily News TV critic) 
BY DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The worst mistake made by Jamie Tarses, who
stepped down Thursday as President of ABC Entertainment, didn't
involve programming strategy _ although trying to revive ``Fantasy
Island'' last year probably comes close. Her biggest misstep was
one of simple hubris, when she agreed, two years ago, to open her
doors to Lynn Hirschberg of the New York Times Magazine, who took
the occasion to write Tarses' professional obit.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding depleted, as her '97-'98 fall schedule was
underwhelmingly received within both the industry in general and
the network in particular, Tarses told Hirschberg, ``I can't
exactly say it was fun while it lasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Tarses had been forced to feign enthusiasm. Last
month, she told the Television Critics Association, ``We are going
to end our erosion and, in a worst-case scenario, shrink (audience
loss) the least (of the major networks).'' Not exactly a rousing
battle-cry.
</P>
<P>
   A resignation statement found Tarses somewhat more sanguine:
``The sweeping changes in the entertainment industry dictated
necessary, competitive changes at ABC, and I feel that the time is
right to move on. ABC is well-positioned to turn the corner next
season, and with the creative team in place, they have all the
momentum to see the network to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses, whose introduction to the TV industry came during her
childhood, when she critiqued her father, Jay's, teleplays over
dinner at home in the Woodland Hills community in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, assumed the title of president of ABC
Entertainment in 1996, the first woman to ascend to such a position
and, at 32, one of the youngest. That's the trouble with youth _
Tarses was considered a tyro at age 32; now 35, she exits a network

DR. CHARLES D. HOLLISTER, 63, GEOLOGIST STUDIED OCEAN FLOOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Davis Hollister, a marine geologist who expanded the
knowledge of ocean bottom currents and deep sea storms, died on
Monday in Wyoming on a family vacation. He was 63 and lived in
Falmouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A mountaineer, Hollister fell while climbing boulders on a hike
and sustained fatal head injuries, said the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, where he was corporate vice president
and senior scientist in the geology and geophysics department.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a scientist he pioneered the field of deep sea dynamics and
made us look at mud on the deep sea floor in a different way,''
said Dr. Robert B. Gagosian, the institute's director.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister was among the first oceanographers to realize that the
deep sea floor was not at all tranquil as had long been assumed. He
demonstrated that large swaths of it are swept by strong currents
and benthic, or sea bottom, storms. He documented this in the high
energy benthic boundary experiment, which he organized in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister used a vast piston coring system to bore into the sea
floor and extract samples. One 100-foot core he took in the 1970s,
called the super straw, produced the longest continuous record of
ocean basin history _ 65 million years.
</P>
<P>
   He was also an expert on the potential disposal of radioactive
waste under the seabed, and he led the American delegation
negotiating with Russia over the monitoring of dumped radioactive
material and ways to prevent its escape.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister's research took him around the world, and he was chief
scientist on 21 of his nearly 30 research cruises for Woods Hole.
He spent months on submarines in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and
Antarctic Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hollister was born in Santa Barbara, Calif., and grew up
on a family ranch that once covered 40,000 acres, making it one of
the biggest cattle ranches in the state. He graduated from Oregon
State University in 1960 and earned a Ph.D. in geology at Columbia
University in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   By then he had been an oceanographer for the United States
Geological Survey and a research assistant at Columbia's
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. He joined the staff in Woods
Hole in 1967, was promoted to associate scientist in 1971 and to
senior scientist in 1979. He also led its graduate program for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister wrote about 90 scientific papers and six books. In his
corporate role he helped the institution raise money and worked
with its governing board.
</P>
<P>
   He was an avid mountain climber, hunter, fisherman and alpine
and cross-country skier. He had climbed most of the country's
peaks, including Mount Rainier while he served in the Army and the
Cascades and Sierras as a student. He took part in the first
mountaineering expedition to Antarctica's Sentinel Range and scaled
five of its six highest peaks, a feat that earned him the National
Geographic Society's John Oliver La Gorce Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister is survived by his wife, Jacqueline McEnroe Hollister;
a daughter and a son from an earlier marriage, Robin J. Hall of
Marshfield, Mass., and David Hollister of Seattle; a stepson,
Andrew Suitor of Falmouth; three brothers, Lincoln S., of
Princeton, N.J., David O., of Greenville, Calif., and C. Doyle, of
Santa Barbara, and two granddaughters. His marriage to Jalien Green
Hollister, of Charlestown, Mass., ended in divorce.

SPARKS' TALL TRIO BREAKS HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks' team defense
delivered again. They stayed in the Houston Comets' faces all night
to make one giant step toward realizing a goal many say is
impossible . . . except them.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of the Comets' Big Three of Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl
Swoopes and Tina Thompson being the dominant force on the court, it
was the Sparks' Big Three of 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie, 6-foot-1 DeLisha
Milton and 6-foot-3 La'Keisha Frett who delivered the one-two-three
punch before 10,099 at the Forum Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The trio combined for 50 points and shot 63 percent from the
field in a 75-60 victory over the Comets in the first game of
best-of-3 Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The series moves to Houston Sunday for a 1 p.m. game, and, if
necessary, Monday at 5 p.m. Knowing the Comets' ability and
experience, the Sparks are hoping not to have to play a third game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this win gives us a lot of confidence that we can
beat this team,'' said Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge. ``We know
that we have a lot of hard work to do. We feel we have a really
good chance to go in there on an emotional high and play as hard as
we can. But step one was getting this game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks quickly regrouped from an early brief deficit and had
the Comets on their heels. Tamecka Dixon came off the bench to add
six quick points and Leslie had five, including a 3-pointer, during
an 11-2 stretch that gave the Sparks a 29-20 lead they would never
relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie had 15 of her game-high 23 points in the first half,
while Milton put up half of her 16. Those two worked particularly
well together, and the Comets didn't have an answer for Milton. She
was 7 of 10 in her 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Houston expected Leslie to explode, but they weren't prepared
for Milton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They struggled with our post game,'' Milton said. ``They had a
hard time with Lisa and me. When they doubled on Lisa, that gave me
a chance to hit that 15-footer that I'm used to shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 51 percent from the field, the only team to
shoot more than 50 percent on the Comets this season and
out-rebounded them, 14-6, in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good win for the Sparks,'' said Houston coach Van
Chancellor. ``I just wished it wasn't at the expense of the
Comets.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 33-20 lead at the break, the Sparks exploded with
a 15-3 run to start the second half. The Comets later cut their
deficit to seven (61-54) with five minutes remaining, but Sparks'
guard Gordana Grubin converted a 3-pointer to spark an 11-2 run one
minute later.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, who had a team-high 17 points for Houston, was troubled
by a sprain knee but still played 33 minutes; she wasn't that
impressed with the Sparks' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from them, but I didn't think they
did anything special in particular, expect grab our jerseys,'' she
said. ``It's not that they played great defense, but we didn't play
well on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shot 41 percent from the field. Cooper, the
three-time WNBA scoring leader, was 4 of 16 for 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor acknowledged that it had been a difficult week for
his team, which lost their spirited point guard Kim Perrot to
cancer Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets are not a team easily whipped, though. They won their
second WNBA title last year after losing the first game on the road
against Phoenix.

NEW REGULATIONS FOR PIPELINE WORKERS ADOPTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators adopted a new rule on Thursday they say will
ensure that 175,000 people who work on the nation's pipelines are
qualified to do their jobs safely.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rule, operators of natural gas and liquid
pipelines must be able to show that employees are qualified, and
they have to demonstrate how they confirmed those qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which was announced Thursday and will take effect this
fall, underscores the importance of human error in pipeline
accidents. Human error may have played an important part in the
deadly rupture and explosion of a pipeline in Bellingham, Wash., on
June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Coyner, a U.S. Transportation Department administrator
whose responsibilities include pipeline safety, declined Thursday
to say whether the new rule would have prevented the Bellingham
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that employees of Olympic Pipe Line Co.,
who may have made critical errors on June 10, would be covered
under the rule. Earlier this month, regulators ordered Olympic to
undertake additional training and review qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Office of Pipeline Safety has said Olympic workers
may have used wrong procedures to shut down then open pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators also believe Olympic workers operating a critical
computer system that day may not have been trained to maintain the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer system, which operated and monitored the pipeline,
malfunctioned on the day of the rupture.
</P>
<P>
   The rule adopted Thursday aims to prevent the failures of
unqualified workers, Coyner said.
</P>
<P>
   The rule will try to make sure pipeline workers and employees of
contractors who work for pipeline companies can do their jobs under
normal conditions, as well as in emergencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government already has training standards for
pipeline workers scattered throughout its regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule adopted Thursday goes further to make sure that
workers were not only trained, but that their companies evaluated
them to make sure they can do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That will move regulators away from their current paperwork
inspections to make sure workers attended training classes and took
exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to look at a batch of exams and check off a list
that says, `Yes, they've taken the exams,' '' said Richard Felder,
director of the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators proposed new training requirements in 1994, then
withdrew the proposal in the face of objections from industry
groups and others.
</P>
<P>
   The current rule took three years to develop under so-called
``negotiated rule-making.'' Industry groups and state regulators
took part in developing the qualified-worker requirements.
</P>
<P>
   A committee that helped to develop the rule included members
from seven trade groups representing the oil, natural gas and
pipeline industries.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to cost the pipeline industry $59 million to
comply with the qualified-worker rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety is giving the industry 18 months
to meet the rule.
</P>
<P>
   It will begin enforcing it in April 2001.

GRIFFEY SR. OR PINIELLA? CHOICE MAY RIDE ON MARINERS' FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A few days of major league pitching has the same
effect on Puget Sounders as a week of steady sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know how to act.
</P>
<P>
   So, delirium becomes epidemic: Four consecutive good games from
starters has Mariners fans thinking wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what the heck. Dreams are free, at least until the club
owners figure a way to get tax money from them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, local pitching historically has proven much like
the local weather. Inevitably and too immediately, it's going to
rain.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-game series starting Friday night in Yankee
Stadium, the storm feeling is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful as have been the latest efforts of Jamie Moyer,
Freddy Garcia, Paul Abbott, John Halama and Gil Meche, the Mariners
still require a miracle tantamount to their 1995 water-to-wine
trick. And baseball rules prohibit clubs from putting a waiver
claim on the New Testament more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But a miracle may be required for a number of Mariners careers,
including the baseball bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The likely retirement of Mariner CEO John Ellis, and the
offseason ascension of Nintendo chieftain Howard Lincoln, will
signal the first significant shift in club operations since our shy
tycoons took over in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   What this means isn't known, but Ellis, for all his
prevarications with the public, has been consistent in standing up
for president Chuck Armstrong, vice president of baseball
operations Woody Woodward and manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Absent Ellis, the baseball bosses may well be left to stand on
their records, which means a one-month miracle would come in real
handy.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella celebrated his 1,000th career victory as a manager
recently by fending off separate reports of his potential Mariners
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired of talking about it,'' he said. ``I don't like
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   An item in Peter Gammons' column in the Boston Globe said that
agent Alan Nero was about to be hired by Piniella to scout
potential managerial vacancies in case he's a free man this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging having lunch with Nero in Seattle during
the Arizona series last month _ Nero represents a D-backs pitcher
who is as tall as his wallet is thick _ he said he did so on the
recommendation of longtime friend Ken ``Hawk'' Harrelson, whom Nero
has helped get speaking and endorsement deals that Piniella was
curious about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to look at some opportunities, and Hawk said
Alan helped him,'' he said. ``I didn't sign anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella pointed out he has never used an agent to negotiate a
managerial contract and didn't feel a need for one now, with a year
left on his Seattle deal.
</P>
<P>
   The other report was a little more ominous. A Dayton, Ohio,
newspaper a few weeks ago quoted an unnamed baseball executive as
saying that Ken Griffey Sr., the Reds' hitting coach, was destined
to succeed Piniella in Seattle, a report dismissed by the
principals.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a source in the American League said the Mariners,
in a contract extension offer to Junior last year, told him his
father would receive ``strong consideration'' for any Seattle
managerial vacancy. Junior was noncommittal about the offer but was
said to have informed Piniella so his manager knew he was not part
of any plan to usurp him.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Piniella dismissed questions about it, as did
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on any negotiations,'' Armstrong said this
week. ``Lou is our manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior has talked in the abstract about his potential enjoyment
of playing for his father, who has never managed in the majors, and
has seen it work in Baltimore with the Ripkens and in Montreal with
the Alous. He's also wondered out loud about what the Mariners
franchise can offer him that he couldn't get with any other team.
The money, he reasons accurately, will be the same wherever he
goes.
</P>
<P>
   But as he reportedly demonstrated, he and Piniella have enough
mutual respect that he would not turn on him, particularly if it
were to cast a shadow on his father.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to keep Griffey, already huge, grows daily and
probably will reach a climax this winter, because if a trade is the
option, his value will be higher than at the July trading deadline.
If Lincoln succeeds Ellis with a do-what-it-takes attitude,
sentiment and relationships will come in second to the deeds
required to keep the best player in baseball in one of the game's
most magnificent theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The best, and maybe only, way to end this palace intrigue is
with a September miracle. And to do it with three rookie starting
pitchers ...
</P>
<P>
   Not only would Piniella keep his job, the Manager of the Year
Award would be retired in his honor.

FORGET TAXICABS. YOU COULDN'T EVEN HAIL A GARBAGE TRUCK.
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   During Thursday's protracted moment of communal adversity, New
Yorkers seemed to borrow some strategies from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from commuters in Cairo, hundreds of Upper West
Siders jammed into buses, faces mashed against the doors, daring
drivers to tell them they could not ride on the steps. Others
cheerfully shared taxis, Minneapolis style, or tried to hitch rides
_ in one case on a garbage truck.
</P>
<P>
   In midtown, scores of bus riders inexplicably behaved as if they
were in London during the blitz: waiting in single file,
uncomplaining, honoring the honor system. And with a nod to
Seattle, many commuters gave up entirely and created virtual
offices in the city's coffee shops, jettisoning ties, slurping
latte and e-mailing all the while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attempted the one train, I attempted a cab and now I am
attempting this,'' said Richard Willard, who runs his own Internet
marketing company, as he sat working on his computer in Starbucks
at Broadway and 87th Street. His next stop was Xando, another
coffee shop, which had the Internet connection he needed to send
e-mail. ``This is inconvenient, but not quite a killer for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sat and watched bus after bus inch by, often out of
service or otherwise lousy with folks in suits, their faces
dripping with sweat. At 86th Street, some started to beg drivers
stopped at the light for a ride. One man tried to ingratiate
himself with garbage and cement truck drivers before finally
settling on a Lincoln, as four other would-be bus passengers joined
him.
</P>
<P>
   All around the region, attempts to get from here to there were
delayed or thwarted and employers were thinly staffed after storms
flooded streets, railways and subways. Yet people seemed too
floored to be mad. Folks stood on platforms waiting for N and R
trains, some of the few lines running, only to find cars already
packed as they pulled into the station. On some platforms,
commuters opened umbrellas against water cascading into the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Richardson, an administrative assistant from Newark who
commutes by bus each day, said her bus meandered through flooded
streets in New Jersey before arriving a half-hour late. She then
plunked down $1.50 at the Union Square subway station, only to give
up quickly. ``There are like 29,000 people in there and its hot and
nothing else is running,'' Ms. Richardson said. ``So, I am going to
have breakfast and just relax.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, commuters spent two hours or more on overcrowded
buses and trains just to reach Atlantic Avenue. Josette Goeloe, 28,
of Crown Heights, stood with her 6-year-old daughter, Jenia, in the
Atlantic Terminal, pondering how to get to her job as a
receptionist on Wall Street. Jenia had been looking forward to
visiting her mother's office for weeks. The two had started out
about 8 a.m., taking the No. 2 train from Sterling Street. That
train took nearly an hour to arrive at the Grand Army Plaza stop,
where passengers were informed that service had been stopped. ``The
buses were too crowded and they wouldn't let anyone on,'' Ms.
Goeloe said. ``There was no dollar van service. It was just
miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture was no prettier in the suburbs. At the Tarrytown
station in Westchester County, the lines for the phones were 10
deep with people trying to find a way into the city. Cars jammed a
mile-and-a-half portion of the southbound Saw Mill Parkway in
Yonkers after the police closed a section of flooded road. George
Sperling's tan Jaguar, worth $58,000, gave him no advantage.
Sperling, a lawyer who lives in Mamaroneck, had been trying to get
to his midtown office when he saw the Thruway congesting in front
of him in lower Yonkers, with several cars on one exit ramp pulling
over the divider and onto the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed,'' said Sperling, who is 64. Twenty minutes later,
he was wiping mud from his hands, and his blue pinstripe suit
looked as if he had spent the night in a park. His Jaguar was
helpless in a foot of mud.
</P>
<P>
   Metro North riders were among the most inconvenienced commuters.
The 8:15 train from New Haven to Grand Central went all the way to
Norwalk, where it proceeded to sit and sit. The conductor
announced, ``You can get off the train, but we may pull out at any
minute. We don't know if we'll be here one minute or twenty
minutes. If we pull out, you will get stuck here.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, streets were abuzz with the tweet tweet of
cellular phones, as people walked up and down major intersections
giving the blow by blow to whomever would listen to their travails.
Men and women walked down streets pulling suitcases, defeated and
unable to get to the airport. Cabs were impossible to find. ``I've
been waiting for 45 minutes,'' said Jennifer Lerer, who was trying
to get to her first day on the job at Oxygen Media, a new-media
company building Web sites and cable television programming
tailored for women. ``They said, `Get here when you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Baby sitters all over the region were unable to get to work, and
Tanya Coke of Montclair, N.J., a lawyer, had her husband, also a
lawyer, stay home with their two small children. Normally, they
would have had to flip a coin, but he had an afternoon flight and
could stay home till then. ``He got the better end of the deal,''
she said. ``He played happily with the baby while I sat for two
hours on the subway. What was I thinking?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The diminutive player with the devilish
goatee heard both cheers and jeers from the partisan crowd.
</P>
<P>
   When Marcelo Rios purposely dropped his racket en route to
losing the first set a man shouted, ``Pick it up, you crybaby!''
More hecklers followed, raising their voices and whistling in
disgust at the poor play by the No. 2 seed. But as he captured the
second set with ease, the small gathering of fans cheered for Chile
and waved flags from the South American country. They sang ``Ole,
Ole, Ole,'' and added a fierce international spirit to the
second-round contest of the US Pro Championships between Rios and
Canadian Daniel Nestor.
</P>
<P>
   The last match completed under the Longwood lights Thursday was
a study in contrasts. Nestor needed a tiebreaker to take the first
set, 7-6 (8-6), while Rios worked quickly to win the second, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The contest came down to a decisive third set which saw Nestor
edge toward an upset in the ninth game only to falter and fall in
the 10th. Then with a tennis racket salute to his faithful fans and
their flags, the No. 2 seed advanced to the quarterfinals, 6-7
(6-8), 6-2, 6-4. Rios and the flagbearers return Friday afternoon
to face Sjeng Schalken for a Final Four berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very good,'' said Rios. ``I needed to play
better, but I got through on the big points.''
</P>
<P>
   At final count, Nestor served 13 aces, Rios just five. The
Canadian also double faulted four times less than his opponent, but
the final two times Nestor failed to make a serve proved the
ultimate difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean gave his opponent two break opportunities with the
game score even in the third. But Rios managed to salvage the game,
gaining deuce and then hitting a service winner for a 5-4 final-set
lead. In the final game, Nestor showed how a player can
self-destruct in a short time, double faulting twice in his final
service game. He fell behind love-40 and handed Rios the match with
a double fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the case the few times that I've played him that
I've been in every match,'' said Nestor. ``I've always had good
chances to be able to beat him, I just haven't executed. Obviously
I'm doing the right things and putting myself in a position to win.
I've just got to finish him off. I had chances and I didn't
convert. Against top players you can only have so many chances.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Nestor, his opponent played well in spurts,
offering him ``loose points'' in the final set after pulling away
in the second. But the conditions, combined with unpredictable play
from Rios, hurt Nestor. He said the balls felt heavier and his
shoulder stiffened as the match continued. The damp air made
consistent play difficult. The Canadian acknowledged he also may
have suffered from poor concentration at the end.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 seed Cedric Pioline appeared to suffer from a similar lack
of focus, but post-match he was unwilling to make a full admission
of his faults. But when Pioline sent a ball 15 rows into the south
end of the grandstand, he made an unmistakable statement. The
Frenchman had conceded the match. The high-flying ball was a
not-so-friendly reminder. The 4,100 fans watching the match managed
only mock surprise as the No. 4 seed continued to let his
frustrations show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, somedays, it's going one way and then the other,''
he said. ``You have to play with it and try to do the best.
Unfortunately, I couldn't do better. Some days I play better. Some
days I play worse, It was not a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, both before and after a 2 1/2-hour rain delay, the
shots and the calls went David Prinosil's way. He earned the 7-6
(7-1), 6-3 second-round upset in 1 hour 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The German led his opponent in every significant statistical
category and composure. Prinosil won a high percentage of first and
second service points, posted a respectable seven aces and double
faulted just once. On the other side of the net, Pioline appeared
sluggish and, at times, uninterested. He double faulted five times,
the last leading to a service break for Prinosil and the ball
launched into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   In Pioline's match, the first signs of his impending collapse
came late in the first set. With the score even at 5-5 and Prinosil
holding the advantage at deuce, the Frenchman sent a lazy backhand
into the net. Pioline looked down in disgust after the failed shot.
He swatted the air, pantomiming his mistake. Prinosil walked away
with his first break of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Serving in the next game, the German suffered through his only
bad stretch of the contest. He went down, 0-30, after pushing a
forehand volley just wide. Prinosil approached the net, looked at
the chair umpire, and shouted, ``No way, no way.''
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded player collected himself and drew even at 30-30.
Prinosil fell behind again with a long backhand, but fought back to
deuce. A forehand passing shot gave Pioline the advantage. He
earned his first and only break of the match when Prinosil offered
up his only double fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Prinosil, who faces Marat Safin in the
quarterfinals. ``I had some tough weeks. I had some injuries three
or four weeks ago. I was unfit when I came to the US, but I'm
getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   When the first drops of rain started to fall less than an hour
into the contest, Pioline quickly approached the chair for a play
stoppage. But the break, which came with Prinosil ahead, 30-0, in
the third game, did not help Pioline regain his composure.

BABY-FACED MECHE MAKING IT BIG WITH PORTFOLIO OF PITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is as if Gil Meche's baseball card collection has
come alive, the heroes of his childhood climbing off the cardboard
and challenging him to do battle. Fred McGriff has homered, Cal
Ripken has doubled. Will Clark and David Justice have struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm collecting all these guys' cards, and the next thing you
know I'm pitching against everybody,'' said Meche, the Mariners'
20-year-old right-hander, who was three months from being born when
Ripken began his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice, McGriff, all these guys that I pitched against, I
mean Ripken, one of the best ever in baseball _ it's amazing. I
think really it's going to hit me when I go into the offseason and
actually realize what just happened. I feel like I belong here, and
I feel like I can pitch well here. But it's still a big surprise
knowing that I'm here at this age and throwing against my idols as
a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just nothing better than being here, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche, who starts Friday night in Yankee Stadium as the Mariners
begin a seven-game road trip to New York and Chicago, is 4-3 with a
5.12 earned run average. In six of his eight starts, he has lasted
at least 52/3 innings while allowing no more than three earned
runs.
</P>
<P>
   To those who saw him at Class A Wisconsin last season, the
contrast is remarkable. Bryan Price, Mariners minor league pitching
coordinator and part-time batting practice pitcher, said Meche
looks more confident in the majors than he did in the Midwest
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see in Wisconsin last year that when he would
struggle, he'd get mad at himself and it would affect his
performance in a negative way,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, at least initially, you don't see any of that negative
stuff. You see a guy very much in control, living in the moment and
thinking about what to do to get out of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche, the Mariners' No. 1 pick in the 1996 draft, arrived at
minor league camp this spring hoping to be assigned to Class AA New
Haven. He thought he would stay there all year adapting to the
league, which is how it happened for Seattle's other pitching
phenom, Ryan Anderson. But by early June, Meche had earned a
promotion to Class AAA Tacoma, and he joined the Mariners a month
later.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was not easy. Woody Woodward, M's vice president
for baseball operations, acknowledged it was ``pretty risky'' for a
20-year-old to jump so many levels so quickly. But with the early
season struggles of Ken Cloude, Brett Hinchliffe, Mac Suzuki and
others, it was hard to ignore Meche's progress.
</P>
<P>
   That was manager Lou Piniella's feeling. Meche had thrown three
innings late in spring training, allowing six runs on six hits,
striking out none and walking three. The results were poor, but the
impression was not: To Piniella, Meche was further along than
Anderson, who threw three shutout innings the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see that he was going to come quick,'' Piniella
said. ``You could just see it. He stood out. We only saw him pitch
three innings, and he got hit that day, too. But you look to see
how guys are throwing the ball, their command and their composure,
and the pitches that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important of those pitches was the changeup. Meche had
always thrown hard; ever since he started pitching at age 9, he
said, he could throw a ball past hitters. But his 91-97 mph
fastball was not enough at Wisconsin. Meche's numbers were solid _
8-7 with a 3.44 ERA and 168 strikeouts in 149 innings _ but he was
not a complete pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at times, I was throwing 95 miles per hour in A-ball
and guys were still hitting it,'' Meche said. ``I know A-ball
hitters can hit that kind of speed, but most of the time they don't
because guys have good changeups or something else to throw off the
(hitters') eyes to where they can't catch up with the fastball.
Last year I really wasn't that kind of pitcher; I was just coming
right at you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Meche has pitched that way this year, as he did against
Tampa Bay and Minnesota, he has struggled. When he's on, it's
because his off-speed pitches are working. In Meche's best game, a
4-3 victory at Boston two starts ago, he fell behind often in the
early innings. Instead of falling back on the fastball, he
established his changeup and slider for strikes. His confidence in
those pitches allowed Meche to be more aggressive as the game went
on.
</P>
<P>
   Meche is not a finesse pitcher, said veteran starter Jamie
Moyer, who is, but he has a finesse pitch that can make him
effective. Meche's comfort with the changeup is impressive to
Moyer, who said most pitchers who throw as hard as Meche are slow
to learn the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who throws in the low- to mid-90s, most of the time
it's been reiterated throughout their career to pretty much rely on
the fastball exclusively _ and that's how it should be,'' Moyer
said. ``But Gil's a little bit different in that he uses his
fastball right, but he's not afraid to use his changeup. I think
that's what's going to allow him to have a little more success a
little sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche's changeup varies between 82-86 mph, depending on how hard
he's throwing his fastball. He tried throwing it last year _ he's
always known the circle grip _ but usually could control it only
once in every five tries. He would throw one for a strike, but the
next several might float up in the zone or bounce several feet
before the plate. Unable to trust the pitch, Meche stopped throwing
it, and it wasn't until last winter that he got a feel for it.
</P>
<P>
   Meche worked out at his old high school in Louisiana over the
winter, throwing the changeup over and over with Joe Fontenot, a
friend and Florida Marlins prospect, and Jason Grimsley, a pitcher
with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, who does not throw a changeup himself, helped Meche
perfect the basic grip on the pitch. The changeup was impressive
enough, but Meche's hard stuff also got the veteran's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some kind of electric arm,'' Grimsley said. ``He's
fun to play catch with, because it's on you in a hurry. ... He's
got an idea where the ball is going, too. He's a smart kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche is eager for his start Friday, partly because of the
atmosphere of Yankee Stadium but also because it's his first chance
to pitch in a game with Grimsley watching. Meche did not start when
the Yankees swept a four-game series in Seattle early this month,
and the two spoke only briefly. But, Meche said, ``I know I'll have
a lot to tell him in the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The memories of this season will not easily fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing coming here every day, watching the game,
watching all the big-league hitters, 44,000 people screaming,''
Meche said. ``At 20 years old, I get chills almost every day when I
hear people start screaming. It's just something that I always
wanted to do, and it's scary to think how fast it's come.''

 3 U.S. CONGRESSMEN SEE EAST TIMOR FOR THEMSELVES  &HT;     By LEWIS DOLINSKY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Harkin, senator from Iowa, was stunned at how openly and
brazenly the Indonesian military supports paramilitary thugs in
East Timor. He said Wednesday that a bloodbath is a strong
possibility but that it can be prevented if just a couple of
hundred armed (repeat, armed) U.N. peacekeepers are flown in
``posthaste.'' Otherwise, the Indonesian military will use the
pretext of ``civil war'' to take care of business. (He would be
thrilled to be wrong. But why take chances?)
</P>
<P>
   Harkin also thinks East Timor can be a great victory for the
United Nations. It has done an excellent job preparing for Monday's
referendum, and there is no doubt that the count will be fair. But
what then?
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Harkin and two other Democrats _ Rep. Jim McGovern
of Massachusetts and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island _ visited East
Timor. In separate phone interviews, their reactions were similar
to those of journalists and human rights workers: They spoke of the
high level of intimidation and the courage of people risking their
lives to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The question is simple: Do they want autonomy within Indonesia,
the country that walked in and held East Timor at a cost of 200,000
lives after the Portuguese colonialists walked out? A no vote means
yes to independence, and all hell may break loose.
</P>
<P>
   The three Americans told anyone who would listen that Congress
takes this vote very seriously and that Indonesia's economic health
and its place in the world depend on how it performs. McGovern says
that when he and Harkin met President B.J. Habibie in Jakarta on
Sunday, they made that point as nicely as possible, but repeatedly.
Habibie said everything was fine and will be fine. But if you read
the papers, or see pictures of a brutalized population, you know
all is not fine.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin, McGovern and Reed still expect the referendum to take
place (delay would be worse) and for East Timorese to spurn
Indonesia's autonomy offer. But by how much? The votes could be
counted by the end of next week in Dili, the capital, with a panel
of three foreigners in charge. Don't expect an exit poll or
preliminary results, Reed says. If the vote is 60 to 70 percent
``no,'' that's good, he says, but if it's only 55-45 against, the
Indonesian military, which is hedging its bets, will be tempted to
hang on.
</P>
<P>
   The military is reluctant to give up power, money and patronage
that come with control of East Timor, and it is concerned that one
secession will give hope to other movements. But the generals are
also ready to get their allies out if independence is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In Suai, at a churchyard crammed with about 2,000 people seeking
refuge while they wait to vote, Reed got up and said, ``The vote is
more powerful than the army.'' Everyone cheered. The militias had
cut off water to the church. After the Americans objected, water
was apparently restored. If so, a small victory.
</P>
<P>
   For Harkin, the referendum is full circle. In 1976, he
introduced the first congressional resolution condemning Indonesian
annexation of East Timor. He says Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger could have stopped it by telling Indonesia not to use our
arms there and by threatening to cut off military cooperation. He
didn't. The East Timorese had no strategic value.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption now is that this process will lead to the
independence that was thwarted then. But Megawati Sukarnoputri, top
contender to be Indonesia's next president, has called East Timor
an integral part of the nation. Harkin says an acquaintance close
to the Megawati camp has let him know that if Habibie lets U.N.
troops in, she will not use that ``to hammer him.'' From this
discussion, Harkin infers that Megawati would let East Timor go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ghastly scale of the death toll in Turkey's earthquake
became apparent in the days after the tremor, so did the tardiness
of the official rescue and relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock and grief of last week, the predominant
sentiment in Turkey this week was anger. Anger at the government
for not reacting swiftly enough to rescue and help survivors. Anger
at the army for not pulling into action sooner. And anger at the
country's bureaucrats for allowing the poorly constructed
buildings, which crumbled like sand castles, to have been put up in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this anger is properly directed. But some of it could
lead to the wrong conclusions about how to avoid such appalling
loss of life _ 13,000 dead by the middle of this week, with many
thousands more believed dead under the rubble _ next time.
</P>
<P>
   It seems incredible that Turkey, which sits on a geological
fault line, had no dedicated rescue team. Not only did the
government fail to train and equip such a force, it also failed to
mobilize the one institution whose strength and discipline are
legendary: the army.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled foreign technicians bored, chiselled and hacked their
way into the mounds of compacted debris, and as Turkish volunteers
ferried in food and dug desperately with their own machinery, tools
and hands, their government froze.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Saturday, fully four days after the quake, that
the army _ admittedly reeling from casualties of its own _ went
into action.
</P>
<P>
   For these two failures, the blame lies squarely with the
government. More complicated, however, is the matter of the flimsy
buildings, a big contributor to the heavy death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comment since the quake, both in Turkey and the
West, has centered on the need for tougher regulation of the
building industry. In the aftermath of such a catastrophe, that is
an easy demand to make. But Turkey had building regulations: they
were evaded (with official collusion) or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is more effective regulation, which is a
different and more difficult thing.
</P>
<P>
   If rules are to prevent the shoddy and reckless work that has
cost many lives _ blocks built on shallow foundations, cement mixed
with too much sand _ they must be designed so that they are
feasible both to obey and to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that were merely ``tougher'' could be quickly
introduced, but in all likelihood would be neither.
</P>
<P>
   There is another problem. The lessons from the earthquakes in
Los Angeles in 1994 (54 deaths) and Kobe, Japan, in 1995 (6,500
deaths) suggest that _ other things being equal _ the critical
factor determining the death toll is the nature of the building
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the killer: Turks were crushed by the collapsing
structures above their heads. In Japan, heavy-roofed buildings put
up to withstand the frequent typhoons also proved lethal. In
California, timber-framed houses with light roofs, bolted to a
concrete foundation, rode out the tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Before Turkey and foreign well-wishers rush to rebuild heavy
high-rise cement buildings, they might do well to consider
old-fashioned timber.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that all things are far from equal. The
harsh and unavoidable fact is that natural disasters kill more
people in poor countries than they do in rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy construction is one of the deprivations of poverty. And
though the poor world has no monopoly of bureaucratic corruption,
enforcing rules designed to make buildings safer (and dearer) will
always be easier in countries that are richer and which have more
accountable governments.
</P>
<P>
   This week's outburst of popular Turkish anger at their state for
failing them has been startling. Could it become a force for
change?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, if it prompts more of the humility shown by at least
one member of the government this week _ and if this translates
into a willingness to allow greater openness and freedom in Turkey,
even in ways that challenge the secular creed bequeathed by Kemal
Ataturk in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Turkey's best prospects of becoming a better
governed and more prosperous place may lie in the embrace of the
European Union. Here too some hope emerges from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments have repeatedly snubbed Turkey, refusing to take
seriously its hope of membership and huddling conveniently behind
the objections of its old antagonist, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Eventual Turkish membership would be a matter for delicate
negotiation. But the generous hand held out to Turkey by Greece
this week offers a hope that objections to opening such talks may
yet be overcome. &QL;

California, timber-framed houses with light roofs, bolted to a
concrete foundation, rode out the tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Before Turkey and foreign well-wishers rush to rebuild heavy
high-rise cement buildings, they might do well to consider
old-fashioned timber.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that all things are far from equal. The
harsh and unavoidable fact is that natural disasters kill more
people in poor countries than they do in rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy construction is one of the deprivations of poverty. And
though the poor world has no monopoly of bureaucratic corruption,
enforcing rules designed to make buildings safer (and dearer) will
always be easier in countries that are richer and which have more
accountable governments.
</P>
<P>
   This week's outburst of popular Turkish anger at their state for
failing them has been startling. Could it become a force for
change?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, if it prompts more of the humility shown by at least
one member of the government this week _ and if this translates
into a willingness to allow greater openness and freedom in Turkey,
even in ways that challenge the secular creed bequeathed by Kemal
Ataturk in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Turkey's best prospects of becoming a better
governed and more prosperous place may lie in the embrace of the
European Union. Here too some hope emerges from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments have repeatedly snubbed Turkey, refusing to take
seriously its hope of membership and huddling conveniently behind
the objections of its old antagonist, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Eventual Turkish membership would be a matter for delicate
negotiation. But the generous hand held out to Turkey by Greece
this week offers a hope that objections to opening such talks may
yet be overcome. &QL;

<P>
   They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work. This half-serious
summary of communist economics contained a kernel of truth: for
Soviet workers, the freedom to pilfer and dawdle made up, to some
extent, for empty shelves and wretched wages.
</P>
<P>
   Like other illusions, it served a purpose for a while, though
that could not last.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet collapse, a different sort of illusion about
the Russian economy has been cultivated in western capitals as well
as in Moscow: ``You Russians pretend to be creating a law-based,
market-friendly liberal democracy. We westerners pretend to believe
you _ and what's more, we pay you for it.''
</P>
<P>
   This new fiction has also served a purpose. By fostering a
climate of determined optimism, both the American and Russian
governments persuaded voters and skeptical legislators that the
promised land of prosperity and reform was just around the corner.
That was politically expedient.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its virtues, the post-communist illusion was
likewise doomed to be shattered _ if only because Russians and
Americans had such different expectations about the ``promised
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans were led to believe that, for an outlay of a few
billion dollars, Russia could be transformed into a country in
their own image: open to American business and cooperative with
American diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Russians were encouraged to think they could enjoy the benefits
of a market economy without the hard slog; and that economic
strength would enable them to flex their muscles, and defy America,
on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Any remaining illusions about the efficacy of western-backed
reform in Russia have been evaporating over the past few weeks with
exceptional speed. Soon there may be nothing left of them, and
Russian-western relations will have to be rethought from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow could be the broadening probe by America's
federal authorities into one of the largest money-laundering
scandals they have ever uncovered: the apparent use of accounts at
the Bank of New York, as well as at several European banks, to
process about $10 billion in ill-gotten Russian gains.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also want to know whether the Bank of New York
was one of a chain of banks through which at least $200 million may
have been diverted from credits granted to Russia by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   This follows an acknowledgment by the Russian central bank that
it channelled tens of billions of dollars, including money received
from the IMF, into a shadowy offshore company in Jersey _ which
then speculated in a lucrative government-bond market that the
central bank was supposed to be regulating.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's admission that ``we were lied to'' by the Russian
central bank about the location of $1 billion in foreign-exchange
reserves in 1996 has done nothing to allay the suspicion that worse
happened both before and after.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's odder political alliances, American
Republicans and Russian Communists are questioning the IMF's $4.8
billion emergency payout to Russia last year. This failed in its
stated aim of shoring up the ruble and probably provided windfall
profits for Russia's financial oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   With elections looming in both Russia and America, skeletons may
come tumbling out of cupboards at a faster pace than anyone in the
Kremlin or the White House can control.
</P>
<P>
   Far from ``civilizing'' the wreckage of the Soviet economy,
economic transactions between Russia and the West are running the
risk of corrupting the western side, if only by forcing it to wink
at practices that would be outlawed in more established economies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a particular irony in the fact that one western party
is the IMF, whose stated purpose is to propagate the virtues of
sound economic policy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IMF's integrity has been compromised, the cause does
not lie in its own sloppy controls; it lies in the collusion of the
American and Russian governments to cover up failures and press the
Fund into treating Russia with greater generosity than its economic
performance would warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The fibbing cannot go on forever, if only because both Russia
(however imperfectly) and America are lively and rambunctious
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration should clear the air and admit some
hard truths about western policy towards Russia. The real aim is
not to create ideal outcomes, but to avert catastrophe: a hard-line
coup, a civil war, a nuclear leak.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding disaster in a country with tens of thousands of nuclear
warheads is undeniably a worthy aim of policy. But if this is the
main purpose of credits to Russia, then America and other western
nations had far better say so rather than pretend to be rewarding
Russia for its government's less-than-impressive economic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that western governments should be prepared to
take responsibility for whatever emergency aid they give to Russia,
rather than force the IMF to engage in games of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   A policy based explicitly on saving Russia from self-destruction
carries risks too: it creates an incentive for Russia's rulers to
engineer situations that are fractionally short of disastrous, and
then extort credits from the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if western governments suspect the Russian government of
playing this game, they should voice their suspicions _ and make
sure the Russian electorate gets the message. That is better than
conspiring with the Kremlin to deceive voters in both countries. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood
what I said,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, once told a congressman. Wall Street, however, finds the
Fed's message clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market shrugged off the Fed's quarter-point increase
in interest rates, to 5.25 percent, on Aug. 24 _ just as it had the
Fed's previous rate rise two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing interest rates so timidly, the Fed is allowing
investors to believe that each rate rise may be the last. This
belief is dangerously misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic expansion is now 101 months old, and, like
many Americans this summer, the economy is looking uncomfortably
hot. Even if you believed that the country's potential growth rate
had risen thanks to faster productivity growth, its current pace
would still be unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market is getting ever tighter, with widespread
reports of labor shortages; wage inflation is starting to pick up.
The much-touted slowdown in GDP growth in the second quarter
largely reflected a drop in stock-building, which may rebound in
the second half of the year as firms cushion themselves against the
risks posed by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent figures bear out fears that growth in domestic
demand remains too strong. Consumer spending is being fuelled both
by rising share prices and by a borrowing spree. Robust demand is
also sucking in imports, pushing the trade deficit to a record
level in June.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that consumer-price inflation remains relatively
subdued, at 2.1 percent in July, but it is a mistake to take too
much comfort from this lagging indicator when so many other
forward-looking ones are flashing red.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a mistake to turn a blind eye to other worrying
imbalances in the economy. The Economist has long been fretting
about America's financial bubble. But it is not just the level of
share prices that gives sleepless nights; it is also the fact that
it has been accompanied by mushrooming consumer and corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   Negative personal savings and the increase in the private-sector
financial deficit to a record 5 percent of GDP all point the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Spending cannot increase faster than income forever. Faced with
this truism, a prudent central bank would have tightened policy
more aggressively by now. Yet even after this week's rise, American
short-term interest rates are still a quarter of a point lower than
they were a year ago, before the Fed eased in response to the
financial jitters caused by Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   Since inflation has edged up over that period, nominal rates
would need to rise to around 6 percent merely to take real interest
rates back to their level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So long as a buoyant stock market and rampant credit expansion
continue to boost growth, it will take more than a few small
interest-rate rises to slow America's boom. Indeed, such timid
moves may falsely reassure Wall Street that the Fed has everything
safely under control _ encouraging the stock market to ever giddier
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the rest of the world economy, which was a
big concern a year ago, has also perked up. Not only has this put
upward pressure on oil prices, it has also made the dollar less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   America's current-account deficit is likely to widen to almost 4
percent of GDP this year. If foreigners' appetite for dollar assets
wanes, the dollar could tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the dollar's strength over the past two years has helped
to hold down American inflation, any weakening would have the
reverse effect, pushing up import prices.
</P>
<P>
   A vulnerable dollar, a stock market that on most measures looks
hugely overvalued, a monstrous overhang of personal and corporate
debt: all combine to make it more likely that America's boom will
end in a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this will test the revered (if opaque) Greenspan to the
limit. But his dilemma is largely of his own making: it reflects a
failure to tackle America's economic imbalances earlier, before
they had become so severe. &QL;

The much-touted slowdown in GDP growth in the second quarter
largely reflected a drop in stock-building, which may rebound in
the second half of the year as firms cushion themselves against the
risks posed by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent figures bear out fears that growth in domestic
demand remains too strong. Consumer spending is being fuelled both
by rising share prices and by a borrowing spree. Robust demand is
also sucking in imports, pushing the trade deficit to a record
level in June.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that consumer-price inflation remains relatively
subdued, at 2.1 percent in July, but it is a mistake to take too
much comfort from this lagging indicator when so many other
forward-looking ones are flashing red.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a mistake to turn a blind eye to other worrying
imbalances in the economy. The Economist has long been fretting
about America's financial bubble. But it is not just the level of
share prices that gives sleepless nights; it is also the fact that
it has been accompanied by mushrooming consumer and corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   Negative personal savings and the increase in the private-sector
financial deficit to a record 5 percent of GDP all point the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Spending cannot increase faster than income forever. Faced with
this truism, a prudent central bank would have tightened policy
more aggressively by now. Yet even after this week's rise, American
short-term interest rates are still a quarter of a point lower than
they were a year ago, before the Fed eased in response to the
financial jitters caused by Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   Since inflation has edged up over that period, nominal rates
would need to rise to around 6 percent merely to take real interest
rates back to their level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So long as a buoyant stock market and rampant credit expansion
continue to boost growth, it will take more than a few small
interest-rate rises to slow America's boom. Indeed, such timid
moves may falsely reassure Wall Street that the Fed has everything
safely under control _ encouraging the stock market to ever giddier
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the rest of the world economy, which was a
big concern a year ago, has also perked up. Not only has this put
upward pressure on oil prices, it has also made the dollar less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   America's current-account deficit is likely to widen to almost 4
percent of GDP this year. If foreigners' appetite for dollar assets
wanes, the dollar could tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the dollar's strength over the past two years has helped
to hold down American inflation, any weakening would have the
reverse effect, pushing up import prices.
</P>
<P>
   A vulnerable dollar, a stock market that on most measures looks
hugely overvalued, a monstrous overhang of personal and corporate
debt: all combine to make it more likely that America's boom will
end in a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this will test the revered (if opaque) Greenspan to the
limit. But his dilemma is largely of his own making: it reflects a
failure to tackle America's economic imbalances earlier, before
they had become so severe. &QL;

<P>
   ``If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood
what I said,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, once told a congressman. Wall Street, however, finds the
Fed's message clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market shrugged off the Fed's quarter-point increase
in interest rates, to 5.25 percent, on Aug. 24 _ just as it had the
Fed's previous rate rise two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing interest rates so timidly, the Fed is allowing
investors to believe that each rate rise may be the last. This
belief is dangerously misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic expansion is now 101 months old, and, like
many Americans this summer, the economy is looking uncomfortably
hot. Even if you believed that the country's potential growth rate
had risen thanks to faster productivity growth, its current pace
would still be unsustainable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The stir over whether George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has
used cocaine is not the first and will not be the last example of
America's unique ferocity in testing its elected politicians to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before the country takes another lurch towards regarding moral
ambiguity as a disqualification from office, it makes sense to ask:
which questions are legitimate for voters to ask? Which aren't?
</P>
<P>
   Private matters become public depending on what a candidate says
and the nature of the question in hand. For example, adultery in
itself is not a legitimate matter of electoral scrIt becomes
one if a politician, rather than remaining silent on the subject,
proclaims his fidelity or makes great play of ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to speak out is vital because voters have a right
to know whether somebody is lying, and a lie about a personal
matter is a valid gauge of truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Many people argued during the Monica Lewinsky affair that Bill
Clinton was justified in lying in public because it was a private
matter, and anyone would tell lies to protect their marriage. But
lying in public means deceiving the voters and is a legitimate
matter for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's willingness to speak out also helps decide how far
back enquiry can reasonably go. If he or she talks about the
distant past, it opens that period up to legitimate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, that means the past 25 years, the period he says
he has not taken drugs. So far, there is no evidence that he is
telling lies _ and no one has come forward with accusations about
his behavior. On these grounds, then, voters ought to be satisfied
with his answers so far.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the issue also matters. Not all actions deserve
the same degree of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, many people have argued that, since possession of
cocaine is a felony, Bush should reassure voters that he has never,
ever, taken coke.
</P>
<P>
   His friends might reply that, when it comes to setting a
political statute of limitations, there are different kinds of
offense. A crime of violence, for example, is worse than possession
of cocaine, even though both are felonies.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that Bush's incomplete statements reflect a wider
ambivalence in the public attitude towards drugs. Since so many
Americans have taken them, they are more tolerant of this
particular felony than of others.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Lewinsky affair, journalists have justified
any and all enquiries on the grounds that, because candidates have
been talking about restoring the honor and dignity of the
presidency, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems to disagree. But even if a candidate is not
lying, and even if the issue might not justify public scrutiny,
there remains a further test: voters are entitled to ask whether a
candidate is a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, two questions about double standards were
pertinent. First, could he pass the background drugs tests required
of federal employees? Second, and more significant, did his
personal history invalidate his policies towards drugs?
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush has approved a law that allows judges
to imprison people convicted of selling or possessing less than one
gram of cocaine. In the United States, thousands are in jail for
this, some as young as 14.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a minute that he had sniffed cocaine before he was
24. Would it be wrong of him to support mandatory jail sentences
for young cocaine users now?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should be able to change their minds in good faith,
and voters should be willing to let them. Bush ought to be allowed
to say that he has learned from his mistakes and has concluded that
tough anti-drugs laws work (mistaken as he may be about that).
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly have been more convincing if he had said that
he had used cocaine, that that was the temper of the times and it
was this experience which had persuaded him of the need for tough
anti-drugs policies. But he has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simply refuses to confirm or deny. He has chosen to be less
than candid. It is indeed a kind of hypocrisy _ one with which the
American public, not for the first time, seems happy to go along. &QL;

<P>
   DES MOINES, IOWA _ ``I am convinced from evidence in our house
that my husband listened to the grain markets at noon, as he
usually did, heard them go lower, and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enclosed a copy of the letter he left me. It reads:
`The only thing I will regret is leaving (the children) and you.
This farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy, but most
of all grief. All I ever wanted was to farm since I was a little
kid, and especially this place. I know now that is never going to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   This stark letter, written by a farmer's widow to the governor
of Iowa, is an extreme expression of the most severe agricultural
downturn in America since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Iowa State Fair, one of the country's
agricultural showpieces, the talk is gloomy. ``It's the start of
the end of family farming. We can't cover our costs and many will
go to the wall,'' says Leland Fynaardt, of Searsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Severin of Lowden agrees. ``The big guys are coming into
this business,'' he says, while staring bleakly at Rumpelstiltskin,
the winner of the fattest pig in the fair (487 kilos, or 1,071
pounds), who looks like a pink zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are squeezing the heck out of the small farmer and the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the same message is blaring forth: ``It is
not an overstatement to say,'' declares Byron Dorgan, the
Democratic senator from North Dakota, ``that we are approaching the
end-game for family-based agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, it would be a huge change in what is still
America's second-largest exporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, family farms _ a few hundred acres looked after by
a man, his wife and their sons _ have been the weft and weave of
the Midwest. But is family farming really dying?
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic view of one family, with some corn, a few cows,
pigs and chickens on 200 acres _ that died out in the 1960s,'' says
Ray Bardole, who farms 1,400 acres (560 hectares) in Rippey, in
central Iowa's billowing landscape of black earth and waving corn.
</P>
<P>
   He is right: since 1950, the number of farms has fallen from 5.6
million to 2.2 million. Thousands of farmers continue to leave the
land every year, responding to technological changes that have
doubled agricultural productivity over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are different this year. There are unnerving
parallels with the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, which gutted
communities throughout the central states.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, three years of good weather produced bumper crops,
and deep price falls when demand fell in world markets at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been worse. Soybean farmers are harvesting their
third record crop in a row, even while prices have hit their lowest
since 1972, about $4 a bushel. This is less than most farmers' cost
of production. Two years ago, soybeans fetched $8 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in meat prices has been even more dramatic. Last year,
the pork price fell to just $8 a hundredweight. This was even less
than during the Great Depression and a third of the cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Some family farmers will not survive for long. Bankers in the
Midwest are already asking for next year's financial plan even
before this year's harvest is in.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have only survived this long because, in one respect,
they are better off than during the 1980s crisis. Then, the
increase in farm incomes in earlier years had bid up the price of
land, which in parts of Iowa trebled to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the farm woes occurred when the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates to cool off the Reagan expansion, making it
impossible for thousands of farmers to service the debts they had
taken out to buy land at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed raised interest rates this week, farmers'
financing costs are still low compared with what they were in the
1980s. Then farmers' debt-service costs were around 14 percent of
production expenses; they are now 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, then, farmers are in better shape than they were
the last time things got really tough. Still, with prices so low a
renewed shakeout is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1987, the number of farms fell by 250,000. If
the same thing were to happen again, the number would fall to 1.94
million by 2005 _ a 12 percent decline in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of most industries, that would count as a
modest decline. But farmers are not like most other workers _ their
way of life, self-respect and sense of identity are often
intimately entwined with their job.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even those that remain on the land fret that the
relentless growth of corporate farming will leave them as little
more than hired tractor-drivers, a prospect most find humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilbert of the Iowa Farmers' Union explains: ``Turkey and
eggs used to be an essential part of diversified farming. It was
how you learned the business. That's been taken over by one or two
processors. Then came beef. Now three or four packers buy most of
the cattle. Everyone thought it would never happen to pigs. They
were too diversified and easy to raise. But look at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the pig industry has been transformed. Family
pig farms in Iowa, the main hog-producing state (and the
second-largest farm state after California), used to have up to 500
sows, each producing about 20 piglets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, industrial-scale pig warehouses are appearing, with 16,000
sows raising 320,000 piglets a year. The stench from these huge
battery pig farms spreads for miles. But they are only the most
visible and smelliest evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the way in which pigs are marketed. Where
family farmers used to take their piglets straight to market, they
now raise them on behalf of the large warehouse farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a tenth of America's pigs were raised in this
way, under contract. Now two thirds are.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contract-farming system that the family owners now
fear as much as bankruptcy. They have seen poultry, beef, and pig
farming swallowed by the system. The next domino to fall could be
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the firms involved in agriculture, the largest are
already the grain traders and seed producers, most of the latter
owned by big chemical firms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,500) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Last year, Cargill, one big firm, bought the grain-trading
operations of another, Continental. For many, this exemplified the
trend toward greater concentration and monopoly purchasing
threatening farmers. They fear being crushed between these
corporate millstones, and that the big companies will then buy up
their farms.
</P>
<P>
   That is possible. But the pattern of rapidly increasing
consolidation is not quite the unstoppable, Darwinist expansion
that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is nothing relentless or rapid about the
growth of the biggest beef companies. Although a few big firms
dominate slaughtering, it took them 30 years to get to the point
where they slaughter about two-thirds of all cattle, and they still
have only about 22-24 percent of cattle under contract. That share
has been stable for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is nothing mysterious about the rise of these
operations. They succeed where they have a price advantage, as in
the pork business, where superior feeding, veterinary and other
techniques are important. But they do not have this advantage
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, calf raising, which is largely a matter of looking
after cows and calves as they forage, is run by small farmers. It
seems likely that the family grain farms are more like the
calf-foraging operations than the pork factories.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious advantage to size. A typical Midwestern
grain farm is roughly the acreage that one family can farm.
Improvements to tractors or fertilizers make it possible for one
person to look after a slightly larger area each year, so farms get
bigger and a few more people leave.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no technological gain to dramatic increases in
scale. So family farms should survive. But not unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bardole shows how they are changing. His farm provides an
income for himself and his family, and his two sons and their
families. About half the money comes from soybeans and corn. But
one daughter-in-law works in a day-care center; one is a speech
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a pig nursery for a large hog producer. He rents out a
special piece of farm-drilling equipment. And about half of his
soybeans are grown under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I use contract farming as a tool,'' he concludes,
``it's a good deal. If a big company is using me as a tool, then
it's a problem.'' &QL;

   DES MOINES, IOWA _ ``I am convinced from evidence in our house

<P>
   John Gilbert of the Iowa Farmers' Union explains: ``Turkey and
eggs used to be an essential part of diversified farming. It was
how you learned the business. That's been taken over by one or two
processors. Then came beef. Now three or four packers buy most of
the cattle. Everyone thought it would never happen to pigs. They
were too diversified and easy to raise. But look at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the pig industry has been transformed. Family
pig farms in Iowa, the main hog-producing state (and the
second-largest farm state after California), used to have up to 500
sows, each producing about 20 piglets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, industrial-scale pig warehouses are appearing, with 16,000
sows raising 320,000 piglets a year. The stench from these huge
battery pig farms spreads for miles. But they are only the most
visible and smelliest evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the way in which pigs are marketed. Where
family farmers used to take their piglets straight to market, they
now raise them on behalf of the large warehouse farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a tenth of America's pigs were raised in this
way, under contract. Now two thirds are.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contract-farming system that the family owners now
fear as much as bankruptcy. They have seen poultry, beef, and pig
farming swallowed by the system. The next domino to fall could be
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the firms involved in agriculture, the largest are
already the grain traders and seed producers, most of the latter
owned by big chemical firms. &QL;

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,500) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Last year, Cargill, one big firm, bought the grain-trading
operations of another, Continental. For many, this exemplified the
trend toward greater concentration and monopoly purchasing
threatening farmers. They fear being crushed between these
corporate millstones, and that the big companies will then buy up
their farms.
</P>
<P>
   That is possible. But the pattern of rapidly increasing
consolidation is not quite the unstoppable, Darwinist expansion
that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is nothing relentless or rapid about the
growth of the biggest beef companies. Although a few big firms
dominate slaughtering, it took them 30 years to get to the point
where they slaughter about two-thirds of all cattle, and they still
have only about 22-24 percent of cattle under contract. That share
has been stable for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is nothing mysterious about the rise of these
operations. They succeed where they have a price advantage, as in
the pork business, where superior feeding, veterinary and other
techniques are important. But they do not have this advantage
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, calf raising, which is largely a matter of looking
after cows and calves as they forage, is run by small farmers. It
seems likely that the family grain farms are more like the
calf-foraging operations than the pork factories.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious advantage to size. A typical Midwestern
grain farm is roughly the acreage that one family can farm.
Improvements to tractors or fertilizers make it possible for one
person to look after a slightly larger area each year, so farms get
bigger and a few more people leave.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no technological gain to dramatic increases in
scale. So family farms should survive. But not unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bardole shows how they are changing. His farm provides an
income for himself and his family, and his two sons and their
families. About half the money comes from soybeans and corn. But
one daughter-in-law works in a day-care center; one is a speech
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a pig nursery for a large hog producer. He rents out a
special piece of farm-drilling equipment. And about half of his
soybeans are grown under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I use contract farming as a tool,'' he concludes,
``it's a good deal. If a big company is using me as a tool, then
it's a problem.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Illegal substances, and the question of whether or not he
consumed them, have given George W. Bush a spot of bother recently.
In the coming months Bush will, with luck, face equally probing
questions about substance of a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   After months of telegenic grins and a single stump speech, the
Republican front-runner has finally promised a series of policy
speeches. If these are to contain any content at all, it will most
likely come from the governor's chief economic adviser, Larry
Lindsey, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is the man overseeing 12 working groups that are
preparing the Bush economic agenda. Their mission is to give some
meaning to what Bush has so far used as something of a security
blanket, the all-purpose slogan ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Lindsey is enough to understand how he got this
position. Affable, funny, opinionated, and with an evident gift for
explaining complex concepts in plain English, Lindsey is the kind
of economist a straight-talking Texan would warm to.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of that, he is a heavyweight, in the intellectual as
well as physical sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   He was a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers in
the early Reagan years; associate professor at Harvard; author of
``The Growth Experiment'' (a 1990 book that is probably the most
valiant intellectual defense of the Reagan tax cuts); domestic
policy advisor in the Bush Administration; and a governor of the
Federal Reserve for much of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad record for a man who is only 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the Lindsey take on economic policy is pure
mainstream Republican. He talks a lot about incentives and reducing
unnecessary regulation. He favors the partial privatization of
Social Security by diverting a share of payroll taxes into
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Medicare reform that includes choice and means-testing,
lamenting that ``Medicare regulations are four times the number of
pages of IRS regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants greater defense spending. (``We [have] a defense
program run by budget numbers and not by military needs.'')
</P>
<P>
   He wants tax rates ``consistent with sensible incentives'' and
believes that surplus tax revenue should be returned to those who
paid the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so uncontroversial. But there is more to Lindsey than
predictable mainstream opinions, at least judging from his
publications. Although ``The Growth Experiment'' is best remembered
as a staunch defense of supply-side tax cuts, it is the
lesser-known second half that merits rereading.
</P>
<P>
   Here Lindsey set out a tax agenda for the 1990s which might
qualify as a truly radical plan for compassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated a single 19 percent tax rate on all income
(including, flat-taxers take note, on capital gains). The income
threshold up to which no taxes were paid would rise substantially,
but exemptions would be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   His aim was to improve incentives by broadening the tax base and
reducing rates, while at the same time specifically lowering the
tax burden on low and moderate-income Americans. (He suggested, for
instance, extending mortgage-interest relief to poorer tax payers
but limiting its amount, so that the mansions of the rich were no
longer subsidized by the government.)
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond ``The Growth Experiment'' and there is no doubt that
this is a man who cares deeply about tax and regulatory impediments
facing lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He claims an early personal lesson in how red tape is a
proportionately bigger burden for the small guy: in college Lindsey
faced reams of red tape when trying to set up a summertime hot-dog
stall. The experience seems to have scarred him for life.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had professional experience with anti-poverty policy
(as a governor of the Federal Reserve he chaired the Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation, a small government agency that promotes
urban renewal efforts). And he is currently writing a book that
asks whether, and why, the market fails in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the intellectual ingredients for a radical,
compassionate conservative agenda exist. But radicalism is unlikely
to be the hallmark of a Bush agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor would doubtless gulp at some of the more
populist ideas in Lindsey's 1990 book. It is hard to imagine any
Republican, compassionate or otherwise, depriving rich homeowners
of their tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And, steeped in the murky reality of policy advice, Lindsey
himself has become a staunch proponent of incrementalism. Taking
policy changes gradually, he now conveniently claims, makes
economic as well as political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he is too much of a political operator to try and rock
the Republican boat by pushing too far or too fast in any
direction. Nonetheless, he appears to offer at least the glimmer of
a sensible, long-term Republican tax agenda: low rates, fewer
exemptions, and better incentives, especially for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if Lindsey's predictions about the American
economy are correct, then a President Bush in 2001 will not have
the luxury of concentrating on such long-term matters. For Lindsey
has made no secret of the fact that he considers the American
economy to be suffering from an asset-price bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledges there have been fundamental
improvements in America's economy, he has no doubt that Wall Street
is overvalued. As far as he is concerned, the only real issue is
how painful the inevitable bursting of the bubble will be.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, in testimony to Congress, he argued that a tax
cut was needed as an insurance policy against future recession.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy roaring along, his arguments were discounted
(probably rightly) as an opportunistic attempt to justify the
Republicans' political agenda with clever-sounding economics.
Neither then, nor now, does the American consumer's appetite need
fueling with tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, if Lindsey's bubble analysis is correct, the sharp drop in
stock prices he fears might well be followed by economic slowdown,
and perhaps a recession. Then fiscal loosening could be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting to know that Bush is being advised by someone
who is thinking seriously about what to do in bad times as well as
good. On the other hand, if the governor really shared his
adviser's pessimism, he might be wiser not to run at all. &QL;

HARRIS-LEWIS OFFER TO SETTLE REJECTED BY DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis have offered to settle
the medical malpractice lawsuit against her late husband's chief
cardiologist, Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. for no more than $5 million _
the ceiling on Mudge's malpractice insurance coverage _ but the
offer has been rejected, setting the stage for a second trial.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the case said Thursday that Harris-Lewis and
her attorneys have made a ``very constructive offer that was within
(Mudge's) insurance company's ability to pay, and even offered to
donate a substantial portion to medical research at a
Harvard-related medical facility into the condition that killed''
Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement proposal was spurned, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge heads the cardiac transplantation unit at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated institution.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., declined to comment on
the settlement offer, but said he anticipates a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing to try the case again,'' Dailey said
Thursday. ``It is unlikely that the case is going to be settled.''
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the case said a chief stumbling block to
a settlement is resistance by Risk Management Foundation, the
Cambridge, Mass. company that insures all Harvard-affiliated
doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Risk Management ``doesn't want to budge,'' said the source. The
company did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles attorney Jerome Stanley, Lewis's former agent,
contended that it is Mudge who is unwilling to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said in a statement issued Thursday that ``the greed and
arrogance of Dr. Mudge'' had caused settlement talks to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Thursday afternoon, Mudge declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not some crazy settlement proposal,'' said a a friend
of Harris-Lewis familiar with the case. ``This was well within
reason. This was constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is not receptive,'' the source added, referring to
Mudge. ``He figures he escaped once, he's got to escape again.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June, after nearly seven weeks of testimony and six days
of deliberations, a 15-person jury could not agree on whether Mudge
was negligent in his treatment of the Celtics star before his 1993
death. After the jury deadlocked twice, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith
declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed and died while shooting baskets at Brandeis
University in July 1993, two months after Mudge had diagnosed him
with a benign fainting condition, not the serious heart condition
found by a team of a dozen prominent doctors consulted by the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and three consulting doctors for
malpractice in May 1996. Two of the consultants, Drs. Peter L.
Friedman and Mark A. Creager, were cleared of negligence by the
same Suffolk Superior Court jury that deadlocked on Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has appealed those verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth party, Dr. John D. Rutherford, paid Harris-Lewis
$500,000 in a settlement before the case went to trial. The
settlement did not require Rutherford to admit guilt or
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, defense attorneys for Mudge, Friedman and Creager
suggested that Lewis's death was caused by his own failure to
follow doctor's orders to avoid strenuous exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's lawyers argued that Lewis's death was the result
of inferior care by an ego-driven doctor whose main goal was
contradicting the team of high-powered medical experts who already
had concluded that Lewis had a life-threatening heart condition and
would probably never play basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis and Mudge are to meet Sept. 10 for a
pretrial ``status conference'' at which Fremont-Smith is expected
to query both parties on settlement possibilities.

TARSES OUT AS ABC'S TOP PROGRAMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tumultuous reign of Jamie Tarses, the first woman to head a
network entertainment division, ended Thursday with her resignation
as president of ABC Entertainment under apparent pressure from
higher-ups at the network.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster of the 35-year-old Tarses occurs just days after ABC
Group chairman Robert Iger, responding to a Newsweek report that
Tarses would be asked to resign, issued a statement saying: ``It is
simply untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own statement Tarses said that ``sweeping changes in the
entertainment industry dictated necessary, competitive changes at
ABC, and I feel that the time is right to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   When last season ended, ABC was looking up at rivals CBS and NBC
from the No. 3 spot. Now, the network faces turmoil at the top with
the fall season slated to begin in one month.
</P>
<P>
   A mere three years ago, Tarses went to ABC after a stint at NBC,
where she helped create ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.'' In addition to
being the first woman to serve as chief programming executive, she
was also one of the youngest entertainment division presidents the
TV industry had seen.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, she lavished attention on ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' a hit show
for the network, and was a strong supporter of ``Sports Night,'' an
innovative but ratings-challenged show.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the start, the adjective ``embattled'' was
appended to her name, as Tarses was constantly dogged by rumors she
was on the verge of being fired. In an appearance before TV critics
in Pasadena, Calif., in January 1998, she added her own humorous
twist to such speculation, striding onstage as the lyrics from a
rock song blasted from speakers: ``I get knocked down/but I get up
again/you're never gonna keep me down.''
</P>
<P>
   She was resilient. Indeed, in an indication of the
precariousness of life at the top of a network these days, Tarses
had served in her position longer than any head of entertainment at
the six broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the constant scrutiny and the reports in
newspapers and on showbiz TV shows like ``Access Hollywood'' wore
her down, according to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week she's fired, she's out, she's gone, and it hasn't
been true,'' the friend said. ``But she just said, `You know what?
I'm not having fun anymore.' She just felt it was time to pick up
her marbles and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Tarses has quit, the friend said, ``I've never seen her
happier. She's finally got her life back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses is the third top entertainment executive to be forced out
in the past year. Previously, Warren Littlefield of NBC and Peter
Roth of Fox were shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive situation among the networks is so intense
now, because of the declining share of the viewing audience they
have, that you won't see any program boss have a long tenure,''
remarked TV historian Alex McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a no-win job,'' he added. ``You'd have to be very
lucky to come up with quality and highly rated shows three years in
a row. It's just a tough gamble to be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Tarses grew as ABC ended last season in third place,
behind CBS and NBC, in terms of total viewers. When it came to
viewers age 18 to 49, the prized demographic for which advertisers
pay premium rates, ABC also finished third, behind NBC and Fox. Her
position was also weakened when ABC and corporate parent Walt
Disney Co. merged its TV production divisions recently, placing
them in the control of cochairmen Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun.
That left observers wondering what would remain for Tarses to do.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Tarses said that ``ABC is well positioned to
turn the corner next season, and with the creative team in place,
they have all the momentum to see the network to the next level,''
and added that ``I wish everyone well.''
</P>
<P>
   Iger, in a statement, said: ``Jamie is a creative talent whose
abilities are well-recognized in the entertainment business. We
very much appreciate her tireless commitment and energy in helping
shape our prime-time efforts.'' Bloomberg said that ``Jamie's
contributions to ABC have been significant during her three years
here, and my respect and admiration for her have only grown during
the time we've run this division together.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Hold those grudges at bay
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when editors looked for ``feel-good'' stories for their
newspapers _ the kind of story that made a reader feel good when he
read it.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, more often than not, it seems the paper is filled with
feel-bad stories.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one from USA Today: ``Holding a grudge hazardous to
health.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that you ought to feel bad if you can't forgive your
enemies, and for good reason. Your own health will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Probably so. Jesus taught that we should forgive our enemies.
Only problem, His enemies didn't go along with it. They bore a
grudge. He bore a cross.
</P>
<P>
   This current concurrence of the 2,000-year-old admonition comes
from the National Institute of Healthcare Research in Rockville,
Md. Loose quoting from USA Today follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Growing evidence shows that people inclined to forgive others
enjoy better mental and physical health than those who hold
grudges.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refusal to forgive is most common among people with high anger
and fear levels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Humility encourages people to let go of slights or betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who feel that they themselves have been forgiven in the
past are more likely to forgive others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Those with high esteem readily forgive themselves, but
sometimes find it harder to be as generous when dealing with
others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Depressed, angry people have the most trouble forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guilt is good. If you feel bad about a grudge, you're more
likely to forgive readily.
</P>
<P>
   _ From a health standpoint, heart rate and blood pressure rise
and moods worsen for those who dwell on the hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Not to argue with the National Institute of Healthcare Research
when they are on the side of the angels, but I've known folks with
hate in their hearts who work especially hard at maintaining their
own health.
</P>
<P>
   Such is their incentive for outliving an enemy. They want to be
around to dance on his grave.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, here's a parable that a friend passed along to me
on the very subject, called ``The Wolves Within.''
</P>
<P>
   An old grandfather said to his grandson, who came to him with
anger at a schoolmate who had done him an injustice, ``I, too, at
times have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much,
with no sorrow for what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But hate wears you down, and does not hurt your enemy. It is
like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have
struggled with these feelings many times.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It is as if there are two wolves inside me; one
is good and does not harm. He lives in harmony with all around him
and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will
only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the other wolf, ah! He is full of anger. The littlest
thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights everyone, all
the time, for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is
helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me,
for both of them try to dominate my spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy looked intently into his grandfather's eyes and asked,
``Which one wins, Grandfather?''
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather smiled and said, ``The one I feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus couldn't have said it better.
</P>

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &UR; Good morning, folks. This is your pilot, Captain Johnson. &LR;
<P>
   &UR; As we wait for clearance to take off, I'm finishing my &LR; 
 &UR; coffee, and I feel very perky, yet at the same time I feel like &LR; 
 &UR; staggering glassy-eyed to a corner of the cockpit and lying down &LR; 
 &UR; to drool and pee on myself. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight American Airlines employees were busted for
smuggling drugs and weapons aboard A-A flights in Miami. The sting
operation started after an A-A pilot was served coffee accidentally
laced with heroin. Oops!
</P>
<P>
   The employees even smuggled hand grenades in the overhead
storage compartments, which explains why there's never any room up
there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What section would you prefer to sit in, sir _ snorting, &LR; 
 &UR; shooting-up or live ammo? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An A-A spokesperson actually said, ``We view these kind of
incidents as proof that the (surveillance of employees) program
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents?!
</P>
<P>
   An incident is the flight attendant slopping lasagna sauce on my
good necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight employees, bags of heroin and military explosives
jammed into the landing gear and hidden in the plane _ that kind of
stuff is downright annoying.
</P>
<P>
   TEN OUT OF TEN pedestrians, according to my informal, ongoing
poll, have not the vaguest clue what those blinking red hands and
``Don't Walk'' signs mean.
</P>
<P>
   My study has found that there are two kind of people who totally
ignore those signs _ people who walk and people who drive.
</P>
<P>
   Corner of Fifth and Mission Thursday, I saw a woman pushing an
infant in a baby carriage. Big red hand is up, but she barges into
crosswalk, leading with the baby. Two steps and the signal light
turns red and buses and cars honk at her.
</P>
<P>
   Miffed, she retreats to the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of another tragedy, a 7-year-old boy killed in a
crosswalk this week, Supervisor Mark Leno called for more
pedestrian signals.
</P>
<P>
   We kill a very high percentage of pedestrians in this city.
Maybe we could issue a few tickets, to let drivers know they're not
in the Indy 500. Or hire more crosswalk guards, since the city is
in a hiring and job-creating mood.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll bet the solution is not more of those expensive
pedestrian signals that waste valuable electricity.
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR CANDIDATE FRANK JORDAN'S camp had to be heartened by the
news that Willie Brown's get-out-the-vote people are going into the
city's jails to register voters.
</P>
<P>
   Because when Willie's current campaign manager Jack Davis was
running a previous Jordan campaign, Davis' stated philosophy was
that registering prisoners was strictly a last-ditch, desperation
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   THE QUESTIONS they ask you at the airline ticketing desks were
probably a little different at American Airlines, Barb Burgelin
speculates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What type of drugs and weapons will you be smuggling onto &LR; 
 &UR; this flight? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THE GREAT wheel of life: At BART's 12th Street station in
Oakland, the escalator is under repair. I can imagine your
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the public informed, there is a chart listing the 12
steps of the repair (yes, escalators have 12-step programs), from
``Start'' to ``Completion.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone has penciled in a 13th step: ``Start again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAS ANY suspicious person approached you and asked you to &LR; 
 &UR; carry anything onto the flight? If not, would you like one to do &LR; 
 &UR; so? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WANT GANGSTA RAP, played at bone-vibrating volume, with all the
bad words, as you and the kiddies shop for that Barney video?
</P>
<P>
   At the S.F. Shopping Center, Goody got it!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN JUST a moment, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be starting &LR; 
 &UR; today's in-flight movie, ``Up in Smoke,'' starring Cheech and &LR; 
 &UR; Chong. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU remember Scott Barry, you watch waaay too much football.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 49ers' sixth-round pick in '84, a quarterback who
lasted all the way to the end of the exhibition season before being
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's reliving that brilliant career in his ``Solo Gig
Squared'' show at Il Teatro 450 (thr/Q)exq

<P>
   BEIJING _ The unassuming old Chinese cobbler who works on a
narrow city alley suddenly realized he risked getting locked up. So
he took the logical step and stopped doing his daily meditational
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes sure everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to practice Falun Gong, but now I know it's not good,''
he announced out of the blue to a foreigner who stopped to chat.
``It was a good thing the government explained this.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has not merely ``explained'' the evils of Falun
Gong to average Chinese like Liu Donghua, the 73-year-old who
quietly tends to broken shoes and zippers from his tiny alleyside
chair.
</P>
<P>
   It outlawed the popular regime of meditation and exercise, and
has blanketed this nation of 1.2 billion people with an unrelenting
propaganda barrage that even government supporters describe as
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese followers of Falun Gong were detained at
least briefly, and thousands more like Liu now have renounced the
sect and its charismatic founder Li Hongzhi, who lives in exile in
New York. In coming weeks the movement's core leaders are expected
to be charged here and tried for crimes related to undermining
social order.
</P>
<P>
   Why this attack-dog response to a spiritual, mental and physical
regimen that draws on respected, centuries-old Chinese traditions
such as Buddhism and Taoism? Or is Falun Gong really something more
insidious?
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's communist power elite knows its country's history.
Such moralistic or quasi-religious movements undermined past
Chinese regimes, from the Donglin Society in the 1600s to the
Taiping uprising against the Qing rulers in the 1850s, as Chinese
unhappy with their lives became mesmerized by teachers promising to
show a better way.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the wake-up call jolted Beijing on April 25, when
10,000 Falun Gong members suddenly showed up at the capital,
quietly ringed the seat of government at Zhongnanhai compound and
protested their failure to win official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The top leadership soon discovered that Falun Gong encompassed
not just cobblers, but military officers, educated professionals
and even Communist Party members. The group had set up 39 teaching
centers, 1,900 places of instruction and more than 28,000 group
exercise venues. It had also published books and produced videos,
and kept it all connected with high tech communications via
Internet, phone and fax.
</P>
<P>
   It was organized, and to an autocratic Communist regime that
does not countenance any other independent organizations, that
meant it was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Falun Gong was banned.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long drumbeat of government-sponsored propaganda against
the group has included daily articles in newspapers and
testimonials televised day and night from Chinese telling how their
lives or their loved ones were ruined by the practice of Falun
Gong. The tragedies included suicides and deaths from refusing
medical treatment, supposedly under Falun Gong influence.
</P>
<P>
   The promise last week(CQ) to prosecute key organizers carried a
pledge to go lightly with those who see their error and give up the
practice. But it also drove another wedge in relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe people should be persecuted or prosecuted
simply for peaceful assembly or for exercising their religious
beliefs or practices, as long as they are not harming anybody,''
said U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   China gave its normal response: keep out of our internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falun Gong is an anti-scientific, anti-human, anti-social,
anti-government and illegal organization with all the
characteristics of an evil religion,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese government claims that Falun Gong has wreaked both
personal physical harm and broader societal damage are countered by
the group's response that it promotes a simple, take-it-or-leave-it
philosophy for better living.
</P>
<P>
   Li Hongzhi, 48, only devised the movement in 1992 as another
sibling in the Qi Gong (pronounced, ``Chi Gong'') family of
meditational exercise and martial arts. In America, the best-known
is Tai Chi.
</P>
<P>
   Until he started studying Qi Gong, Li was known for nothing
remarkable; playing the trumpet at a military stud farm while he
was a conscript in the People's Liberation Army and later working
in security at an agricultural enterprise in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Li managed to attract as many as 70 million Chinese
adherents to his five meditational exercises, four done standing
and one seated. Slow-motion arm movements combined with clearing
the mind are said to relax and free the practitioner from stress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in this time of change and uncertainty, some argue, the
greater attraction was his moral dictum to cultivate zhen-shan-ren
_ or truthfulness, compassion and forbearance _ while eschewing
unhealthy habits like cigarettes and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government's claims of anti-scientific teachings
have some basis in Falun Gong literature, all of which has been
banned.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Web site speaks to the ``supernormal capabilities''
of Li and other masters of meditation, such as ``penetrative'' and
``remote'' sight permitting them to see through objects and miles
distant. It suggests they can ``remove the evil spirit and pull out
the root of the disease'' from a person who is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falun Gong defenders say they never propose
``disturbing the normal state of human society'' by using these
supernatural powers on a wide scale, the message certainly could be
bent in the mind of a mentally challenged or physically sick person
seeking comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Falun Gong has preached, and whatever average Chinese
truly think about it today, the government hit a societal nerve
when charging the movement incited disturbances and fostered
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Liu the cobbler, who had practiced Falun Gong for nearly two
years and said he is in great physical shape, nonetheless seemed to
have dropped it effortlessly. The explanation may lie in another
comment he made, when asked to cite the best change in China in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social stability,'' he said. ``It's improved peoples' lives in
every way.''

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ The protest camp perches on a rocky
hilltop next to the bullet-riddled hulk of an old tank. A Puerto
Rican flag snaps in the stiff August breeze, while far below waves
dapple the azure Caribbean in a panorama that tourists would gladly
pay to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no tourists on this remote tip of Vieques, a small
island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast. The protestors here are
illegally occupying a U.S. Navy bombing range, determined to end
the decades of military activity they say has brought environmental
destruction and hampered economic development on their 20-mile-long
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because this is a form of oppression,'' said Pedro
Zenon, 21, a student who has camped on the remote target zone for
more than 100 days. ``We are tired of the Navy bossing us around.
It's time for all of our island to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides anxiously await the recommendation of a
Clinton-appointed panel probing use of the bombing range --
although there have been indications in recent days that the
report, which is due Tuesday(Aug. 31), may be delayed until at
least mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle over the Navy's 60-year presence on
Vieques, which the Navy considers essential for combat training,
has become a sore spot in the often-touchy field of U.S.-Puerto
Rico relations. In a rare show of unity, the island's normally
fractious political parties _ who argue endlessly over the
perennial question of statehood _ have joined hands in a call for
the Navy to leave Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy lives by an outdated philosophy,'' said Ruben
Berrios, a member of the Puerto Rican Senate and head of the
Independence Party, who also has logged more than 100 days in the
protest camp. ``They are still living in the image of (Gen.
Douglas) MacArthur the conqueror walking through the waves. That no
longer applies. We are fighting for the right to command our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has dominated newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico all
summer, ever since a native-born security guard was killed by a
wayward bomb on Vieques in April. Protests in the capital of San
Juan have swelled with thousands of marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The tumult has crossed the Atlantic, too, stirring awareness in
the vibrant Puerto Rican communities in Florida, New York and New
Jersey. A large protest is planned in New York City next month, and
civil rights icon Jesse Jackson has joined the cause, recently
visiting Vieques to pledge support.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has even appeared on the radar screen of U.S.
presidential candidates, with former senator and Democratic hopeful
Bill Bradley calling the Navy's activities ``unacceptable'' during
a recent visit to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, also has
weighed in on the issue. He has appealed to President Bill Clinton
to look for alternatives that might end the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ perhaps mindful of the large Puerto Rican vote in New
York, where his wife is a likely U.S. Senate candidate _ has
already appointed a commission to investigate. The panel listened
to several days of angry testimony in visits to Puerto Rico and
Vieques, but, perhaps indicative of the situation's sensitivity,
may delay its recommendations well into next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, meanwhile, has responded to the growing protests by
insisting the bombing range on Vieques is unique and irreplaceable,
the only spot in the Atlantic basin where it can conduct full-scale
war games complete with submarines, aircraft carriers, battleships,
landing craft and air power. Even U.S. NATO allies use the practice
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just bombing for the sake of bombing,'' said Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Garcia. ``We're asking our young men and
women to do very risky jobs, and we need to train them like they
are going to actually fight. Vieques is unique because it's the
only place in the U.S. that we can bring all of the elements of an
integrated battle group together for that training.''
</P>
<P>
   All war-making practice on the island has been suspended since
the security guard was killed, although the Navy is clearly eager
to resume its exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the protestors are just as adamant. Puerto Rico's Attorney
General, Jose Fuentes Agostini, has hired the Atlanta law firm of
King and Spalding to prepare a lawsuit to block any efforts to
resume the bombing. The suit would be filed should the Clinton
commission recommend re-opening the Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was a much different place in the early 1940s when
the Navy opened its bombing range. After coming under U.S. control
in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the island remained
poverty-stricken for decades, with little political clout in the
U.S., even though its residents were considered American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the crisis-wracked early days of World War II, there was
little protest when the Navy condemned 22,000 of Vieques' 33,000
acres, moving small farmers and sugar cane workers off their land
to the island's center.
</P>
<P>
   But there was resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my grandfather's land and house and paid him $30,''
said Rabames Trinidad, 46, a lifelong resident. ``They came through
with front-end loaders and took it all, scooping up his house and
dumping it on a little cleared spot where he was supposed to move.
He was never the same after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents soon grew accustomed to the sound of Navy planes
droning overhead, followed by the whump of exploding ordnance.
Houses shook and dust from the bombing sometimes filled the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say many residents left, looking for work on Puerto Rico
or in the nearby Virgin Islands. But there were new Navy jobs for
locals as security guards, and there were new island residents _
lots of sailors _ who patronized local bars and restaurants,
creating new economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With these opportunities, however, also came new tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say the sailors sometimes ran wild on leave, carousing,
engaging in drunken brawls, even molesting island women. Although
the Navy long ago moved all but 25 of its personnel off the island,
the resentments still simmer. Even today, signs are posted on the
outskirts of the village of Esperanza, warning the military that
the area is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the bombing,'' said Trinidad, recalling the
history of tension. ``It's all of this in the past, which we cannot
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Vieques isn't the U.S. military's only possession in Puerto
Rico: the island is also home to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station; the
Army's Fort Buchanan; a Naval security group; a Coast Guard air
station; and two Puerto Rican National Guard facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of Puerto Rico has achieved a modest
prosperity in the past three decades, Vieques and its 9,300
residents are struggling to evolve into something more than a
military target range. While their 3.8 million neighbors on the
main island of Puerto Rico have attracted manufacturing firms and
built a bustling tourism industry, Vieques resembles the Caribbean
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Small farms dot the island's central uplands, livestock
occasionally wandering into the narrow, winding roads. Fisherman
venture out daily from Esperanza, riding the choppy waves in
brightly-colored boats to dive or line-fish for grouper, snapper
and dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita income is only $3,000 a year, less than half the
figure for the rest of Puerto Rico, and unemployment is nearly 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small but growing tourism industry, with several
guesthouses catering to tourists looking for an alternative to San
Juan's dizzy casinos and discos. A small General Electric plant
employs a few dozen workers, while a government-sponsored resort is
rising on the island's west side.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders want more, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that beach,'' said Jorge Adams, 44, a fisherman and
lifeguard, who recently chauffeured a visitor by boat around part
of the island. ``What big hotel chain wouldn't like to build there?
How many jobs would we have from that? But who wants to come here
and listen to bombs exploding?''
</P>
<P>
   But just getting the Navy to shut down the bombing range and
leave Vieques isn't the islanders' only concern. They also want the
sailors to clean up the environmental damage caused by the bombing
and to help jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental damage is clear _ years of bombing have
devastated the 900-acre target area. Shrapnel, debris, shell
casings and bomb parts litter the landscape, along with the rusty
remains of vehicles used as targets. There are likely unexploded
bombs, along with what the Navy admits is a small number of
armor-piercing bullets tipped with spent uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen claim the bombing has devastated their livelihood,
damaging the coral reefs that harbor fish and help spawn the marine
food-chain.
</P>
<P>
   There is an even more troubling claim.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques is saddled with Puerto Rico's highest rate of cancer _
27 percent greater than any other Puerto Rican town, according to
government statistics. Residents blame the bombing, and want
reparations for the illnesses. The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry is looking into the allegations, although its
report may take many months to compile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vieques' residents wait patiently, enjoying the
temporary bombing halt, hoping it soon will be made permanent. If
the Navy refuses to leave, they vow the protest camps on the
bombing range _ already in place for more than three months _ will
grow. Any attempts to remove the protesters by force will only
bring more Navy opponents, they promise, along with a new round of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has the last word,'' said fisherman Jose Anibal
Guerra, 54. ``I think he is going to tell them they have to go. If
he lets them stay, there will be more protests and fights. The Navy
has to leave Vieques. They have become our enemy.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the former Soviet Union, Big Brother may not be
watching you any longer, but he'd like a peak at your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's security service, the FSB, the main successor to the
Soviet-era KGB, is tapping into most of the country's Internet
service providers under a federal directive that allows it sweeping
powers to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But one crusading Internet company in the southern city of
Volgograd has balked, and has launched a legal challenge in what
could be the first privacy-rights fight of its kind in
post-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to use the Internet without fear that
someone is watching them,'' said Nail Murzakhanov, 33, general
director of Bayard-Slavia Communications in Volgograd, a city of 1
million on the banks of the Volga River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are relying on their grandfather's methods,'' he said,
referring to the Soviet spy agency. ``That's not the way Russia is
supposed to work today.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, FSB agents came to the firm's offices to demand a list
of his clients and the ability to read their e-mail. The agency
also wanted the Internet provider to buy the thousands of dollars
of equipment its agents would need to carry out its electronic
snooping, and train them how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to shut him down if he did not comply,
Murzakhanov said, and soon afterward the company abruptly lost its
lease on the Moscow-based satellite service it used.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 850 clients in the Volgograd region can e-mail
each other on the local network, but are cut off electronically
from the outside world. Murzakhanov said he and other employees of
the company received personal threats if they did not drop their
objections to the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians in Russia say the regulations, known as
SORM-2, violate the spirit of Russia's constitution by giving the
government vast and unchecked powers of surveillance, similar to
the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   In theory under the regulations, the FSB would need a warrant to
monitor e-mail exchanges. But the rules also require that a ``black
box'' be attached to every Internet system, allowing agents to sit
at computer screens in the FSB offices and tap via a high-speed
fiber-optic line into the e-mail exchanges anytime they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet providers must render assistance. But access to the
(Internet) system should be carried out by a court order and under
the rule of law. Not this way,'' said Ina Zemskova of St.
Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman declined to discuss the new regulations or the
Volgograd case with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the routine business of hunting spies and criminals, the
United States and most advanced countries maintain
intelligence-gathering networks capable of intercepting telephone
calls and data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent flap erupted in the European Union over the reach of
the U.S. National Security Agency, the super-secret spy
organization that specializes in eavesdropping. With the help of
the British government, the NSA reportedly has established a system
to monitor every e-mail, fax and telephone call made in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The task for countries large and small has become more difficult
and expensive in the Internet age, requiring security services to
gain greater technical expertise and expensive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In cash-strapped Russia, the FSB wants it done for them. The
SORM-2 regulations _ SORM is the acronym, when translated from
Russian, means System for Operational-Investigative Activities _
require telecommunications companies to shell out thousands of
dollars to equip the FSB, or risk losing their licenses to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 companies provide Internet services to an
estimated 1 million computer users in Russia, mainly in the larger
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies had their arms twisted and were compelled to
get the equipment,'' said Andrei Shipilov, editor-in-chief of
Komputerra, an on-line and published Russian-language computer
magazine based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, where corruption is rampant, Shipilov suggests
that many companies may simply be able to bribe their way around
the rule to avoid giving the FSB access to their systems.
</P>
<P>
   More than just individual rights of privacy are at stake, say
computer and legal experts. In Russia, the FSB's system also could
be used for corporate espionage. After the Soviet Union fell in
1991, many of the KGB's top agents left to enter the lucrative
field of corporate security and many still have ties to the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``If providers grant the FSB this kind of access, the
information could be sold to the highest bidder,'' said Viktoria
Yevgorova, a journalist who writes for Russia's Libertarian
movement.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain just how far and wide the new rule has been
applied.
</P>
<P>
   The SORM-2 rules were written in 1998 by the FSB and the State
Communications Agency and enacted this year. The new rules updated
a 1995 version that applied only to telephone, fax and pager
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have been slow to be applied because of the highly
technical nature of the Internet and the inconsistent way
regulations are enacted in Russia, varying from region to region.
Because they are administrative regulations and not law, they
required no presidential or legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Milechko, an official with GlasNet, one of Russia's
largest Internet providers, said his company has not yet been
approached by the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, MTK-Mobile, said it and other firms have slowed
the process by seeking negotiations with the FSB. ``In practice, we
know we have to do something but we need to know the legal basis
and the technical specifications,'' said Alexei Volchkov, the
company's technical director.
</P>
<P>
   In its first legal step, Bayard-Slavia Communications asked the
local prosecutor to take up the case as a constitutional matter and
file an appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the law on the
public's behalf. The prosecutor refused in an Aug. 18 reply,
stating that the FSB had the legal authority to pursue its
monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the company plans to appeal to the nation's chief
prosecutor. If that fails, it will file a lawsuit directly with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to fix this problem in silence. We want to
overcome this problem publicly so all will know that there is
nothing to fear,'' said Murzakhanov, head of the Volgograd Internet
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the sophisticated nature of Internet
technology, the FSB is probably reading the e-mail only of those
with nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the FSB is only going to have access to ordinary
users. Anyone engaged in espionage or criminal activity will easily
get around it using encryption software that the FSB doesn't have
the means to decipher,'' said Shipilov, the computer magazine
editor.

 &HT;    Texas group fights to keep gas additive out of use
 &HT;    By Mike Elswick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ The courts may decide the fate of a
controversial gasoline additive that has caused friction between
several East Texas cities and the state's environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on the gasoline additive methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether has
been sought by officials from Longview, Marshall and Tyler as the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission considered rules to
require a cleaner burning gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from those cities did not contest the state requiring
gasoline that would contribute less to air pollution. But they did
object to MTBE, a common additive that has been used in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Longview, Marshall and Tyler have filed a petition in the Travis
County District Court, said Victoria LaFollett, city of Longview
community relations manager. TNRCC recently passed rules that will
bring about the use of cleaner burning gasoline in 95 counties in
eastern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The East Texas cities asked the agency to prohibit MTBE use. But
despite those requests _ made during hearings, in writing and at
public meetings _ TNRCC implemented the requirement for mandatory
use of cleaner burning gasoline, without banning MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   The petition filed last week seeks to have the Travis County
District Court declare that TNRCC's rules concerning the use of
cleaner burning fuels are inconsistent and violate state law,
LaFollett said. The petition also calls the rules ``arbitrary and
capricious, invalid for failing to substantially comply with
procedural rule making requirements and preempted by federal law,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, TNRCC spokesman, said it is agency policy not to take
a stand on a case pending in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our policy on MTBE and cleaner burning gasoline hasn't
changed,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   LaFollett said MTBE is highly soluble in water, should it leak
from storage tanks or be involved in spills.
</P>
<P>
   It has an offensive taste and odor and is considered a potential
human carcinogen, she said. In states like California and Maine,
where MTBE has been used for several years, officials have cited
problems with contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from all three cities testified at TNRCC's hearing in
late June, LaFollett said. Despite their concerns and the pending
issuance by the Environmental Protection Agency of a special report
on MTBE, TNRCC passed the ruling without the ban on MTBE, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks later, the EPA's panel reported that there should
be immediate nationwide action taken to reduce the use of MTBE in
gasoline,'' LaFollett said.
</P>
<P>
   Longview Mayor David McWhorter said the EPA's recommendation
reinforced the belief that East Texans have been on the right side
of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading air quality for water quality is totally unacceptable,
especially as demands for our water intensify,'' McWhorter said.
``We will continue our efforts to convince TNRCC to change its
position on MTBE _ even though we have filed this legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter also said TNRCC's own studies have demonstrated that
the use of cleaner burning fuel in East Texas would have
inconsequential impact on ozone pollution levels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   LaFollett said the petition filed by the cities and the outcome
could be precedent-setting in the MTBE debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first decision following the EPA's Blue Ribbon
Panel's findings,'' she said. It is also the first case where local
opposition has arisen to rules allowing MTBE as a gasoline
additive, LaFollett said.

 &HT;    Some of God's creatures more equal than others
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ We had finished a leisurely Saturday
morning breakfast. I was on my way outside to dust Sevin on some
pole beans that managed to survive both the summer's drought and a
record infestation of Japanese beetles when my wife brought up the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you ought to consider joining one of the environmental
groups,'' she said. I was shocked at her suggestion, even more so
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were going to join anything, I'd join the Moose Lodge,''
I replied. ``I hear good things about the Happy Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious,'' she said. ``You really need to think about
what you've been doing to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What have I been doing to the environment?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It mostly has to do with your garden,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you mean,'' I replied. ``My garden caused that
earthquake in Turkey.'' I recognized another ploy to discourage me
from having a garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be silly,'' she said. ``After some things I learned from
the newspaper this morning, I'm afraid you are terribly
environmentally incorrect. You may be a mass murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' I replied. ``I haven't had my shotgun out
of the closet since quail season ended last February.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you spray the grass all around the place when the Inman
church had that outdoor revival?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``If I hadn't, the mosquitoes would have eaten
the preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says in the newspaper that when you did that spraying you
didn't just kill mosquitoes. You caused the sickness and eventual
deaths of millions of tiny creatures, many of them so small they're
invisible to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I should hope so,'' I replied. ``I paid almost $30 for
that stuff I used to mix the spray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you killed a lot of things besides mosquitoes,'' she
insisted. ``They were God's creatures, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it,'' I answered. ``The Bible says forgive
70 times 7, and at my age I don't think I'll have to spray
mosquitoes for over 69 more outdoor revivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' I asked, ``what part of the newspaper are you
reading? I've never seen Walter Reeves write anything like that in
the Home and Garden section.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faith and Values section,'' she answered. ``It says that
God doesn't see any difference between a weed and a flower, so
people shouldn't use poisons that seep into ground water just so
they can have a green lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish God had spoken up earlier,'' I replied. ``I've always
favored dirt yards like we used to have in the country. They're a
lot cheaper and easier to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You also need to stop putting out stuff to kill fire ants,''
she continued. ``It says that if you're at a picnic and an ant
comes along, you should let him, or her, crawl onto a napkin where
he, or she, can be carried to safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly what are you reading?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A column by a very nice lady who points out that all God's
creatures were put here for a purpose and should be treated
equally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean you and I are the same as a pair of bumblebees as far
as God is concerned?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sort of what it says,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you read in a column isn't necessarily true,'' I
explained. ``Newspaper columnists will write almost anything when
they're on deadline. I wonder why editors let some of their stuff
run in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Editors are a lot more enlightened than they were in your
day,'' she replied. ``They're careful to let people voice differing
opinions and to make news stories fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right,'' I agreed. ``I'll bet if fire ants lived in
condominiums, Ron Martin would hate them just as much as I do, but
he wouldn't let his personal prejudice slant stories about them,
even though they are known to kill house pets and small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the Faith and Values columnist say anything about termites
and powderpost beetles?'' I asked. ``We spent a small fortune
getting rid of them when we were fixing up the Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything,'' she replied, ``but we've been doing
the wrong thing about roaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong about calling an exterminating company?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And cause the roaches to die a slow and painful death?'' she
answered. ``When you see a roach running across the kitchen floor
you're not supposed to stomp him, or her. You're supposed to coax
him, or her, into a jar and then carry him, or her, outside to a
place where he, or she, can continue to enjoy life.''
</P>
<P>
   I admit I'm antiquated and somewhat insensitive, and perhaps
it's true that God watches over cockroaches and Japanese beetles as
diligently as he watches over sparrows. I'm not sure I'm ready to
become a card-carrying environmentalist, but I'll try to do better.
For starters, I apologize to all those boll weevils I murdered with
calcium arsenic when I was growing up on the farm, trying to get a
bale of cotton to the gin.

 &HT;    Only an independent probe can restore Justice Dept.'s reputation
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Attorney General Janet Reno promises to find out
the truth about FBI actions during the final assault on the Branch
Davidian compound six years ago that ended in an inferno and the
deaths of 76 men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard that before. Why should we think that this time
will be any different?
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with promising to come clean and then get
caught in a lie. Who is going to believe you the next time you
promise to come clean.
</P>
<P>
   After denying flatly to Congress and the public for six years
that the FBI did not fire ``pyrotechnic'' tear-gas canisters into
the Davidian's Mount Carmel compound, Reno and the FBI have had to
admit that those denials were false.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden reversal occurred only after Reno and FBI officials
were confronted with physical evidence recovered from the Mount
Carmel ashes and held in storage by the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   By ordering a new investigation into what actually transpired
when she authorized the FBI to launch a tank and tear-gas assault
on the compound April 19, 1993, Reno said, ``It is absolutely
critical that we do everything humanly possible to learn all the
facts as accurately as possible and make them available to the
Congress and public.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said much the same thing in 1993 before her Justice
Department produced a three-volume, 1,000-page self-examination
that found the FBI, which reports to her, blameless, if not
faultless.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be blamed if they did something wrong,'' she
said in defense of her praise-filled whitewash of an
``investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of credibility, Reno should have called for an
independent investigation into Justice Department and FBI conduct
during the siege and the final assault. She didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, President Clinton should have ordered Reno
to follow the example of the Treasury Department's independent
investigation of the actions of its Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents in the planning and initial raid on Mount Carmel. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When it became obvious that neither Reno nor Clinton were going
to call for an independent investigation, members of Congress
should have pushed for an outside investigation of unquestioned
credibility. They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats appeared afraid that an independent investigation
would hurt the young Democratic administration. Politicians on both
sides of the aisle didn't want to risk appearing on the side of a
well-armed apocalyptic cult that killed four ATF agents.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, America's media also appeared eager to move
on to other stories.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a credible investigation accompanied by full
accountability of all decisions and actions at the Branch Davidian
compound became apparent on April 19, 1995, when 168 innocent men,
women and children were killed by a horrific truck bomb at the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   This cowardly terrorist attack on a government building and its
occupants occurred on the two-year anniversary of the FBI assault
on the Branch Davidian's Mount Carmel compound. It soon became
apparent that the timing was no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   I have never thought that any government official or agent
wanted to physically harm any of the Branch Davidians, even David
Koresh, the cult's anti-government, child-molesting, messianic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, bungle, lie and cover-up with outrageous
arrogance and precious little accountability.
</P>
<P>
   When will we learn?
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, this time there must be an independent
investigation of Justice Department and FBI actions during the
standoff and the final assault. The investigation also should
determine why Reno's first self-investigation misled Congress and
the American people.

 &HT;    Millennium fizz: Top champagnes may sell out early
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's bad enough the Y2K bug has us worried about our
food supplies and bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the bubbly, too?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. Rumors of a Y2K champagne shortage have been greatly
exaggerated. If you wait until December, you'll still be able to
find something sparkling for your millennium toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people wait, they may not get the particular brand they
want, and they'll pay more for it than they'll pay now,'' said
Michael Bishop, wine director for the metro-area Green's Beverage
Stores.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how the notion came about that there
wouldn't be enough champagne to satisfy the world's appetite for
toasting a new age.
</P>
<P>
   Some trace it as far back as a 1995 Morgan Stanley report
predicting a worldwide champagne shortage. The report was quickly
reversed, but the rumor was born and over the past few years,
newspaper and magazine articles, and no doubt some in the champagne
industry, have kept it alive.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean-Louis Carbonnier, director of the Champagne Wines
Information Bureau in New York, said stocks in the cellars of the
Champagne region of France have at least three year's worth of
shipments, and vineyard conditions are good this year.
</P>
<P>
   No wine produced outside the Champagne region can claim to be
champagne; but some California sparkling wines can hold their own
and may be an alternative for those who can't find the champagne of
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonnier said more demand than usual for finer champagnes may
make certain brands scarce. Bill Yorks, the buyer for Prestige Wine
Wholesale in Marietta, agreed. ``Names everyone knows like Dom
Perignon will be hard to find. If you don't buy it by October or
November, you won't find it,'' Yorks said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop agreed, saying the top-of-the-line ``luxury cuvee''
champagnes will become increasingly scarce, as will the second tier
vintage champagnes. ``We had 90 bottles of Vueve Clicquot, but it's
all gone. Normally we don't sell out until November or December,''
said Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien, a wine specialist with Tower Beer and Wine stores,
said he's also been getting requests for fine champagnes. ``One
woman came in and was looking for 36 bottles of Cristal, which
costs $150 a bottle,'' said O'Brien. ``We won't be able to find
that many.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also been getting requests for large bottles. Champagne
comes in a range of sizes beyond single bottles, from magnums (the
equivalent to two bottles) to the behemoth Nebuchadnezzar (20
bottles' worth.)
</P>
<P>
   Even the better known nonvintage champagnes, which are the least
expensive, might be hard to find come December, though lesser-known
brands should remain available, the wine sellers said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the brand, consumers can expect to pay more for
it the longer they wait. Yorks said champagne producers such as
Moet &AMP; Chandon are unrolling three price increases this year.
Bishop said a nonvintage Clicquot that sold for $29.99 this past
December now sells for $35.99, and the price could go up again.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, folks may want to go ahead a buy a few bottles
and then store them in an unlit area where the temperature is
stable, preferably around 60-65 degrees. You can store bottles
upright or on their sides, but do not store it in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing here is the uncertainty,'' said O'Brien, who
compared it to pre-Olympic planning. ``It may turn out to be
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you're the better-safe-than-sorry kind, buy now. After
all, there's never any harm in having a little champagne in the
house.

 &HT;    New book series reader friendly and durable
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sterling, that most prolific publisher of books on
woodworking, has a couple of interesting new series going.
</P>
<P>
   One is Workshop Bench References, spiral-bound volumes with
tear-proof covers and chapters that have easy-to-find tabs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, I've seen volumes on the bandsaw and the scroll saw. The
band saw reference is done by Mark Duginske, who has written a
number of authoritative works on the tool.
</P>
<P>
   The sections cover components and features of the tool, blades,
alignment and adjustment procedures, cutting techniques, the use of
patterns and templates, jigs and fixtures and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The technique that Duginske pioneered for cutting dovetails on
the bandsaw is included, and if you don't have this procedure
outlined elsewhere, it's worth the $18 this book costs.
</P>
<P>
   To my taste, it's the only worthwhile jig-assisted way of
cutting dovetails. That's because it's the only way I've seen that
allows virtually the same freedom in sizing the the pins as
hand-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   If you're cutting half-dovetails for drawers or joining
something a foot wide or more, router-cut joints are OK. But when
it gets down to dovetails in relatively narrow boards, router-cut
dovetails reveal their nature by the clunkiness of the pins.
</P>
<P>
   Duginske's bandsaw method will make dovetails that look as
though they were cut by hand. Of course there's nothing to stop you
from cutting them by hand, but unless you're one of those rare
genuises you'll need to cut an awful lot of joints before you start
making really clean ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other series is called ``Two Books in One,'' and it's a very
strange feat of publishing. So far we have Woodcarving and
Woodturning in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Like the benchtop books, these are spiral bound and have tough
covers. But inside, each page is actually two separate sheets, so I
suppose this is where the ``two books in one'' comes from.
</P>
<P>
   The top sheet, which is the larger, presents projects. The
bottom sheet discusses techniques.

<P>
   EDIT-RENO27-COX _ From the 1993 raid in which nine people died
to the tear-gas assault 51 days later that resulted in flames and
death, federal handling of events at Mount Carmel has been a
maddening succession of missteps, misstatements and outright lies.
(Waco Tribune Herald).
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ ``If you don't have anything
in your car, you don't have anything to worry about.'' That's what
a Texas state trooper told a friend of my daughter's after he was
stopped on Interstate 20 and for the third time in three months
told that an officer needed to search his car for drugs. (Walker,
Longview News-Journal).
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ ``Holding a grudge hazardous to health,'' the
headline said. Not to argue with the National Institute of
Healthcare Research when they are on the side of the angels, but
I've known folks with hate in their hearts who work especially hard
at maintaining their own health. Such is their incentive for
outliving an enemy. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Attorney General Janet Reno
promises to find out the truth about FBI actions during the final
assault on the Branch Davidian compound six years ago that ended in
an inferno and the deaths of 76 men, women and children. We've all
heard that before. Why should we think that this time will be any
different? (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ I never used illegal drugs.
Not once. Ever. I wish I could say this is because I was, in my
tender youth, a fine upstanding and God-fearing young man, but it
just isn't so. I was, however, a father-fearing young man and my
father the cop had made it plenty clear to me that if I was caught
with drugs he would see to it that I was put in the deepest,
darkest cell with an inmate whose nickname was ``Boyfriend.'' I
believed him when he told me that 30 years ago and I believe it
now. It was surely enough to keep me on the straight-and-narrow.
(Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I admit I'm antiquated and
somewhat insensitive, and perhaps it's true that God watches over
cockroaches and Japanese beetles as diligently as he watches over
sparrows. I'm not sure I'm ready to become a card-carrying
environmentalist, but I'll try to do better. For starters, I
apologize to all those boll weevils I murdered with calcium arsenic
when I was growing up on the farm, trying to get a bale of cotton
to the gin. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ This column will not move today. (McCarty,
Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-NEWT29 _ News of his affair has exposed Newg Gingrich
to charges of hypocrisy, not to mention a substantial bit of
snickering. Some of that's deserved. The man who decried what he
called ``a multicultural, nihilistic hedonism that is inherently
destructive of a healthy society,'' and who blamed liberals for
Woody Allen's affair with his stepdaughter and for Susan Smith's
murder of her two children, can't expect much sympathy when the
chickens come to roost on his own bedpost. However, on the most
specific and damaging charge of hypocrisy _ that Gingrich was
bashing Bill Clinton for immorality even while he himself carried
on with a House employee _ the issue is a little more complicated.
Because even as other Republicans were calling Clinton everything
up to and including rapist, Gingrich largely refrained. The record
of that period instead reveals Gingrich struggling with a deeply
personal dilemma. (Bookman, Atlanta Constitution). FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Generation X-ers who remember the olden times
B.MTV. (Before MTV) can only stare dumbfounded at the sight of the
American Medical Association throwing in with a Democratic-led plan
for federal regulation of the practice of medicine. (Tom Teepen is
national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR
SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ This is the lousy part. There is a
storm out there, somewhere between there and here. It's sitting,
deciding which way to go, growing in strength. And you don't know
when to panic. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News
Service.) Eds: This column moved Thursday for immediate release.

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service
in the Washington bureau.) MOVES THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

 &HT;    Writer romances readers
 &HT;    By Anntoinette Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Rosalyn Alsobrook always thought she would
write a book, ``when I
</P>
<P>
   was old and wise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for thousands of readers of women's fiction,
Alsobrook didn't wait, writing her first romance novel in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The resident of Gilmer, a community of 5,400 in Northeast Texas,
is working on her 30th romance and recently was honored with the
1999 Rita, the Romance Writers of America's Lifetime Achievement
Award.
</P>
<P>
   It is named after Rita Estrada, who founded the writers' group
in 1981. Alsobrook is one of the original 40 members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Romance Writers of America might be 200 people.
We're almost to the 9,000 mark, and 700 of those are published,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook said she is honored to be in the company of past Rita
winners such as Sandra Brown and Janet Daily.
</P>
<P>
   After her name was called out at the July 31 awards ceremony in
Chicago, Alsobrook said she sat there a moment because she couldn't
quite believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful. I got home with mine and just put it on my
desk for inspiration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook's career as a romance writer began because she enjoyed
reading romances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, she was reading ``Tears of Gold'' by Laurie McBain.
Alsobrook could tell by McBain's photo on the book jacket that she
was about Alsobrook's age.
</P>
<P>
   She showed the photo to her husband, Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and said, `Couldn't you write a book like
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   When she went to bed that night, a glimmer of an idea occurred
to her. She got up and wrote it down in a composition book. That
idea became Alsobrook's first romance novel, ``Thornbush Blooms,''
set in Gilmer in the 1800s and published by Tower Publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was writing longhand, and I had a baby and I was working
full time, so it took me about a year to write it,'' Alsobrook
said, adding that she had just read the history of Upshur County.
She spent 11 months writing in longhand and then about a month
typing the manuscript. She sent it to six publishing companies, and
one bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook recently has returned to writing after taking a
two-year break to take care of her mother, who was ill. Her 30th
book _ a historical romance with a working title of ``Man of Honor
`` _ will be published in fall 2000 by Avon Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two little old ladies in this book _ they're based on
my aunts. They are pretty eccentric. They have a problem focusing
on more than one thing at a time, and that gets them into
trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is set in fictional Pine Bend, Texas, in 1887, which _ if it
were a real place _ would be located near Jefferson, Alsobrook
said. The heroine is the guardian of the two little old ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be a control freak. When you're writing
a book, you're 90 percent in control. Your characters have 10
percent control. They have gone off in areas I didn't want them
to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook said she ``always has movies running in her head,'' so
coming up with plot ideas is not difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the oddest times, ideas will hit me. I always seem to have
a pen but never something to write on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook uses East Texas as the setting for about every other
novel that she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to research when the mosquitoes die or what kind
of snakes there are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of research Alsobrook does depends on whether
settings or characters drive the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to allow the reader to see it all. ... To have them get
the full flavor, they have to see it, smell it, taste it and hear
it,'' she said. ``In my head, I'm really there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook has written several novels set in Pennsylvania,
including three that involve the Johnstown Flood. She traveled to
Pennsylvania to research those books.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Johnstown Flood books, the flood played a large
part,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides contemporary and historical romances, she has written
paranormal romances with ghosts and paranormal romances with time
travel. Her Seascape series was set in a haunted bed-and-breakfast
in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Her two favorite books are ``Wild Western Bride,'' which she
wrote for her father, and ``Time Storm,'' her first time travel
book.
</P>
<P>
   She dedicated ``Wild Western Bride'' to her father, who was
depressed after having a leg amputated. In the novel, the hero also
has a leg amputated and thinks he has nothing to live for until two
orphan boys enter his life, Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was telling my dad he had something to live for,''
his two grandsons, she said. Her father died before she finished
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first best seller. I guess all the emotion I was
pumping into it showed,'' Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   She also enjoyed writing ``Time Storm,'' her first nonhistorical
romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There for a while, time travel was hot. Then ghosts were hot.
And I had such a meddlesome ghost (in the Seascape series) that
those were fun to write,'' Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   In romance novels, ``the relationship is important and being
able to overcome all kinds of odds and still maintain that
monogamous relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They must have a strong conflict from the very start that
continues until it is resolved by the characters at the end of the
book, Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the character manages to solve the problem against all
odds, that makes a good book. I have a definite set of readers who
like the fact that I don't write the really detailed love scenes.
... I allow the readers to use their own imagination,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Romance writers have more freedom in what they can write about
than they used to, Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're allowed to use issues more, such as spousal abuse, child
abuse. If you have something you're campaigning for, you're allowed
to put that in a book. You can explore these issues if you're not
preaching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Alsobrook took time off from writing to take care of her
mother, she was writing two books a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much I missed writing until I went back
to it. After having two years when I had no control over my life, I
finally had control over something, my characters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my really close friends are writers. They were having
books come out and I was still at the 'one-day' stage: 'one day
I'll write again,' `` Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Romances are popular because they always have a happy ending and
a monogamous relationship, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no matter what trials and tribulations they go through,
they always come out on top and with a happy future. And the way
the world is today, most women have to have that. They've got to
have hope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook, who grew up in Daingerfield, and her husband live in
Gilmer, where he is an automotive parts representative. They have
two adult sons, Anthony and Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   She helped found the East Texas chapter of Romance Writers of
America, which has about 40 members, eight of whom are published.
</P>
<P>
   Writing romances ``gives me an outlet for my creativity. When
it's going well, I'm on a high like you wouldn't believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love computers. I love the Internet. I do a lot of my
research now on the Internet,'' said Alsobrook, who has a Web site
at http://home.earthlink.net/(tilde)ralsobrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``In romance, you have everything,'' she said. Writers can focus
on romantic suspense, paranormal settings, humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are even futuristics, if you want to write sci-fi,'' she
said, adding that her favorite romance authors are Judith McNaught,
Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Lorraine Heath, Pamela Morsi and McBain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does give you any avenue you want. No other genre can say
that. We're really a culmination of all the genres,'' Alsobrook
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   _ 40 percent of paperback books purchased in the United States
are romances
</P>
<P>
   _ Romance generates about $1 billion annually in sales
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, 2,020 romance novels were released and 182 million

   KIDSHEALTH-SLEEP _ School starts soon, which means school-age
kids will start becoming sleep-deprived soon. The typical schoolday
schedule virtually guarantees that, which puts children's doctors
at odds with their educational administrators. ``They start so
early, that's a horrendous thing for kids,'' says Greg Ramey, a
pediatric psychologist at The Children's Medical Center. ``We just
sometimes fail to recognize that even older kids need lots of

   EDIT-RENO27-COX _ From the 1993 raid in which nine people died
to the tear-gas assault 51 days later that resulted in flames and
death, federal handling of events at Mount Carmel has been a
maddening succession of missteps, misstatements and outright lies.
(Waco Tribune Herald).

   WALKER-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ ``If you don't have anything
in your car, you don't have anything to worry about.'' That's what
a Texas state trooper told a friend of my daughter's after he was
stopped on Interstate 20 and for the third time in three months
told that an officer needed to search his car for drugs. (Walker,

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ ``Holding a grudge hazardous to health,'' the
headline said. Not to argue with the National Institute of

I've known folks with hate in their hearts who work especially hard
at maintaining their own health. Such is their incentive for
outliving an enemy. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Attorney General Janet Reno
promises to find out the truth about FBI actions during the final
assault on the Branch Davidian compound six years ago that ended in
an inferno and the deaths of 76 men, women and children. We've all
heard that before. Why should we think that this time will be any

<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ I never used illegal drugs.
Not once. Ever. I wish I could say this is because I was, in my
tender youth, a fine upstanding and God-fearing young man, but it
just isn't so. I was, however, a father-fearing young man and my
father the cop had made it plenty clear to me that if I was caught
with drugs he would see to it that I was put in the deepest,
darkest cell with an inmate whose nickname was ``Boyfriend.'' I
believed him when he told me that 30 years ago and I believe it
now. It was surely enough to keep me on the straight-and-narrow.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I admit I'm antiquated and
somewhat insensitive, and perhaps it's true that God watches over
cockroaches and Japanese beetles as diligently as he watches over
sparrows. I'm not sure I'm ready to become a card-carrying
environmentalist, but I'll try to do better. For starters, I
apologize to all those boll weevils I murdered with calcium arsenic
when I was growing up on the farm, trying to get a bale of cotton
to the gin. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ This column will not move today. (McCarty,
Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-NEWT29 _ News of his affair has exposed Newg Gingrich
to charges of hypocrisy, not to mention a substantial bit of
snickering. Some of that's deserved. The man who decried what he
called ``a multicultural, nihilistic hedonism that is inherently
destructive of a healthy society,'' and who blamed liberals for
Woody Allen's affair with his stepdaughter and for Susan Smith's
murder of her two children, can't expect much sympathy when the
chickens come to roost on his own bedpost. However, on the most
specific and damaging charge of hypocrisy _ that Gingrich was
bashing Bill Clinton for immorality even while he himself carried
on with a House employee _ the issue is a little more complicated.
Because even as other Republicans were calling Clinton everything
up to and including rapist, Gingrich largely refrained. The record
of that period instead reveals Gingrich struggling with a deeply
personal dilemma. (Bookman, Atlanta Constitution). FOR SUNDAY

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Generation X-ers who remember the olden times
B.MTV. (Before MTV) can only stare dumbfounded at the sight of the

HARRIS-LEWIS OFFER TO SETTLE REJECTED BY DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis have offered to settle
the medical malpractice lawsuit against her late husband's chief
cardiologist, Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. for no more than $5 million _
the ceiling on Mudge's malpractice insurance coverage _ but the
offer has been rejected, setting the stage for a second trial.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the case said Thursday that Harris-Lewis and
her attorneys have made a ``very constructive offer that was within
(Mudge's) insurance company's ability to pay, and even offered to
donate a substantial portion to medical research at a
Harvard-related medical facility into the condition that killed''
Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement proposal was spurned, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge heads the cardiac transplantation unit at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated institution.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., declined to comment on
the settlement offer, but said he anticipates a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing to try the case again,'' Dailey said
Thursday. ``It is unlikely that the case is going to be settled.''
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the case said a chief stumbling block to
a settlement is resistance by Risk Management Foundation, the
Cambridge, Mass. company that insures all Harvard-affiliated
doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Risk Management ``doesn't want to budge,'' said the source. The
company did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles attorney Jerome Stanley, Lewis's former agent,
contended that it is Mudge who is unwilling to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said in a statement issued Thursday that ``the greed and
arrogance of Dr. Mudge'' had caused settlement talks to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Thursday afternoon, Mudge declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not some crazy settlement proposal,'' said a a friend
of Harris-Lewis familiar with the case. ``This was well within
reason. This was constructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is not receptive,'' the source added, referring to
Mudge. ``He figures he escaped once, he's got to escape again.''
</P>
<P>
   In late June, after nearly seven weeks of testimony and six days
of deliberations, a 15-person jury could not agree on whether Mudge
was negligent in his treatment of the Celtics star before his 1993
death. After the jury deadlocked twice, Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith
declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed and died while shooting baskets at Brandeis
University in July 1993, two months after Mudge had diagnosed him
with a benign fainting condition, not the serious heart condition
found by a team of a dozen prominent doctors consulted by the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and three consulting doctors for
malpractice in May 1996. Two of the consultants, Drs. Peter L.
Friedman and Mark A. Creager, were cleared of negligence by the
same Suffolk Superior Court jury that deadlocked on Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has appealed those verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth party, Dr. John D. Rutherford, paid Harris-Lewis
$500,000 in a settlement before the case went to trial. The
settlement did not require Rutherford to admit guilt or
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, defense attorneys for Mudge, Friedman and Creager
suggested that Lewis's death was caused by his own failure to
follow doctor's orders to avoid strenuous exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's lawyers argued that Lewis's death was the result
of inferior care by an ego-driven doctor whose main goal was
contradicting the team of high-powered medical experts who already
had concluded that Lewis had a life-threatening heart condition and
would probably never play basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis and Mudge are to meet Sept. 10 for a
pretrial ``status conference'' at which Fremont-Smith is expected
to query both parties on settlement possibilities.

THERMOSTAT WARS: SOME LIKE IT HOT _ AND SOME DON'T 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CAROL RUST 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's warfare, cruel and unrelenting. Enemies move
surreptitiously down the hall, guerrilla-style, clandestinely
clicking the thermostat up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Women wear flannel and sweats in August. Men kick off covers,
then sheets. Then they shout, as if interrogating the universe:
``Who's been messing with the air conditioner?''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, it becomes all-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   It's the real Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Couples are battling for control of the thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   And the hotter the weather, the hotter the tempers, although the
conflicts may seem good-natured, even comical at times.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Sussman household. Their go-to-bed ritual is always the
same. Robin, a free-lance food writer, will come into the bedroom
where her husband, Philip, is getting ready to go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's freezing in here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not,'' says Philip, who likes to keep the thermostat
in the upper 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is,'' Robin says, then gets in bed and pulls up the
extra covers on her side nearly over her head to keep her ears
warm.
</P>
<P>
   At bedtime, they find themselves lingering around the den or
kitchen. ``Whoever goes to bed last, they get their way with the
thermostat,'' says Philip, who is in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is not a quiet conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' he says. ``It's out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   And that includes the winter _ Philip refuses to use the heat.
Robin walks around in a coat, as she often is forced to do in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Hawkins is another veteran of a thermostat war. Maggie,
who says her Popsicle toes may never thaw, battles her hot-natured
husband every night about running the ceiling fan. She says she was
unprepared for an Arctic way of life when she married John, an
elevator technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that (hot-naturedness) about him when I was
dating him,'' she says. ``We could go to the movies, and I was
never comfortable, and he always was, but it didn't click.''
</P>
<P>
   And each morning, she goes from a ``freezing'' house to a
``freezing'' public relations office. It's unlikely she'll ever
defrost.
</P>
<P>
   But she does what she can at home. ``When I walk down the hall,
I turn up the thermostat, and he'll yell, `don't touch the
thermostat,' and I'll say, `it just happened to cycle off when I
went by.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sure it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's winning, but he doesn't realize I'm constantly
turning up the thermostat,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biggest problem is sleeping,'' Maggie says. ``We have
a ceiling fan, and we fight over whether we turn it on or off. And
we have a water bed, so we fight over the water temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   (The water temperature controls are on her side, and she keeps
the water as warm as a heating pad, John says.)
</P>
<P>
   The only time the two were in agreement was when Maggie was
pregnant and hot all the time. But now things are back to normal _
and freezing. And, because he is backed by three hot-natured
children _ 6, 4 and 1 _ he usually gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Maggie and John, some couples never mention the
temperature issue, but it is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Flori Meeks, an account executive for a public relations firm,
and her schoolteacher husband, Rick, are constantly following each
other down the hall to change the thermostat back to where it was
before the other touched it. Flori prefers the temperature in the
75- to 79-degree range, while Rick is more comfortable at 72
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   And the warfare goes on quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both know what's going on, and we just keep changing the
thermostat. We never say anything about it. We have a wonderful
relationship, other than that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a cold-natured Michelle Weiss has complained
about the temperature so much that she doesn't think it registers
anymore with her husband, Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an old argument that it's not an argument anymore,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The two work together, but their environments are controlled by
separate air conditioners at Engineered Protection Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But at home, he says, ``I keep cranking things down, turning on
fans; she turns them off, she opens the windows; I shut them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her to go put something on,'' he says. ``I just have my
shorts and T-shirt on, and I can't take anything else off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a passive, low-intensity warfare. It's probably just
a physiological difference. Some low-intensity warfare is good for
a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Short, an attorney with Short and Jenkins, considers
himself a defeated man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, this is a firm with seven lawyers, and I'm the only
male, five female legal assistants, five female secretaries and a
female office manager. They all want the office warm,'' he says.
``They treat me like a child anyway _ they tell me I'm only
imagining that it's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   All that wouldn't be so bad, except that he goes home to a wife
and three daughters, ``who all want it hot. Even my black Lab is a
female, and she sides with the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend my life saying, `You can put clothes on, but I can't
take mine off,''' Short says.
</P>
<P>
   But not all women are cold-natured. Take Elyse Lanier, wife of
former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier. ``You could hang meat in one of
our rooms,'' she says cheerfully. ``If I could get the thermostat
down to 55, I'd be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this hot-natured woman was chairing the Houston
Image Group when hot flashes became a part of her life. ``I was at
a phase of my life where I had to deal with a lot of people,'' she
says. ``I had a fan beside me, a hand fan in my desk and the
temperature as low as I could get away with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of embarrassing when you're at a meeting with all
men,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers how hard it was on her husband's chief of staff,
Dave Walden, who wasn't particularly hot-natured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd cross my legs and cross my arms and drink coffee, but I
would be dying, I was so cold,'' Walden recalls of his visits to
the Laniers' home and offices.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob Lanier suffered a mild heart attack in June 1998, he
had to take blood thinner as part of his treatment, which makes
many people cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even just to get it where I was comfortable, he still had on a
jacket, sweater, hat, a space heater at his feet, corduroy pants
and a blanket over his lap to stay warm,'' Elyse Lanier says.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he doesn't mind putting on extra clothes, although
not as many are necessary when he's not taking blood thinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `fortunately' because I don't even think he knows where
all the thermostats are,'' she says. ``I feel it's OK if they want
to control the remote for the TV, but the air conditioner is
something else.''

COLORFUL ASSESSORIES INVADE NEUTRAL TERRITORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fashion trends for fall and winter have some exciting news
for shoppers _ patterns, furs, bright colors and a world of
accessories. But when it comes down to the clothes women will
depend on in their day-to-day lives, the emphasis remains on
neutrals.
</P>
<P>
   Black, gray,and white top most retailers' noncolor charts for
fall clothing. Although most designers include camel as well as
their favorite colors (almost as afterthoughts), the prevailing
opinion is that women have no intention of abandoning the security
of neutrals.
</P>
<P>
   Their position on neutrals was years in the making and included
decades of subtle and not-so-subtle preaching about how their male
counterparts achieved success through dress. Dressing primarily in
noncolors became the hallmark of a man poised for success. Now that
women get it, don't expect them to jump back into a world of
head-to-toe color at the drop of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Color will come but gradually. While the fashion forward will
let rip with brights, most women will be content to add colorful
sweaters and accessories to neutrals.
</P>
<P>
   Boring? Probably not for the majority of women who view neutral
clothing like the major food groups and colorful, fun accessories
as their just deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Many neutrally colored fashions for fall will look new again.
Consider a gray pantsuit with a peacoat instead of a traditional
jacket. Or a camel-hair coat with a fluffy fur collar worn with a
camel sweater and trousers for all the panache of Marlene Dietrich.
Or snowy white separates that can be worn with black or in a pure
statement of white. Or the many sleeveless tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   What also makes many of these neutral clothes look new is a
profusion of details _ tucks, pleats, wraps, zippers and trims.
There are even sweaters with detached sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   What is really at work here is a realization by designers,
retailers and women that fewer, better clothes in neutral shades
can do double and triple duty in their wardrobes. Change their
accessories and they have a completely different look.
</P>
<P>
   The growing trend to casual clothing is conspiring in this new
direction. Women are learning that the good black pantsuit they
wear to work goes out to dinner or even a cocktail party with red
satin slingback pumps and a pretty evening bag. And a slim daytime
skirt, worn with a sweater set, can be replaced with a long, satin
ball skirt for even formal events.
</P>
<P>
   The new casualness means that fabrics such as tweed, felt, knits
and wool flannels are considered proper for dressy occasions. A
black beaded sweater with black-and-white tweed pants or a black
ribbed turtleneck with a beaded black sarong skirt are examples.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses also enter into this versatile equation, especially the
neutrally colored coat dress, a polished look that can tackle most
situations, day or evening.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, dress-length coats are being worn as jackets over
pants. Add a belt to complete the look and a pair of high-heeled
pumps to dress it up.
</P>
<P>
   One problem that confronts women is how to mix colorful
accessories with neutral basics. The answer is as simple as
throwing caution to the wind _ for what looks newest also looks
thoughtless.
</P>
<P>
   Did the wearer stumble out of bed and into her closet, picking
up any old thing? Probably not, but that's the effect. Using
neutrals as the foil for fabulous or fantasy accessories takes the
worry out of choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Handbags and footwear lead the accessory pack, but choices
extend to stoles, shawls, muffs, elbow-length gloves, caps and all
manner of jewelry, from elaborate bead chokers to chunky leather
cuff bracelets. The emphasis is on how one individualizes a look
without overdoing. Less is still more.
</P>
<P>
   If one adds a fabulous, attention-riveting bag to an ensemble,
her shoes and belt must fade into the background. If tasseled,
two-tone leather mules cover her tootsies, she must keep her purse
in check _ not in printed cowhide. If chandelierlike earrings drip
from her ears, she should not pile on a necklace or bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   What pulls the fall neutrals-plus look together is grooming.
Hair is meticulously cut and shined. Makeup is polished, even
though it may at first appear totally natural. What doesn't look
natural are deep berry or wine-kissed lips and defined eyes, color
and lines that betray attention to detail. &QL;

TRUTH IS OUT THERE ABOUT LINUX OS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, a reader asks why I never write about Linux,
the sometimes free, Unix-like operating system that's the geek fad
du jour. My answer is usually a straightforward one: I write about
mainstream computing, of which Linux is not yet a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But wait!'' they inevitably counter. ``Linux has come a long
way. It's ready for prime time. It's a serious alternative to
Windows. It's more stable, with lots of applications, and you
certainly can't beat the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am an operating system kinda guy. I was a Windows 95 beta
tester, and I really enjoyed learning the nuts and bolts of it.
Indeed, I am one sick puppy _ I actually enjoy editing the Windows
Registry.
</P>
<P>
   So, I figured I'd give Linux a chance and install two different
versions of it on a spare computer. I wanted to see if it was
indeed as evolved as its proponents kept telling me.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Caldera Systems' OpenLinux 2.2 ($50), and Red Hat
Software's Red Hat Linux 6.0 ($80). Both use the same core
component of Linux, version 2.2 of what's called the kernel, but
add their own features and extra software.
</P>
<P>
   You can get other versions of Linux, including some that are
free. Linux is what's known as ``open source'' software, which
means that anyone can distribute it and even try to improve on it,
so long as their changes are also made freely available. There's
even a free version of Red Hat Linux available from the company's
Web site at www.redhat.com, and a ``tryout'' version of OpenLinux
at www.caldera.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NOT FOR YOUR AVERAGE NOVICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After having installed these two packages, let me say up front
that I have not become an instant Linux expert. What you're about
to read here are the impressions of an experienced Windows user
trying to set up and run a different operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the bottom line: No, this is not ready for prime
time, and don't try this at home, kids.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, and despite slick user interfaces that differ
between packages, Linux is still Unix, with all that it entails. In
order to make Linux do what you want it to, you would have to know
a lot more about the guts of the operating system than most
consumers care about.
</P>
<P>
   I first tried the Caldera version, which was the easiest to
install and get running. The Caldera package lets you begin the
installation process with Windows applications, making it the best
choice for Windows users who want to experiment with Linux. It even
includes a special version of PowerQuest's excellent PartitionMagic
program, which automatically sets up an area of your hard drive on
which to install Linux.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with PowerQuest's BootMagic, which lets you easily
start the system with either Windows or Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera even goes out of its way to entertain you through the
lengthy process of copying Linux and its applications to your hard
drive. A version of the falling-blocks game Tetris appears
onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   By default, Linux interacts with users through a command line
interface, similar to that of Microsoft's MS-DOS. Both OpenLinux
and Red Hat Linux come with graphical interfaces called shells that
_ for the most part _ shield users from this. They have some very
cool features, including the ability to have multiple desktops. For
example, you can have a cluster of programs operating on one
desktop, switch to a blank desktop and launch a few more.
</P>
<P>
   OpenLinux's interface is KDE (or K Desktop Environment), and it
will be familiar to most Windows users, even down to a
Start-button-style program launcher. In fact, you can choose from
several KDE styles, including one that makes the desktop look even
more like Windows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GETTING STARTED AND STARTING UP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as intriguing as this installation was, I immediately ran
into a problem that illustrated how far Linux needs to go.
</P>
<P>
   The install process did not recognize my modem. While Linux
won't work with the type known as a winmodem _ which is designed
specifally for use with Windows _ the modem in this PC was a
standard US Robotics 56K fax modem. To get the modem to work, I had
to run a command-line program that went looking for the device and
then had to edit a configuration file with the information it
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   If this fix was available in the on-disk documentation, or in
the small ``Getting Started'' book, I couldn't find it. I had to
rely on a Web site _ which I accessed using my trusty Windows 98
machine _ at www.linux.org. (It's an an excellent resource, by the
way.)
</P>
<P>
   The Caldera package comes with the best software bundle for
desktop users, including a version 8.0 of Corel's WordPerfect;
StarOffice, an office productivity suite; Netscape Communicator
4.51; Apache, a popular freeware Web server; and a slew of server
and administration tools.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hat installation was far more challenging. It comes with
only the most rudimentary programs for preparing your hard disk for
the installation. They perform what is known as a destructive
partition, meaning you'll lose any data that already exists on the
disk.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat also doesn't make it easy to have multiple operating
systems on a PC. I lost the ability to boot to Windows when I
installed Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat also presumes that you know something about Unix _ and
if not, there's a recommended reading list offered in the first
chapter. Otherwise, you'll be completely befuddled by prose such as
this, from the second chapter: ``For example, if partition /dev/hda
were mounted on /usr, that means that all files and directories
under /usr would physically reside on /dev/hda5. So the file
/usr/doc/FAQ/txt/Linux-FAQ would be stored on /dev/hda5, while the
file /etc/x11/gdm/Sessions/Gnome would not.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, and have a nice day.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat's default shell is called Enlightenment, and it's very
similar to KDE in that it's Windows-like. I found it not quite as
flexible as KDE, though I liked the way it handled file management
and its ability to change its colors and button arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat comes with a CD full of applications beyond the standard
install. Most of these are of interest to computing professionals,
though one of them is a full version of StarOffice.
</P>
<P>
   If Linux is not ready for the average computer user, what's the
appeal? The operating system is quite stable. Linux users take
great pride in talking about long their computers have been running
without a restart. It also comes with an incredible amount of
business-related software for a pittance _ and in some cases, for
free.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a business user on a budget who's also very computer
savvy, Linux may be a good choice. If you're a hobbyist who revels
in the pain of tweaking and tuning your operating system, you'll
love this. And if you are a computer professional who wants to
learn the ins and outs of Unix, perhaps as a smart career move,
then consider Linux your platform of choice.
</P>
<P>
   All others: You have been warned.

USUALLY, MINOR ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED TO GET PC READY FOR CABLE,
ADSL SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in getting either a cable modem or ADSL
service. I understand the differences between the two and certainly
the benefits. However, I am curious as to what has to happen to my
computer for these to work. Do the companies that sell the service
have to install anything? Can I use another Internet service as a
backup?
</P>
<P>
   A: This depends on who your provider turns out to be. But in
general, there are only a few things that have to change for you to
enjoy high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Both types of service require that a card be added to your
computer. In the case of a cable modem, that will be a network
interface card, or NIC, which is a standard Ethernet connection.
For ADSL, it may be an NIC, or it might be an internal ADSL modem.
Some Compaq Presarios come with ADSL modems built-in.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have a quality network card in your computer,
you're in good shape. If it's a cheap or no-name model, though, the
phone or cable company may want you to replace it with a
higher-grade one.
</P>
<P>
   If an NIC is installed, then the technician who handles the
installation will attach a cable modem or an external ADSL modem to
that card. If you have a home network, you can link the modem
together with all the other PCs using a network hub.
</P>
<P>
   The respective modems then are connected to their wires _ cable
TV coaxial in the case of a cable modem, or ADSL wiring for that
service.
</P>
<P>
   The technician who installs the network card will have to fiddle
with the network settings on your PC, but these are minor tweaks.
I've tried both ADSL and cable-modem service, and in both cases
I've still been able to use my dialup service.
</P>
<P>
   But that situation may be different for other users. If your
Internet provider uses a firewall and requires certain settings on
your computer, the cable or ADSL settings may disable those. This
is particularly true for those people trying to get into a
corporate network, which often has elaborate security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Contact the help desk at your current Internet provider, or the
information systems manager at your employer, to determine whether
either of these services will undo your current settings.
</P>
<P>
   RoadRunner also will install software on your computer that
allows you to easily manage your account. Either service may need
to upgrade your Web browser or other operating system components.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a Web ring?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can think of a Web ring as a collection of sites that all
deal with the same subjects, usually joined by a common set of
links at the bottom of the main pages.
</P>
<P>
   Web rings amount to a kind of virtual community of sites, and
they are great if you have a strong interest in a subject and want
to know more about it.
</P>
<P>
   The links for most Web rings allow you to go forward and
backward in the list of sites, so that each site appears as though

   Q: I want to add another hard drive to my computer. I've been
told you can only have so many hard drives in a computer that has
EIDE connections, which is what's in mine. How many drives can I
have?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can have up to four EIDE drives in most modern PCs. There
are two controller connections on these machines' main system
boards, or motherboards, and each controller can handle two drives.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a CD-ROM drive in your machine, it's likely that it
is connected to one of those controllers as well _ unless it uses a
different interface, such as SCSI. That means your maximum number
of hard drives would be three.

GETTING A COLLEGE ROOMMATE MAY MEAN MORE THAN DRAWING STRAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years after rooming together as freshmen at Russell Sage
College in Troy, N.Y., Lisa Sweet and Kristy Abbasciano happily ran
into each other one late-August afternoon, just before the start of
this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they are still talking, and, more than that, they are still
friends. Their other roommate from freshman year has drifted into
the netherworld, buried in memories of inch-thick dust, wrappers
and piles of dirty clothes.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the three had enjoyed shopping expeditions, dinners
and pizza parties, but their sharing of living quarters ultimately
deteriorated because of the third roommate's habits. By the end of
the semester, despite a meeting to air differences, ``we didn't
want to deal with it,'' said Abbasciano, describing a decision, by
default, to let the mismatch slide to an inevitable end.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, these two juniors diplomatically summarize by
saying, ``It just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   That most such living arrangements do work out _ falling into a
spectrum ranging from bliss to resignation _ beats the odds of an
inherently arbitrary, unscientific method of matching freshmen.
Chances are, these students have just left the sanctity of their
own bedrooms at home, bringing to college their high expectations
of dorm life, clearly part of this rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that their roommate is going to be their best
friend, because that's what they see on TV, and that they're going
to make the transition very easily,'' said Laurie Garafola,
director of residential life at the State University of New York at
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   New students cast an anxious eye on the process by which
roommates are assigned, said Trish Cellemme, the director of
residence life and student services at Sage.
</P>
<P>
   (Freshmen in some instances may request a specific roommate,
someone perhaps from the same hometown, or someone they absolutely
clicked with at summer orientation.)
</P>
<P>
   Russell Sage is a small women's college, where half of its
approximately 1,000 students live on campus. Here, the assigning of
roommates probably is about as personal as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Before July orientation at Sage, new students receive a housing
preference card, which tries to succinctly get at their lifestyles.
One key question: ``I classify myself as: a `night owl'; stay out
late on weekends, but need sleep during the week; early to
bed/rise,'' all of which ask students to name specific times. Or,
students are asked to describe their cleanliness, from ``fairly
neat and would like to live with someone similar'' to ``neatness is
not important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin P. Gleason is the wizard who matches new Sage students
based on their answers. The associate director of residence life
and student services, Gleason has spent three weeks matching 150
women at Sage.
</P>
<P>
   For her, this mix of humanity on 6-by-9-inch blue cards is
sorted, in bins, by study habits, cleanliness and bedtimes, and
interests. Too, smokers and nonsmokers are separated.
</P>
<P>
   (In one student-only session during orientation, students are
asked to come clean about themselves, particularly if they've
concealed their smoking habit from parents by fibbing on the
housing card, said residence director Cellemme. While Sage banned
smoking from residence halls a few years ago, the college still
asks the question because some students object to the clinging odor
of smoke.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gleason and Cellemme joke that they hold all of the
power _ ``don't give us a hard time, we make your room
assignments,'' Cellemme laughs _ the sorting is a ``painful
process,'' Gleason said. ``I know that for students, this will be
their first experience away from home, and you'd like it be
beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to school is a very anxiety-provoking time, and you add
all the other things what we might consider small issues for
students dealing with all of these changes in their lives, it
sometimes becomes very unmanageable, for something that seems
simple,'' said Garafola of SUNY-Albany, which houses more than
6,000 students; of those, 2,700 are freshmen or transfer students.
</P>
<P>
   New SUNY-Albany students are paired, simply, by gender, whether
they smoke and in the order their housing application is sent back
to the university, the latter causing a flurry of overnight express
mailings from students in late May, Garafola said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking any other details about lifestyles of most new students
would be difficult, given the university's size and limited space.
Once applications are in, ``we let the computer do its work,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., still hand-sorts the
roommate requests of some 700 freshmen and transfer students, a
method that provides a distinct advantage to a small college that
stresses a personal touch, said dean of students Jeanne Obermayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a student calls, I know their name and I know something
about them, which is really important.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 700 new students have already requested
specific roommates, leaving Obermayer and her staff to match the
other half of the incoming class.
</P>
<P>
   Her staff whittles away at some specifics: smoking, even though
it is banned in halls, some requests for ``substance-free'' areas,
which ban alcohol, even if the students drink off-campus, and the
pairing of science majors, whose lab and class time tend to set the
tone for their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, pairing is random.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have asked Obermayer why Siena doesn't survey students
for more details on the way they live. The college has tried, but
matching people who report habits they've had at home, in high
school, hasn't worked. Habits may change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our experience, there has been much greater roommate
conflict. They expect one to be like the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges do kick around ways to improve the matching of
roommates, including discussion on software packages that could
help, said Obermayer, who co-chairs a committee of residential life
administrators at the Hudson-Mohawk Association of Colleges and
Universities. Obermayer said she's yet to discover software that
would offer the flexibility of allowing a particular college to
select its own matching criteria.

A SENTINEL OF CALM IS KEPT IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We were maybe 10 minutes into a 43-minute flight
from Indianapolis to Chicago, and I was reading in the National
Geographic about the dirt-poor Chipaya Indians of Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   A sound came from the rear of the plane, something between a
thunderous pop and a mini boom. The pressure inside the cabin
dropped noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   Never an easy flier, I felt an adrenaline surge and flashed on
the all-time plane crash movie, ``Fearless.'' Sensing big trouble
before anyone else on a doomed flight, Jeff Bridges _ a flying
phobic _ warns his business partner: ``Something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 43 passengers on the EJR-145 jet seemed to think the
same thing. Their heads whipped around to the back of the plane,
then to the front where a lone flight attendant wrestled with a
beverage cart. A sweet-faced blond woman who appeared to be in her
mid-20s, she continued to take drink orders, shovel ice and pop the
tabs on soft drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   My adrenaline receded.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever turbulence, weird engine noise or plain bad vibes scare
me, I watch the flight attendants. Whatever I don't know about
commercial aviation, I've always figured I could make up for by
reading flight attendant body language. If something's REALLY
wrong, they sure wouldn't keep pouring drinks.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a few rows, this flight attendant calmly called
the cockpit. Then she returned to her cart. A few rows later, she
walked to the rear of the plane, went into the restroom and shut
the door. But she did it with such serenity, I went back to the
Chiyapa.
</P>
<P>
   When her call button ding-donged and the flight attendant again
picked up the phone to the cockpit, I watched her face as if it
were a seismograph on the San Andreas Fault. Nothing registered.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she interrupt drink service when the plane began to make
a series of tight turns that seemed out of place in a straight
northwesterly flight to Chicago. When the jet began to descend, the
flight attendant cooly continued to shovel, pop and pour.
</P>
<P>
   I looked outside. A gray gauze of clouds dissolved and fields of
cultivated farmland lay below us. (Very close below us.) Just as I
was handed a glass of water and a bag of pretzels, the plane went
into a deliberate but marked descent.
</P>
<P>
   Flustered but not frightened, the flight attendant muttered, ``I
can't believe they're doing this to me.'' Then she wrestled her
heavy cart back up the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   The captain's voice came over the speaker with obvious news:
``Flight attendant, prepare for landing.'' I scanned the ground for
a sign of big, bustling O'Hare Airport _ or any airport. I saw
soybean fields. Not 30 minutes had passed since takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, a runway appeared. The little Brazilian-made jet
touched down and slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendant welcomed us ``to Chicago.'' Then a
chartreuse fire truck came barreling over, then another. Printed on
their sides was, ``Indianapolis International Airport.'' Six more
vehicles converged.
</P>
<P>
   With studied nonchalance in his voice, the captain announced
that the smoke sensor in the baggage hold had gone off. (I later
learned that the pop-boom was probably when the captain ``fired the
bottles'' _ or set off the cargo hold fire extinguishers.) Although
we weren't in danger, he told us to leave all of our belongings and
get out of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, we sat at the edge of the plane's door, then jumped
onto the back of an emergency vehicle and onto what must be
Indianapolis International's most remote tarmac. In the distance, a
television station helicopter hovered and recorded our evacuation
for the 6 o'clock news.
</P>
<P>
   Back inside the terminal, the flight attendant stood by herself.
I asked if anyone in the cockpit had told her we were going back to
Indy for a semi-emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, very quietly. ``I think they were too busy up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt almost as sorry for her as I did for myself. Nothing
against the flight crew _ they'd gotten us down safe and sound, God
bless 'em _ but most of their passengers had realized we weren't in
Chicago before their flight attendant had. As for me, I'd just lost
one of the mainstays of my arsenal against fearful flying.
</P>
<P>
   Body language, schmoddy language. Sometimes, the flight
attendant is the last to know.

IT'S THE ECOLOGY, STUPID 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lyndon LaRouche's followers handed out a picture
of our vice president with the headline ``The Pure Evil of Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   I had a good laugh, but then I got back to the office and read
that Gore had just said, through a spokeswoman, that ``localities
should have the right to teach creationism.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't pure evil, of course. It's pure stupidity, cowardice
and pandering in an attempt to get a few votes. But it's coming
from a man who claims to be a leader in the field of
environmentalism, which is supposed to be related to science.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went to Harvard University. Didn't he take Natural Sciences
5 with the late, great Nobel Prize-winning biologist George Wald?
There is a kind of banal evil when a man forsakes what he knows to
be true in order to achieve power.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hedged his statement by saying that he ``favors'' teaching
evolution, but local authorities should have the final say. Local
control of education is fine on most matters, but the Supreme Court
ruled in 1987 that the Constitution prohibits schools from teaching
creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism is a religious belief. In its most literal forms,
it's also wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The world is simply not 10,000 years old. If you want to believe
that, fine. But don't say kids can be taught that in schools we all
pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even try to teach kids that the six days it took God to
create heaven and Earth may not have been literally six days, but
billions of years. That's just adding poetic interpretation to
religion.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well say that Adam and Eve are just symbols for the
first hydrocarbons. It's still not science.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made education a big part of his presidential campaign.
Would he make a statement saying local school boards can decide
whether to teach that the sun revolves around the Earth or two plus
two equals five?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. Gore did try to convince people that he
invented the Internet, but he took that back. However, now he's
saying that public schools can be turned into Sunday schools, and
kids can be taught that life began a few thousand years ago and God
deposited the first man in a garden, making a woman out of his rib
to keep him company.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great story, an ageless metaphor and it makes for any
number of book and movie treatments, but it isn't science.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalists, and the candidates who kowtow to them, keep
saying that evolution is ``just a theory,'' as if that means a wild
guess, something that Darwin and his followers thought up the way
UFO fanciers come up with theories about aliens among us.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the word ``theory'' in respect to evolution means (and
I use a literal interpretation of the dictionary) ``a systematic
statement of principles underlying observed phenomena.''
</P>
<P>
   In numerous species, from bacteria on up, evolution is an
observed phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   As the National Academy of Sciences stated last year, ``There is
no debate within the scientific community over whether evolution
has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't teach biology without evolution, just as you can't
teach geology without plate tectonics or physics without relativity
and quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The only place evolution hasn't occurred is in the thinking of
politicians, and in that part of the general public H.L. Mencken
called ``the booboisie.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls show that Americans consider education the No. 1 issue
in the country, yet polls also show that more than half of all
Americans don't like the idea that humans evolved from other
species _ commonly called ``lower species.'' Scientists like
Stephen Jay Gould don't like that term because it implies that the
highly accidental processes of evolution inevitably leads up some
kind of ladder to humans.
</P>
<P>
   People don't like the idea that we might be an accident. They
don't like the idea that we may have come from species without much
cognitive ability or language.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that well-educated politicians are devolving their
own cognitive abilities and language to get votes.
</P>
<P>
   We expect the likes of George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole to
hedge on creationism because they are Republicans, the party that
panders to the religious right. Gore is supposed to be pandering to
us.
</P>
<P>
   As an acquaintance said of the new sort-of-creationist Gore,
``What a twit!'' That's a better way of putting it than ``pure
evil.''

THE SHOW GOES ON, EVEN WITH NEW CASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``Law &AMP; Order'' creator Dick Wolf thinks Jerry
Orbach, who joined the show as Detective Lennie Briscoe in its
third season seven years ago, said it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the original cast was still there,'' Wolf recalled Orbach
saying, ``the show wouldn't still be on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order'' may be the foremost practitioner of the art of
introducing new characters as others depart. Churning, it's called.
This year the NBC cop show will be bringing in Jesse L. Martin (Dr.
Greg Butters on ``Ally McBeal'') to the fold, replacing Benjamin
Bratt. (In addition, there will be a spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order:
Special Victims Unit.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem with dramas is, after five or six years,
if it's the same cast, you've told all the stories,'' Wolf said.
``You (would) have to do soap opera to keep the dramatic intensity
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast changes are often the last gasps of dying shows, sometimes
vain attempts at survival. Remember Jonathan Winters on ``Mork &AMP;
Mindy''? The Great Gazoo on ``The Flintstones''? The annoying kid
Oliver on ``The Brady Bunch''? Unknown Leonardo DiCaprio on
``Growing Pains''? And, please, don't make me bring up Scrappy Doo.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many shows that reloaded and pressed on well, from
``MASH'' to ``Cheers'' and, of course, ``L&AMP;O.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best examples may be ``Valerie.'' After one season
the title star, Valerie Harper, left in a dispute with producers.
Sandy Duncan was added, the show was renamed ``The Hogan Family,''
and the sitcom enjoyed a nice five-year run on NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   This coming season several comedies are bringing in new blood.
``Suddenly Susan'' (NBC) is adding ``Monty Python'' alum Eric Idle,
among others, to the lineup, as Judd Nelson departs. Heather
Locklear (``Melrose Place'') will add intrigue to ``Spin City''
(ABC) as a foil to Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veronica's Closet'' (NBC) is juggling characters, but with its
move to Monday nights from the protected Must-See cocoon that is
Thursdays, the artistically challenged show may already be on the
rocks. ``Jesse'' (NBC) is also undergoing changes. But the biggest
changes will come from those two Chicago hospital dramas that
debuted in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At ``ER,'' tinkering was done to offset the departure of George
Clooney and the planned departures after this season of Julianna
Margulies and Gloria Reuben (Eriq LaSalle, who was strongly
thinking of leaving, has reportedly re-upped for three more
seasons).
</P>
<P>
   Over at CBS, a cast-ectomy was performed on ``Chicago Hope,'' as
creator David E. Kelley came back and cleaned house. In a stunning
final episode penned by Kelley, original Mandy Patinkin returned as
Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, but now as a boss.
</P>
<P>
   He fired much of the staff (actors Alan Arkin, Hector Elizondo,
Mark Harmon and Rocky Carroll survived) after delivering a
devastating sing-song of criticisms that could have been directed
as much at the actors and the show as the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Holly, Barbara Hershey and Carla Gugino join the drama,
which will now concentrate more on the doctors' medicine than their
personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ```Chicago Hope' was in trouble, in terms of even getting
renewed,'' Kelley said. ``We met with CBS, (and) pretty much agreed
that in order for `Chicago Hope' to come back, it would have to be
reborn again, and sweeping changes would have to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ER,'' whose ratings, if not top-ranking, slipped last season,
is bringing in Michael Michele (``Homicide: Life on the Street''),
Maura Tierney (``NewsRadio'') and Goran Visnjic (``The
Peacemaker''). In addition, Ming-Na is reprising her role as Deb
Chen, and Paul McCrane (Dr. Robert Romano) has been upgraded to a
series regular.
</P>
<P>
   Two more recurring stars have been added: Rebecca DeMornay
(``The Hand that Rocks the Cradle'') will play a patient who has
ties to Dr. Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the man who played one of television's most legendary
doctors joins the staff, as Alan Alda (Hawkeye Pierce of ``MASH'')
will play a new attending doctor, Ted Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' executive producer John Wells said none of the actors who
have departed his show were pushed, and if he had his way he would
have liked all who have gone/are going to have stayed. This, he
said, is because the hospital drama is a character-based show, as
opposed to story-based show, allowing greater depths to explore
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the energy of the show can be well-served by new
characters coming in,'' Wells said. ``It gives you a whole other
new set of stories to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the heart of ``ER,'' Anthony Edwards, laughs at the notion
of the irreplaceable, indispensable star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actors,'' he said. ``It's only been a hundred years that
we've been allowed to be buried in cemeteries.''

`THE 13TH WARRIOR': HO-HUM ADVENTURE FROM THE MIDDLE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' is not great art. It's not little art. It's
not even art. But it does boast several pelt-wearing,
proto-Norwegian warriors armed with broadswords, many of them used
to dismember and/or impale demonic furry enemies bearing no small
resemblance to Ewoks. (Tall Ewoks, but Ewoks nevertheless.)
</P>
<P>
   Adding to this somewhat-redemptive spectacle is Jerry
Goldsmith's score, which drums up a few pseudo-Wagnerian choruses
and then beats them with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is based on a Michael Crichton novel (``Eaters
of the Dead'') and helmed by John McTiernan (the first and third
``Die Hard'' pictures), may remind astute viewers of a movie from
the director's early years: ``Predator,'' in which SWAT leader
Arnold Schwarzenegger, joined by his biceps, fights off a
man-eating invisible alien with long claws.
</P>
<P>
   The villains in ``The 13th Warrior'' aren't invisible and don't
hail from another planet, but they do like to nosh on dead folks,
and their nails are obviously in need of a trim. What aspect of
McTiernan's psyche this reflects is not clear, although it is worth
mentioning that he also directed ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' and
that Pierce Brosnan appears amply manicured throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' stars Antonio Banderas and many large,
unfamiliar blond men, a few of whom have in fact appeared in other
movies. It is one of nine films being released in the week before
Labor Day, and you can bet that the others (among them ``Dudley
Do-Right'') don't involve characters named Hyglak the Quarrelsome
and Edgtho the Silent and Halga the Wise. One of ``Warrior's'' weak
points is its near-total disregard for character development, which
means that Edgtho might as well be Hyglak, or vice versa, for all
we care. Presumably their mothers can tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
   If it's decapitation, mist-covered battle scenes and puddles of
blood you're after, ``The 13th Warrior'' has them aplenty, along
with a touch of hand-held camera work just for verite. The film
purports to be a medieval swashbuckler, or perhaps it purports to
be a star vehicle for Banderas, who swooped and slashed his way
through last summer's ``The Mask of Zorro'' and does so less
felicitously here.
</P>
<P>
   The plot requires Banderas to wear a turban, pretend his
mellifluous Spanish accent is actually a mellifluous Arab accent
and glower meaningfully at the flaxen-haired heathens in his midst.
He plays Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, a 10th-century poet who must forsake
his peacenik ways to join a Dirty Baker's Dozen of warriors charged
with rescuing a tiny northern European village from the
aforementioned Ewoks.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he learns to speak and understand ancient Norse,
an ability he acquires by staring at his comrades around a
campfire. (His first words to them are: ``My mother was a pure
woman from a noble family. And I at least know who my father is,
you pig-eating son of a whore.'')
</P>
<P>
   Berlitz course completed, the 13 warriors reach their
destination, where they meet more characters with incomprehensible
names and start doing battle with demon bear-people. Endless
carnage results, along with several choice lines of dialogue (``The
heads. They always take the heads.'') from William Wisher's
(``Judge Dredd'') and Warren Lewis' (``Black Rain'') gruntlike
screenplay, which doesn't waste time explaining things.
</P>
<P>
   It needn't. The bogeymen's secret identity isn't much of a
secret, although Ahmed's sudden epiphany three-fourths through the
movie (``the claws ... the headdress ... bears!'') is greeted with
shock by his confreres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' is at its most charming when it's in the
middle of some form of mass extermination; if you squint your eyes,
some of it looks like the World Wrestling Federation. McTiernan's
fondness for gore is innocent, in its way, like an 8-year-old
anatomizing action figures. And Peter Menzies smartly points his
camera outward, offering grand views of a rugged Vancouver Island,
a photogenic substitute for ancient Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The Scandinavian-heavy cast includes Dennis Storhoi as the
film's most effusive Norseman, Anders T. Andersen as its most
irritating and Vladimir Kulich (a Czech) as the warriors' bullish
chieftain, Buliwyf. Omar Sharif plays an Arab named Melchisidek,
who appears early on as Ahmed's sagacious U.N. translator and then
promptly disappears, leaving a pleasant, David Lean-like aura in
his wake.

UNIVERSITY HALTS RESEARCH ON MIND CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The State University of New York at Albany has
shut down the research of a psychology professor probing the
``X-Files'' world of government surveillance and mind control.
</P>
<P>
   At conferences, in papers and research over two semesters,
Professor Kathryn Kelley explored the claims of those who say they
were surgically implanted with communications devices to read their
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   According to colleagues, Kelley has privately claimed the
university is violating her academic freedom. She declined to
answer questions about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's research and the controversy surrounding it echoes the
experience of John Mack, a renowned Harvard psychiatrist who wrote
the 1994 bestseller ``Abductions: Human Encounters with Aliens.''
By lending credence to the stories of those who claimed they were
abducted and molested by space aliens, the book led to an
unprecedented inquiry by the Harvard Medical School. A school
committee eventually chastised him for engaging in unorthodox
research and ``affirming the delusions'' of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Kelley, Mack has an international reputation. He
earns hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants and won a Pulitzer
Prize for his biography of Lawrence of Arabia. And while Harvard
challenged Mack's conclusions, the investigation at SUNY-Albany is
focused on methods.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, University spokeswoman Mary Fiess released this
statement on the matter: ``The university imposed the suspension
because of serious concerns that the experiment did not meet the
standards governing such projects on campus. While we're working to
gather all the facts in this case, we cannot comment further.''
</P>
<P>
   A memo sent to all psychology professors and graduate students
last week instructed them to refer calls ``looking for information
on any psychological research conducted in our department'' to the
university's public relations office.
</P>
<P>
   According to three sources _ two faculty members and a graduate
student _ the school's Institutional Review Board, which monitors
human research, closed the project when a student complained late
last spring. The student, the sources said, was not allowed to
leave a lecture that was part of Kelley's experiment. Refusal to
allow a subject to leave an experiment violates National Science
Foundation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the inquiry, Kelley, a fully tenured professor who
earned $67,000 last year, is slated to teach two graduate courses
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The department became aware of Kelley's theories in the spring
of 1998, when a note on her office door announced a lecture called
``The Psychology of Invading the Self.'' The note described implant
research funded by the National Security Agency and the Defense
Department with an annual budget of $2 billion. The ``uninformed,
unconsenting subjects'' of these devices were typically ``federal
prisoners and political dissidents,'' the note said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kelley won approval from the review board to
conduct research on ``advances in technology that affect
interpersonal communication.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 16-page outline to the board, Kelley said she wanted to
look at the uses of technology for ``monitoring and control.'' She
proposed presenting a lecture to research subjects and then having
them respond to 60 questions about how the case study affected
their views.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in technology marked an extreme departure for
Kelley, a professor at SUNY-Albany since 1979. Kelley, who earned
her doctorate from Purdue University, was a professor at Marquette
University and the University of Wisconsin before joining the
psychology faculty at SUNY-Albany. Her previous research dealt with
issues like health, date rape and risk-taking. With her former
husband, distinguished psychology professor Donn Byrne, she
co-authored a textbook on gender differences.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gregory George, a graduate student who has since left the
university, said he was part of a team assigned to lay the factual
foundation for the implants.
</P>
<P>
   To his astonishment, he found that several companies had
actually developed ``trans-tympanic transducers,'' instruments that
function as mini-telephones that send voice messages directly to
the inner-ear. Companies declined to market the product for fear of
bad transmissions causing deafness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   George believed the point of the research was to look at how
people would perceive those with the implants, and whether there
might be a social stigma attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathryn has never been one to go traditional,'' George said.
``But some of us wondered why we were looking at the social stigma
of something that hadn't been developed yet. Why not look at the
stigma of using something more common, like a wheelchair?''
</P>
<P>
   Papers Kelley delivered at two recent conferences suggest that
she was becoming fascinated with the subject of mind control.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual conference of the Eastern Psychological
Association in Providence, R.I., she delivered a paper that looked
at implant-claims as ``one of the indicators of schizophrenia.''
Yet many colleagues began wondering to what extent Kelley believed
in the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In a more detailed treatment she gave at a conference earlier
this month in Orlando, Fla., Kelley lent more credence to the
phenomenon. She described how a subject might be implanted with the
device during anesthesia, perhaps leaving tiny stitches visible in
the ear. She called the devices RAATs, short for radiowave,
auditory, assaultive, transmitting implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (short-wave) operators transmit to or scan RAAT implants
in victims, they can talk to the victims remotely and anonymously,
and hear the victim's speech and thoughts,'' Kelley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The paper noted that the National Institutes of Health denied
any governmental role in such research.
</P>
<P>
   The current investigation into Kelley's work is considered
highly sensitive at the university, coming four years after a
gunman who claimed the government planted a microchip in his brain
and penis held a class of 37 students at SUNY-Albany hostage. Ralph
Tortorici, the gunman, recently hanged himself in his prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   Without commenting on specifics, sociology professor David
Wagner, outgoing chair of the review board, said that shutting down
a professor's research was ``quite rare.''

BRADLEY MAY STILL SCORE WITH HIS LONG SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's those elbows, Ernestine Schlant Bradley was
saying. You need to watch her husband's elbows. He used them to
great advantage during his 10 years in the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Come December or January, she promised, Bill Bradley will
unlimber those elbows in Al Gore's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Schlant Bradley was in Albany, at a luncheon meeting
with about 30 local Democratic politicians. She is a professor at
Montclair State College in New Jersey, author of three books, a
woman with an active career who did some vigorous but limited
campaigning for her husband when he served as a senator from New
Jersey. Now she has taken a leave of absence from her job to work
at helping him win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bill Bradley remains a long shot for the
Democratic presidential nomination. As a sitting vice president and
the anointed heir of Bill Clinton, Gore sits atop a mountain of
money and is lining up supporters all across the country. But
Bradley, who has friends on Wall Street, has raised some serious
money of his own. He's also acutely aware that, in the polls, he
neatly beats Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican
nominee. Meanwhile, Gore can't seem to rise above a statistical tie
with the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stench of Clinton clinging to Gore, former Albany Mayor
Tom Whalen was explaining recently at that luncheon. People just
want Clinton to go away, and Gore's image suffers from his devoted
service as Clinton's No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, even Democrats backing Gore publicly say the same
thing. As Gore lines up ritual endorsement after endorsement for
the Democratic presidential nomination, local party pros fret that
he might be unelectable in a general election. They also worry, and
seriously, about what damage a Gore defeat could inflict on local
Democratic candidates farther down the ticket. Nowhere is that
worry more pronounced than in New York, where Bradley essentially
enjoys a home court advantage in next year's presidential primary.
Not only did Bradley represent a neighboring state in the Senate
for three terms, he spent his basketball career playing for the New
York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats also recall that Gore was hardly impressive
when he made his first run for the presidency in 1988. He got only
10 percent of the primary vote in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the Hillary question. If First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton decides to run for the Senate from New York
next year, do New York Democrats also want Gore on the ballot in
November? Would New York voters, even in this dependably Democratic
state, view those two names on the same ballot as a dangerous
overdose of Clintonism?
</P>
<P>
   So while Gore is undeniably ahead in the fight for his party's
nomination, his support _ in New York, at least _ seems vastly
broader than it is deep. If Bradley beats him in Iowa or New
Hampshire, or even comes in close to the vice president, then
Gore's support in New York and the other big industrial states
could evaporate like morning mist. And many of those states,
including New York, will hold their presidential primaries on Super
Tuesday, March 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley believes that his party should devise a fairer
method of selecting its presidential candidate. His proposal:
</P>
<P>
   A jump shot contest from the top of the key.
</P>

`ACID HOUSE': DOWN AND OUT IN EDINBURGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filth becomes Irvine Welsh more than messages do.
</P>
<P>
   He thought so enough to call last year's violent cop novel
``Filth,'' and three of the tales in ``The Acid House,'' his 1994
collection of Scotland-bound short stories, have been made into a
new movie _ one caked in lurid, hallucinogenic, ecstatically
burned-out filth that Welsh adapted himself. He said he wanted to
take a swing at screenwriting after the botched job the author felt
John Hodge made of Welsh's ``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   That film, Welsh charged, was a slick commercial for clean
living with a soundtrack that served as the hook for a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But, mercifully, director Danny Boyle and Hodge had given
Welsh's 1994 novel the one thing he'd never meant it to have: a
message _ lust for life _ that you just happen to be able to dance
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Acid House'' imagines itself to be a more hard-core
experience with significantly less Iggy Pop to it. It has the
English subtitles to prove it. Paul McGuigan directs Welsh's three
shorts with an ample helping of ``Trainspotting'' detritus while
remaining haplessly devoted to the emasculated scuzziness of the
people living in its North Edinburgh projects.
</P>
<P>
   It feels like a trumped up trifle, disinterested in narrative
exercises, using instead technique (cinematography, editing and a
soundtrack) to swing moods and heighten reality, then send it
crashing to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the first panel, ``The Granton Star Cause,'' Welsh plunges
the luckless Boab (Stephen McCole) further into dejection by having
God (Maurice Roeves) make a horsefly of him, after he's been dumped
by his soccer team, his girl, his boss and his parents.
</P>
<P>
   His palaver with a sloshed Almighty in a pub is a sketch, a
funny one, in which God unleashes his malevolence on Boab, but then
it swaps that exchange for the squalid surrealism that dominates
the rest of that short and the following two stories as well.
</P>
<P>
   What momentum the film gathers as it progresses is seriously
aided by the fact that McGuigan isn't so much a director as much as
he is a DJ, with an imagist's sensibility, guilty of far worse
sonic indulgences than Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Soft Touch,'' the most visceral, resonant and sincere of the
three, is merely a long-form video, albeit a harrowing one. A
lacerating Ned Sorensen Sound wedding cover of ``Wonderwall'' and a
magically soiled lip sync of Arab Strap's ``I Still Miss You'' are
highlights, but they're asides more spectacular for their
arbitrariness than for any lasting significance.
</P>
<P>
   It's the mildly devastating performance by Kevin McKidd
(``Trainspotting's'' smacked-up soccer fiend), as a used and abused
husband and father, that anchors the film. It's the only movement
with any heft. By the time ``The Acid House'' closes with its title
panel featuring Ewen Bremner (``Trainspotting's'' Spud), the
digitally superimposed roiling clouds and disdain for
middle-classness suggest it might be up to something. But its idea
of mischief is as juvenile as the vile LSD-induced body swap
Bremner pulls with an animatronic toddler cum Chucky doll.
</P>
<P>
   It's pulp fiction buried in an evanescent filth that leaves but
one question: This is hard core?

BIG EAST: WHICH WAY WILL THE WIND BLOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest irony in college football last season was that it
took a hurricane for the Miami Hurricanes to create quite a tempest
of another sort. Remember? The Hurricanes were set to host UCLA in
a marquee nonconference matchup at the Orange Bowl Sept. 26, but
the threat Hurricane Georges posed to South Florida forced Miami
officials to postpone the game until Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   That's when UCLA truly felt the effects of hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerrin James, who departed early for the NFL draft and wound
up a first-round pick (No. 4 overall) of the Indianapolis Colts,
proved to be a cyclonic force of nature in rushing for a
league-record 299 yards and three touchdowns in a 49-45 triumph
that knocked the previously unbeaten Bruins out of the title
picture.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that upset, and Miami's subsequent 46-23 romp
over North Carolina State in the Micron PC Bowl, Hurricane warnings
are now being posted for all latitudes and longitudes throughout
the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Better batten down the hatches and find safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 returning starters, including 10 of 11 on defense, Miami
figures to be a force to be reckoned with when it kicks off the
season _ in Sunday's Kickoff Classic against ninth-ranked Ohio
State, no less _ as the odds-on favorite to win its fifth Big East
title and third under fifth-year coach Butch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're consistent and stay healthy, I think we can make a
run for it,'' said running back James Jackson, a 5-foot-11-inch,
200-pound junior who is set to take over as Miami's featured back.
``We've been working hard, getting ready for the season, and it's
time to start producing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the league's first year in 1991, Miami captured the inaugural
conference championship en route to a 12-0 season and a national
championship. Only Syracuse, last year's repeat champion, Virginia
Tech, and West Virginia have dared to challenge Miami's conference
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   And while all will likely be contenders for a conference bowl
slot _ which was expanded this year to include a fourth spot in the
Music City Bowl Dec. 29 in Nashville _ all will be supremely
challenged by the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen will have to reconstruct an offense that lost five
key starters, including quarterback Donovan McNabb. The
Mountaineers return a capable quarterback in senior Marc Bulger,
but not much else after West Virginia's offensive and defensive
lines were decimated by graduation. And the Hokies, the only
conference team with a winning record against Miami (4-3), will
attempt to do what no other team has accomplished by winning their
fifth in a row against the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've probably got the most talent in the league right
now,'' said Virigina Tech defensive end Corey Moore, who earned
Defensive Player of the Year honors last season after leading the
league with 13 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the second-most talent? Well, that could very well
be Moore's Hokies, who were picked to finish second behind the
Hurricanes in a preseason media poll. While Moore, an undersized
6-foot, 212-pound senior, anchors a defense that returns seven
starters, coach Frank Beamer will look to unproven but talented
newcomer Michael Vick to take over the reins at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Vick has been so quick of foot and strong of arm in spring
drills and preseason camp that he has already drawn comparisons to
McNabb, the three-time Offensive Player of the Year from Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, who were picked third (but are capable of
finishing worse than that), will sorely miss McNabb along with
departed fullback Rob Konrad, wide receiver Kevin Johnson, and
tailback Kyle McIntosh. The fact coach Paul Pasqualoni has said
he'll wait until the Sept. 2 opener vs. Toledo to decide among
Madei Williams, Troy Nunes, and freshman newcomer R.J. Anderson as
his starting QB does not bode well for the Orangemen. What does is
that senior linebacker Keith Bulluck will anchor a defense that
returns seven starters.
</P>
<P>
   At West Virginia, Bulger will have to shoulder much of the
burden, evidenced by his bionic effort in passing for 429 of the
Mountaineers' 491 yards total offense in a 34-31 loss to Missouri
in the Insight.com Bowl last Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston College, the exact opposite will be the case. The
Eagles, predicted to finish fifth, will rely upon their experienced
and senior-laden defense _ led by defensive tackle Chris Hovan and
free safety Pedro Cirino _ to carry them early while an
inexperienced offense, led by junior QB Tim Hasselbeck, jells into
a cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, which experienced something of a breakthrough with last
season's 5-6 record, Temple, which recorded the biggest upset of
its 2-9 season in a 28-24 victory at Virginia Tech, and Pittsburgh,
which suffered through an 0-11 season, hope to be improved.
</P>
<P>
   But the forecast is not good. After losing to Miami last year by
a combined margin of 133-34, the Scarlet Knights, Owls, and
Panthers all seem to be in store for even more Hurricane damage.

MENIFEE THE ONE TO BEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Saturday's 130th running of the Travers
Stakes at Saratoga offers a $1 million pot, and there are several
serious players in the game. But the trainer holding the strongest
hand is Elliott Walden, who will send out two aces, Menifee and
Ecton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, who was second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness,
captured the Haskell at Monmouth, and Ecton Park, an improving
colt, took the Jim Dandy at The Spa, the prep for the Travers, both
Aug. 8. At Thursday's post position draw, Menifee was installed as
the 9-5 favorite for the mile and one-quarter Travers, the top
summer race for 3-year-olds, while Ecton Park was made third choice
at 7-2. In between the two is Cat Thief, the hard-trying horse
trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who was listed at 3-1. Lemond Drop Kid,
who won the Belmont Stakes, is 9-2 in what should be a closely
contested event.
</P>
<P>
   Both Menifee, a son of Harlan, and Ecton Park, by Forty Niner,
are models of consistency. Menifee's only poor race came in the
Belmont Stakes, when he tired at the top of the stretch while
trying to run a mile and one-half, finishing eighth. Ecton Park's
one bad race was in the Kentucky Derby, in which he was far back at
all times in the roughly run race, and wound up 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menifee has been first or second in eight of nine starts
(9-5-3), that's the quality of a very good racehorse,'' said
Walden. ``Ecton Park has only been out-of-the-money once
(10-4-3-2), and is a consistent animal, as well. They are both
doing extremely well, and they are both coming off wins. The only
physical difference is Menifee is more of a big guy, while Ecton
Park is a little more compact. ''
</P>
<P>
   As if Walden's duo needed any more of an advantage, they are
both undefeated at Saratoga. Menifee won a key allowance race at
The Spa last year, defeating both Cat Thief and Lemon Drop Kid,
while Ecton Park's Jim Dandy victory came over a sloppy track in
his Saratoga debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race Menifee won here last year was the best 2-year-old
race of the year, period,'' said Walden. ``It helps when your
horses like the track, but they both have run on so many
racetracks. When they run in the Triple Crown, they learn to adapt
to different surfaces. They don't need to take their racetrack with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather has been unsettled, and if the track comes up wet
Saturday, Ecton Park would seem to have a distinct advantage. Forty
Niner is by Mr. Prospector, and Ecton Park's dam, Daring Danzig, is
by Danzig. That is as good as mud breeding can get, and Ecton Park
relished the slop as he won the Jim Dandy by better than 5 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Walden, however, thinks Ecton Park is more than a superior
mudder. ``Ecton Park won the Jim Dandy in fine style, and I don't
know if the rain helped him or not,'' he said. ``Frankly, I don't
think so. I could see how some people could say the mud caused his
big effort, but he's just a good horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee is owned by Arthur Hancock, a noted breeder, and will be
ridden by Pat Day, who has won the Travers three times (Play
Fellow, 1983, Java Gold, '87, and Easy Goer, '89). Ecton Park is
owned by Mark Stanley, an auto parts magnate, and will be ridden by
Alex Solis, an outstanding West Coast rider who finished second
aboard the now-retired Victory Gallop in last year's Travers.
Victory Gallop, who was nosed by Coronado's Quest, was also the
first Travers starter for Walden. Menifee is a closer, and Ecton
Park is a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both riders know their horses,'' said Walden. ``Solis rode
Ecton Park in the Jim Dandy, and he couldn't be any higher on him.
Pat has been the regular rider for Menifee. They are two very good
riders, in the top five in the country, and I'll leave it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Travers, the best of the 3-year-olds begin to race
against older horses in major events. This year, the handicap ranks
have been decimated by injury, and the 3-year-olds, who are
overmatched most years, have a real chance to do some damage
against their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sad thing for racing that so many handicap horses
got hurt (Silver Charm, Free House, Real Quiet, Victory Gallop,
Mazel Trick), injuries seem to come in bunches sometimes,'' said
Walden. ``It's time for the 3-year-olds to come out, and at least
the first two out of the Travers will go on to be big factors in
the handicap division.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if Walden's horses are as sharp as he believes, those two
will be Menifee and Ecton Park.

CALL THE MOUNTIES; `DUDLEY' NEEDS HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``George of the Jungle'' put Brendan Fraser in the funnyman big
leagues. His amiable deadpan was endearing and innocent, and the
movie had some nice, silly surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser is back in ``Dudley Do-Right,'' another picture based on
a Jay Ward cartoon, but this time the needle on the laugh-o-meter
barely budges. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Casting Fraser as Ward's numbskull Mountie was a no-brainer, and
he gets good support from Alfred Molina as Snidly Whiplash and Eric
Idle, who plays a befuddled prospector. Sarah Jessica Parker's also
on hand, as a not-so-innocent Nell, Dudley's girlfriend. And there
are a few laugh-out-loud, hokey-smoke jokes, real Rocky and
Bullwinkle-style groaners. But the fun is hit and miss, mostly
miss.
</P>
<P>
   The villain here isn't so much Snidly as writer-director Hugh
Wilson, who hit the big time with the sit-comish ``First Wives
Club,'' and has worked with Fraser before (``Blast from the
Past'').
</P>
<P>
   Wilson catches the punny tone of the Jay Ward joke factory
(complete with the Don Pardo-style narrator), and he can pull off a
gleeful culture-clash bit like having the picture's extremely
tourist-minded, and non-PC, Indian tribe put on dance routines that
mingle ``Riverdance'' steps with tacky Vegas chorus-line moves. But
he's also a director who finds it hilarious to have Dudley's
beloved Horse delivering repeated Bronx cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The original short ``Dudley'' segments on the various Rocky and
Bullwinkle shows made the most of their minimalist animation
through Ward's slightly subversive take on the world and his
reliance on exceptional vocal talents (remember cackling Hans
Conreid as Snidly?).
</P>
<P>
   Inflating these shenanigans to feature length _ and three
dimensions _ is tricky, and finally beyond the powers of the
writer-director of the original ``Police Academy.'' He's a
filmmaker who can't resist the obvious, and ``Dudley Do-Right''
brings out the worst in him. This one is really for Fraser
die-hards only.

DOWN SOUTH, GAME DAY IS MUSIC TO EVERYONE'S EARS

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENDLETON, S.C. _ The Farm is only a few miles from Memorial
Stadium, the scene of some of his greatest triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Figuratively, however, it is farther away than that _ much
farther. Right now the count is 155 acres, which he hopes to expand
to 180 acres before he is finished.
</P>
<P>
   His life now does not include much football. Although he still
networks via the phone, a fax machine, and a computer that sits on
a desk in the kitchen, keeping in touch with old friends such as
former Auburn coach Pat Dye, Danny Ford's interest in a game he
once lived and breathed is more casual than committed. But there is
no denying the impact college football has had on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Without the game _ without Saturday afternoons on which 81,000
people, many of them with Tiger paws painted on their faces, howl
at the moon during their weekly worship of Clemson football _ there
probably would be no farm, no opportunity for Ford to step out onto
his driveway on a summer night, look around, and know he owns all
the land as far as he can see.
</P>
<P>
   Without the success he achieved in an 11-year stint as the
second-winningest coach in the history of Clemson football, Ford
would not be able to sit in his kitchen, weeks before the start of
another football season, and worry more about the vagaries of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average than about when the freshmen will
report for another season of football at Clemson, or at Arkansas,
where he finished his last stint as a college coach two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How is this possible? Well, Ford coached at Clemson for 11
seasons, and as part of his contract, he received a parcel of land
a few miles outside Clemson, S.C., each year. When he was done, he
had a good- sized spread, and he has added to it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed,'' says Ford, standing in his kitchen
cutting up breading and frying a rabbit that his son had shot
earlier in the day. ``I don't watch that many games anymore. I
can't, really, without sitting there and wondering how I would have
done things in different situations. But miss it? No, not that
much. I enjoyed it when I did it, but I don't miss all the other
stuff. It is hard for me to sit in the stands, though, and not
being thinking about situations and what I would do if I were still
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still a coach after all these years _ after a 1981 national
championship that culminated a 12-0 season when he was only 33.
</P>
<P>
   Still a Son of the South, where college football is worshiped
each Saturday by millions of people who fill stadiums come famine,
pestilence, or, in the worst-case scenario, probation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many in New England, where Boston College is the only
Division 1-A outlet, the passion for college football is more a
curiosity than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But as F. Scott Fitzgerald once intoned about the rich, college
football in the South is different, not only in terms of fan
enthusiasm but also social significance _ its impact on the daily
lives of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As another college football season commences this weekend, one
only has to look at the national rankings to see that the South has
risen again, with Florida State, Tennessee, and Florida all in the
top five in most rankings and in the top 10 in all of them. One
only has to check a list of national champions of last 25 years to
see that teams from the South have won or tied for 13 titles, seven
in the last 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the East, college football is a cultural exercise,'' said
former Alcorn State football coach Marino Casem. ``On the West
Coast, it is a tourist attraction. In the Midwest, it is
cannibalism. But in the South, it is religion. And Saturday is the
Holy Day.''
</P>
<P>
   But it goes deeper than that. Longtime observers of Southern
football link the sport to evolving social behavior through the
1950s and '60s, when segregation was a contentious issue.
Theoretically, the same good ol' boys who were at Ku Klux Klan
meetings on Fridays would find themselves the next afternoon in the
uncomfortable position of cheering for black athletes who played
for their alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that college football helped improve race
relations in the South during that turbulent time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the impact of black football players at major
Division 1-A schools in the South wasn't even an issue until the
mid-1960s, when Kentucky first broached the issue of recruiting
blacks in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But like most things tied to football in the South, the issue of
black players was not fully dealt with until former Alabama coach
Paul ``Bear'' Bryant deemed it appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   For years, college football in the South was as segregated as
the lunch rooms and rest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The region's talented black players had two college choices:
Play at a small, predominantly black school in the South, or head
north or west.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant changed that, provoked by an embarrassing 42-21 loss to
Southern California on Sept. 12, 1970, at Birmingham's Legion Field
in which Trojans running back Sam Cunningham scored three
touchdowns and tore up the Tide defense.
</P>
<P>
   On the bus ride back to Tuscaloosa that night, Bryant told his
staff, ``We're going to have to go out and recruit some black
athletes if we want to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the playing field had changed. Bryant's approval made
it all right, although there still needed to be years of
adjustments in attitudes by fans who saw their schools go from not
even scheduling games against teams that used black athletes to
having their own teams dominated by them.
</P>
<P>
   So far has the pendulum swung that on this year's Alabama
defensive unit, all 11 starters are black.
</P>
<P>
   The South, which turns out hundreds of top Division 1-A-quality
athletes each year, now keeps many black athletes closer to home.
And, gradually, the power base in college football has swung from
the North back to the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, what happened,'' said David Sansing, head of
Center for the study of Southern Culture at the Univeristy of
Mississippi, ``was that Southerners said football was more
important than race.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As more talent has stayed home, more games have been won and
traditions have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, for example, was able to harvest the crop in its own
state _ along with Florida State and Florida _ and win four
national championships in a nine-year span from 1983-91.
</P>
<P>
   But with winning came more pressure to win, which led to corners
being cut and rules being bent and broken. Many schools in the
South _ ranging from Alabama to Clemson, Florida to Miami _ have
felt the blows of NCAA probation shortly before or after winning
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   However, sometimes even winning a national title is not enough,
an indication of the importance of college football in the South.
The year Ford's Clemson team won a national championship, Ford
heard criticism from fans that his team did not pass enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, loyalty is not strictly based on wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   First-year Clemson coach Tommy Bowden was surprised, but not
stunned, last spring when a record crowd of 16,500 attended the
Tigers' spring intrasquad game, this following a 4-7 season. ``At
some places,'' said Bowden, ``a 7-4 record will get you a raise.
This is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half hours down the road in Columbia, new South
Carolina coach Lou Holtz also has gotten an up-close-and-personal
look at the ferver of fans, who saw their team stagger to a 1-10
record a year ago but remain unwavering in their support.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PENDLETON, S.C.: ... their support.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Holtz earlier this month, sitting in a
plush conference room at South Carolina's football complex. ``South
Carolina doesn't have a tradition of winning. It's won only one
bowl game. It's never been to a major bowl. But the support is
unbelievable. The assets and facilities are second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, who left Notre Dame two years ago, never thought he would
return to coaching. He was dealing with the illness of his wife,
Beth, and because he was making ``more money than I've ever made in
my life'' from television and other business dealings, Holtz had no
financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd ever coach after Notre Dame,'' said Holtz.
``I turned (the South Carolina job) down three different times. But
I'm a teacher, and it was a challenge I like. I thrive on
challenges. I think that's what makes life exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz has had many glimpes at the importance of football to the
South Carolina fans, but none more clear than the one he got during
the spring in Hilton Head. S.C. ``I was playing in the Heritage
Golf Tournament in Harbortown,'' said Holtz. ``I had a cover head
of a leprechaun over my big driver. I had a cover of Cocky (the
South Carolina mascot) over my 3-wood. Every hole I would take out
the leprechaun and hit it. The fans noticed this and they asked,
`Why don't you hit Cocky?' I said, `Cocky won't hit anybody.' No
one laughed. That offended them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing was what happened when Holtz agreed to conduct
a football clinic for women. At first Holtz tried to get out of the
commitment. But then he learned that 1,200 women were waiting to
hear him explain just how he was going to turn South Carolina into
a winner, and many of them had planned their vacation schedules
around his clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, who has coached in both the North and South during his
27-year career, understands the differences. ``It's just more
important here,'' he said. ``You can't turn on a radio when they
are not talking about recruiting or how the team is going to be. I
turn on the sports talk shows so I can find out what's going on
with our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Football in the South also cuts across social strata. A fan is a
fan. ``I don't care if you are the governor or the paper boy or a
street department worker,'' Holtz said. ``It's the one thing
everyone has in common. `How's our team doing?' It's the one thing
that rallies everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a family thing. Tailgating is a social activiity for
which parents bring their children, who then bring their children.
</P>
<P>
   And the SEC is the heart of the South. The average stadium
capacity rate for games in the SEC is 99.6. The average attendance
is 69,900.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern football is rich in talent, from the incredibly deep
recruiting pool in Florida, which supplies not only Florida State,
Florida, and Miami, but many other major schools, to states such as
Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The migration from the North a generation ago, when families
moved from the so-called Rust Belt to the Sun Belt, has been felt
in college football. Youngsters growing up in the South can play
year-round. ``They have spring practice here,'' said Holtz, meaning
high school spring practrice.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Crimson Tide are in a down period period right now,
a notch below Florida and Tennessee, Alabama remains the prototype
of Southern football passion and history, primarily because of
Bryant. After his decision to recruit black players in 1970, Bryant
took it one step further. The next year he went to Texas and
studied the wishbone offense used by Darrell Royal.
</P>
<P>
   The result?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Alabama's record was 103-16-1, with eight SEC
titles and three national championships.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the South and college football is not new,
either. It dates back decades to when John Heisman coached at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are tales that go beyond X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman spent 19 years at Georgia Tech and left only after
getting involved in messy divorce. As part of the settlement,
Heisman and his wife had to live in separate cities. She wanted to
remain in Atlanta. So Heisman left Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   One of the legendary places in college football is Baton Rouge
and Louisiana State's Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was never louder than the night of Oct. 8, 1988, when an
undefeated Auburn team was the opponent. Trailing for the entire
game, LSU got the ball one last time, and led by quarterback Tommy
Hodson, the Tigers scored in the final seconds for a 7-6 win.
</P>
<P>
   So great were the cheers of the 79,341 that the noise registered
on the seismograph at LSU's Geography Department.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium has its own lore. It was built during the
Depression, when former governor Huey Long was having trouble
convincing even diehard Tiger fans that the state should spend
money on a football stadium during a time when families were having
difficulty putting food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Long came up with a proposal: Build new dorms for the state
univeristy.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, said the voters. Only Long built what is now Tiger Stadium
around those dorms.
</P>
<P>
   LSU fans still talk about an 89-yard run that Billy Cannon made
against Ole Miss on Halloween night, 1959, to give the Tigers a 7-3
win.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. But 40 years later, you can drive through either
one of those states (primarily Louisiana) and still hear the
broadcast of that touchdown run on the radio during football
season.
</P>

   Nothing creates more interest in the South than recruiting. It'sa year-round passion that naturally has generated legendary
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Greer, a longtime assistant coach at Georgia, remembers
the time he went after a player in one of the most rural sections
of the state. When he arrived, he found the doors of the house open
but no one around. As he walked around, he heard the sound of a car
engine or someone making the sound of a car engine shifting gears.
</P>
<P>
   He looked up and saw the recruit sitting in the driver's seat of
a car sitting on blocks without wheels, pretending that he was
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Greer climbed into the passenger's seat and said, ``Son, what
are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, I'm driving,'' said the recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind, if I ride along?'' said Greer.
</P>
<P>
   The recruit went to another SEC school, which surprised Greer a
little until the next time he went to the house and saw the car, in
the same place, with four new tires.
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant was coaching, the stories flowed like cheap whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   One SEC assitant coach absolutely had a recruit from Alabama
locked up in his mind. But as signing day approached, the coach was
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, coach,'' said the recruit. ``I'm sticking with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coach worried. And on letter-of-intent day, he
checked in a final time. ``Coach, don't worry, I'm still sticking
with you. But Coach Bryant is coming to see me this afternoon. It
won't do any good, though.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant was Bryant, and this coach fretted all afternoon,
finally driving out to the farm where the recruit lived. He pulled
off onto a side road and waited.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Bryant's entourge whizzed past in a cloud of dust.
Half an hour later, the caravan left. The coach waited five more
minutes and drove to the house, where he found the recruit crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, coach, I'm sorry, I'm going to Alabama,'' said the
recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened?'' said the stunned coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Coach Bryant asked about my parents and how they enjoyed
their jobs (for the town). I said fine. Coach Bryant said that was
good and he hoped things would be all right in school for me with
both my parents out of work, which is what would happen if I didn't
go to Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   College football in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Life or death, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Nah, it's more important than that.

EAGLES WON BATTLES IN RECRUITING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When he was an assistant under George Welsh at the
University of Virginia, working feverishly to help resurrect the
Cavaliers' football program, Tom O'Brien knew he had to look south
to the fertile yet untapped Tidewater region, where some of
Virginia's best high school players could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Virginia, hard by the Mason-Dixon line, they had to go
south to find football talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much that it was Southern football, but it was
the fact that Tidewater, Va., was the best area in the state.
That's where most of the athletes came from,'' said O'Brien, now
entering his third season as Boston College's head coach. ``It was
important in those days to establish a presence there because very
few people came from Tidewater, Va., to the University of Virginia.
In those days, the Lawrence Taylors of the world were going to the
University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, North Carolina had more Virginia players on
their roster than they had players from North Carolina,'' O'Brien
said. ``It took us maybe five years until we really hit it big down
there and once we started getting good players, then good players
beget good players, so we started a little pipeline going there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the first trickle of talent from Tidewater began in
1986, when he landed Ray Savage, a defensive end/outside linebacker
from Newport News, Va., and Keith McMeans, a safety from Virginia
Beach. ``Ray Savage, who was from the Hampton side, was the player
of the year on the peninsula and Keith McMeans was was the player
of the year in Tidewater, which is on the Virginia Beach side,''
O'Brien said. ``They both went on to be first-team All-Atlantic
Coast Conference and Savage was a Kodak All-American. Both were
very highly-recruited, nationally-recruited kids and ended up as
four-year starters on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Savage, the school's fourth all-time tackler with 302,
and McMeans, who led the country in 1987 with nine interceptions
and wound up the school's all-time leader with 17, helped bolster
the program, perhaps their most important contribution was that
they opened the doors for others from the Tidewater region, most
notably Tabb High teammates Chris Slade and Terry Kirby, both of
whom signed with Virginia in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Slade wanted to come to Virginia because of Ray
Savage,'' O'Brien said. ``So Ray Savage begat Chris Slade.'' As for
Kirby? ``Who knows why Kirby came,'' O'Brien joked. ``Maybe it was
because we did a great job recruiting him.''
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies the crux of the battle for all players,
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was said about Virginia was that it was a great
place to go to school, and it had great academics, but they never
won,'' said O'Brien. ``Now you could almost say the same thing
about Boston College. We've only won three times in the last 11
years. So, great school, great city, great academics, but they
haven't won. (Tom) Coughlin did, but he didn't stay around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if he stays around, we may not be having this
conversation, but that's what we continue to work for, getting
those types of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   While O'Brien and his staff this year assembled a class of 23
freshmen that has come to be regarded as one of the best in BC
history, only a fraction came from the South _ quarterbacks Kevin
Kiley of Fairfax, Va., and J.D. Schmidt of McLean, Va., and
offensive lineman Mark Parenteau, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. BC has
six players from Florida, five from Virginia, and two from Texas.
Of those 13, five are listed as starters: senior wide receiver
Derrick Crittenden of Annandale, Va.; senior defensive tackle Mike
Willetts of Alexandria, Va.; senior offensive lineman Darnell
Alford of Fredericksburg, Va.; sophomore punter Kevin McMyler of
Dallas; and sophomore cornerback Jonathan Ordway of Seffner, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Two others are listed as backups: junior tight end Robert Ellis
of Baytown, Texas, and sophomore defensive tackle Sean Guthrie of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are capable of elevating a team's speed and, in
some cases, making an even bigger impact at a skill position,
players from the South generally are regarded as important
additions. But, O'Brien said, a program cannot overlook its
principle recruiting base. In BC's case, that area encompasses New
England, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important because there's speed in New England,
but there's not a great number of speed players,'' O'Brien said.
``There's more kids who can run fast in the South and that's
generally why a lot of people go to the South to look for that. It
generally has to do with the weather, being outdoors year-round and
being able to run track and do those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Florida, California, and Texas are considered by
many recruiters to be hotbeds of high school talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is the fourth or fifth most populous state in the
nation right now, so there's a lot of people down there and a lot
of people who can run fast,'' O'Brien said. ``Sometimes it's
over-recruited and sometimes the grade aren't what we're looking
for, so we still have to do a good job here in New England and into
New York state, eastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. That still
has to be our base operating area.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are instances when recruiting in the South can yield
an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our second year at Virginia, we signed a kid out of Belle
Glade, Fla., named John Ford,'' O'Brien said. ``He was a wide
receiver, a tall kid about 6-2 and 195 pounds with 4.4 speed, which
in those days was pretty good. I beat Florida for him, and somehow
he came to Virginia and he came in and played as a true freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford made an immediate impact with 19 receptions for a
team-leading 545 yards (28.7 yards per catch) and seven touchdowns
in helping the Cavaliers to an 8-2-2 record and a trip to the Peach
Bowl, where they beat Purdue, 27-24. Ford finished his career
Virginia's all-time leader in receptions (128) and second in
receiving yards (2,399).
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably, as much as anybody at Virginia, helped us win,''
O'Brien said of Ford. ``Our third year there he made a ton of plays
for us in the passing game that we weren't able to make our
previous two years there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien landing Ford was something of a recruiting coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Florida was in a little bit of disarray, so it
helped,'' O'Brien said. ``And at that point he was a kid who had
definitely made up his mind that he was going to leave the state.
When we go to Florida, we look for those kids who aren't interested
in staying there. Miami, Florida, and Florida State are going to
get their share of kids down there. But they can't sign them all.
They can only sign 75 (combined) of their Division 1 scholarships
in any given year, maximum. So there's enough good players, and we
just have to continue to go down there and find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that diligence can pay off with a find, which was the
case with Ordway.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-10-inch, 178-pound sophomore who is projected to start
this season, Ordway had designs, as do most football players
growing up in Florida, of playing for one of the Big Three: Miami,
Florida, or Florida State. But in a year when Hillsborough County
was teeming with talent such as Travis Henry (now at Tennessee),
Kenny Kelly (now at Miami), and Daryl Jackson (now at Florida),
Ordway was overlooked by the state's major programs, getting
attention from Central Florida, Florida A&AMP;M, Army, and The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College? The only thing Ordway knew about the Jesuit
school was that Doug Flutie had once played there. But when Tim
Rose, BC's former defensive coordinator, saw tapes of Ordway in
action, as a running back, he knew he had discovered a diamond in
the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the exact same thing he said to me,'' said Ordway, who
was part of O'Brien's first class of recruits. ``He said I was a
diamond-in-the-rough-type of guy. But those were the exact words he
used, diamond in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could've gone to smaller schools in Florida, like Central
Florida and FAMU, and gotten the chance to stay at home, but I
don't think I would've had the same exposure. It's not so much as
being on TV, it's more about playing a good schedule. So if you
can't be at Miami, then the next best thing is to play against
Miami and maybe beat Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Eagles are to do so, O'Brien must be able to fight fire
with fire by getting some of the players available to Hurricanes
coach Butch Davis. If not, BC faces an uneven playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still look for the best players we can get and if there's
speed in New England, then it's much better for us because we have
a much better chance of recruiting them because of the location,''
O'Brien said. ``But if we can't find it, then we have to go
somewhere else. Whether that be North Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
we have to go find a kid with good academics, a kid who can fit in
Boston College, and fit in the city of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys do a great job of recruiting. They get kids real
interested and pumped up about Boston College. We bring them on and
they see the stadium and the things going on here and see that it's
a good setup. We have a lot of good things to sell about Boston
College. Then distance becomes a factor, being away from their
family becomes a factor, and opportunity to play becomes more of a
factor as we recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to start winning and show success in this program,
then you'll have a better chance to get anybody. You may have a lot
to sell but the bottom line is that kids want to play on winning
football teams.''

JIMMY BUFFETT ENJOYS THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ageless free spirit Jimmy Buffett telephoned from Martha's
Vineyard this week. ``I'm sitting on a boat enjoying some great
weather, but the fish aren't biting today,'' says Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Minor gripe aside, Buffett is still having the time of his life.
He's always been adept at balancing business and pleasure, but this
summer he's found a formula that has caused his ``energy level to
go way up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he has stopped playing back-to-back shows
and is only performing on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays _ a
dream schedule for most artists. Then again, it's a schedule that
he's earned after 30 years on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun _ and I think this is a more civilized way to
approach this,'' says Buffett, who plays the Tweeter Center in
Mansfield, Mass. Thursday and next Saturday. It marks the first
time in years that he's cut back to two dates at the Tweeter
(rather than three or even four). But the payback, in his opinion,
is better shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cutting back in all the markets. I could play more if I
wanted to,'' he says. ``But this way, I don't feel burned out
anymore. Sometimes in the past, you'd get three-fourths of the way
through a run, and you'd really have to dig for it. But I'm
enjoying it much more now.''
</P>
<P>
   And no longer does he talk of being overworked and needing a
year off. ``We've got a nice pace now, and yes, I'm going out again
next year,'' says Buffett, 52. ``I had always planned on quitting
in the next millennium, but this is far from being a grind. If
people are still coming, then I'm going to play for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his Coral Reefer Band are also broadcasting all of the
shows on ``Radio Margaritaville,'' on his Web site,
margaritaville.com. ``I don't care if anyone bootlegs it or not,''
says Buffett. ``And I love it that there are requests from all over
the world for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's latest tour is in support of his new album, ``Beach
House on the Moon,'' his best-selling disc in a while. It contains
typically playful Buffett tunes such as ``I Will Play for Gumbo''
(which has found its way into his show), as well as more probing
numbers such as ``Permanent Reminder'' (about an unwanted
pregnancy) and ``Pacing the Cage,'' a Bruce Cockburn song.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's summer tour ends at the Tweeter Center (``It will
always be Great Woods to me,'' he says, referring to its previous
name). He then plans to take his boat out to Nantucket and up to
Maine for more rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   A treat this summer is the video appearance of news-anchor icon
Walter Cronkite, a Buffett friend who narrates the ``Beach House on
the Moon'' landing during the show. Cronkite appears in a Hawaiian
shirt, which makes him blend in with the Parrotheads in the crowd.
Cronkite is expected to attend next Saturday's show at the Tweeter
Center, Buffett says.
</P>
<P>
   A new addition to the tour is Doyle Gresham on pedal steel
guitar. ``He was on my first three or four albums,'' says Buffett.
``I'm so pleased to have him out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's more flexible schedule has allowed him to play some
smaller gigs this summer with Coral Reefer mate Mac McAnally. ``In
Atlanta we played a 500-seat theater, and in Chicago we just played
at the House of Blues,'' says Buffett. ``It's great to be a club
player again.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, Buffett plans to get a couple of other projects
whipped into shape. One is the movie version of his best-selling
novel, ``Where is Joe Merchant,'' which he describes as a ``couple
of margaritas, a seaplane chase, a couple of pirates, and pretty
girls _ what else would you want?'' He hopes to hire a director for
it shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects are a short story collection (he writes a page a
day on his laptop) and a touring version of the mischievous
Caribbean-based musical, ``Don't Stop the Carnival,'' which he
adapted with Herman Wouk from Wouk's novel of that name. Buffett
hopes to mount that in San Diego next year and tour it in rock
halls of up to 3,000 seats but skip Broadway, where he first
thought of taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is also a free agent in terms of his recording contract.
He just delivered his last album for Island Records and is weighing
options for his next. ``It's nice to be a free agent and still feel
you're at the top of your game,'' says Buffett. ``And I'm lucky to
be able to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southside on the prowl again: Southside Johnny, the Bruce
Springsteen buddy whose rowdy R &AMP; B shows have been the stuff of
legend, is back performing after taking a couple of years off. ``I
quit, actually, but the bills didn't quit,'' he says. ``Still, I
had enough money saved up to go a year or two without working. My
mother also died and my marriage broke up, so I needed to get
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Southside hopped in his car and drove 40,000 miles around the
country. ``I didn't run into a lot of people. I drove the back
roads,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He had felt shunned by the music industry, despite having a
loyal group of fans. ``You appreciate the fans a lot more when you
go away,'' says Southside.
</P>
<P>
   Southside is back with the Asbury Jukes _ a horn band hatched
from the same New Jersey club scene as Springsteen and the E Street
Band. Southside went to high school with Springsteen's bassist,
Garry Tallent, who is expected to produce his next album. Southside
remains friends with Springsteen and caught one of the latter's
recent Jersey shows but missed saying hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came in, he had a lot of people around him, so I
didn't want to bother him. And when he left, I was playing pinball
backstage,'' says Southside.

TURKEY QUAKE EXACTS TOLL ON CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ISTANBUL _ ``We haven't told him yet,'' said 7-year-old Serhan
Akarsu's Aunt Ayse in a hushed voice on the other side of the glass
in Istanbul's Numune Hospital. A thin rake of a child, Serhan
wasn't playing with the toys next to him on the bed, or looking
much at anything.
</P>
<P>
   After four hours buried in the wreckage of his family's
five-story apartment block in Izmit, he had been rushed from one
overloaded hospital to another as gangrene ate away at his leg. He
ended up here while his mother, sister, and uncle died under the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how we're going to tell him, either,'' his aunt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has yet to start down the road to recovery from last
week's massive earthquake, which killed more than 13,000 and left
more than 200,000 homeless. But for the country's youngest victims,
many of whom were orphaned by the calamity, the path ahead seems
even more impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital's trauma ward, the children lay in silent shock
or exhibit a detachment of a noisier kind, playing frantically and
telling stories with fantastic explanations of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``One told me the earthquake came from the sea and swallowed
everything,'' said psychologist Nese Karabekir of the Istanbul
Psychodrama and Counseling Center. ``Others say their parents are
coming soon, that they've just gone away for a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Serhan was 4-year-old Ceren Korkmaz, her head
shaved from an operation that has left a circle of stitches around
her skull. Ceren, whose leg also was being treated for gangrene,
spent 14 hours trapped between fallen masonry before finally being
dug out.
</P>
<P>
   Large families had gathered around many beds, but around Ceren's
sat only one surviving cousin, Hatice. ``I don't want to talk. I
can't talk,'' Hatice said. ``There's nothing to say now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karabekir said thousands of people are in shock. ``Amongst
adults, the symptoms won't show for two or three weeks _ maybe even
a year _ because right now they are trying to be strong and help
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they have lost family, friends, neighbors, but that
right now they don't feel anything and feel guilty for not feeling
anything,'' Karabekir said. ``But it will come. In the children it
shows earlier, though.''
</P>
<P>
   At an Israeli field hospital in Adapazari, one of the
hardest-hit towns in the region, the initial flood of battered and
injured survivors has receded. But Anrieta Levi of the Israeli Army
medical team says the trauma is showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the patients are deeply affected,'' she said as the rain
spattered on the canvas ward in which half a dozen other children
lay, most sleeping or clinging silently to the arms of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had four suicide attempts. Some people continued
feeling the earthquake long after. But with the kids . . . well, we
hope their chances of recovery are greater, that perhaps they can't
see so much what's been going on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleague, Benjamin Krasna, said: ``The first day we were
here, we had an 8-year-old boy who'd been under the wreckage for
four days, trapped in a space one and a half-foot tall. All his
family are dead. He was so quiet. His uncle came. We just have to
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has any real idea how many orphans Turkey's worst
earthquake has left. Government statistics for deaths and injuries,
which were revised downward Wednesday before resuming their climb
Thursday, are suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of denial everywhere,'' said Ali Carkan at the
polyclinic in Istanbul's Cerrahpasa Hospital. ``Nobody wants this
to have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey possesses no psychological trauma center for dealing with
events of this kind. ``We are late,'' admitted Karabekir, ``but
hopefully not too late for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And some help is promised. A team of French psychologists is en
route to counsel500 people in the quake zone, and a group of
volunteer Turkish counselors is being mobilized.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish parliamentarian Gonul Saray has been at the state
hospital in Adapazari since the day after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't ready,'' he said. ``We have to have psychological
counseling centers here where the problem is. We have to think what
will be the children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The future seems uncertain for Serhan. ``When he's better, we'll
take him to Ankara, somewhere safer,'' his aunt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when he's ready, somehow, we have to tell him. He is a
clever boy though,'' she said, smiling nervously, ``he was always
very clever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ceren's cousin, Hatice, had little to say about tomorrow.
``We are alone now,'' she said, ``Ceren and I are totally alone.''

BROOKS AND STONE INSPIRE `MUSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MUSE 
Directed by: Albert Brooks 
Screenplay by: Brooks, Monica Johnson 
Starring: Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie MacDowell, Jeff Bridges 
Running time: 97 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' is a tangy little winner that finally might be the
film to transform Albert Brooks from a connoisseur's item into a
mainstream success and increase awareness of Sharon Stone's
versatility and comic abilities. A smart and wickedly knowing
satire of Hollywood craziness, it immediately claims a place
alongside ``The Player,'' ``Swimming with Sharks,'' and a select
handful of other movies about how movies get made and lives get
unmade in Hollywood. Brooks has always cast himself as the clever,
out-of-step schlemiel who stands around dispensing a lot of
hilariously cranky why-me? questions and asides while the sky falls
on his head. But his persona and his target have never coincided
more happily than here in a role as a desperate screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins brilliantly, with Brooks's writer, Steven
Philips, accepting a humanitarian award with a furrow of worry
engraved on his brow, as if he knows no good can come of it. Sure
enough, the humanitarian award is used against him the very next
day, as evidence that he has lost his edge _ which, in Hollywood,
is to say his potency, his savvy, and his saleability. Smiling a
smile too contemptuous to conceal its falseness, his drolly slimy
boss (Mark Feuerstein) drawls, ``Congratulations, was that this
year?'' Then, as if it was the merest afterthought, he informs the
writer that he's fired and could he please clear out his office by
5 o'clock because Brian De Palma needs it.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to get advice from his longtime pal and fellow writer
played by Jeff Bridges, Brooks's Steve sees his colleague planting
a kiss on a blonde he's sending off in a taxi. Don't get the wrong
idea, Bridges's married pal tells him. It's not what you think. The
confident beauty played by Sharon Stone, he says, is nothing less
than a muse. Bingo! Brooks alone, with his comedy of pessimism, can
be too much of a downer to carry a film. Here, though, he's got a
lot of help, starting with his skewering of massively insecure
Hollywood's way of constantly bringing in big-bucks experts to
repair ailing big-bucks projects. Most of the help comes from
Stone, who shines as a high-maintenance muse with a delightful
flair for insouciant comedy.
</P>
<P>
   No star has made a more varied and more interesting set of
career choices than Stone in recent years, and she's right on
target here as one of Zeus's nine daughters, named Sarah _ as in,
her considerable clientele hopes, serendipity. She doesn't take
money, she explains, and she clearly isn't impressed by the little
blue box offering he brought her from Tiffany's. She simply throws
it on top of the other, bigger, unopened Tiffany's boxes on her
mantelpiece, and informs him that while she doesn't accept money,
the way the muse thing works is that the client takes on all her
expenses. They begin with her insistence on being installed in a
$1,700-per-night suite at the Four Seasons. Also, she adds, all her
wants and whims must be satisfied around the clock, such as, for
instance, her craving for a Waldorf salad in the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   And oh yes, she doesn't write, she inspires, this muse who is
indistinguishable from a princess. When the screenwriter sees his
bank acount going up in smoke, and his wife (Andie MacDowell)
wonders pointedly where he rushes off to at all hours, he not only
owns up, but ushers the muse into their house to save money while
his creativity revives. Which it does, slowly. But, unpredictably,
and troublingly to him, his wife's creativity spikes even higher.
She and the muse hit it off and the next thing the screenwriter
knows, his wife's success starts surpassing his. The film is
stuffed with amusing industry bits that will first detonate laughs
and then reinforce the audience's vicarious feeling of being
ushered into the Hollywood insider's club.
</P>
<P>
   One involves the writer being dissed royally when he goes to an
appointment he can hardly believe he got with Steven Spielberg. But
then the muse unfurls her share of surprises, too. So does Brooks.
If his character is too depressed to be flamboyant, everybody
surrounding him more than fills the energy and personality gaps
left by his whiny sad-sack persona, right through the slightly
ramshackle windup. There are hilarious cameos. One involves
Wolfgang Puck, but the funniest spotlight A-list fixtures are
Martin Scorsese and James Cameron. They dutifully troop to the
screenwriter's guest house for emergency insights, taking it on
faith that a muse called Sarah will lead them to a guy called
Oscar. Resonance, anyone? In a summer of costly noise and mostly
witless dross, ``The Muse'' stands out as the season's brightest
piece of counterprogramming from the land where nobody knows
anything and everybody craves magic.

 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Rene Gayo, who wanted Michael Bishop to be a baseball
player, wasn't overjoyed by the news on his voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   The message came from Boston. The caller, a reporter, left word
that Bishop was the talk of the New England Patriots' training
camp. Bishop had people excited. He was throwing passes, running
out of trouble, repairing busted plays on the fly, making everyone
wonder how in the world he went from the No. 2 pick in Heisman
Trophy balloting to the 227th pick in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking good for Michael,'' said the caller. ``He's
got another game Saturday night . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   The message ended.
</P>
<P>
   Gayo winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, I said, `My dream's over,' '' said Gayo, reached
Thursday at his hotel room in the Dominican Republic, where he was
checking up on prospects for the Cleveland Indians. ``Honestly, I
was hoping to hear something like it wasn't working out, maybe he
hated it, and he'd call me this winter and say, `Hey, Rene, let's
give baseball a try.' Right. No such luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayo, a scout for Cleveland, twice convinced the Indians to
draft Bishop, first in '95 and again this spring. He liked his arm.
More than that, he liked his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he liked Bishop's nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a true fearlessness, the kind you see in exceptional,
great athletes,'' said Gayo, who first followed Bishop in his days
as a catcher-pitcher-first baseman-outfielder for Willis (Texas)
High School. ``I mean, what do I know about football, right? I'm a
baseball scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I went and watched him play football in junior college _ I
stood right on the sidelines _ and that was serious contact. Guys
were nailing him. But he'd just turn his shoulder and keep going
like, I don't know, he was out there playing by himself. You see
that attitude in baseball, too. It's that Reggie Jackson attitude.
Mr. October. That's Michael. He wants that attention on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will hit the three-quarter pole in the exhibition
season Saturday night when they face the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay
and the focus is squarely on the 23-year-old Bishop. At the moment,
he remains the No. 3 quarterback on the New England depth chart. In
the grand scheme of things, he won't be a starting signal-caller
this season, and coach Pete Carroll has said adamantly that he
won't turn Bishop into a Kordell Stewart clone, some hybrid
slasher/ QB/running back dropped into the lineup like some circus
sideshow act.
</P>
<P>
   But in two exhibition game appearances, Bishop has the
imaginations of Patriots fans revving. Could he be more than a No.
3? They've seen glimpses of his fearlessness, his fiery
competitiveness. They've seen the power in his arm, the ingenuity
in his head. In the often mundane world of NFL quarterbacking
(read: three steps back, look, throw, and most important, survive),
he already is a delightful deviant. He'll duck and run. He'll throw
long and longer. When he takes the field, suddenly all the
horizontal and vertical lines disappear and the static world of run
and throw turns into a football funhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like some of the things that I've been doing in games,
the rest of my teammates feel that no matter what the situation is,
if I get the opportunity to get in the game, I'll make something
happen,'' Bishop said earlier this week, just before the Patriots
broke training camp in Smithfield, R.I. ``I think that says a lot.
Because if Drew (Bledsoe) goes down, or John (Friesz) goes down,
and they put me in the game, my teammates know I am going in to
win. We can be losing by 20, I'm still going in to put points on
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where is this late-summer joyride going? No one knows. Four
months ago, Bishop also was the talk of the league, but for a much
different reason. He experienced a draft-day freefall. Runner-up to
Texas running back Ricky Williams in the Heisman voting, he finally
was snatched by the Patriots in the seventh round. In two years as
the starting QB, he led Kansas State to a 22-3 record, hitting on
244 of 480 passes and throwing a school-record 36 TD passes. But
when it came time to catch the eyes of NFL talent scouts, he
couldn't connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the season is over, everyone starts to spend time
analyzing players,'' said Bobby Grier, New England's vice president
of player personnel. ``I think people began to focus on what they
felt were his faults _ that he carried the ball too low, or maybe
that his throwing motion was erratic. Little things. Michael got
overanalyzed, that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Willis, Texas, the Bishops had a barbecue on draft day.
Friends and relatives flocked to Reese Street, where Artis and
Ethel Bishop were doing it up right. Their son, who used to strap
bicycle tires on the backyard fence and race across the yard,
firing footballs through the makeshift target from 30 yards out,
was headed to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Artis worked the BBQ pit in the vacant lot next door. Ethel
greeted visitors. The first day of the draft came and went and
Michael wasn't drafted. Draft day No. 2 arrived and the rounds
continued without Bishop getting called. Finally, in the seventh
and final round, the Patriots raised their hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the house, and it was very tense,'' said David T.
Sine, who was Bishop's quarterback coach at Willis High and has
remained a close friend. ``With all the talk, I expected he'd go
maybe in the fourth or fifth round _ but in many ways, that's the
story of Michael Bishop. He gets over obstacles, puts them behind
him and moves on to tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week about the indifference he encountered in the
draft, Bishop said, ``I really don't know what happened _ there's
no answer that I can come up with. At this point in time, I'm just
living with it. I was shocked the way the situation went down, but
I have no control over that. All I can do is be glad I got the
opportunity to play and make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop has become accustomed to the doubting game. Out of high
school, a quarterback since the age of 9, his dream was to
quarterback a major college team. But his grades were in question _
a slip-up, his father explains, in the number of core credits
required _ and a number of big schools wanted him to try a position
other than QB. He opted for Blinn Junior College in Brenham, Texas,
where he led the school to back-to-back National Junior College
Athletic Association titles.
</P>
<P>
   After two stellar seasons directing Blinn, Bishop still found
many big schools reluctant to recruit him as their signal-caller,
and he finally opted for Kansas State, where head coach Bill Snyder
assured him a shot at being the club's QB. Two years later, he left
with a 22-3 record, his name established as a fierce, fiery
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Sine, who used to meet with Bishop at Aunt Annie's diner in
Willis for game-day breakfast (Bishop was a biscuit and sausage
guy), knows that the doubting of others has been a compelling force
in his ex-student's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he keeps this one quote in his head,'' said Sine. ``It
came from the preacher who spoke at (former Houston Oiler) Jeff
Alm's funeral. He said, `In order to sail the high seas of
tomorrow, you cannot be anchored to yesterday.' Michael and I talk
at least twice a week, and invariably one of us reminds the other
of that quote. No matter what anyone says about him, thinks about
him, all he's worried about is tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grier believes Carroll and the rest of the coaching staff will
find ways for Bishop to get in the game this season. Maybe that
will be as the No. 3 QB. Maybe they'll have to improvise. Following
the season, said Grier, NFL Europe could be an ideal place for
Bishop to hone his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an excellent opportunity for him to go in and
start 10 games,'' said Grier. ``Dick Curl, coach of the Rhein Fire,
was in our camp a few days and he liked Bishop a lot. He said he'd
take him right now. It's a passing team, and they get blitzed a lot
because of that, and Dick said to me, `They'd be scared to blitz
against that guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Indians have held out the option that Bishop will
come back to them. Bishop hasn't played baseball since his high
school days, but Gayo believes he still could make it a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' said Artis Bishop, who four years
ago watched his son turn down an $80,000 signing bonus from the
Indians. ``The superstar that he is, even Michael Jordan couldn't
make it in baseball. I think Michael (Bishop) made the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, for 15 years now, Artis Bishop has watched his son toss
a football from one end of Reese Street to the other. There is some
heritage in that arm. Kelly Bishop, Michael's grandfather, was a
pitcher in the Negro leagues. In his early teens, Michael already
could toss a football some 70 yards in the air. One report from his
college days had him flinging it 93 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question isn't how far he can throw, but how far those
tosses can take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a long wait, but hopefully I won't end up in that
situation,'' said Bishop, knowing the life of a No. 3 quarterback
can be more play watching than playmaking. ``If I get the
opportunity to compete for the job, I'm going in and give it all I
have _ and everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Down there in the Dominican Republic, Gayo has no doubts Bishop
is right. ``If you doubt him,'' said Gayo, ``that's when he
flourishes. I've got no doubt he'll throw the hell out of the ball
and compete like crazy. That's just the way he is. There's nothing
wrong with him, except I don't have him and the Patriots do. He's
got it, the right stuff. Michael Bishop has got the right stuff.''

RUN, CATCH, KISS 
By Amy Sohn 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 255 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity poor Ariel Steiner. A would-be actress and recent Brown
grad, Steiner just wants to be loved _ although she wouldn't mind
also being gainfully employed. She's smart, she's hip, but at heart
she's also a traditional Brooklyn girl. And, unlike some misguided
young urban heroines of late (such as Bridget Jones), she's smart
enough to recognize her true old-fashioned self. ``Deep down I was
really a shtetl girl,'' she tells us early on. ``I didn't want the
pogroms. I just wanted the certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Steiner is, of course, a contemporary Everywoman, a
``hopeless romantic trapped in the body of a seething hussy.'' She
also seems to be a very thinly veiled version of her creator, Amy
Sohn. In what must be deemed a roman a clef, Steiner/Sohn stumbles
into a writing career by way of the New York alternative press and
ends up with the beginning of a book.
</P>
<P>
   The author's note says nothing about how Sohn's career was
launched; in ``Run Catch Kiss,'' her heroine yearns first for the
stage, but her acting aspirations only land her humiliation; she
keeps getting sent to audition for ``fat roles'' because of her
``zaftig'' figure. After penning a provocative monologue (``Vanya
in My Vulva'') for a very off-Broadway production, Steiner gets an
offstage break when it gets published by an alternative weekly. Her
male editors find her spicy offerings a welcome variation in their
otherwise all-male roster of first-person columnists. They hire her
to chronicle her adventures in the greater Manhattan dating pool in
detail _ and the dirtier the better _ for a column, which they name
(like the book) for a girls-against-boys schoolyard game, run catch
kiss. (Sohn writes the ``Female Trouble'' column for New York
Press.)
</P>
<P>
   That's where Ariel runs into her own brand of female trouble.
Just as her career is heating up, her love life is cooling down.
Soon reminiscences are substituting for current affairs, and her
permissible elaborations begin to verge on fiction, which her
editors expressly forbid. And the hot prose really begins to get
its author into hot water.
</P>
<P>
   With its contemporary foibles and likable heroine, Sohn has a
pleasantly readable winner in this debut novel. Her Ariel is smart,
but she stumbles often enough to be vulnerable, coping with
loneliness and, eventually, the ups and downs of a real romance
(with a fellow writer she dubs ``Novel Lover'' in her column). And
although the situations she faces are exaggerated, they do play up
not only the pitfalls of modern romance but also the conflicts
blossoming young adults have with their parents, pitting their
pride against their desire to keep their children innocent and
protected. ``He was in a horrifying Jewish parent predicament,''
she says of her father once her column has become a hit. It was as
if, she understands, ``his child had been awarded the Pulitzer
Prize . . . in pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Sohn's verbal ripostes often strike home, and when skewering the
hip downtown club scene (in which every bar has a jokey name, such
as BarF, so named because it is on Fifth Avenue), she throws out
quite a few funny asides. But her smart-aleck nature can also trip
her up. Her compound and often unprintable words _ such as her
nickname for her boss _ are sophomoric, and her slam-blast putdowns
of casual lovers (such as ``Tell, an occasionally cross-dressing
punk rock grad student who thanked me for helping him realize that
all women are evil'') are funny at first, but after a few tend
toward the flip.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while her heroine goes through quite a lot (from oral sex
in a Times Square peep show to humiliation while laboring as a
Hebrew teacher), she doesn't really grow much. At the end, as at
this light novel's start, she's still virtually clueless: once
again looking for a job and living with her parents. But ``Run
Catch Kiss'' isn't the kind of novel one picks up for greater
enlightenment. It's a flirtation, fun and sexy, and soon forgotten.

POLISH UP THAT BIG BRASS BELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 29, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have an old locomotive bell, solid bass, that someone
painted black. How can I remove that black paint and polish up the
big brass bell? About half has peeled off, and I think there is
only one coat.
</P>
<P>
   ALLAN VAUGHAN, Pride's Crossing, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Tch, tch. I am not tching at you, Allan Vaughan, but at
people who do such things to perfectly good materials such as solid
brass.
</P>
<P>
   But no real damage was done, and here is how you can polish up
that big brass bell. Since it is one coat and on brass, removing it
will be easy. Use a citrus-based remover, such as Citristrip. Paint
it on, let it sit for five to 15 minutes, then scrub off with a
Scotch pad, not steel wool. You may have to repeat, but I doubt it;
you can wash remaining remover and paint residue with water. This
treatment will tarnish the brass more than it is already tarnished,
but you can restore it to pristine condition by polishing with
Noxon and a power buffing bonnet on an electric drill.
</P>
<P>
   A homemade brass polish is this: Mix equal parts salt and flour,
add vinegar to make a paste, spread onto brass, wait an hour, then
scrub and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is best to polish the bell, then keep it as is,
requiring periodic polishing. Without polishing it will tarnish to
a dull brass, but remember, tarnished brass is sold as antique
brass and is more expensive than just plain old solid brass. Or, if
you like, you can spray the bell with a clear aerosol plastic
spray, such as Krylon. This is not as good as factory lacquering,
but it will prevent tarnishing for some time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. All of the ceilings in my condo are that ugly, swirly finish,
which I would like to smooth off. The ceilings must be 30 years
old, and there are 900 square feet of ceiling. Is this feasible?
</P>
<P>
   JUDITH BORIT, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whoever invented that swirl pattern is spending his time in
hell painting each swirl with a toothbrush. It's feasible, all
right, but for 900 square feet, it is a major project. The swirl is
probably in the plaster, so sanding it smooth is your only option
other than putting up Blueboard and a skimcoat on the ceiling. I
don't think the swirl is in the paint, but if it is, you can sand
it off.
</P>
<P>
   But one possibility, and a way to avoid sanding or other
terrifying projects: Keep painting the ceiling, one thin coat at
time, and eventually, afer many coats, and when you and I are
(really) old, the paint will smooth out those swirls.
</P>
<P>
   If you are doing any of this yourself, avoid tackling 900 square
feet at a time. With that big an area, there will be no end in
sight. If you do one room at a time, you will see an end to your
work, and you can take comfort in that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to put shingles over old clapboards on the third-floor
exterior walls of my triple-decker, where the clapboards are at
their worst. The clapboards on the first two stories are OK. How
can I get the wall to flare at the bottom of the third story?
</P>
<P>
   LORRAINE POLLACK, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There may be a natural flare to the wall on the third floor.
Many three-deckers were built that way; it's a good architectural
trick to keep those tall, narrow buildings from taking off,
visually, into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no flare, you can install one yourself. If there is,
you can just follow it with the new shingles or add to it.
</P>
<P>
   To make a flare or add to it, nail a 1 x 2 at the bottom of the
third-floor wall, horizontally. Install the under course of
shingles, overhanging the 1 x 2 by 1/2- to 3/4-inch. Then apply the
starter course of shingles directly onto the under course.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of flare with the shingles overhanging the 1 x 2 will
provide a distinct shadow line. If you feel the flare is too
severe, replace the 1 x 2 with a board 1/2-inch thick or even
1/4-inch thick. But you still want to let the shingles overhang by
the specified amount, and to double that course.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some interior unfinished wood shutters. What is the
easy way to paint them? There are a lot of them, so I don't want to
use more than one coat.
</P>
<P>
   LUCIE MUHLFELDER, Concord, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. For a decent job, you need two coats: one a primer, the other
the finish. There is no easy way, but spraying from an aerosol can
is probably the easiest, although most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Krylon makes various kinds of aerosol paints; if you can find a
can of primer-sealer or undercoater, all the better; otherwise you
have to brush on a latex enamel undercoater. Using a brush will
make life miserable for you, but it can't be helped. After that,
spraying the enamel will be easy and quick.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's the easiest part: Hang each shutter on a
clothesline, spray both sides, and be sure to keep wiggling and
moving the louvers back and forth so they will operate properly
when the enamel dries.
</P>

WITH `IN TOO DEEP,' RAPPER LL COOL J GETS SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His name is James Todd Smith, and face to face, you shake hands
warmly and call the engaging man in the red-white-and-blue running
suit and Yankees baseball cap James. But you know him as LL Cool J
_ one of rap's longest-running stars (15 years, over 20 million CDs
sold) and an emerging actor. His stage moniker, taken as a
teenager, stands for Ladies Love Cool James.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Deep Blue Sea,'' LL Cool J plays an amiable shark-fighting
chef named Preacher, a good guy in the mix. But the largest role
he's undertaken is in the just-released drugs-and-crime movie, ``In
Too Deep,'' in which he plays an evil millionaire who goes by the
name of God. In this film, the ladies will not love cool James, nor
will the men. This is no benevolent God _ although, when it suits
him, he pretends to be. God is the street-name taken by a cunning,
vicious, high-stakes drug dealer born Dwayne Giddins.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds familiar, it should: ``In Too Deep,'' though set
in Cincinnati, is loosely based on the tale of a Roxbury, Mass.
drug kingpin, Darryl Whiting, who went by the same God tag, and
ruled the roost a decade ago. (He was convicted in 1991 and is
serving a life sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unlikely that LL Cool J should play such a hard
character. He's not a gangsta rapper, never has been. He's one of
the hip-hop world's good guys, the guy in the ever-present Kangol
hat whose hits include ``Mama Said Knock You Out,''
``Around-the-Way Girl,'' ``Doin' It,'' ``Phenomenon,'' ``Hey
Lover,'' and ``I Need Love.'' And that, in part, is why he fought
so hard for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard to convince (director) Michael Rymer that I
was capable of doing this,'' says Cool J, savoring a noontime steak
in the Back Bay last week. ``He didn't think that I could be a
villain. He wasn't sure people would believe me as a villain; he
thought all my roles have been likable. I had to convince him:
`Mike, I'm an actor, I'm capable of doing different things in real
life, and as an actor I can do different roles.' I did an
unbelievable amount of work for this thing. . . . If I'm doing my
job as actor and you don't forget about LL the rapper then I'm not
doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare to be God, LL Cool J went back to the video. ``I was
really studying acting as a craft,'' he says, ``looking at the old
films of Morgan Freeman like `Street Smart,' looking at `The
Untouchables,' with Robert DeNiro and Kevin Costner. It took me two
to three months to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge was that God is not 100 percent bad to the
bone. He hosts a Thanksgiving Day dinner for everyone in the 'hood;
he takes care of his people; he gets to pose as a pillar of his
community. He gets to, in effect, say `Here's your lovely turkey
dinner and, by the way, would your children care for some crack?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a scene,'' says Cool J, `'where he's talking to this
girl at the Thanksgiving scene, this big carnival thing, and he
says `If you get a little stressed,' he has the drugs to help you
get by. He does whatever he has to do to say in control: drugs,
intimidation, fear, guns, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   As God's foes learn, if you cross him, or he thinks you've
crossed him, he quickly snaps into being a human pit bull, starved
of meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money allows you'' liberties, suggests Cool J. ``It reinforces
the idea that if you are a jerk and you get some women, if you have
money you'll be a bigger jerk. . . . This is a very disturbing
movie, it's dark. And I think it's right: That is the way it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're in a black-oriented movie and you're a black guy and
you're playing a black thug, well, questions, albeit cliched ones,
come up about what your choice of the role is saying to your
community. ``That's OK,'' says Cool J, of the question, but adds,
``Robert DeNiro was in `Goodfellas' and Al Pacino was in `The
Godfather' and they're Italian-Americans and they say that's OK
because we're telling a story and we're in the storytelling
business. Maybe, one day I will play a black scientist or a black
DA. I see no reason as an African-American to limit myself in
either direction _ any role that a white has played in Hollywood a
black can play.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``In Too Deep,'' Cool J says he had to work at things such
as not putting on a tough face to scream at his minions or his
enemies. ``That,'' he says, ``is not as powerful as going `Hey,
man, I told you what to do with your dumb ass.' He is very
manipulative, cold and calculated, but in some sick way he loved to
communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a grittiness about the $12 million film that makes the
tension seem real. None of the gunplay looks exciting or fun. The
pain feels palapable. If there is a message, Cool J says, it's
``watch your choices. Young kids have choices in life. You don't
have to base your choices on instant gratification. Base your
choices on what's right and don't be seduced, by, like the Chinese
say, the man with the Buddha mouth and the snake's heart. Remember
God exists'' _ and here, LL Cool J's talking about the Lord, not
the drug lord _ ``and there are different areas in the world'' in
which to work. ``The investment world, the marketing world. Don't
be sucked in.''
</P>
<P>
   LL Cool J's career as a rapper resumes in November when a new,
as yet untitled album comes out. Here's how he looks at his two
main worlds: ``You know how they have those graphs when people are
doing presentations? They have two circles that interlock in the
middle? That interlock is the audience that sees me as an actor and
a rapper, but then I have two whole pieces over here that aren't
crossing the line. The rap audience will know about the film, but
the film audience will not always know about the rap. It's
exciting. I get to express myself on different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to deny my past for my future,'' he reasons,
about rap and film. Cool J, who hails from Brooklyn, has lived in
Beverly Hills for four years to work on the TV show ``In The
House.'' He recently moved back to New York ``to be closer to my
reference point.. . . to stay focused . . . to reconstruct and get
my mind together.'' He said he had lost some of his edge out west.
``I don't ever want to give the general public the feeling where I
forget where I came from.''
</P>
<P>
   His new album? He calls it a `'street record. I am going to
occupy the same space that I have always occupied. I am going to
shoot my shot. Nothing is easy and I am not going to take it for
granted. I am going to have some fun and make some cool records. I
am not going to make a record about killing everybody because that
is not what I do and I am not interested in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his longevity in the quick-turnover rap realm, he says, ``I
don't know, you can't cheat the public. It's like a relationship
you have. You make a bad record, it's like an argument _ you have
to make up. Elton John lasted, Mick Jagger lasted, Tina Turner
lasted. (Pop music) can be a fling or a relationship. I didn't have
a fling with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   LL Cool J, at 30, is happily married with three kids, 9, 8 and 3
_ no, he wouldn't allow any of them to see ``In Too Deep.'' He's
tight with God _ yes, the Biblical one _ and says, ``I am really
serious. When I pray, I get down on my knees. I was raised
Catholic, and I have always had the belief. I have always tried to
do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived this life so far and am doing well,'' Cool J
says, summing up. ``I am thankful, I work hard . . . I want contact
with the whole world.'' He has two albums left on his contract with
Island/Def Jam and then says, ``I don't know where I will be. I'm
kind of a free agent. . . . When the time comes, and I'm ready to
make a complete transition from music to something'' that he will
do.

MCENROE SAYS OPEN UP THE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't take much for John McEnroe to get started.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked the CBS tennis analyst a question about empty
seats at the Arthur Ashe Stadium at the National Tennis Center in
Flushing Meadow, N.Y., and McEnroe had an out-of-body experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium is way too big,'' McEnroe said. ``I don't know why
they built it that big. The closest thing they had to a full house
was during the first day at the ceremony. I just don't understand.
It holds, what, 22,500 people people? And way too often, there are
too many empty seats.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference call that was supposed to be about the upcoming
US Open turned into a McEnroe soliloquy on a wide range of
topics.``Tennis already has enough problems being an upper-class,
rich sport and not accessible enough to the average American,''
McEnroe said. ``The empty seats only exacerbate the problem. They
should have built a smaller stadium with a cozier atmosphere. I
tell you how to change that. Let people in for free. Have a line
for free seats.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe was equally candid about the player rankings. ``We've
had five different No. 1 players and the people don't care,'' he
said. ``It doesn't matter who is No. 1 until the end of the year.
It's a pathetic attempt to raise interest in the sport. Half of the
people don't know who these No. 1 players are. It changes every
couple of weeks. It's so misleading. What they should be doing is
making the players more accessible to the kids and stop wasting
time talking about who is No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``McEnroe Unleashed,'' a new 30-minute show on USA Networks,
debuts Aug. 29 at 11 p.m. The show includes a ``crossfire'' segment
with ``Mad Mac'' and the reserved ``Mr. McEnroe.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS begins coverage Sept. 4 at 11 a.m. and ends with the men's
final Sept. 12 at 4 p.m. McEnroe is joined by analysts Mary
Carillo, Patrick McEnroe, Tony Trabert, Pam Shriver, Bill Macatee,
Michele Tafoya, and Bonnie Bernstein.

NESSLER HAS LEARNED FROM ONE OF THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brad Nessler grew up in a small town in Minnesota, watching
college football on television.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jackson was _ and, in many minds, still is _ the voice of
Saturday afternoons. There was an appeal to Jackson's ``Whoa
Nellie'' call, so much so that Nessler, at 12 years old, proudly
proclaimed to his father that he, too, would become a sports
broadcaster. His father laughed and promptly told his son to go
into computers.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out both Nesslers were right.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson retired last year and has since returned to ABC to call
Pacific-10 games. The extensive travel had become a grind, and
staying on the West Coast will allow Jackson more time to relax and
work.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates an opening for one of the most coveted jobs in
sports broadcasting. Nessler and Brent Musburger are filling in as
play-by-play announcers for ABC's nationally televised college
games. Nessler's first game this season should be a good one:
third-ranked Penn State against No. 4 Arizona Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith is one of my mentors,'' Nessler said. ``He knows that he
has no bigger admirer than me. He is one of my heroes. It's just
great sitting around the table with him. He's a great storyteller.
I don't use him as much as a football dictionary. I mean, he's done
and seen everything. In fact, football is one of the last things we
talk about. We were talking fishing the other day and how the
salmon fishing on the West Coast wasn't that great this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Musburger is another story. In his heyday, Musburger was the
golden boy at CBS, covering all of the major sporting events.
Nessler was just starting out at CBS and Musburger referred to him
as ``kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He still calls me that every now and then, and we just
laugh,'' Nessler said. ``But Musburger is one of my heroes as well.
Jackson is already in the broadcasters' Hall of Fame, and Brent is
sure to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Nessler readily acknowledges that the television landscape is
quite different now. Back when Jackson owned Saturday afternoons,
television viewers had only one or two games from which to choose.
Nessler is unsure if anyone can have the same impact as Jackson
once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all tend to get lost in the muddle,'' Nessler said. ``Not
that there isn't a lot of quality out there. There's just a lot of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. ABC's sister networks, ESPN and ESPN2, will air a
whopping 92 college football games this season. Fox Sports Net, the
cable network, airs 60 games. The increase in television coverage
over the years is not lost on coaches, either.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Paterno, the venerable Penn State coach, said the downside
of increased exposure is the pressure that it places on the
players. ``It's definitely more hoopla,'' Paterno said during a
conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno also lashed out at some commentators. ``Some of the
second-guessing is irritating,'' Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   Nessler isn't the most critical guy in the booth. For one thing,
it's not his job. Former NFL quarterback Gary Danielson has worked
with Nessler the last eight years, and his job is to provide the
game analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about 18- to 22-year-old kids,'' Nessler said.
``It's not my job to rip them. If somebody fumbles the ball three
times, I might say the coach should take him out. But who am I to
second-guess a coach like Joe Paterno?''

HACKERY BECOMES GENDER-NEUTRAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is progress: A minimally qualified, somewhat arrogant,
politically connected (itals)woman(unitals) is picked to rescue a
troubled state authority. And it's no big deal, because arrogant,
underqualified men have long been using their connections to
flourish in politics and everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Buckingham just got her equal-opportunity push to the
top from Governor Paul Cellucci. The governor's 33-year-old chief
of staff is returning from maternity leave to take over the
Massachusetts Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Political hackery, circa 1999, is becoming gender neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wants to clean up Massport's ``frat-boy culture,''
so he sends over a sorority sister. Buckingham's femaleness is
supposed to make us believe that she is a reformer. But this is a
woman as inside as an insider can get.
</P>
<P>
   What is Buckingham going to reform? The way consultant contracts
are given out? Ray Howell, a consultant and behind-the-scenes
Cellucci adviser, describes himself as Buckingham's ``mentor.'' He
also has a public relations contract with Massport that runs out in
December. Does anyone think Howell's contract won't be renewed, or
to put it more generally, that the process of awarding such
contracts to a tight circle of friends will change with Buckingham
in charge?
</P>
<P>
   The status of women in politics is changing, but the change
isn't all good.
</P>
<P>
   On the national scene, women like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth
Dole have credibility they wouldn't have had in the not so recent
past.
</P>
<P>
   But, the credibility comes at least partly from their ability to
trade on relationships with men who happen to be their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is pushing the gender button, somewhat cynically, to
shore up support with women, an important constituency for any
Republican hoping to win or keep statewide office in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He was kind to Carolyn Boviard, the economic development
director, accused of having an affair with her chief of staff. The
governor kept the focus on whether Boviard misused her public
office, rather than whether she had sex with an underling. Using
that criterion, he saved her job, in much the same way many a man's
job has been saved.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is also careful to keep Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift
standing solemnly by his side as he addresses recent political
embarrassments. And Swift, a new mother as well, finally and
thankfully put down her adorable baby daughter to at least give the
appearance of taking charge while Cellucci was vacationing in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham is still holding her 4-month-old son, as she should.
And there is something heartwarming about the fact that a woman
cradling an infant can be the governor's go-to person in a crisis.
For sure, times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, I interviewed Cellucci when he was a state
senator and I was a pregnant political reporter. He spent a good
part of the time talking about labor _ not the kind that involves
unions, but the kind that involves childbirth. It wasn't offensive;
in a way, it was kind of sweet. But it was also clear that at that
point in his life, he, like many men, had trouble seeing beyond a
pregnant woman's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Now new mom Buckingham will be running the show at Massport, a
$250 million entity that in many ways operates as the economic
engine for Massachusetts and New England.
</P>
<P>
   I am not suggesting motherhood will stand in the way of her
success. But there are other things that may.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham is a Boston College graduate with a degree in
communications. This is her basic resume since graduation: She
worked as a press aide for Stephen Tocco when he was running
Associated Builders and Contractors and moved over to work as a
press aide to Cellucci when he was running for lieutenant governor
in 1990. She served as press secretary for former Governor William
F. Weld, campaign manager for Weld's unsuccessful run for US Senate
and then became chief of staff, first to Weld, then to Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   She is experienced in dealing with the media, but running
Massport is more than a media game. You don't have to be a pilot,
but a working knowledge of complex transportation issues involving
planes, cars, buses, and boats would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is committed to building a new Logan Airport runway, a
goal backed by the business community. But community opposition is
fierce, organized, and spearheaded by Fred Salvucci, a savvy
political operator and policy expert who served as the state's
transportation chief and is a former member of the Massport board.
If it's Ginny versus Fred, I know where my money is.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's absolutely true that Buckingham's predecessors
were all as political as she. And that is the real problem. In
Massachusetts, political loyalty continues to rank higher than
competence, vision, and experience. That's no great step forward
for women or men.

BATTLE CRY IS MISSING FROM A WEAK `WARRIOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE 13TH WARRIOR 
Directed by: John McTiernan 
Screenplay by: William Wisher &AMP; Warren Lewis, based on Michael
Crichton's novel, ``Eaters of the Dead'' 
Starring: Antonio Banderas, Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhoi, Daniel
Southern, Neil Maffin, John Dessants, Clive Russell, Mischa
Hausserman, Richard Bremmer, Tony Curran, Asbjorn Riis 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: R (bloody battles and carnage) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not only are the Norsemen big in ``The 13th Warrior,'' their
horses are big, too. They tower over the star of the movie, Antonio
Banderas, almost as imposingly as the huge trees on Vancouver
Island, standing in for a gloomy forest in 10th-century Scandinavia
where the film is set. Just about everything is big in ``The 13th
Warrior'' except the writing, which is microscopic. It's just as
well that the screen is filled with Vikings who sleep with their
big broadswords when they aren't whacking away at the bearskin-clad
savages on horseback who keep raiding their settlement and keep
trying to burn it down. If ``The 13th Warrior'' is no Scandinavian
``Zorro,'' it's no worse than most of the dumb summer action
movies, and it's visually imposing. But epic nothingness is still
nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   There just isn't much story there, and there's less
characterization. Except for a clumsy message of multiculturalism,
there's little to keep you watching ``The 13th Warrior'' apart from
the visuals. Whereas Banderas played a lowly type working his way
up the social scale in ``Zorro,'' he's slumming here as an exiled
Arab-speaking diplomat, embodying the pinnacle of world
civilization at the time. He's none too happy about being dragged
off to the misty north to liberate what he regards as an
unspeakably primitive tribe from an even more primitive but more
vicious enemy who lives in caves, outnumbers the Norse, and knows
how to rub it in by lopping off the heads of their victims and
making off with them.
</P>
<P>
   If his booming Norse hosts regard the Moor as an effete wimp,
the newcomer at least brings them a civilized and scientific way of
looking at the world. This liberates them from superstition. Until
the outsider proves to them that the enemy, underneath the
bearskins and body paint, consists of men, they had regarded the
attackers as demons. But I have already implied a greater narrative
texture than the film is inclined to attempt. The few plot strands
wither meekly away as the film devotes itself mainly to having the
Norsemen and the local savages hack away at one another. The action
scenes, enthusiastic and screen-filling, peak when the Vikings go
on the defensive, raid the invaders' cave, and find it filled with
a few eye-popping barbarities even Indiana Jones never dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   But the only dimension the film possesses is a
pseudo-anthropological one supplied by the costumers and set
designers and decorators. What makes Banderas an asset in action
movies is his ability to work a hint of ironic self-mockery into
his performances. But this one is written, or perhaps one should
say underwritten, so squarely, that we are denied even this
diversion, despite the enhanced visual authenticity that comes of a
mostly Scandinavian cast playing big guys with names like Buliwyf,
Helfdane, Skeld, and Hyglak. If you're into bearskins, or Vikings,
or big log cabins, then ``The 13th Warrior'' has something for you.
If not, you're likely to find that it relies too heavily on its
yoking of Moslem brains and Viking brawn to the exclusion of
everything else. ``The 13th Warrior'' looks good but it plays dumb.

`VENUS' OF THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The road beckons to Tori Amos, then beckons some more. While she
has a reputation for being one of the new ``sensitive girl''
rockers, she's a hardy ``road dog'' too, by her own admission. She
says she has played 2,200 shows since 1991, which averages out to
244 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a loyal fan base just with hits. You get it by
going from town to town like the old vaudeville acts,'' says Amos.
``Like the troubadours, you go from village to village, castle to
castle. You've got to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Bruce Springsteen. He's a road dog. He put the time
in. And there's something to be said for that,'' Amos adds. ``If
you don't go to these towns and sweat, if you don't trip and fall
and give that to people and make yourself vulnerable and also
metamorphize with them, then you don't have that relationship with
them. You just don't. End of story.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos's latest incarnation is with Alanis Morissette. The two
share double billing on a tour that comes to the Tweeter Center in
Massachusetts Tuesday. They have distinct musical styles yet have
been quite supportive of each other, says Amos, who credits
Morissette with first suggesting the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along very well,'' says Amos. ``It's like two pirate
ships that have gone into the same cover together.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women have offered to share chefs, a masseuse, and, on
each show night, some time together before performing. The only
thing they don't do is sing onstage together.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not the Christian, Campfire Girl thing, where we
roast marshmallows and sing `Kumbaya,' '' says Amos. ``We're two
separate people, but we're orbiting together. We see each other
before the show always and we talk. . . . We talk about what
happened with our day. She was water-skiing yesterday, and I was
with my niece who was telling me family stories. Each day we touch
base, and it's not a studied thing. It's just hanging out, and you
have to trust that is going to set a tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos, who will release the double-album ``To Venus and Back'' on
Sept. 21 (one disc is live, the other is a studio disc), describes
herself as a ``lone wolverine,'' so she was flattered to receive
Morissette's invitation to share a tour. (Morissette was
unavailable for an interview this time.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it came from her, it meant something to me,'' says
Amos. ``And I don't feel a sense of division with her. I also like
to watch her show from the wings. I just sense that this is an
event. It's about two individual shows going on with two crews. To
me, it's like a Dionysian ceremony with two storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's advertised as a double bill, Amos opens for
Morissette each night. They each play for 75 minutes. Amos has no
ego problems with this order, and even rejected Morissette's
suggestion that the two flip-flop every night, as many stars do in
double-bill situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her, `Are we both confident enough that your
audience will come early and stay, and that mine won't leave
early?' We knew we had to have the courage to do this, and it's
working,'' says Amos. ``It's kind of like Torville and Dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos has been so busy with this tour and her other touring dates
and recording plans that she hasn't had time to do much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls like, `Do you want to write with so and so' or `Do
you want to work with so and so.' Moby called me and I would have
loved to have worked with him on his new record. But I was just
walking into the studio at the time realizing that I was going to
be recording my own new album. The timing wasn't great. So, there
are outside things that you wish you could do, but you can get
seduced into trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio portion of ``To Venus and Back'' turned out
beautifully. Amos first thought she might just do a couple of new
numbers to go alongside some B sides, but the muse struck and she
kept going.
</P>
<P>
   So how was the Venus metaphor conceived?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with my girlfriends,'' she notes. ``I said I
need to go somewhere and come back from somewhere (on this record).
They started mentioning places and I said, `Oh, no, I'd never go
there.' And then one of them, Natalie, looked at me and said, `You
know, you would go to Venus if you could.' She giggled and said, `I
think that's where you try to go when you play.' And that's how it
began, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Venus'' studio disc was made with the band that has been
touring with her for the past couple of years. It's filled with
Amos's provocative lyrical imagery (the song ``Juarez'' addresses
the unsolved murders of many women in the desert where ``no angel
came''). It also has some of the best vocals of her career,
embedded in modern, special-effects-laden soundscapes that move
from electronica-spiced piano pop and hip-hop to ambient space
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can't call your record `Venus' and not be modern,
right?'' she says with a laugh. ``You can't go retro with a name
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new songs of note (she may only slip one or two into
Tuesday's show because the album isn't out yet) include the
atmospheric ``Suede,'' the spiraling ``Concertina,'' the airy
``Lust,'' the alluring ``Spring Haze,'' and the show-stopping
``Glory of the '80s.'' The latter recalls her days in Los Angeles
(where she moved after growing up in the Washington/Baltimore area)
and the ``silicon party Barbies,'' a ``space cake high,'' and
``auditioning for reptiles'' in the entertainment industry. In
short, it's vintage Tori.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, it's back to the road and the touring circuit.
``I do it because I love it,'' she says. ``And, you know, I'd still
be humming something in my head, even if I didn't do it out loud.''

EROTIC `BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE' A SEMISWEET TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE 
Directed by: Anne Wheeler 
Screenplay by: Peggy Thompson 
Starring: Wendy Crewson, Karyn Dwyer, Christina Cox, Ann-Marie
MacDonald, Marya Delver, Kevin Mundy and Peter Outerbridge 
Playing at: Landmark Kendall Square Cinema and the Landmark Embassy
Cinema in Waltham
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running Time: 103 minutes &QL; 
Rated: Unrated. (nudity, language) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The movie is called ``Better Than Chocolate'' and you're
probably not going to have your stretch your mind too far to answer
the implicit question of: What could be better than chocolate?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is sex, glorious sex. Almost exclusively, it turns out
in this comedy-drama set in Vancouver, British Columbia, of the
sapphic kind. It is a coming-of-age story, set in the city's
lesbian community on Commercial Drive _ which, here, essentially
means a music-performance club called the Cat's Ass and a
book/video store called 10 Percent Books. Appropriate soundtrack
music is supplied by Canadians such as Sarah McLachlan and Ferron,
and American Ani DiFranco.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Better Than Chocolate,'' directed by Anne Wheeler, written
by Peggy Thompson, and produced by Sharon McGowan, we've got our
19-year-old law school dropout-now-artist Maggie (Karyn Dwyer)
falling in lust (later love) in about a nano-second with the
gorgeous, where-I-hang-my-hat-is-my-home painter Kim (Christina
Cox) and spending most of the film trying to explain I'm a lesbian
to her mother, Lila (Wendy Crewson) who has moved into her sublet
of a loft because she has just separated from her cheatin' husband.
Lila arrives with her teenage son Paul (Kevin Mundy), who figures
out the lay of the lesbian land much more quickly than mom and does
not shrink from glimpsing a bit of the torrid action between his
sister and her lover.
</P>
<P>
   Lila, her son, and the coffee-shop-owning Tony are the only
straight folks in the film. Mom is a pill-popping neurotic mess who
yearns to control her daughter's life, and, initially, would much
prefer if it included Maggie's former boyfriend who went off to
become, hmmm, a fashion designer. Her lonely life _ she bemoans
she'll never have sex again and ``chocolates are the only pleasure
left for me'' _ begins to change when she discovers a box of
vibrators hidden under Maggie's bed. The bookstore _ which is being
challenged by customs officials for importing ``pornography'' _ is
owned by Frances, initially, a cold, business-oriented fish who
could use a little lovin'. The richest character is Judy (Peter
Outerbridge), a transgender man on the verge of womanhood who is
beaten by a lesbian in the Cat's Ass for using the women's room,
and shows potential to melt Frances's heart. Judy also sings a
riveting tango in the club about being transgendered _ not a drag
queen. Carla (Marya Delver) swings both ways _ ``Soft centers, hard
centers, I like all the chocolates in the box'' _ and fixates upon
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in this flick is doing it, thinking about doing it, or
complaining about not doing it. There are several highly charged
erotic scenes between Maggie and Kim on a large swath of paper
after body-painting each other, in the shower, and, noisily, in the
club's bathroom stall. (They exit to the applause of their peers
and bow graciously.)
</P>
<P>
   Outside tension is provided by the lesbian-loathing local
skinheads who do things like paint ``Die Dyke Die'' on the sidewalk
in front of the bookstore and taunt our heroines on the street.
There is a volatile conflagration at the end which we won't give
away suffice to say it oddly serves to tie up all the loose ends in
an improbably happy fashion. It's a quickie resolution that doesn't
ring with the verisimilitude of the rest of the movie, which mixes
cute, sexy, witty, and edgy. Sample: Maggie makes an ice sculpture
encasing the would-be confiscated books, signifying that when the
ice melts the books will be freed. Frances notes, they'll also be
ruined.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, ``Better Than Chocolate,'' which won the Millivres
Multimedia Audience Award for Most Popular Film at the 1999 London
Gay &AMP; Lesbian Film Festival and the Best Feature Audience Award at
the 1999 Toronto Lesbian &AMP; Gay Film Festival, is a semisweet
nugget, an insinuating, low-budget little charmer.

GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO CLOSE FOR NEW YEAR CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Golden Gate Bridge will be closed at
midnight Dec. 31 as part of the splashy celebration to welcome the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge is scheduled to be closed, for about 20 minutes
before and 20 minutes after midnight, to allow a waterworks show to
go off safely, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're celebrating San Francisco,'' said Martha Cohen, an aide
to Mayor Willie Brown who has been coordinating the event. ``Its
beauty. Its diversity. We're promoting the excitement of being in
San Francisco anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the event will be a cascading waterfall from
Golden Gate Bridge as part of the fireworks-laser show there.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule calls for city-sponsored events at Golden Gate
Bridge, Union Square, the Ferry Building and Civic Center Plaza
featuring fireworks, laser shows and big screens.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there will be a peace alliance at Union Square throughout
the evening that will include a spiritual religious ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, all the video screens at the various
venues will focus on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Golden Gate Bridge district staff recommended
closing the bridge for about 20 minutes for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations do not include any big-name entertainment _ no
Lauryn Hill, no Tony Bennett, no Pearl Jam, no Herbie Hancock, all
of whom have headlined shows here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not entertainment-driven,'' Cohen said, explaining the
decision to forgo big musical acts. ``Live entertainment is so
prohibitively expensive for the new millennium. The money we'd need
to raise we'd spend on one or two talents.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the event is $3 million, to be raised privately.

<P>
   SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass. _ Twelve-year-old Sarah Mahoney sat in the
dentist's chair Thursday and spat.
</P>
<P>
   It's what her dentist wanted her to do.
</P>
<P>
   The spit was collected in a cup and analyzed for mutans
streptococci, a virulent bacteria that causes tooth decay. Many
people have the bacteria, but few dentists have gone to the trouble
of finding out.
</P>
<P>
   If Sarah's dentist, Dr. Traci Portnoff, sees a high
concentration of the bacteria, she most will likely prescribe a
simple antimicrobial mouthwash regimen that would keep the bacteria
in check and reduce Sarah's chances of getting cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the embryonic world of managed care in dentistry,
where the ideal means never having to drill.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the medical world, which has been transformed over
several painful decades by the forces of managed care, dentistry
has escaped relatively unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Dental Plan of Massachusetts, the state's largest dental
insurer, opened the small Southborough dental practice in June in
collaboration with the Harvard School of Dental Medicine as ground
zero of dental managed care.
</P>
<P>
   For Delta, managed care is as much a medical concept as it is a
financial one _ an ounce of prevention can prevent a pound of cure.
</P>
<P>
   The spit test, for example, can help prevent a lifetime of
expensive procedures associated with cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Most dentists, however, are deeply suspicious of managed care,
believing that it can only lead to reduced fees and lower quality
of care.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude represents a formidable hurdle for Delta as it
seeks to spread the virtues of cost-cutting and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said it was going to be easy,'' said Dr. Robert D.
Compton, director of disease management at Delta and president of
Delta's managed care venture, called DentaQuest. ``Change doesn't
occur unless there's great pressure for it.''
</P>
<P>
   For medicine in general, pressure came during the late 1980s and
early 1990s in the form of exploding health care costs. Employers
and consumers turned to health maintenance organizations and other
managed-care plans as a cost-saving alternative. The result was
nothing less than a series of seismic changes ranging from how
physicians are paid to how they practice medicine. Not all of the
changes have been well received. Patients have chafed over the
restrictions involved with managed care, and physicians have
rebelled against low payments. State legislatures all over the
United States have passed bills to address what they see as the
downside of managed care, a temptation to deny care in order to
save money.
</P>
<P>
   With so much public backlash against managed care, it's no
wonder dentists aren't embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think managed care is a bad idea for everyone except the
insurance company,'' said Dr. Jay Morgenstern, 41, a dentist in
Brookline. ``I'll retire before I accept managed-care business.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Delta, however, believe managed care is an
unavoidable trend in dentistry. Spending on dental services has
spiked 9 percent a year for the past nine years, according to
government estimates. Nationwide, Americans spent $53.7 billion on
dental care last year, up from $13.3 billion in 1980. Because
dental spending is just 5 percent of the nation's $1.1 trillion
health care budget, it has largely escaped notice from
cost-conscious employers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But that is bound to change, said Compton of Delta. If overall
health care costs continue to spiral, cash-strapped employers may
be tempted to pull the plug on dental insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that employers will look at their benefits and
reconsider their dental insurance,'' Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will need to be convinced of the value of providing
dental insurance to their employees or they will begin demanding
that Delta cover more patients for less money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge. What emerges from Southborough could lead
Delta to fundamentally change the way it pays thousands of dentists
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 dentists, or about 95 percent of practicing dentists
in Massachusetts, do business with Delta, with each receiving on
average 40 percent of their revenues from Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Such ramifications are not obvious when visiting the
Southborough site. Situated in a strip mall, the office looks
identical to a small dental practice. A few things, however,
distinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   The dentists, Portnoff and another dentist, are salaried so
there is no incentive to overtreat. Every patient is taken through
an exhaustive evaluation, one that includes the spit test, and
placed in risk categories. Patients with high risk for tooth decay
and gum disease are followed more closely and intensively, for
example, every three instead of six months.
</P>
<P>
   Children are given free mouthguards to prevent sports-related
damage to their teeth. Instead of drilling a minor cavity, the
dentist prescribes fluoride treatment in an effort to allow the
tooth to heal itself and restore its enamel. And instead of
drilling a wide swath around a cavity to prevent it from spreading,
as most dentists do now, dentists will try a new method of carving
out just the cavity, preserving as much tooth structure as
possible, and applying a sealant over the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to come up with new ways of practicing dentistry
that would cut costs while simultaneously promoting health, and
sharing the findings with dentists who do business with Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way practicing dentistry is about treating symptoms,''
said Dr. Robert E. Hunter, president of Delta. ``This is about
treating the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, patients and employers are responding well. Sarah's
mother, Kim Mahoney, said she drove 40 minutes from Milton in order
to try out the less invasive, more preventive approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah has a heart defect, so every time she goes into the
dentist's office, she has to be premedicated,'' said Mahoney, a
grade-school teacher. ``To me, the less she has done in her mouth,
the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta's approach also appeals to employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly makes a lot of sense,'' said Nancy Lazgin,
director of corporate benefits for Staples Inc., a Delta customer.
``They are treating the disease before it becomes problematic and
expensive to treat. That's what managed care has been doing for a
number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Practicing dentists, however, are more skeptical. Dr. Sara
Stock, a dentist in Brookline, said much of dentistry already is
focused on prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that managed care will be able to increase the
rate of prevention because many dentists are already trained to be
conservative,'' Stock said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Bramson, executive director of the Massachusetts
Dental Society, echoed Stock's sentiment, pointing out that the
parallels between how managed care works for general medicine and
how it's likely to work in dentistry are imperfect. For one thing,
HMOs squeezed savings by moving patients from a high-cost hospital
setting to a lower cost ambulatory setting. In dentistry, the vast
majority of care already takes place in an outpatient setting.
</P>
<P>
   What dentists fear, of course, is the potential financial impact
of managed care, namely deep discounts or ``capitation'' contracts
where dentists are paid a set amount for every patient they see.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of caring for their patients exceeds the amount they
are given, dentists are expected to make up the difference out of
their own pockets. If it costs them less, they get to keep the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, capitation _ or managed care, for that matter _ has
not caught on in dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 percent of Delta's business is currently capitated.
Elsewhere in the United States, the statistics are somewhat higher,
with some states reaching 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So while dentistry is just at the threshold of managed care, the
industry is likely to face the same kinds of wrenching changes seen
years ago in the rest of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us respond to those changes,'' Compton said.

NEW PLAYER SEEMS A CLONE OF CITIZENS FINANCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there room for another Larry Fish in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sidhu and his Sovereign Bancorp Inc. bear a striking
resemblance to Fish and his Citizens Financial Corp. They might be
looking each other eyeball to eyeball if Sovereign pulls off the
New England banking divestiture bonanza prompted by the pending
merger of Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fish, Sidhu has spent years finding ways to grow a small
thrift into a much larger, hybrid banking company that competes
with giants in its back yard. Both have pulled off aggressive
acquisition strategies, but also have bumped up against similar
limitations that sometimes constrain their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   They even talk the same talk. Who said this: ``Our philosophy is
that we outlocal the nationals and outnational the locals.'' That
was Sidhu speaking to us Thursday, but ``the big-bank muscle with
small-bank touch'' sloganeering could just as easily have come out
of Citizens headquarters in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at entities like Sovereign or Citizens, or
Peoples Heritage in Portland and draw some pretty good
comparisons,'' said analyst James Ackor of Tucker Anthony.
``They've all taken pretty much the same tact and been successful
to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish has nothing on Sidhu when it comes to rapid fire bank
mergers. Sovereign has grown mostly thanks to 17 acquisitions in
the past 13 years. A victory in the Fleet/BankBoston divestiture
competition would propel Sovereign, about the same size as Citizens
today with $24 billion of assets, into an entirely new category.
</P>
<P>
   It is such an aggressive step that analysts question how Sidhu
can raise the additional capital required to support such a
dramatically increased banking company. But Sovereign had already
secured a financing commitment from a third party as part of its
bid for the divestiture package, according to people familiar with
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   A victory in New England would actually be Sovereign's second
big divestiture triumph in less than two years. It acquired 95
branches in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, divested in 1998 as a
result of First Union Corp.'s acquisition of CoreStates Financial
Corp. of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   When it sought customers in those new markets, Sovereign pushed
its high-touch marketing with a heavy emphasis on retail customers
and small-business borrowers. That philosophy gives you an idea of
what it would offer customers in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not the cheapest bank,'' said Sidhu, who declined to
discuss Sovereign's New England divestiture bid. ``We don't compete
on price alone, but it is competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is different when you start dealing with us. We
are not in the banking business. We are a marketing company that
happens to have a banking charter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidhu said Sovereign pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars
of business in Philadelphia, above and beyond what it acquired in
the CoreStates divestiture last year, by attracting customers who
were disaffected by the acquisition of the leading local bank.
Analyst Ackor agrees Sovereign did well competing in a big-city
market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been doing well garnering small-business loans and
retail customers from the fallout there,'' he said. ``Their
experience has been positive, but they're not of the ilk that can
compete for the large commercial loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sovereign's business loans range from $200,000 to $10
million with an average commercial credit of about $1 million. Some
of that business is already located in New England, where Sovereign
offers financing to auto dealerships, asset-based lending services,
and other business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Sidhu described Sovereign's business as mostly ``bread and
butter'' banking, but you wouldn't be able to tell that from the
company's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Sovereign's assets are not loans of any kind, but
short-term securities. Similarly, half the company's finances come
from something other than deposits from customers. Sidhu said
Sovereign's financial mix was a strategic decision based on the
relatively small difference between short- and long-term interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sovereign will be a banking presence in New England
soon. Maybe not. But Sidhu said he has no concerns about competing
with bigger and more established institutions like Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have competed very effectively with large banks, but at the
same time we've had some pretty fierce competition with smaller
banks,'' he said. ``We don't always win, but we always try to
learn. When you get thrown off the horse, get back on and try to
avoid getting thrown off next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on tight.

Peterson exits Harvard
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Peterson, who has managed high-yield investments at
Harvard Management Co. for a decade, is leaving next month to work
full time at his own firm based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who manages about $200 million in assets for Harvard
Management, will continue to invest Harvard funds at his firm,
Regiment Capital Advisors. His group's high-yield assets managed
for Harvard have earned an annualized return of almost 19 percent
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson has been investing other institutional money
independently while still at Harvard, managing a $700 million
collatoralized bond obligation, similar to a closed-end fund. He
expects to launch a second investment vehicle for institutional
clients early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson is the third executive to recently leave Harvard
Management but continue to invest money for the Harvard University
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Jacobson left to launch Highfields Capital Management,
a hedge fund, last year. Michael Eisenson of Harvard's Private
Capital Group also departed to establish a new firm.

   Q. I am a self-employed 46-year-old earning about $105,000 a
year. I have $91,000 in a 401(k) plan, all of it in a money market.
I also have $42,000 in the bank. I've been afraid to invest in the
market because it's at historic highs and I've been waiting for a
downturn to jump in. Do you think this is wise? What funds would
you recommend investing in? I contribute about $10,000 a year to my

   A. Well, if you don't begin to make some changes fairly soon,
the answer to the final question is probably going to be no. If you
kept your retirement savings in a money market fund, continued your
$10,000 annual contributions, and achieved average 5 percent
earnings on your investments, you would have $542,331 after 19
years _ far from enough to support a comfortable retirement for a
person who has been living on $105,000 a year. If you add in the
bank savings and presume 3 percent earnings over the same period,
that would only add a further $73,978.
</P>
<P>
   So the short answer is that unless you are willing to
dramatically increase the rate of your savings, you can't afford
not to move to a portfolio with higher growth prospects. I know
that a stock-oriented portfolio is a lot riskier than the
investments you now hold, and I agree that the market stands at
dizzying heights. But 19 years is a long time, and provides plenty
of time for you to recover from any short-term reversals.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that I'd advise you to simply throw that
$91,000 into the market. If you adopted a program of moving $3,200
a month (plus your ongoing contributions) into a stock portfolio,
you would spread the process over the course of a little more than
30 months, somewhat mitigating the risk of short-term losses.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how to treat the $42,000 you have in a bank
account. Since you're self-employed, perhaps you feel this amount
of savings is necessary for you to ride out seasonal bumps in your
income stream. But even if that's not the case, you would certainly
do better if you were to switch from a bank savings program to a
mutual fund company's money market offering, where the returns are
likely to be in the neighborhood of twice what the bank is paying
you. But I'd also suggest you look at that money and analyze
whether you need that much in liquid savings. If so, well, so be
it. But if you could shake $10,000 or $12,000 loose and commit it
to a long-term supplemental retirement account, you'd likely be in
a far more comfortable position when that time comes.
</P>
<P>
   As for investment vehicles, I'd suggest a pretty traditional mix
_ perhaps half of the money in a Standard and Poor's Index 500
fund, and then 10 percent each in the Mid-Cap, Small-Cap,
International stocks, and Health Care sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you were to put all of your 401(k) money in a
portfolio that achieved average 10 percent annual returns, and
continued at your $10,000 annual level of contributions, you would
accumulate $1,091,343 in the account over 19 years. It seems to me
if you really want that comfortable retirement, the time to
increase contributions to retirement savings is about now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 26 years old and the only payment I make each month is a
$700 rent check. I have no school loans, no car payments, and no
other bills. My annual income is $40,000. As of this date, my
portfolio consists of a Roth IRA with Janus, where $1,050 is
invested in Janus fund, $2,088 in Janus Twenty, and $550 is in
Janus Mercury. I add $75 a month to each fund. I also have a 401(k)
account at work with $2,800 invested and no company match. I have
cut back considerably on the 401(k) and have been trying to focus
on the Roth IRA because I feel it will be worth my while in the
long run. Next month I will be selling a car and receiving close to
$5,000. I am not sure what to do with this money when I get it. I
am saving for a down payment on a home in five years, possibly
opening my own business, and also retirement. Am I on the right
track, or possible over my head?
</P>
<P>
   C.L., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. By and large you're doing fine, but I'd suggest a few
modifications. First of all, with your $225 monthly contributions
to the Roth IRA accounts, you're shortly going to find that you're
reached the $2,000 annual limit for contributions. I suggest you
continue the program until you're reached the limit and then add to
your participation in the 401(k) during the last three months of
the year so as to maintain the total dollar savings program.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 2000, I'd then add $166 a month to the Roth IRA
accounts and put the remaining $59 (or more, if you think you can
afford it) into the 401(k). Incidentally, I agree with you that
given the many years you have to go before retirement, the Roth IRA
is a better bet than the 401(k) _ both because your good savings
habits will likely lead you to a substantial accumulation by the
time you retire, and because a Roth IRA also protects you against
the prospect of significantly higher tax rates at the time you
eventually retire.
</P>
<P>
   But as I said above, don't turn your back on the 401(k)
entirely. The best retirement portfolios will contain all three
elements of savings _ Roth IRAs from which withdrawals can be made
with no taxes; taxable accounts where you will face capital gains
taxes but no income taxes; and tax-deferred accounts such as the
401(k) or a traditional IRA, where withdrawals will be treated as
earned income.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little tough to figure what to suggest for the $5,000 you
anticipate getting for your car. Usually I suggest that people
segment their savings, earmarking specific amounts of money for
specific purposes. This allows the saver to chose appropriate
investment vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three you mention, for example, any money you put aside
for retirement will have a long time to work for you, so it
certainly should go into a growth-oriented stock fund. If you
anticipate that you might need capital to establish your own
business in an eight- to 10-year time frame, you might look to a
balanced fund, which divides its portfolio between stocks and
bonds. And if you're saving for the purchase of a home in five
years, you'll want to invest the money much more conservatively _
in money markets and CDs at the most conservative, or in a
short-term bond fund at the most aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   If you can manage to allocate portions of that $5,000 among the
various accounts you mention, so much the better. But if, as I
suspect, you are simply listing some of the expenses that might
come up at some ill-defined point in the future, I think I'd put
$1,000 in a stock account targeted for retirement and put the
remainder in a balanced fund, moving it to more conservative
holdings only when you have settled on a purpose for it and realize
it's likely to be called upon in five years or less. Since you're
already working with Janus, Janus Balanced would be a solid choice
in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, going back to that Roth IRA, I'd rather see the lion's
share of the investment in Janus rather than the higher-risk Janus
Twenty and Mercury funds. How about realigning the balance so that
talk of the total and half of the contributions are in Janus, with
the remaining balance and contributions split between Twenty and
Mercury?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your column of Nov. 10, 1996 deftly advised a grandmother in
Vista, Calif., on establishing a mutual fund account for her
grandchild, and pointed out the disadvantages of some funds because
of high initial investment and minimum subsequent investment
levels. You advised that she consider Franklin California Growth
fund, and we (and the new grandmother) are content with the
performance. We now have a second grandchild, and again seek your
advice on what other funds are out there and meet the same or
similar parameters for minimum investment levels and front end
loads _ this new gamin is a sure candidate for Phi Beta Kappa in 21
years or so.
</P>
<P>
   D.C., La Quinta, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're looking for another fund in the mid-cap growth
arena, you might consider Alger Mid-Cap Class B. and Nicholas II
funds. Both have fairly modest minimum investment amounts _ none in
the case of Alger and $500 for Nicholas II. Additional investment
minimums are $25 for Alger and $100 for Nicholas II. Like Franklin
California Growth, neither fund has set the world on fire in the
past couple of years, but it can be argued that the results reflect
the relative unpopularity of their segment rather than individual
performance. And of course, you could do a lot worse than to go
back to Franklin California Growth, although the initial investment
is now $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, I own shares in Alger Mid-Cap Growth.

`STRANGE JUSTICE' SPINS A DIFFERENT VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
STRANGE JUSTICE 
Starring: Delroy Lindo, Mandy Patinkin, Regina Taylor, Louis
Gossett Jr., Paul Winfield 
Directed by: Ernest Dickerson 
On: Showtime 
Time: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that mass culture is doing that tabloid thing, the truth is
glitzier than fiction. You just can't beat a hastily gathered press
conference for grabbing the multitasking eye of America, and ``Days
of Our Lives'' has nothing on the decade's stream of teary
accusations and sober denials. Meanwhile, commentators wax
apocalypse while the zillion newsmagazines shape current events
into ``Roshomon,'' or, more often, Harold Robbins' ``The Betsy.''
When national tempests blow, our media machine instantly transforms
them into theater.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say that ``Strange Justice,'' a Showtime docudrama
about the Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill tangle, has to deal with
some heavy competition. Like Oliver Stone's ``Nixon,'' it is a
fact-based movie that comes up against all the drama of the
original events, which are still vivid in our imaginations. It was
only eight years ago that the country was buzzing about pubic hair,
a Coke can, and a fellow named Long Dong Silver, and all the
pivotal images and hot-button issues of the Thomas confirmation
hearings still linger. The question weighing upon a docudrama about
Hill and Thomas is, what can it add to our already oversaturated
understanding? What makes it more than merely further exploitation
of a hot controversy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice,'' which airs Sunday at 8 p.m., tries to take
the high road in justifying its existence. Rather than
kitsch-ifying the Hill-Thomas conflict like so many network
movies-of-the-week, or provocatively taking sides, director Ernest
Dickerson and writer Jacob Epstein aim to make points about the
American system that were missed during the heat of the dispute.
Don't get me wrong: The movie, based on the pro-Hill book by Jane
Mayer and Jill Abramson, is absolutely tilted toward Hill, from its
very title to a mocking scene that has Thomas, his wife, and Sen.
John Danforth walking in slow motion to ``Onward Christian
Soldiers.'' But the goal of the movie is not to reassert Thomas'
guilt, but to portray both Thomas and Hill as pawns in a massive
game of spin, a game that, finally, Hill loses. The central figure
is neither Hill nor Thomas; it's Kenneth Duberstein, the man hired
by the Bush administration to wage a war of perception and win the
unlikely Thomas a seat on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The approach doesn't entirely work. Spin and the way citizens
can get swept up in partisan battles are not exactly juicy
revelations in 1999, especially after the transparent efforts of
the White House and Ken Starr during the Monica Lewinsky affair. We
are acutely aware of complex manipulation that goes into creating
public opinion, and how ultimately, tragically, the truth is
unimportant. While ``Strange Justice'' makes a big deal of
Duberstein comments like, ``Undertakers and spin doctors, we're
never out of work,'' and ``Our job is the same as if we're selling
a product on the marketplace,'' these lines don't have the
resonance they might have had in earlier decades, and the
filmmakers seem more impressed with the freshness of their approach
than it may merit. The movie avoids rehashing the details and
making the case against Thomas, but it doesn't then proceed to
offer an awful lot to chew on thematically.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps aware of this, Dickerson juices up ``Strange Justice''
with an arsenal of flashy stylistic tricks bound to get people
talking. For instance, while the movie shows lots of fast-talking
spin doctors galloping from office to office, it lapses into a
alternate reality when Thomas and Hill testify. Think ``The
Twilight Zone,'' rather than ``fact-based story.'' Dickerson, who
has served as cinematographer on many Spike Lee movies, treats the
hearings as though they are an existential play, with the room
darkening, a spotlight glaring in the center, and close-ups on the
central figures. An enraged Thomas strips off his shirt, paces the
room, and yells, ``Your Supreme Court is just not worth it.'' When
he delivers his line about a ``high-tech lynching,'' he makes a
noose of his tie. Hill, too, lets loose during her testimony,
crying with rage and seething over the loss of her privacy. These
moments are simultaneously riveting, absurd, self-consciously
provocative, and disturbingly ficticious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice'' is helped enormously by a batch of
well-grounded, extraordinary performances, particularly by Delroy
Lindo as Thomas. Lindo makes his judge into a puppet prepared to
let Duberstein determine even his moral positions. He's painfully
recessive. When he stands behind the real George Bush in one of the
movie's digitally altered news clips, he adopts a clueless,
out-of-place expression that comically recalls Forest Gump. But
before the Senate committee, Lindo changes into an erupting volcano
of disgust and scorn for his handlers. Miraculously, when he takes
off his shirt, he makes us overlook the pure artificiality of the
gesture. As Duberstein, Patinkin is a steely gamesman, but Patinkin
being Patinkin, he invests the spin doctor with a mensch quality
that saves him from becoming the movie's too-easy villain. And
Regina Taylor makes Hill's reticence and torment palpable, while
keeping her nobility from seeming sanctimonious, even after she
sees a needlepoint that reads ``Evil flourishes when good people do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Gossett Jr. is onhand with sharp cameo as Vernon Jordan,
whose advice to Thomas on how to win black support triggers an
adamant reaction from Thomas. But the best bit in ``Strange
Justice'' belongs to Paul Winfield, who plays outgoing Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. He has to meet the press in the
summer of 1991 to answer questions about his retirement from the
bench, but he's glued to more more pressing matters in his
chambers: ``Days of Our Lives.''

CARNIVAL EXEC CALLS FOR REGULATION OF AMUSEMENT RIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATTHEW YI and MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of a traveling carnival company says
state regulation of his industry has made it safe and advocates the
same safety oversight of amusement park rides because of recent
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Butler, the president of Butler Amusements, said he
recalled the days when there was no regulation of his portable
rides, which he operates at county fairs or carnivals. People were
getting hurt and, in some cases, killed.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when California began to regulate traveling
amusement rides in 1972, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, the state has been ranked near the top in
safety,'' said Butler, whose business is one of the largest
traveling carnival companies in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In California, traveling carnivals are regulated by inspectors
from the Elevator Ride and Tramway Unit of the Division of
Occupational Safety and Health, which is part of the state
Department of Industrial Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're required to inspect each individual ride annually,''
spokesman Dean Fryer said. ``Every portable ride that operates in
California is given a one-year permit. We also inspect rides when
there's an accident and we also have periodic random inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The same isn't true for permanently fixed rides found in
amusement parks like Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo, where a
roller coaster malfunctioned Wednesday, causing 28 riders to be
stuck in their train for about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're in an entertainment field, there's significant
pressure to be open and be presentable and to make sure your
revenue is coming in the door,'' said Dana Babin, deputy chief
executive officer of the Solano County Fair, which has used Butler
Amusement for years. ``Safety is certainly a part of that, but if
you're self-governing ... there could be room for some
discretionary decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   The malfunctioning Boomerang roller coaster at Six Flags Marine
World was to be inspected by its Netherlands-based manufacturer,
Vekoma International. Park officials said Thursday that a cable
that broke played a role in the accident. It is unknown if the
snapped cable caused the accident or if another problem led to the
cable breaking, park spokeswoman Kristi Vonne said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to regulate amusement parks in California were stepped up
amid the accident at Six Flags Marine World and these incidents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Joshua Smurphat, 12, of Sunnyvale fell to his death Sunday
while riding the Drop Zone Stunt Tower at Paramount's Great America
in Santa Clara. The cause for his fall has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   _ Five people were cut or bruised when wood fell off a roller
coaster at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timothy Fan, 20, of Long Island City, N.Y., died while riding
the Shockwave stand-up roller coaster in Paramount's Kings Dominion
park near Richmond, Va. Preliminary reports showed the man had
partially wiggled out of the shoulder harness that held him in the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   While some continue to question whether allowing the amusement
park industry to rely on itself for safety is good for the public,
at least one Northern California amusement park official argued the
industry's self-regulatory standards far exceeds common
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have about 15 to 20 outside inspections including
the city, county, the fire department, insurance companies and
industry inspectors,'' said Ann Parker, spokeswoman for the Santa
Cruz Beach Boardwalk. ``We have four full-time roller coaster
mechanics. They are specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Industrywide, fatalities in amusement parks have been minimal,
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting figures from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission, Parker said fatalities related to fixed-site amusement
rides around the country have averaged between one and two per year
over the past 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   However in California, the number of deaths in amusement parks
is much higher than in the state-regulated traveling carnival
rides.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 report by the California Research Bureau,
there were 10 deaths at amusement parks with permanently fixed
rides between 1973 and 1996. For state-regulated portable rides,
there were none during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our first death in the (traveling carnival industry)
last year in Mendota, (Fresno County), when a little boy fell off a
ride and died,'' Butler said. ``That was the first since the
regulation started.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Assemblyman Tom Torlakson, the author of a bill
requiring annual inspections of theme park rides in California,
said it was difficult to pass any sort of legislation to regulate
amusement parks in the past because of heavy lobbying from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 30 years, state legislators have failed four times
to regulate amusement parks and Torlakson is now making a fifth
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that so many accidents have riveted the
public's attention to do this, but sometimes that's the way it
works,'' he said.

there were 10 deaths at amusement parks with permanently fixed
rides between 1973 and 1996. For state-regulated portable rides,
there were none during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our first death in the (traveling carnival industry)
last year in Mendota, (Fresno County), when a little boy fell off a
ride and died,'' Butler said. ``That was the first since the
regulation started.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Assemblyman Tom Torlakson, the author of a bill
requiring annual inspections of theme park rides in California,
said it was difficult to pass any sort of legislation to regulate
amusement parks in the past because of heavy lobbying from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 30 years, state legislators have failed four times
to regulate amusement parks and Torlakson is now making a fifth
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that so many accidents have riveted the
public's attention to do this, but sometimes that's the way it
works,'' he said.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Golden Gate Bridge will be closed at
midnight Dec. 31 as part of the splashy celebration to welcome the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge is scheduled to be closed, for about 20 minutes
before and 20 minutes after midnight, to allow a waterworks show to
go off safely, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're celebrating San Francisco,'' said Martha Cohen, an aide
to Mayor Willie Brown who has been coordinating the event. ``Its
beauty. Its diversity. We're promoting the excitement of being in
San Francisco anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the event will be a cascading waterfall from
Golden Gate Bridge as part of the fireworks-laser show there.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule calls for city-sponsored events at Golden Gate
Bridge, Union Square, the Ferry Building and Civic Center Plaza
featuring fireworks, laser shows and big screens.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there will be a peace alliance at Union Square throughout
the evening that will include a spiritual religious ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, all the video screens at the various
venues will focus on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Golden Gate Bridge district staff recommended
closing the bridge for about 20 minutes for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations do not include any big-name entertainment _ no
Lauryn Hill, no Tony Bennett, no Pearl Jam, no Herbie Hancock, all
of whom have headlined shows here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not entertainment-driven,'' Cohen said, explaining the
decision to forgo big musical acts. ``Live entertainment is so
prohibitively expensive for the new millennium. The money we'd need
to raise we'd spend on one or two talents.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the event is $3 million, to be raised privately.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the former Soviet Union, Big Brother may not be
watching you any longer, but he'd like a peak at your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's security service, the FSB, the main successor to the
Soviet-era KGB, is tapping into most of the country's Internet
service providers under a federal directive that allows it sweeping
powers to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But one crusading Internet company in the southern city of
Volgograd has balked, and has launched a legal challenge in what
could be the first privacy-rights fight of its kind in
post-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to use the Internet without fear that
someone is watching them,'' said Nail Murzakhanov, 33, general
director of Bayard-Slavia Communications in Volgograd, a city of 1
million on the banks of the Volga River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are relying on their grandfather's methods,'' he said,
referring to the Soviet spy agency. ``That's not the way Russia is
supposed to work today.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, FSB agents came to the firm's offices to demand a list
of his clients and the ability to read their e-mail. The agency
also wanted the Internet provider to buy the thousands of dollars
of equipment its agents would need to carry out its electronic
snooping, and train them how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to shut him down if he did not comply,
Murzakhanov said, and soon afterward the company abruptly lost its
lease on the Moscow-based satellite service it used.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 850 clients in the Volgograd region can e-mail
each other on the local network, but are cut off electronically
from the outside world. Murzakhanov said he and other employees of
the company received personal threats if they did not drop their
objections to the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians in Russia say the regulations, known as
SORM-2, violate the spirit of Russia's constitution by giving the
government vast and unchecked powers of surveillance, similar to
the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   In theory under the regulations, the FSB would need a warrant to
monitor e-mail exchanges. But the rules also require that a ``black
box'' be attached to every Internet system, allowing agents to sit
at computer screens in the FSB offices and tap via a high-speed
fiber-optic line into the e-mail exchanges anytime they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet providers must render assistance. But access to the
(Internet) system should be carried out by a court order and under
the rule of law. Not this way,'' said Ina Zemskova of St.
Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman declined to discuss the new regulations or the
Volgograd case with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the routine business of hunting spies and criminals, the
United States and most advanced countries maintain
intelligence-gathering networks capable of intercepting telephone
calls and data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent flap erupted in the European Union over the reach of
the U.S. National Security Agency, the super-secret spy
organization that specializes in eavesdropping. With the help of
the British government, the NSA reportedly has established a system
to monitor every e-mail, fax and telephone call made in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The task for countries large and small has become more difficult
and expensive in the Internet age, requiring security services to
gain greater technical expertise and expensive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In cash-strapped Russia, the FSB wants it done for them. The
SORM-2 regulations _ SORM is the acronym, when translated from
Russian, means System for Operational-Investigative Activities _
require telecommunications companies to shell out thousands of
dollars to equip the FSB, or risk losing their licenses to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 companies provide Internet services to an
estimated 1 million computer users in Russia, mainly in the larger
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies had their arms twisted and were compelled to
get the equipment,'' said Andrei Shipilov, editor-in-chief of
Komputerra, an on-line and published Russian-language computer
magazine based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, where corruption is rampant, Shipilov suggests
that many companies may simply be able to bribe their way around
the rule to avoid giving the FSB access to their systems.
</P>
<P>
   More than just individual rights of privacy are at stake, say
computer and legal experts. In Russia, the FSB's system also could
be used for corporate espionage. After the Soviet Union fell in
1991, many of the KGB's top agents left to enter the lucrative
field of corporate security and many still have ties to the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``If providers grant the FSB this kind of access, the
information could be sold to the highest bidder,'' said Viktoria
Yevgorova, a journalist who writes for Russia's Libertarian
movement.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain just how far and wide the new rule has been
applied.
</P>
<P>
   The SORM-2 rules were written in 1998 by the FSB and the State
Communications Agency and enacted this year. The new rules updated
a 1995 version that applied only to telephone, fax and pager
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have been slow to be applied because of the highly
technical nature of the Internet and the inconsistent way
regulations are enacted in Russia, varying from region to region.
Because they are administrative regulations and not law, they
required no presidential or legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Milechko, an official with GlasNet, one of Russia's
largest Internet providers, said his company has not yet been
approached by the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, MTK-Mobile, said it and other firms have slowed
the process by seeking negotiations with the FSB. ``In practice, we
know we have to do something but we need to know the legal basis
and the technical specifications,'' said Alexei Volchkov, the
company's technical director.
</P>
<P>
   In its first legal step, Bayard-Slavia Communications asked the
local prosecutor to take up the case as a constitutional matter and
file an appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the law on the
public's behalf. The prosecutor refused in an Aug. 18 reply,
stating that the FSB had the legal authority to pursue its
monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the company plans to appeal to the nation's chief
prosecutor. If that fails, it will file a lawsuit directly with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to fix this problem in silence. We want to
overcome this problem publicly so all will know that there is
nothing to fear,'' said Murzakhanov, head of the Volgograd Internet
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the sophisticated nature of Internet
technology, the FSB is probably reading the e-mail only of those
with nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the FSB is only going to have access to ordinary
users. Anyone engaged in espionage or criminal activity will easily
get around it using encryption software that the FSB doesn't have
the means to decipher,'' said Shipilov, the computer magazine
editor.

   JACKSON _ WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday the
controversy over drug use and Texas Gov. George W. Bush presents an
opportunity for leaders to rethink the nation's drug laws. Jackson
said those laws have produced an urban policy based largely on the
incarceration of minorities and the poor. He said Bush should
answer questions about any use of cocaine in his youth. He said
there is no provision for ``youthful indiscretions'' in the
country's drug laws. He also said he had never used illegal drugs.

   GINGRICH-AFFAIR _ Recent revelations of infidelity by former
House speaker Newt Gingrich, a man who preached family values, has
left members of the group Friends of Newt feeling betrayed. They
wonder, like many, whether he really resigned his seat in Congress
last year because of the affair. And they wonder why, if it was
such a widely known ``secret'' in Washington, news of his
relationship with a congressional aide never filtered down to

   ISRAEL-BURGERKING _ GAZA STRIP, West Bank _ MA'ALE ADUMIM, West
Bank _ Do these burgers violate the Geneva Convention? A day after
Burger King gave in to pressure and yanked its franchise from a
lunch counter in a Jewish settlement, Israelis vowed their own
boycott of the food giant. Hungry, and now angry settlers in the
Ma'ale Adumim mall's food court continued eating the burgers Friday
and the local franchise holder vowed to fight the parent company's
decision. To them, the rare victory for Arab activists in the
public relations war over the holy land smacked of the old Arab
boycott that kept Israel isolated for decades. Ma'ale Adumim Mayor
Benny Kashriel said Burger King should have held out as the Coca
Cola Co. did for more than a decade when it was boycotted in the
Arab world because it operated in Israel. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox

MAKE PLANS FOR THE FOLIAGE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foliage season is near. For leaf peepers, now is the time to
plan your outing, especially accommodations, as the period from
mid-September to near the end of October is peak viewing season in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, early reports indicate the foliage season will be
``on time and looks good.'' However, a story in last week's New
York Times said that instead of a colorful fall scene, this
summer's drought may bring a drab brown leaf season. In Litchfield,
Conn., leaves were reported already falling on the village green.
</P>
<P>
   If the reports prove otherwise, New England's most colorful show
begins in the north country and slowly travels south. That means
peak season will be in northern Vermont and New Hampshire beginning
in mid-September and in southern New England by mid-October.
Somehow, Mother Nature always cooperates by making the Columbus Day
weekend peak viewing time in most parts of the region, and the show
continues until the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, states and Canadian provinces along the East
Coast will be offering foliage hot lines, with reports on where the
color can be expected. The Globe Travel section will list these
numbers along with other information in its annual foliage issue
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fall, though, is more than foliage. Making New England's season
all the more colorful are the many harvest festivals, farm stands
packed with fresh apples and other produce, and outdoor activities.
Vermont likes to say ``Fall is our season,'' and to prove it
produces guides to events, activities, and lodging. It even offers
a staffed information center; call 800-VERMONT or visit
www.1-800-vermont.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Magazine is offering its ``Secrets of Autumn'' issue Aug.
31, which includes information on how leaves change color, along
with suggested drives.
</P>
<P>
   And if, heaven forbid, New England's season isn't as colorful as
hoped, you might consider another area of the country. Wisconsin's
tourism secretary, Moose Speros, says the state's ``colors rival
those anywhere else in the nation.'' And Wisconsin says there are
other things besides leaves. The state claims it is a wildlife
watcher's mecca and has the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside
Germany. Wisconsin even claims the cranberry as its number one
fruit crop and celebrates the berry with festivals. Great hikes and
bike rides are available, too. To find out about this state, call
800-432-8747, a line that has real people answering 24 hours a day.

   Any inn that names a suite for a dog has to be good. When Kathie
Lynch, publisher of The Pet Gazette of Duxbury, took a
mini-vacation, she booked the Inn by the Sea (207-799-3134) in Cape
Elizabeth, Maine. Lynch found a ``very pet-friendly
establishment,'' complete with a pet menu and gourmet pet treats.
In honor of Lynch, and the visit of her Australian Shepherd, Suite
112 is now known as The Shadow Suite.

A REALLY OLYMPIC TRIP ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE FLATTERY, Wash. _ ``This place is big,'' my 12-year-old son
announces.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big?'' I ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really big,'' Ethan replies. ``Really, really big.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise from a boy who tends to favor only man-made
phenomena created since, oh, about 1995. But standing here on the
rocky northwesternmost point of the continental United States, with
the Pacific Ocean lashing at sea caves below us and a pair of
golden eagles soaring overhead, it's easy to be impressed. Ethan is
even ready to concede that the view from these remote cliffs is
worth the winding two-hour drive from the hot mineral pools of our
hotel. And his father is no longer dubious about having passed, 19
miles back, the ``Last Chance Cold Beer'' sign at Ray's Grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Our family of three is driving the perimeter of the Olympic
Peninsula, a route that can cover as few as 250 miles but _ thanks
to imperative side trips _ is taking us more than 600 miles in four
days. The peninsula, which we reached via a 35-minute ferry ride
across Puget Sound from Seattle, is slightly larger than
Connecticut. Its core consists of the Olympic National Park, which,
confusingly, lies within the Olympic National Forest. You can't
drive across its midsection, however. That means we're following a
kind of great circle route on US 101, sharing the two-lane blacktop
with no small number of RVs and logging trucks while making
occasional forays into the majestic center of the park, where the
Olympic Mountains hover.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks come here to hike, of course. There are more than 600
miles of trails within the park, as opposed to 168 miles of road.
But we're limiting ourselves to short walks of no more than 3
miles. One good reason: Even though it's late July, much of the
high country is still covered with snow. How much? ``Part of the
Deer Lake Trail has been obliterated by an avalanche with up to 13
feet of snow and debris,'' my wife, Margery, declares one morning,
reading a park bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately announce that we have decided to skip the Deer
Lake Trail this trip.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Despite the sheer size of almost everything here _
the largest living specimens of 10 species of trees are located
within the park _ what has struck us most about the Olympic
Peninsula is the wide diversity that's crammed into a relatively
small area. There are wild, frigid-water beaches piled with
driftwood. There are mountains (most notably the three peaks of
Mount Olympus) that approach 8,000 feet in height and look as if
they've been imported from Switzerland. There are more than 60
glaciers. There are remote fishing villages (such as Neah Bay) and
a Yupscale Victorian tourist town (Port Townsend). There's a
village (Forks) that annually receives 105 inches of rain a year
while a town located less than 60 miles away (Sequim) gets only 17.
And there's a lush, temperate rain forest (the Hoh) that is only 20
miles from an alpine vista (Hurricane Ridge) that's 4,500 feet
higher and represents a climate growing variation of no fewer than
1,500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   You can drive here from Seattle, but we chose the much quicker
water route. The ferry's solarium made us chuckle. Sunshine? In
Washington? Please. Actually, the weather has tended to clear in
the afternoons during our stay. The mornings, however, have usually
been gray and murky, especially the first one. ``Just wait a
while,'' urged a staff member at the Peninsula Gateway Visitor
Center near the hamlet of Shine. (Shine? In Washington? Please.) We
were skeptical, but she was right: Fair skies greeted us even
before we reached the small seaport of Port Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   Port Townsend, parts of which are a National Historic District,
is the nearest thing the Olympic Peninsula has to cute, a place
where local ordinance prohibits restaurants and retailers from
using Styrofoam. We spend a night at Manresa Castle, now a hotel
but built in 1892 as the largest private residence in town. We walk
the tourist-laden streets of the commercial downtown and admire
uptown Victorian homes that now stand cheek-by-jowl to modern ranch
houses. We eat Northwestern seafood in the terrific Silverwater
Cafe, down elegant mint truffles at the Elevated Ice Cream Co., and
note that Capt. Joe's Tattoo Parlor promises clean needles for
every customer. Ethan declares that he approves of Port Townsend.
``Three toy stores,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the peninsula beckons, so we soon motor west.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge, on the north coast,
we pick our way among the driftwood logs and branches that have
piled up along a narrow spit of sand that curves some 7 miles into
the Pacific. The trees have been washed out to sea by rushing
rivers, banged against the sand and rocks, and sanded smooth by the
waves. We discover that they make a great climbing structure for a
12-year-old who's just spent a few hours hunkered down in the back
seat of a car.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we wait once again for the skies to clear. As
we order breakfast in Bonny's Bakery in Port Angeles, the largest
city on the peninsula, the news on the radio is good: Clear
conditions are emerging on Hurricane Ridge Road, with all peaks and
valleys visible. The road is literally the high point of any trip
here, a 17-mile drive up an often-winding road that curves through
dense forests of the likes of Western red cedar and Pacific yew
before revealing an alpine view of ice-covered peaks that lacks
only Julie Andrews singing ``The Sound of Music.'' At 5,230 feet
above sea level, Ethan and Margery break out in a mid-summer
snowball fight, and Ethan and I ski on our feet down a meadow that
still has more than a foot of snow on it. Two black-tailed deer sit
serenely nearby. Cool, in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about the Olympic Peninsula: It keeps throwing
changes at you. At the seasonal Sol Duc Hot Springs resort in
Olympic National Park, the descendant of an early 20th-century spa
that is tucked into a valley of old-growth Douglas firs, we sweat
it out in a trio of mineral pools that are naturally heated to 100
degrees, give or take. (We are staying in one of the hotel's 32
phoneless and TV-less cabins, but just plain folks can use the
pools for a small fee.) The next day, in stark contrast, we shiver
in the frigid surf of Ruby Beach, on the west coast, while
wandering among towering sea stacks that were once part of the
mainland but now stand majestically alone along the rocky beach.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Hoh Rain Forest, a world unto itself.
Blessed with some 14 feet of annual rain, it offers us two short
trails through a primeval setting consisting of dozens of shades of
green. Even the sunlight, such as it is, is green. We walk among
moss-draped maples, giant Sitka spruce, and feathery ferns. We
learn that the dense forest exists because warm air rolls over the
peninsula from the west and is forced upward by the mountains,
creating colder air and triggering so much percipitation that the
hot local bumper sticker is ``Rain Happens.'' It doesn't happen to
us, but four Roosevelt elk happen by the side of the 19-mile road
that leads us to the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leave the peninsula, Margery and Ethan insist upon
following signs to the world's largest Sitka spruce, near Quinault
Lake in the Olympic National Forest. I wait behind the wheel while
they walk into the woods to behold the behemoth. It stands 191 feet
tall, has a circumference of 58 feet, and spreads 96 feet above the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was it?'' I ask my son when he returns to the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big,'' he replies. ``Really, really big.''

 &HT;    GORE PRIMED TO LAND 'KNOCKOUT PUNCH' IN EARLY STATES
 &HT;    1020&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore is well ahead of Bill
Bradley, his only opponent for the 2000 Democratic presidential
nomination, in building a battle-hardened campaign organization in
the key states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore forces are so entrenched in Iowa and New Hampshire, the
states with the earliest presidential voting, and their message is
so finely tailored to the local economies, that the vice president
could deliver an early knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   No one associated with the Gore campaign will publicly predict
in which round Bradley may fall. But the organizing and positioning
of people and resources by Gore suggests a strategy of going for
broke early: if not in Iowa, then here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former three-term senator from New Jersey, may raise
enough money to go the distance in next year's compressed primary
season. But so far, the money has not boosted Bradley's standing in
public opinion polls, where he trails Gore by double digits in both
early states, as well as nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has to win someplace early, to establish he has
political legs,'' said Darrell West, political science professor at
Brown University. ``If he cannot beat Gore someplace, he starts to
look like a malcontent who is damaging the party in the ultimate
race against the GOP.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley must also break through early to avoid being overwhelmed
as the contest shifts from the retail politics of cornfields and
coffee klatches to the expensive TV ads of the big-state primaries
that follow, especially California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recognizes the importance of New Hampshire to long-shot
candidates. He makes his ninth visit to the state Sunday(8/29). He
has scheduled three full days of receptions and town hall meetings
in the northern and coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, he joined 500 volunteers on the last of seven
days in which they left handbills on the front doors of 10,000 New
Hampshire homes in 31 cities. He portrayed the canvassing as an
example of a new style of politics, of getting people involved at
the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Shaheen also knows about the grass roots of New
Hampshire and how underdogs win in the nation's first presidential
primary. He helped Jimmy Carter, the longest of long shots, win in
1976. And this year, he is chairing Gore's campaign in the Granite
State, one of the many members of the state's Democratic Party
establishment backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaheen has the state's booming economy as an ally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Clinton first brought his presidential aspirations
north from Arkansas, New Hampshire was devastated by economic
recession. At times that year, it led the nation in the rate of
lost jobs, personal bankruptcies, new welfare enrollments and bank
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the
country, 3 percent. It is the fastest growing state in the region.
And high-tech has replaced manufacturing as its economic base.
</P>
<P>
   The administration in Washington, including Gore, deserves much
of the credit, Shaheen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you ever want to change drivers in the middle of an
economy like this?'' he asked in an interview last week. ``He's
part of the team that helped bring this state and this country
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 13 Democrats in the New Hampshire state Senate
apparently agree. They have endorsed Gore, as have 40 Democratic
state House members, including House Democratic Leader Peter
Burling, one of the state's most influential legislators. Gore's
campaign steering committee in New Hampshire is nearing 1,000 party
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking state official backing Bradley is state Sen.
Mark Fernald, considered a political maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's wife, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, whose election began the
resurrection of the Democratic Party in the GOP-dominated New
Hampshire, is expected to endorse Gore before the New Hampshire
primary next February. ``I keep working on her every day,'' Shaheen
said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation exists in Iowa. Christie Vilsack, the
state's first lady, is actively involved in Gore's campaign. And
while Gov. Tom Vilsack has been studiously neutral so far, in
recent weeks he has repeatedly volunteered comments about how
Gore's campaign is steadily improving.
</P>
<P>
   But where New Hampshire's economy is booming, Iowa, like the
rest of the Midwest, is gripped by the most severe agricultural
downturn in the country since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and soybean prices are down 47 percent from the fall of
1997. Hog prices are near Depression-era levels. And Vilsack is
warning that Iowa could lose one-third of its farm families in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley initially angered Iowa farmers with his acknowledgement
that he knew little about agriculture, the state's biggest
industry. He has tried to recover with innovative proposals to help
family farms with Starbucks-style marketing to high-end grocery
stores.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, with promises of help from the federal government, has
organized 122 farmers into a new group, ``Farmers for Gore,'' and
won the endorsement of Iowa Agriculture Secretary Patty Judge.
</P>
<P>
   And at this summer's Iowa State Fair, one of the country's
agricultural showpieces, Gore won the presidential straw poll with
1,475 votes. He was followed by Texas Gov. George Bush with 1,113,
publisher Steve Forbes with 964 and Bradley with 949.
</P>
<P>
   But as important as the farm vote is in Iowa, the secret of
winning the state's presidential caucus, which precedes New
Hampshire's primary, is organization. And on the Democratic side,
no group is more successful in getting voters out on a cold winter
night to caucuses throughout Iowa than organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's Iowa campaign is in the hands of Dan Lucas, a longtime
party activist with grass-roots organizing experience with unions
and trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's Iowa campaign, run by Steve Hildebrand, who was in
charge of the crucial Midwestern states for the Clinton re-election
campaign, got a two-month jump on Bradley with unions in Iowa. As a
result, Gore has won the endorsements of Iowa unions representing
auto workers, mail handlers and carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is strong with organized labor _ strong,''
said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a two-time candidate for president and
one of the staunches allies of labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has the endorsement of 70 Democrats in Congress and 12
former senators, while Bradley has the backing of only three former
Senate colleagues. And elected officials will represent about 20
percent of the Democratic delegates who will determine the party's
nominee at the national convention next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating being up against the whole party
establishment,'' said 25-year-old Eric Landen, one of the so-called
``road warriors'' who has come to New Hampshire from his native
Ohio to set up field offices for Bradley. ``But we're counting on
the iconoclastic nature of New Hampshire voters to even things
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger and anxiety that was so apparent among New
Hampshire voters in 1992 has receded. And Clinton is golden.
``There's just a love affair with him in this state,'' said former
state party chairman Jeff Woodburn, a Gore backer.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Gore is not distancing himself from the president,
at least here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the message,'' said Nick Baldick, gesturing to the blue
and white banner on the wall of the Gore campaign headquarters, a
downtown storefront. The banner reads: ``Expanding America's
Prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldick runs the Gore campaign in New Hampshire. He was here
with Clinton during the 1996 primary. But in the 1996 general
election, he engineered the minor miracle of winning Florida, the
first time the Sunshine State had voted for a Democratic
presidential nominee in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's New Hampshire campaign manager is Mark Longabaugh, an
Ohio native who filled the same post for House Democratic Leader
Dick Gephardt in 1988. Bradley hired Longabaugh 10 days after
Gephardt endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for Congress in Ohio in 1996, Longabaugh ran a
campaign that emphasized the kind of long-shot door-to-door
canvassing that is the primary feature of the Bradley effort in New
Hampshire. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Anita Dunn, a senior Bradley adviser, ``We have always
believed that people would decide the nomination at the polls and
understand fully that the bulk of the institutional support would
be with the vice president.''

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore is well ahead of Bill
Bradley, his only opponent for the 2000 Democratic presidential
nomination, in building a battle-hardened campaign organization in
the key states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore forces are so entrenched in Iowa and New Hampshire, the
states with the earliest presidential voting, and their message is
so finely tailored to the local economies, that the vice president
could deliver an early knockout punch.
</P>
<P>
   No one associated with the Gore campaign will publicly predict
in which round Bradley may fall. But the organizing and positioning
of people and resources by Gore suggests a strategy of going for
broke early: if not in Iowa, then here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former three-term senator from New Jersey, may raise
enough money to go the distance in next year's compressed primary
season. But so far, the money has not boosted Bradley's standing in
public opinion polls, where he trails Gore by double digits in both
early states, as well as nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has to win someplace early, to establish he has
political legs,'' said Darrell West, political science professor at
Brown University. ``If he cannot beat Gore someplace, he starts to
look like a malcontent who is damaging the party in the ultimate
race against the GOP.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley must also break through early to avoid being overwhelmed
as the contest shifts from the retail politics of cornfields and
coffee klatches to the expensive TV ads of the big-state primaries
that follow, especially California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recognizes the importance of New Hampshire to long-shot
candidates. He makes his ninth visit to the state Sunday(8/29). He
has scheduled three full days of receptions and town hall meetings
in the northern and coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, he joined 500 volunteers on the last of seven
days in which they left handbills on the front doors of 10,000 New
Hampshire homes in 31 cities. He portrayed the canvassing as an
example of a new style of politics, of getting people involved at
the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Shaheen also knows about the grass roots of New
Hampshire and how underdogs win in the nation's first presidential
primary. He helped Jimmy Carter, the longest of long shots, win in
1976. And this year, he is chairing Gore's campaign in the Granite
State, one of the many members of the state's Democratic Party
establishment backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaheen has the state's booming economy as an ally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Clinton first brought his presidential aspirations
north from Arkansas, New Hampshire was devastated by economic
recession. At times that year, it led the nation in the rate of
lost jobs, personal bankruptcies, new welfare enrollments and bank
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the
country, 3 percent. It is the fastest growing state in the region.
And high-tech has replaced manufacturing as its economic base.
</P>
<P>
   The administration in Washington, including Gore, deserves much
of the credit, Shaheen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you ever want to change drivers in the middle of an
economy like this?'' he asked in an interview last week. ``He's
part of the team that helped bring this state and this country
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 13 Democrats in the New Hampshire state Senate

state House members, including House Democratic Leader Peter
Burling, one of the state's most influential legislators. Gore's

WHO INHERITS THE IRA?

<P>
   Many Americans have large portions of their assets in Individual
Retirement Accounts _ especially people who have changed jobs or
retired and rolled over their pension plans. But if they should die
before they can use those savings, the money may not go to their
chosen heirs.
</P>
<P>
   That is because money in an IRA will go to the people designated
on the account's beneficiary forms. And those forms, often filed
when the account is opened, override even a will, which may have
been written or revised later and reflect new circumstances in a
family's financial life.
</P>
<P>
   Often, IRA beneficiary forms are a ``time bomb,'' according to
Seymour Goldberg, senior partner in Goldberg &AMP; Goldberg, a law firm
in Garden City, N.Y., and an expert on retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nissenbaum, national director for individual income taxes
and retirement planning at Ernst &AMP; Young, said mutual funds and
banks ``often give bad advice on naming IRA beneficiaries,''
especially when it comes to naming a trust or charity as the
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   When filling out beneficiary forms, he said, ``if you have
something substantial in an IRA, if it's a key part of your assets,
get professional advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The most basic problem, however, involves the division of
assets, said Goldberg, who has written several books on IRA's and
pensions, including ``J.K. Lasser's How to Protect Your Retirement
Savings From the IRS,'' to be published by Macmillan USA in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Say a widow has three children _ Tom, Dick and Harry, all of
whom have children. She names her sons as beneficiaries, but Harry
dies before she does. Most standard forms state that if one child
dies, the surviving children get all the money,'' Goldberg said,
``but most wills say that if a child dies, his share goes to his
children.''
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this problem, Goldberg and his son, Jason, the firm's
other Goldberg, amend the standard form for clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldbergs also amend the form when a beneficiary or
contingent beneficiary is a minor, to provide that the money be
transferred under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, with the
custodian to be selected by the executor.
</P>
<P>
   Without that clause, Seymour Goldberg said, many state laws
require that a guardian be appointed, that the guardian buy a
surety bond and that a court approve any investment changes the
guardian wants to make in the account.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Goldberg said that when amending a form, he prepares two
copies for his client to send to the financial institution, with a
cover letter requesting that one copy be stamped ``received'' and
then dated and returned. That is important because institutions
have been known to lose the forms, especially after mergers. If the
loss is not discovered before the account holder dies, and the
executor has no copy of the form, the IRA could go into the estate.
Then it could be divided among additional beneficiaries, and the
tax benefits of stretching out the payments could be lost.

A TOUGH TIME FOR ARMY RECRUITERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When's the last time you sat down and talked to an
Army recruiter?'' asked Lt. Col. Cornell McGhee, as he sidled up to
a young man in a T-shirt and denim shorts browsing at Wherehouse
Music.
</P>
<P>
   Startled, the young man stared back and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you in school?'' McGhee persisted. ``Are you working? What
do you see yourself doing two to five years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   The young man, who barely looked up from the music rack, was
clearly not interested in joining the military, much less providing
his name and phone number so a recruiter could call.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, McGhee tried one last time to establish a rapport as
he thrust a business card in the young man's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't cost you nothing to look,'' he said. ``It don't cost
you nothing to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   McGhee is an Army recruiter, which is one of the toughest jobs
in the military today. That's because McGhee has a formidable enemy
_ the good economy. There are so many options these days, he said,
which makes young folks less likely to sign up for a two- to
six-year hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Each month he and his own army of 234 recruiters have to find
between 150 and 200 new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   They fan out as far north as Marshall (265 miles) and as far
south as Victoria (125 miles), visiting shopping malls, university
cafeterias, music stores, anywhere 17- to 21-year-olds congregate.
</P>
<P>
   The best recruits are the kids who graduated from high school a
year or two earlier who are unsure about their futures, McGhee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the Army is like selling any other product. And there is
a lot of science behind the Army's methods.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best recruiting methods is to bring kids back home
who are between their basic training and their first assignment,
McGhee said.
</P>
<P>
   For two to three weeks, they visit their old stomping grounds
and talk to their friends, family and old school chums, hoping to
get them to consider the Army. The ``hometown recruiters'' are
responsible for getting two people each day to visit an Army
recruiting station.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing for a recruiter is to establish rapport,
McGhee said. Hometown recruiters don't face that barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Their friends see their sharp uniform, McGhee said. ``That
really appeals to them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MONETARY APPEAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to do push-ups?'' asked one young woman shopping
with her friend at a Houston-area mall when Sgt. 1st Class Louis
Jasso approached her. She is attending Houston Community College
and perked up when Jasso mentioned the Army has up to $50,000
available for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a reserves program,'' said Jasso, who has a smooth,
easygoing style. It would pay $750 a month for two days worth of
work.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman stopped shopping long enough to give Jasso her
name and phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call anytime,'' she assured him. ``I don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a good contact, Jasso later told McGhee. She might just
sign up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BUSINESS OF CHASING RECRUITS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's important to Jasso because he is evaluated based on his
recruiting ability.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to have the first interview within 72 hours, said
Jasso. After that, the prospect loses the ardor.
</P>
<P>
   So recruiters typically spend Mondays and Tuesdays prospecting
in the malls, stereo shops and college campuses. Then they schedule
the follow-up interviews for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of talking to enough people, said McGhee, who
estimates that for every 10 people who consent to an initial
interview, one will sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jasso pulled his van up in front of the High School for
Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   It's really important to have a strong presence at the high
schools, said Jasso, who visits large schools in his territory
weekly to meet students, teachers and counselors. He tries to make
presentations to the honor classes, especially math and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're seen and known, they'll think Army when they think
military,'' said Jasso, as he walked around the campus.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the afternoon, McGhee and Jasso compared notes.
McGhee got four leads and Jasso got two.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, that was not a bad (few hours') work,'' said
McGhee. ``Normally, that's how you'd do late in the evening or on
the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   And the recruiting never stops. When I called to ask how to
spell Jasso's name, Staff Sgt. Brian Faw answered the phone. After
he spelled Jasso's name, he asked, with the hope of a used car
salesman: ``Do you want to join?''

   Three years ago, Marnie Lerner and Cynde Cassel started Star
Treatment, a company in Los Angeles that created whimsical,
personalized gift baskets. Soon, they moved beyond baskets and into
a distinct regional niche: gifts for the stars.

<P>

pampering,'' Ms. Lerner said. ``There is just so much of
everything.''

   There is always a new gadget that will appeal men, she said _
say, the night-vision goggles worth about $500 that they chose for
a client who wanted to express thanks to a Hollywood lawyer. It was
delivered in an ergonomically designed shoulder bag.
</P>
<P>
   For women, they choose luxuries that certify both giver and
recipient as current with trends. ``Say Sharon Stone, who can buy
herself absolutely everything and probably does,'' Ms. Lerner said.
``If you send her over a pashmina scarf in this season's colors,
it's something she'll appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   What they actually have sent to Ms. Stone _ in an assignment a
year ago, before the ascendancy of pashmina _ was an aromatherapy
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's current style of lavish gift-giving goes back at
least to the mid-1980s, when Michael Ovitz began sending actors
gifts to celebrate the start of work on films.
</P>
<P>
   Star Treatment's gifts cost from $150 to about $2,000. While 80
percent of the clients are connected with show business, the
company also has gift baskets available on the Internet at
www.startreatment.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company which had sales of more than $500,000 last year,
tailors its Hollywood gifts to both customers and recipients.
``Star Treatment kind of runs the gamut,'' said Alison Bossert,
Columbia Pictures' manager of special events. ``They have great
products, which they put together so well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gramercy Pictures wanted to celebrate Cate Blanchett's
Oscar nomination for ``Elizabeth'' this year, Ms. Lerner and Ms.
Cassel provided a tiny Elph camera and tucked it into an Armani
evening bag. When Julia Roberts headed off this summer to film the
coming drama ``Erin Brockovich'' in the desert near Barstow,
Calif., they helped get her Alba botanical sun cream, Kiehl's
soothing lotion and Oliver Peoples sunglasses. They are currently
putting together some Christmas gift suggestions for Maria and
Arnold _ as in Shriver and Schwarzenegger _ to use.
</P>
<P>
   Studios often order gifts to mark the start of filming, so they
give scripts to Ms. Lerner and Ms. Cassel to help them with ideas.
As a result, a visit to Star Treatment's suburban Los Angeles
offices provides an inside glimpse of coming attractions and
requires a vow of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the most in the loop out-of-the-loop people in
Hollywood,'' Ms. Cassel said.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1998 remake of ``Psycho,'' they helped Universal
Pictures give the stars, Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn, and the
director, Gus Van Sant, handmade rocking chairs with chenille
throws tossed over the backs, alluding to the shadowy figure in the
window of Norman Bates' house.
</P>
<P>
   The stars also received Sabatier butcher knives (think ``shower
scene''), engraved with the word ``Psycho'' on the blades and
jabbed into natural sponges. And all received French bath potions,
but only the men received stuffed birds, calling to mind Norman's
interest in taxidermy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Lerner and Ms. Cassel win plenty of praise from the
givers of gifts (``We got a wonderful handwritten thank you from
Jodie Foster for the basket you did for her son's first birthday,''
went the note from one studio representative), the recipients
usually don't even know they exist, though they might surmise that
someone was acting as a middleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who does anything themselves in Hollywood?'' asked Nikki
Finke, a veteran Hollywood journalist who is finishing a book about
agents. ``You would not have an economy in Hollywood if people did
things for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner, 27, who was a movie critic for Mundo L.A., a
Spanish-language weekly newspaper, and Ms. Cassel, 30, then a
personal shopper at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, met at a fashion
show in New York in 1993. They met again after Ms. Cassel moved to
Los Angeles; she began working in marketing at Mundo, part of a
publishing company owned by Ms. Lerner's parents. In 1995, the two
women were asked to put together 100 gifts to be distributed by the
company for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   They amassed items from retailers like Pier One and Costco and,
armed with a heat gun and shrink wrap, set to work assembling
baskets. The gifts were so successful that they started their
business in the spring of 1996, with Ms. Lerner's mother, Diane
Lerner, as a partner. Each woman put in $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very naive,'' Ms. Cassel said. ``You can blow that in a
week just paying to get envelopes, business cards and inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The business has been built on cold-calling and knocking on
studio doors. ``We'd go to Century City and walk the buildings,''
Ms. Cassel said. That meant covering about 25 floors of offices and
braving the threat of being tossed out by security, which happened
to Ms. Lerner once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mortified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long, with a business to build. ``You get over it
very quickly when it's your baby,'' Ms. Cassel said.

IN A RACE WITH TIME, JOCKEYS FACE PERIL AT EVERY TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM WILKIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ On every inch of every race track in
the world, danger waits, ready to pounce, ready to put a jockey's
career _ or life _ in jeopardy. At any time, in any thoroughbred
horse race, every rider's nightmare can become a horrible reality.
</P>
<P>
   One moment, a jockey can be maneuvering a 1,200-pound horse _
which can run as fast as 40 mph _ toward the finish line. A split
second later, he or she can be sprawled on the race course, at the
mercy of the thundering herd.
</P>
<P>
   Serious injury, paralysis, even death are part of this game.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven jockeys have died in the 1990s as a result of injuries
suffered during thoroughbred riding accidents. There are no 1990s
figures for paralysis, but John Giovanni, the national manager and
secretary of the Jockey's Guild, said 52 riders in the Guild are
paralyzed. (The total includes exercise riders.) Giovanni said
three riders have been paralyzed in the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the National Football League, a league known
for brutality, there have been no on-field deaths in at least the
past 25 years. In the same period, at least five players _
including New York Jets defensive lineman Dennis Byrd in 1992 _
have left the field with paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Baez became horse racing's most recent victim of a
paralyzing injury, in the second race at Rockingham Park in Salem,
N.H., on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, the leading rider in New England, broke out of the gate on
the rail aboard a horse named Gaitor Bait. A sixteenth of a mile
out of the gate, the field squeezed each jockey to the inside. Baez
got squeezed most of all.
</P>
<P>
   He catapulted onto the track when his mount clipped the heels of
another horse. Baez struck the ground head-first. The impact
severed his spinal cord and left his lower body paralyzed. Doctors
say he will never walk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw him, I couldn't believe it,'' said Mike
Szpuk, Baez's agent for the past 15 years. ``When he fell on his
neck and his head, the force was just so great ... his head was
swollen twice its normal size and both his eyes were swelled shut.
His whole face was bruised. Terrible, just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Death and paralysis, of course, represent the most nightmarish
end of the injury spectrum. But jockeys suffer a multitude of other
injuries, with fractures of the legs, shoulders and arms being the
most common, Giovanni said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 2,500 jockey injuries are reported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was suffered by Mike Smith at Saratoga last summer.
Two days after winning the Travers aboard Coronado's Quest, Smith
crashed back to reality when he was thrown from his mount and
suffered a broken back. Smith was in a body cast for a month and
spent five months in rehabilitation. He returned to racing in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Baez was in a drug-induced coma for nearly 10 days, breathing
with the help of a respirator. He currently is in the Kessler
Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange, N.J., the same place
the actor Christopher Reeve went after injuring himself in a fall
while riding a horse four years ago. Reeve is a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right know that (Baez) is amazing,'' Szpuk
said. ``He doesn't blame anyone for what happened. He is dealing
with the cards that he has been dealt. When I first talked to him,
he told me a nurse said he had a one-in-a-million chance of walking
again. I told him, `Rudy, you're in big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Baez adjusts to life as a paraplegic, Szpuk said the former
rider constantly asks about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Szpuk said Baez has been offered a position in racing at Suffolk
Downs by Lou Raffetto, the track's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury has really soured me on the game,'' said Szpuk, who
has not returned to Rockingham since the accident. ``It's like a
part of me has died. It's like trying to wake up from a dream and
you can't do it. But Rudy has been so great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not once has he said, `Woe is me' or `Why did this happen to
me.' When he first came to, he thought he was dead. That's what he
said. Then he said he was just happy to be alive. Some people would
rather be dead than paralyzed. But Rudy won't blame anyone. He is a
beautiful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Figueroa was the most recent jockey to be killed on a race
track. He was killed last year while riding at the Northampton Fair
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dangerous and difficult occupation for anyone,'' said
Giovanni, who was a rider during the 1960s and '70s. ``I don't care
who he or she is. They are risking life and limb every time they
get on a horse.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   There are measures to protect jockeys. All, for example, are
required to wear flak jackets and helmets, and ambulances are on
standby at the tracks in case of emergency. But sometimes it isn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever see a sport where there is an ambulance following
around every race?'' Szpuk said. ``How dangerous is this game?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, the leading rider at the current Saratoga meet,
has avoided serious injuries during his career. His worst injury
was a broken jaw that forced him out of action for three months in
1978.

 &HT;    FAIRFAX COUNTY RIDES HIGH-TECH BOOM TO RICHES _ AND SPRAWL
 &HT;    With TECH-FAIRFAX-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. _ The pastures and orchards that not long ago
produced a wealth of food here are sprouting a new bounty now:
high-tech jobs, stock options, luxury subdivisions and cars, cars,
cars.
</P>
<P>
   All over the rolling parcels of green in formerly rural Fairfax
County west of Washington, entrepreneurs are raising the heavily
wired, glass-encased office buildings that will contain the
industrial base for the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside them are the Internet, telecom and software
executives and technicians who have helped boost Fairfax's median
household income to $87,569 _ the highest in the nation, according
to the market research firm Claritas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has its price. Like other high-tech hotbeds,
including Atlanta, Austin and Dallas, Fairfax County residents are
suffering from the aggravating side effects of rapid growth:
crowded schools, underdeveloped mass transit systems, skyrocketing
housing prices and the loss of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain bitterly about traffic snarls. But their
complaining is often done while sitting in BMWs, talking on sleek
cell phones. ``It's hard to complain too much,'' said Gerald
Gordon, president of the Fairfax County Economic Development
Authority, ``because what we suffer from is our affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   How this once-bucolic community figured out the future, and then
made a fortune from it, is a lesson in the value of post-urban
infrastructure. Instead of building roads, bridges and sewers to
attract new jobs, Fairfax County led in the laying of fat pipes for
computerized data.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Fairfax's advanced wiring, about two-thirds of all
Internet traffic in the world passes within a few miles of
Washington Dulles International Airport on the county's western
edge. By being able to move both data and air passengers quickly,
Fairfax is selling itself as a key port in the global economy.
Atlanta and Denver have similar strategies, but Fairfax also has
proximity to power, with the nation's capital just across the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the next century, the question facing Fairfax
residents is: Will this wiry infrastructure, bustling airport and
tight link to Washington keep the wealth growing? Or will
increasing quality-of-life problems and competition from other
cities cause high-tech businesses to pull out as fast as they built
up?
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Fairfax has seen nothing but growth. Before
World War II, Fairfax was a quiet Southern county with just 41,000
people thinly spread over rural acreage. But as the Pentagon
staffed up in the 1940s, Fairfax became a bedroom suburb of
Arlington, Va., and Washington. By 1950, its population was
106,000. Just a decade later, it was 272,000.
</P>
<P>
   For all the growth, Fairfax remained primarily residential and
rural, with lots of tall oaks but relatively few jobs. In the
mid-1970s, the county was still the state's leading producer of
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Though few realized it then, the seeds of Fairfax's 1990s
affluence were being planted in government computers. The Pentagon
was sponsoring the creation of Arpanet, the precursor of today's
Internet. Many of the engineers working for the government later
became founding fathers of the county's Internet giants, such as
UUNET Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other parts of the government were building
Washington Dulles, an airport whose value was not fully realized
until after the deregulation of airlines in the late 1970s and the
boom in travel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just air service that Dulles provided. Planners
also put a wide road through the middle of the county to connect
air travelers to Washington. Today, the Dulles Toll Road is the
main artery running through the heart of Fairfax County.
</P>
<P>
   With a pleasant climate, good air service, proximity to
Washington and a highly educated work force, Fairfax began to
market itself to entrepreneurs in the 1980s as a great place to
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And telecommunications companies started seeing Fairfax County
as a promised land, a place with lots of wires and computer
engineers, and all within miles of Capitol Hill. Having quick
access to Congress was important to telecom businesses lobbying for
fewer regulations. Satellite companies also settled into the area
because of their need to get government authorization for projects.
</P>
<P>
   Being near the federal government helps, too, when start-ups are
seeking contracts for work. The original Commerce Department
contract for registering Internet addresses gave rise to Network
Solutions Inc., now an e-commerce powerhouse in Fairfax.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington on one side, Dulles on the other, and lots of
brains and wires in the middle, Fairfax County boomed in the 1990s.
Contractors worked frantically to construct the office parks that
could contain the wildly growing work forces at companies such as
America Online, PSI Net Inc., Oracle Corp. and about 2,500 other
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, roughly 130,000 people have moved into the
county and 20 million square feet of office space have been added.
The affluence level has rocketed up, with ``executive-style
living'' subdivisions covering former farmlands with swimming pools
and tennis courts. Pricey malls serve as town centers of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   While a few small towns are located within the county, such as
Herndon and Vienna, Fairfax is overwhelmingly defined by its lack
of urban-ness. It is a land of sprawling subdivisions, sprawling
office parks and sprawling malls.
</P>
<P>
   And cars.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has an elaborate Metro rail system, the mass
transit system has barely penetrated Fairfax County. Seemingly
every day, local newspapers run another story about the political
battles over transportation in Northern Virginia. Everyone agrees
something must be done. The agreement stops there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Economic Development Authority and Chamber of
Commerce continue to seek growth in the high-tech area and display
scant interest in diversifying the economy. Given the astonishing
growth in wealth that they have seen in the Internet and telecom
businesses, one could scarcely blame them for not trying to recruit
a tire factory or meat-packing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, seeing so many economic eggs in one high-tech basket is
some cause for concern. ``The pessimist in all of us might wonder
if it can last,'' said Tony Howard, a spokesman for county Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While he is abashed by the growth, Howard says the future is
bright because most of the numerous office buildings dotting the
county are generic boxes with parking decks. When one hotshot
company goes bankrupt, another company can take its space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing unique about their buildings,'' Howard said of
the high-tech companies. ``The shell of a building is something we
would be able to make use of'' in marketing Fairfax to other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fantastic successes, Fairfax still has some
deficiencies as a high-tech mecca.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it has no first-tier technology research university
comparable to Atlanta's Georgia Tech or Austin's University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Second, venture-capital funding still lags well behind the
big-money magnets of Silicon Valley and New England.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Fairfax County has a new problem: too much success. One
of the reasons so many high-tech companies chose Fairfax was its
high quality of life. Company owners were able to lure young
workers by pointing out the area's relatively low cost of living,
low taxes, great schools and physical beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Now home prices are rising, schools are jammed and roads are
clogged. Shopping centers have replaced the barns and fields that
once added such charm to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Will these growing pains lead to a letdown for Fairfax in the
new century?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can predict what will come next,'' Howard said. But for
now, people are still voting with their feet, running into Fairfax
at a blistering pace. ``These are really some of the best jobs in
the country,'' he said. ``And they will continue to attract the
most motivated citizens.''

   Bailey said that when he goes onto the track, the possibility of
injury is not something he thinks about.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't,'' Bailey said. ``I have had numerous injuries, but
I haven't had the, quote, unquote, big hit, you know? We don't talk
about injuries among ourselves. We do have a devotional prayer
group just about every day and we keep people like Rudy Baez in our
minds and in our hearts. But there is not a lot of dialogue other
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always keep in the back of mind that it can happen. I
reflect on Ron Turcotte, the guy who rode one of the greatest
horses ever (Secretariat). He won the Triple Crown (in 1973), and
then, in a short period of time ('78), he was in a wheelchair.
That's how quick it can happen. It could happen to me today.''

   Richard Migliore learned on July 17 at Belmont Park just how
quickly an injury can alter a career. The 35-year-old rider was
aboard a horse named J Carson in the third race. When he got the
horse to the quarter-pole, J Carson snapped his left leg, sending
Migliore somersaulting over the horse and onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   Migliore was right in the path of another horse, Native Guide.
Jockey Ariel Smith could not avoid Migliore, and the horse stepped
directly onto his right arm at the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got knocked out pretty good,'' said Migliore, who has a cast
on his right arm and is sitting out the rest of the year. ``I was
in and out of consciousness for the better part of a half-hour.
When I came to in the ambulance, there was just so much blood and
my arm hurt so much that I knew I was hurt bad. I couldn't look at
it. I did not want to see my arm mangled, and I knew it was
mangled.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the horse's hoof on Migliore was so great that his
elbow and radius bone popped out of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling it a break certainly minimizes it,'' Migliore said.
``My arm exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen screws and two plates hold it together.

   Since the accident, Migliore has complained of pain so great
that it has forced him out of bed at 3 in the morning and sent him
wandering onto Broadway in Saratoga Springs, sipping coffee. He
also has had mental lapses. He said he doesn't remember being at a
recital for one of his children a few days before he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Migliore said the dangers of the sport will not make him think
about retiring to a safer line of work. He said he loves horse
racing and is determined to one day win races such as the Kentucky
Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic.

 &HT;    FAIRFAX COUNTY RIDES HIGH-TECH BOOM TO RICHES _ AND SPRAWL
 &HT;    With TECH-FAIRFAX-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. _ The pastures and orchards that not long ago
produced a wealth of food here are sprouting a new bounty now:
high-tech jobs, stock options, luxury subdivisions and cars, cars,
cars.
</P>
<P>
   All over the rolling parcels of green in formerly rural Fairfax
County west of Washington, entrepreneurs are raising the heavily
wired, glass-encased office buildings that will contain the
industrial base for the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside them are the Internet, telecom and software
executives and technicians who have helped boost Fairfax's median
household income to $87,569 _ the highest in the nation, according
to the market research firm Claritas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has its price. Like other high-tech hotbeds,
including Atlanta, Austin and Dallas, Fairfax County residents are
suffering from the aggravating side effects of rapid growth:
crowded schools, underdeveloped mass transit systems, skyrocketing
housing prices and the loss of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain bitterly about traffic snarls. But their
complaining is often done while sitting in BMWs, talking on sleek
cell phones. ``It's hard to complain too much,'' said Gerald
Gordon, president of the Fairfax County Economic Development
Authority, ``because what we suffer from is our affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   How this once-bucolic community figured out the future, and then
made a fortune from it, is a lesson in the value of post-urban
infrastructure. Instead of building roads, bridges and sewers to
attract new jobs, Fairfax County led in the laying of fat pipes for
computerized data.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Fairfax's advanced wiring, about two-thirds of all
Internet traffic in the world passes within a few miles of
Washington Dulles International Airport on the county's western
edge. By being able to move both data and air passengers quickly,
Fairfax is selling itself as a key port in the global economy.
Atlanta and Denver have similar strategies, but Fairfax also has
proximity to power, with the nation's capital just across the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the next century, the question facing Fairfax
residents is: Will this wiry infrastructure, bustling airport and
tight link to Washington keep the wealth growing? Or will
increasing quality-of-life problems and competition from other
cities cause high-tech businesses to pull out as fast as they built
up?
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Fairfax has seen nothing but growth. Before
World War II, Fairfax was a quiet Southern county with just 41,000
people thinly spread over rural acreage. But as the Pentagon
staffed up in the 1940s, Fairfax became a bedroom suburb of
Arlington, Va., and Washington. By 1950, its population was
106,000. Just a decade later, it was 272,000.
</P>
<P>
   For all the growth, Fairfax remained primarily residential and
rural, with lots of tall oaks but relatively few jobs. In the
mid-1970s, the county was still the state's leading producer of
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Though few realized it then, the seeds of Fairfax's 1990s
affluence were being planted in government computers. The Pentagon
was sponsoring the creation of Arpanet, the precursor of today's
Internet. Many of the engineers working for the government later
became founding fathers of the county's Internet giants, such as
UUNET Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other parts of the government were building
Washington Dulles, an airport whose value was not fully realized
until after the deregulation of airlines in the late 1970s and the
boom in travel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just air service that Dulles provided. Planners
also put a wide road through the middle of the county to connect
air travelers to Washington. Today, the Dulles Toll Road is the
main artery running through the heart of Fairfax County.
</P>
<P>
   With a pleasant climate, good air service, proximity to
Washington and a highly educated work force, Fairfax began to
market itself to entrepreneurs in the 1980s as a great place to
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And telecommunications companies started seeing Fairfax County
as a promised land, a place with lots of wires and computer
engineers, and all within miles of Capitol Hill. Having quick
access to Congress was important to telecom businesses lobbying for
fewer regulations. Satellite companies also settled into the area
because of their need to get government authorization for projects.
</P>
<P>
   Being near the federal government helps, too, when start-ups are
seeking contracts for work. The original Commerce Department
contract for registering Internet addresses gave rise to Network
Solutions Inc., now an e-commerce powerhouse in Fairfax.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington on one side, Dulles on the other, and lots of
brains and wires in the middle, Fairfax County boomed in the 1990s.
Contractors worked frantically to construct the office parks that
could contain the wildly growing work forces at companies such as
America Online, PSI Net Inc., Oracle Corp. and about 2,500 other
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, roughly 130,000 people have moved into the
county and 20 million square feet of office space have been added.
The affluence level has rocketed up, with ``executive-style
living'' subdivisions covering former farmlands with swimming pools
and tennis courts. Pricey malls serve as town centers of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   While a few small towns are located within the county, such as
Herndon and Vienna, Fairfax is overwhelmingly defined by its lack
of urban-ness. It is a land of sprawling subdivisions, sprawling
office parks and sprawling malls.
</P>
<P>
   And cars.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has an elaborate Metro rail system, the mass
transit system has barely penetrated Fairfax County. Seemingly
every day, local newspapers run another story about the political
battles over transportation in Northern Virginia. Everyone agrees
something must be done. The agreement stops there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Economic Development Authority and Chamber of
Commerce continue to seek growth in the high-tech area and display
scant interest in diversifying the economy. Given the astonishing
growth in wealth that they have seen in the Internet and telecom
businesses, one could scarcely blame them for not trying to recruit
a tire factory or meat-packing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, seeing so many economic eggs in one high-tech basket is
some cause for concern. ``The pessimist in all of us might wonder
if it can last,'' said Tony Howard, a spokesman for county Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While he is abashed by the growth, Howard says the future is
bright because most of the numerous office buildings dotting the
county are generic boxes with parking decks. When one hotshot
company goes bankrupt, another company can take its space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing unique about their buildings,'' Howard said of
the high-tech companies. ``The shell of a building is something we
would be able to make use of'' in marketing Fairfax to other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fantastic successes, Fairfax still has some
deficiencies as a high-tech mecca.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it has no first-tier technology research university
comparable to Atlanta's Georgia Tech or Austin's University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Second, venture-capital funding still lags well behind the
big-money magnets of Silicon Valley and New England.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Fairfax County has a new problem: too much success. One
of the reasons so many high-tech companies chose Fairfax was its
high quality of life. Company owners were able to lure young
workers by pointing out the area's relatively low cost of living,
low taxes, great schools and physical beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Now home prices are rising, schools are jammed and roads are
clogged. Shopping centers have replaced the barns and fields that
once added such charm to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Will these growing pains lead to a letdown for Fairfax in the
new century?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can predict what will come next,'' Howard said. But for
now, people are still voting with their feet, running into Fairfax
at a blistering pace. ``These are really some of the best jobs in
the country,'' he said. ``And they will continue to attract the
most motivated citizens.''

TURN TOMATO AND BASIL HARVEST INTO MORE THAN SPAGHETTI SAUCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
HAS COLOR ART; RECIPES SLUGGED TOMBASIL-RECIPES  
 
  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Your sun-drenched garden's overflowing with
prolific crops of tomatoes and basil, and they're absolutely
wonderful _ what you've waited for all year.
</P>
<P>
   But you're getting tomatoed out and tired of eating them plain
in sandwiches, salads and pasta. You need to dress and spruce them
up _ and give them a little pizazz _ and store some for a taste of
summer later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there's no shortage of recipes, both cooked and
uncooked, teaming tomatoes and basil in appetizers, sauces, soups,
salsas, pizzas, pastas, salads, chilis and more.
</P>
<P>
   Some recipes call for peeling and seeding the tomatoes, while
others use the skin and all. If you opt for seeded tomatoes when
cooking, simply halve the tomatoes and in the palm of your hand
gently squeeze out the liquid and seeds (into the sink). If you
prefer removing the skin, cut an X in the bottom of the tomato
opposite the stem end and plunge into a pot of boiling water 15 to
20 seconds. Remove and cool them enough to handle; then peel off
the skin. ``Tomato and basil are the perfect marriage,'' says Lee
Hefter, executive chef at Spago in Beverly Hills. ``A good tomato
offers a meaty flavor, and the basil is a nice flavor enhancer. I
remember when I was a kid growing up in New Jersey, and we had
tomatoes and basil in the garden _ and it was almost as though they
were planted for each other.'' His mother served the combination in
salads, on pasta and stuffed inside zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Hefter is busy concocting and offering customers an
innovative symphony of tomatoes _ a fabulous, must-try sampler
plate with five or six different tomato-and-basil creations _ that
should be available into October. Recently, it included a fresh
slice of a vine-ripened heirloom tomato lightly salted with French
sea salt, a slice of fresh buffalo mozzarella, a drizzling of
Ligurian olive oil and a sprinkling of chopped fresh basil and
cracked pepper along with a roasted confit of tomato (made with
peeled and deseeded blanched tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and
salt and pepper and baked 1 to 2 hours at 150 degrees F) served
with preserved lemon (substitute zest of lemon), capers and basil
oil.
</P>
<P>
   It also came with fresh tomato soup topped with a savory basil
whipped cream (whipped cream with blanched, pureed basil leaves
folded in); a cherry tomato salad with red and yellow and green
cherry tomatoes topped with shaved French goat cheese, black olive
tapenade, a julienne of fresh basil, olive oil and balsamic
vinegar; and a tartare of tomato on a crouton with a dollop of
basil aioli (a puree of blanched basil and blanched spinach folded
into mayonnaise). Who said you can't be creative with tomatoes and
basil?
</P>
<P>
   Spago also offers angel hair pasta with fresh tomatoes and
basil, a classic on the menu since the restaurant opened.
</P>
<P>
   Which all goes to prove that, flavor and fragrance-wise, there's
nothing to compare with home-grown tomatoes and basil _ from the
back yard or local farmers' markets. One taste, and you'll be
hooked _ and spoiled! It's no secret _ the commercial varieties
found in grocery stores don't even come close.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Weir, television cooking show cook and author of ``You
Say Tomato,'' (Broadway Books; $15) also finds tomatoes and basil a
perfect combination. ``They have the same wonderful sweetness that
seems to enhance each other.'' Weir, who spent four years
developing recipes for her book and currently grows cherry tomatoes
and basil in pots at her San Francisco digs, shares numerous
delicious creations with tomatoes and basil.
</P>
<P>
   When preparing them, she reminds cooks to add a sprinkling of
salt to bring out the flavors. If the tomatoes lack sweetness and
flavor, a splash of balsamic vinegar will bring out the sweetness
and acidity of the tomatoes, she advised. Another trick: If the
tomatoes aren't perfect, when making salads add a little honey to
the vinaigrette to bring out the sweetness of the tomatoes and give
viscosity to the dressing.
</P>
<P>
   High on her list of fast favorites with the duo is cooked pasta
tossed with cherry tomato halves, salt, balsamic vinegar, extra
virgin olive oil and a chiffonade of basil _ and topped with a
sprinkling of crispy bread crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   To hold on to those memories that taste of summer year 'round,
Weir turns her fresh tomato and basil crops into sauces and freezes
them. For best results, start with the most flavorful, luscious and
ripe tomatoes you can find. Weir opts to use a food mill to avoid
peeling, seeding and chopping the tomatoes prior to cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The classic pizza margherita and an Italian tomato and garlic
soup also rank at the top of good-eating tomato and basil
experiences for Weir. She also adores turning a traditional pesto
into a Sicilian specialty by adding chopped fresh tomatoes and then
using it on pasta and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Another tasty idea: Add some tomato paste or finely chopped
fresh tomatoes, a pinch of cayenne, a little paprika and some
chopped basil to store-bought mayonnaise and use as a spread on
tomato sandwiches. Bruschetta or crostini with chopped tomatoes,
basil, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt is divine, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even simpler is basil-infused oil (warm the oil, add chopped
fresh basil, then turn off and cool) poured over chopped cherry
tomatoes splashed with a few drops of red wine vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Weir's lifelong love affair with tomatoes started with tomato
sandwiches her mother served when she was 5 years old, she noted.
``I can still taste them _ toasted homemade bread, mayonnaise and
sliced tomatoes with a little sprinkling of salt.'' You can even
add a little onion, basil, dill or cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ibsen, author of the recently released ``The Great Tomato
Book,'' (Ten Speed Press; $14.95) is another tomato and basil fan.
He delights in using the combination in a tomato tower _ four
alternate layers of 1/4-inch thick slices of different colors of
heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese that are then
drizzled with basil-infused oil and presented in a shallow pond of
the oil.
</P>
<P>
   He also partners the two in basil tomato gelato (ice cream that
is sweet and refreshing with a hint of basil), salsas, Tuscan bread
salad, tortellini with basil balsamic vinaigrette and sauces that
he freezes to use all winter long. ``I can change the frozen sauce,
depending on the mood I'm in. Sometimes I add olives, anchovies,
more garlic and more fresh basil.''
</P>
<P>
   His basic sauce cooks together olive oil, unpeeled tomatoes
chopped in the food processor (squeeze out seeds first), fresh
garlic cloves, fresh basil, fresh parsley, a few red pepper flakes,
black pepper, fresh oregano, a dash each salt and sugar and fresh
ground thyme on top of the stove over low heat two hours.
</P>
<P>
   After the sauce has cooked, he noted, you'll end up with a layer
of water on the top. Remove the tomato sauce water and freeze it to
use as a base for cioppino, soups, etc. ``It's just as valuable as
the tomato sauce, which can be served as is or freshened up and
used as a foundation for other creations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen is so passionate about growing and loving tomatoes that he
founded TomatoFest, a tomato tasting festival that started out in
his back yard in Carmel eight years ago with friends and 20 chefs
bringing tomato creations and has since moved to Quail Lodge in
Carmel. This year's attendees will have an opportunity to sample
200 varieties of Ibsen's home-grown tomatoes along with tomato
dishes _ from appetizers and entrees to desserts _ created by 50
chefs from Central California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   During the harvest season, Ibsen drives around with tomatoes _
his jewels _ in his trunk. ``I pull them out and give them to
people I meet and friends. They're my gifts of the season and are
better than gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to jazz up your tomato and basil repertoire with
these ideas. &QL;

   TOMATO KISSEL AND VANILLA-BASIL CREAM
</P>
<P>
   This is an incredibly different soup. It's an ideal first-course
soup or a light dessert soup to finish a heavy dinner. But, either
way you enjoy it, like summer itself, it's pure ambrosia that's
sure to be talked about long after it's gone. This recipe is from
Jim Gallivan, Fess Parker's Wine Country Inn, Los Olivos, Calif.  &QL; 
4 cups fresh tomato juice OR canned tomato juice &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar OR to taste &QL; 
6 tablespoons potato flour &QL; 
1 pound yellow tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped &QL; 
1 pound red tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped &QL; 
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste &QL; 
Vanilla-Basil Cream
</P>
<P>
   Combine tomato juice and sugar in a medium saucepan over a
medium-low heat. (If tomato juice is sweet tasting, you won't need
more sugar. You don't want the kissel overly sweet.)
</P>
<P>
   Mix in potato flour. Stirring constantly, simmer about 5
minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in chopped tomatoes and
horseradish. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into a serving bowl and chill in refrigerator to allow
flavors to meld. Pour Vanilla-Basil Cream into a squirt bottle and
squirt a decorative squiggle of cream on top of each bowl of Tomato
Kissel. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   VANILLA-BASIL CREAM: In a blender or food processor, combine 1
cup low-fat cottage cheese, 1 cup low-fat yogurt, 1/3 cup powdered
sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup finely chopped basil
leaves. Blend until smooth. Store in an airtight food container in
refrigerator until ready to serve.

   &LR; PEAK-SEASON TOMATO SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   This is the sauce to make at the height of the season and freeze
in containers to use later in the year during tomato-less months.
Starting all of the ingredients in one pot at the same time is the
secret. Use any type of tomato except cherry tomatoes. Serve this
sauce with your favorite pasta.  &QL; 
4 pounds ripe plum tomatoes, cored and halved &QL; 
1 small red onion &QL; 
6 garlic cloves, halved &QL; 
3 sprigs fresh basil &QL; 
Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Place tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a
large pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to medium-high
and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes collapse, about 15
minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is thick, 1 to 1
1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pass sauce through a food mill fitted with finest blade. Season
to taste with salt and pepper, if necessary. Sauce can be
refrigerated 1 week or frozen 2 months. Makes about 4 cups.

   NUDITY-CHIC (Undated) _ Mark Hoppus, the singer and bassist of
Blink-182, says he has noted a marked increase in the amount of
female nudity in the audience at his concerts. He is not
complaining. Nudity is threatening to become mundane. By Frank
DeCaro.
</P>
<P>
   BEAUTY-JUNGLE (Undated) _ Most fashionable young editors at
places like Conde Nast and Hearst might be expected to wrinkle
their perfect noses at the thought of anyone _ much less themselves
_ hawking makeup on line. But how long can a girl sit back and
watch her college classmates, even the ones with no style at all,
make a killing on Internet IPO's? About as long as it takes mascara
to dry. This fall, more than a dozen well-financed Internet
start-ups will begin selling cosmetics directly to consumers on the
Web. Most of those sites will be shaped by former editors from the
top fashion and beauty magazines: places like Vogue, Elle and
Mirabella. By Nancy Hass.

   MOBSTER-CONSULTANT (New York) _ ``Here's where we shot `The Pope
of Greenwich Village,''' said Rocco Musacchia, a man whose stocky
build, dapper bearing and silk sports-jacket elicited gapes from
tourists at the sidewalk tables along Mulberry Street, in Little
Italy. ``Down the block, we shot `Mickey Blue Eyes,''' he
continued. ``And right over there we shot `Donnie Brasco.'''
Musacchia is a technical adviser for movie-location work. He was
talking about some of the films that he has worked on, and also
about certain New York City locations associated in both cinematic
legend and real life with the Mafia _ an organization he does not
concede exists. By Joe Sharkey.

   NY-SILICON-ALLEY (New York) _ Oh, to be young and wired in New
York _ and not just for the lavish parties. New York's Silicon
Alley, the digital neighborhood that is home to some of the
Internet's leading design concerns and Web sites, has long been in
the shadow of its software and hardware producing rivals out West.
But in the last year, there have been more IPO's here than anywhere
else in the country, as well as big media buyouts and a wave of
investment and media coverage. By Anthony Lappe.

   NITEOUT-LL-COOL (New York) _ Born James Todd Smith in Queens, LL
Cool J once boasted in song about having gone ``from Hollis to
Hollywood.'' On Tuesday night, he slipped unannounced into the
Loews 84th Street theater to watch his latest film, ``In Too
Deep,'' with what he called a ``real crowd,'' not the movie
industry insiders of Los Angeles. By Douglas Century.

<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ When they aren't complaining about the
weather, gardeners often like to whine about what awful things the
hybridizers have done to this or that venerable plant to make it
dwarfer or bushier or possessed of a color that does not exist
outside a child's crayon box. By Cass Peterson.

YOU MAY NOT SEE THEM, BUT THE COYOTE IS THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We tend to hear about them only when they get in trouble:
killing pet cats, harassing dogs, and _ in one shocking case in
July _ attacking a child on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   We may take squirrels and pigeons for granted, but never the
wily coyote, Canis latrans. The Northeast reportedly has among the
largest of these predators in the country, with traces of wolf in
our coyote stock.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to admire them, says Tom French, a wildlife biologist
with the Massachusetts Fish and Wildlife Department. The federal
government tried to exterminate coyotes _ trapping, poisoning, and
``throwing everything at them, including the kitchen sink,'' says
French, and yet ``they have thrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so adaptable, they have persevered. Once found
mainly out West, coyotes have been expanding both north and east
for 200 years. And as the wolf was exterminated at the turn of the
century, the coyote benefited. Today, they are found all over North
and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, fast, elusive, and _ above all _ resourceful, coyotes now
number in the thousands in Massachusetts. French uses words like
``ubiquitous'' and ``common'' to describe their numbers and
distribution. He reports they live _ and live well _ anywhere
between the mountains and the seashore. Sightings are common in
remote areas, but also now in urban spots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their numbers, it's not as though we bump into coyotes
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of coyotes' formula for success is that they are secretive.
They can pass right under our noses through suburban neighborhoods
and remain undetected. They are primarily crepuscular, active at
dusk and dawn. But their adaptability extends to all things,
including scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is their strong suit. They are opportunists with a
varied diet _ mice, rabbits, deer, grass, plants, berries, snakes,
insects, and carrion.
</P>
<P>
   Even their social structure is somewhat fluid. Coyotes can be
found alone or in groups of about five _ usually a mated pair and
offspring, sometimes more than one generation's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Though we may have the image of the solitary coyote from
Westerns, some mate for life. And both male and female help rear
their young.
</P>
<P>
   Their mating season is January to March, with pups born in the
spring after nine weeks of gestation. While adult coyotes aren't
picky about shelter most of the year _ a pawed-out depression to
curl up in will do _ dens for pups are required. Since they never
work when they don't have to, they usually just modify a badger or
woodchuck den. The pups, generally four to seven of them, are
weaned within about seven weeks; by fall, they may strike out on
their own or stay with their parents through another litter.
</P>
<P>
   In groups, coyotes are capable of bringing down large prey, such
as deer. When stalking small prey, they are patient, pouncing on
mice with their front feet at the first opportunity. But they will
also relentlessly pursue bigger game. Coyotes are said to be among
the fastest animals in North America, capable of running 38 miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Their senses of smell, hearing, and sight are extremely sharp _
they'll probably see you and make sure you don't see them. But if
you think you see one, here's what to look for: Coyotes are about 4
or 5 feet long from nose to tail tip, and a large male might hit 40
to 45 pounds, says French. They look a bit like a small German
shepherd, with bushy tails that have a black tip; pointy, erect
ears; a buff-gray coat; and a tawny muzzle, back, legs, and feet.
</P>
<P>
   They may be in your neighborhood for trash or to hunt. French
says he believes that coyotes go after cats as prey, but incidents
with dogs are more likely about territory. He maintains that a
coyote would really have to be hard up to attack something as tame
as a dog, a phenomenon that rarely occurs. In Massachusetts, where
wild mates are plentiful, it just doesn't happen at all.
</P>
<P>
   Like dogs, coyotes can live to be about 15 years old, but in the
wild, as many as half of young coyotes die before adulthood. Adults
often live only three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   During that time they can make a lot of noise. Unlike the wolf,
with its drawn-out, mournful call, coyotes tend to yip, yelp, and
yodel. They also indulge in group howls (for a quick pop of coyote
howl, try ngp.ngpc.state.ne.us/sounds/coyote.au).
</P>
<P>
   Should we fear the coyote? Biologists tell us it's best if they
fear us. French says it's important not to feed them. The coyote
who attacked the child on the Cape this summer ``blew away our
ability to say it doesn't happen,'' he cautions. While that animal
did have a broken leg that had healed, French believes that the
coyote may have been fed by somebody and had lost its fear of
humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charitable handout is the kiss of death,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, keep the cats in at night.

   VUK DRASKOVIC
</P>
<P>
   Leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, Draskovic is a
well-known writer and crowd-rousing speaker at street protests who
has tarnished his reputation as a reformer by appearing to flirt
with the Milosevic regime, even joining the government during the
NATO bombing until he was booted out for urging negotiations with
the West. His party controls Belgrade's city government, which
lends him power and funding for his presidential aspirations. But
his surprise appearance at a big mid-August rally he had said he
would skip drew loud boos.
</P>
<P>
   ZORAN DJINDJIC
</P>
<P>
   Leader of the Democratic Party, traditional home for Serbia's
reform-minded intellectuals, former philosophy professor Djindjic
is the most telegenic opposition figure. An excellent stump
speaker, he attracts support from the West as well as Serbia's
middle-classes, but doesn't appeal to the masses like the
emotional, mercurial Draskovic. He and Draskovic conduct a running,
bitter public quarrel at the expense of democratic unity, which
turns off
</P>
<P>
   younger democrats. He has vowed to quit politics if Milosevic is
still in power next year.
</P>
<P>
   GEN. MOMCILO PERESIC
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's former army chief, Gen. Peresic was fired by
Milosevic last year after accusing the government of pushing the
country into war with NATO and manipulating the army for political
gain. Not officially a candidate, Peresic retains close ties with
important military figures and is speaking out for democratic
changes. He is allied with the Movement for Democratic Serbia, an
umbrella for reformers and democrats formed only two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is seen as a thorough professional with little personal
ambition who talks of averting ``a new catastrophe'' _ meaning
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   VELIMIR ILIC
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Cacak, a central Serbian city where Milosevic's
socialists have always been unpopular, ``Velja'' Ilic is a
firebrand from a family of ``Chetniks,'' World War II guerrillas
who felt betrayed when the West threw its support to Tito's
Communist partisans. Forced into hiding during the NATO bombing for
``treasonous'' statements criticizing the Yugoslav army, he has
founded his own political party, New Serbia, and is confident that
democracy's _ and his _ time has come to oust ``the last of
Europe's communists.''

COOPERATION

 &HT;    By LAURENCE JOLIDON

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Although NATO's devastating air
bombardment re-arranged entire landscapes of this capital city, a
couple of salient facts important to Serbia's beleaguered and
frustrated democratic opposition remain firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   First, the leftist-nationalist coalition of their nemesis,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, still rules. He has even
begun taunting his foes with talk of early elections in November or
December, which _ without international supervision _ most
opposition parties believe would only extend his regime and sap
their energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Clinton administration's policy of using economic
isolation and bare humanitarian assistance to force Milosevic's
removal hasn't budged. That means little or no financial help for
the pro-democracy forces just as they are gearing up for a fall
campaign of rallies, civil disobedience and even a general strike
beginning in late September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a small window of opportunity, but no money,'' says
Miodrag Peresic, a Democratic Party founder. He is also a
strategist for the Council of Democratic Changes, an umbrella
organization trying to link Serbia's democratic activists,
politicians and intellectuals with the Serb-American diaspora in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial help is urgent. Our budgets are at an end,'' says
Maja Tasic of the Civic Alliance of Serbia, who believes one
pressing _ and expensive _ need is marketing a new image for
Serbia's democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Voters need to be convinced ``there are lots of new leaders and
heroes'' gaining ground here, she says, with a ``common goal'' of
setting bitterness (at NATO's intervention) aside and standing up
to Milosevic without the compromises and in-fighting of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Velimir Ilic, mayor of the anti-Milosevic stronghold of Cacak in
central Serbia and one of the opposition's new faces, is funding
his fledgling party, New Serbia, out of his own pocket. Hounded by
federal authorities during the bombing after accusing the Yugoslav
army of deliberately parking tanks in civilian areas, he was
well-received at an August 19 rally here that drew an estimated
150,000 protestors.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage rental alone was 14,000 (German) marks,'' Ilic said
(about US$10,000). The entire rally _ posters, leaflets, music,
buses, gasoline, etc. _ ran between US$20,000 and US$35,000. He and
the other two main sponsors split it three ways.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for fall is to hold such rallies every day, in a replay
of continuous protests over Milosevic's refusal to recognize
victories by democrats in local elections a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs money to engage in politics,'' says Ilic, ``even in a
country that's now officially the poorest in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tasic and Ilic were among a group of pro-democracy leaders who
met last week(CQ) in Montenegro with James Dobbins, the new U.S.
State Department point man for the Balkans. Ilic and other
opposition mayors want assistance from the West funneled directly
to their cities, to repair war-damaged bridges, factories and
services and help feed and house an estimated 200,000 ethnic Serbs
who've fled Kosovo province to escape ethnic Albanian
revenge-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   They are working from a target list of 32 cities and urban
districts represented by Serb opposition parties _ basically the
membership of the Association of Independent Cities _ but details
of how much aid and when it might arrive are still under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the $100 million the U.S. Congress has discussed furnishing
to U.S. non-governmental organizations _ little of which Serbian
democrats expect to ever see _ looks like a pittance to independent
economists here. They have gathered data on nearly $30 billion in
damages to the infrastructure of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic, from the alliance's 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of help isn't good enough,'' says economist Milko
Stimac. ``We need a half-billion (dollars) in direct aid, followed
by foreign investment that stays in the country'' to create an
economic environment where democracy can flourish.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S. policy of denying aid and maintaining sanctions
until the Serbs remove Milosevic, Stimac argues that ``it sounds
good, sounds pure . . . but it's really demagoguery. We didn't
elect Milosevic. He's a dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new parties and alliances like the Council for
Democratic Changes that sprang up in the wake of the NATO
intervention, there is growing sentiment that the Serb opposition's
traditional standard-bearers _ Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal
Party and Democratic Party president Zoran Djindjic _ have put
ambition above ideology. Further, many here worry that they have
spent their power to shake the regime or to inspire enough citizens
to march, speak out and organize against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem for us is that the opposition became part of
the government,'' said Lyuba Tadic, a popular actor and activist in
the Movement for Democratic Serbia, which has also recruited Gen.
Momcilo Peresic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff fired by
Milosevic for opposing his campaign to rid Kosovo of ethnic
Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, the regime destroyed this country, and
the opposition didn't do enough to stop them,'' Tadic said.
</P>
<P>
   Tadic's group is an example of post-modern political thinking
here. It is a ``movement,'' not a party, ``because people don't
like parties and there are already too many of them,'' said
Alexander Marinko, a former Democratic Party executive now working
in the Movement. And Gen. Peresic, the movement's president, is
``not a candidate saying he wants to be president'' because that is
seen as craven ambition, not democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of political struggle and tribal clashes among
opposition leaders, all apparently futile, has brought an air of
desperation to the democratic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the final moment,'' Marinko said. But as badly as he
wants to see Milosevic depart, the issue of how, and with whose
help, is still important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think democracy should be brought from inside the country,''
he said. Any suggestion that U.S. money was responsible for
undermining the current regime is ``very sensitive,'' and would
certainly be used to tar brush the democrats who accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Civic Alliance's Maja Tasic, who gets credit for
finally removing Milosevic isn't important _ even if it's an
American president who started the air campaign that took the lives
of some 1,500 Serb civilians, and kept the nighttime skies over her
country filled with bombs and Tomahawk missiles.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is ousted while Clinton is still in office, ``I
know the Democrats in America can say, 'See, that was always our
plan.'''
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't care if they do, ``because here it's not
politics anymore. Here, it's a matter of life or death.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a friend of mine used to say around here, nobody asked me,
but I was just thinking:
</P>
<P>
   Don't you feel relieved that Governor Cellucci is back from
vacation to take the reins over his administration's various
screwups?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Bill Weld's next novel about Massachusetts politics
will feature a steamy boat ride and low jinks at a high level?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think it's starting to sink in on the voters of Turkey
that their government should spend a little more on earth movers,
cranes, and backhoes, and less on jet fighters, heavy ordnance, and
military operations against Kurds?
</P>
<P>
   Does Boris Yeltsin actually watch old W.C. Fields movies, or
just run his government as if he's acting in one?
</P>
<P>
   Is it just me, or are you also surprised at how George W. Bush
spends more time talking about how ``when I was young and
irresponsible I was young and irresponsible'' than Senator John
McCain spends talking about nearly six years as guest of the North
Vietnamese POW hostelry?
</P>
<P>
   For those small and dwindling bands of Lamar Alexander fans out
there _ I remain one _ would you be interested in knowing how many
times he had been invited to appear on a weekend news show by CBS
and ABC over the last year and a half? Zero. Two of the so-called
Big Three never let the guy sit down and talk into the camera.
There's television journalism in action.
</P>
<P>
   Want to bet how many news programs CBS and ABC devoted to Lady
Monica in the same time frame? More than a hundred? Over 200? Who
cares? When your network talk-show scheduling is commandeered by
some 27-year-old who not only reads but believes the New York
tabloids and stays out every night till 3, that's what you get.
</P>
<P>
   With all the Republican candidates bowing and scraping in the
direction of their living legend, Ronald Reagan, am I the only one
waiting for one of the wannabes to glom on to Reagan's biggest
issue in 1980, when he really cemented his grip on the conservative
movement?
</P>
<P>
   What? You don't remember the issue? It was the Panama Canal:
``We built it, we own it, it's ours, and we're not going to give it
away.'' Our learned right-wing journals and foundations, not so
flush with ads and inheritance bequests then as they are today,
took up the cause, which helped demonize Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're ready to hand over the canal, lock, stock, and barrel
of H2O where the Atlantic meets the Pacific, and none of the
right-wingers are beefing. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   After a meltdown involving Gidget and MassPort, and tales of
groping and grappling elsewhere in the government, wasn't it
brilliant of Our Man Argeo to declare that his administration is
foursquare behind strong women?
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to class up his class-challenged crew, which has
tended toward the second-rate appointing the third-rate, Cellucci
settled hastily upon Margaret Marshall to head the Supreme Judicial
Court, elevating her from associate justice.
</P>
<P>
   She's a top-flight judge, but had two strikes against her with
the Cellucci crowd: one degree from Harvard and another from Yale,
to go along with the bachelor's from old W.U. What? Where's W.U.?
Why, as Cellucci tells people, everyone on Beacon Hill knows that
stands for Witwaterstrand University in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it nice that Cellucci's virtual ban on appointing any
judge with the handicap of having graduated from an Ivy League law
school is not official policy, just personal predilection on the
guv's part?
</P>
<P>
   Could that be another of these idiosyncratic inclinations of the
governor's? Do you think Bill Weld would fail to make the cut with
the Cellucci judge-pickers, whose first two dozen choices were all
non-Ivy?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the SJC, do you think the $19 million judgment they
just affirmed against Daimler Chrysler for a winter car wreck would
have been reinstated if the Germans hadn't bought Chrysler? I
dunno, just wondering.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci's faith that naming females to top jobs will
somehow absolve him of blame for the preceding screwups is touching
but misplaced. For a man who only last week discovered the PR value
of appointing women in the belief they are automatically competent,
I have two words: Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   By the way: Can someone let Governor Bystander know that the
state budget has been hung up for two months? The leaders of House
and Senate are palavering daily over the logjam. Boy, I bet if
Cellucci knew about this, he'd have something to say about it. I
bet he'd appoint a strong woman to study the problem, do you think?
</P>
<P>
   Any chance that this Internet thing may have peaked? We may have
approached saturation with word this week that there are two
lobsters in a trap off Spruce Head in Maine with their own Web
site, and Lobstercam, broadcasting live video of the pair hanging
out in the briny deep. Don't take my word for it. Check out the
University of Maine's Lobster Institute at
www.lobster.um.maine.edu/lobster/.
</P>
<P>
   When a pair of crustaceans piles up nearly a thousand hits a day
for their first eight weeks on the Web, somebody out there has too
much time on their hands, to my way of thinking.

JESSE JACKSON SAYS BUSH SHOULD ANSWER DRUG QUESTION

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday that Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, should
answer questions about any past illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the issue of past use of cocaine is a relevant
question for anyone running for public office because using cocaine
is illegal. Noting that Bush has toughened his state's anti-drug
laws as governor, Jackson said a majority of the 149,000 people in
Texas prisons are serving time for non-violent drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot say it's not the business of the press when it's
public policy,'' Jackson said. ``You cannot enforce a law you did
not adhere to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined to answer questions about any past drug use,
often attempting to end such lines of inquiry by quipping: ``When I
was young and crazy, I was young and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson dismissed that tack and told reporters, ``There is no
place in the law for youthful indiscretions and possession and
consumption of cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Bush signed a law requiring Texas state judges to
sentence people convicted of possessing a gram or less of cocaine
to a minimum of 180 days in jail. Under old law, first-time drug
offenders caught with less than a gram of cocaine where given
automatic probation with drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush admits he has used cocaine he will be admitting he has
violated both state and federal laws. But Jackson said any such
admission shouldn't stop Bush from pursuing the Republican party's
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a shame to lose a talent of this capacity on that
question,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush should use the opportunity to campaign for a
loosening of state and federal drug laws that have caused thousands
of first-time and repeat non-violent drug users to be imprisoned in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the controversy surrounding Bush, ``there is renewed
discussion'' of relaxing some state and federal laws involving drug
use, Jackson said. ``The same people who have been saying throw
away the key, zero-tolerance and three strikes are now saying let's
look at this thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said many state and federal drug laws are ``too
extreme'' and that people who use drugs should be given treatment
rather than being thrown in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a rich favorite son who is now caught in a poor man's
trap,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he believes Bush will eventually be forced to
either admit he has used drugs in the past or deny such use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said Bush opened himself up to questions about drug
use by telling reporters that he has been faithful to his wife and
that he quit drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have it both ways,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's policy of declining to answer drug questions has recently
begun to frazzle.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18 Bush told reporters he could pass an FBI background
check used for presidential appointees that investigates whether a
person has used illegal drugs in the past seven years. That would
indicate that Bush was denying any drug use since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Bush, in response to more news media questions
about drug use, said he could pass a White House background check
going back to 1974. That would indicate that the 53-year-old Bush
was denying any drug use since he was 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   So far Bush has refused to answer any questions about whether he
used illegal drugs before age 28.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican presidential candidates have said Bush needs to
address that question.
</P>
<P>
   However, a majority of the Republican party's 50 state chairmen
and women polled by Hearst Newspapers this week said Bush should
refuse to elaborate further on the drug issue. Twenty-six of the 50
state leaders said Bush should stop answering questions about drug
use, four chairs said he should answer such questions completely
and the rest either refused comment or did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1984 and 1988, said he has never used illegal drugs.

GARDEN COLUMN: HYBRID LILIES _ SO MUCH MORE THAN A NOVELTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: For release Sunday, Aug. 29.) 
(th) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they aren't complaining about the weather, gardeners often
like to whine about what awful things the hybridizers have done to
this or that venerable plant to make it smaller or bushier or
possessed of a color that does not exist outside a child's crayon
box.
</P>
<P>
   I've done my share of kvetching along these lines, usually
venting my distaste for novelty items like those grotesque
sunflowers that sport 10-inch flowers atop 14-inch stems. The fact
that it is possible to so contort a plant is no justification for
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll never hear me complain about hybrid lilies. Asiatic,
Aurelian and Oriental hybrids bloom from June through late August
in my garden, in clumps that get larger and more impressive every
year.
</P>
<P>
   I bought my first hybrid lilies _ a dozen fat bulbs of the
Asiatic lily Enchantment _ almost two decades ago. I've moved the
bed several times since, and offspring of those first bulbs are
still making dazzling patches of vivid orange flowers every June.
</P>
<P>
   Enchantment was the first hybrid lily, created by Jan de Graaff
of Oregon in the 1950s. It was also the first lily to bear its
flowers upright, rather than on drooping stems or facing outward on
stiff stems. The cut-flower industry loved this feature, because it
made it possible to ship lilies on the stem. Cut lilies with
outward-facing or drooping blossoms were almost impossible to pack
for shipping without breaking off buds and blooms.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the new hybrids as cut flowers encouraged
wide-scale propagation by tissue-culture techniques, or cloning
from as little as a single cell, which was much faster and more
reliable than propagating from seeds, offsets or pieces of the bulb
called scales. Suddenly, glorious lilies were both easy to get and
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular hybrids for the garden are still the Asiatics,
which grow 4 feet tall or slightly taller on stout stems that
rarely require staking. Enchantment remains one of the best, but it
is rivaled for popularity by the sunny yellow Connecticut King,
soft pink Monta Rosa, red Gran Paradiso and dozens of others in
almost every color except blue.
</P>
<P>
   Asiatics begin blooming in early June in my south-central
Pennsylvania garden, and the display lasts about a month. When the
Asiatics begin to decline, the Aurelians take over.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelian lilies are hybrids derived from crosses between
Asiatics and other lily species, including Lilium formosanum.
They're commonly known as trumpet lilies, and generally grow taller
than the Asiatic hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is one called Black Dragon, which bears as many as
20 drooping, trumpet-shaped blooms on 6-foot stems. The flowers are
clear white inside with a yellow throat, and overlaid with maroon
on the outside. The blooms are so powerfully scented that a single
stem perfumes the entire house.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental hybrids, created from a cross between L. auratum and L.
speciosum, produce the massive, bowl-shaped blossoms that star in
high-priced floral arrangements. Among the most popular are the
all-white Casa Blanca and pink Mona Lisa, as well as Star Gazer,
pink with red stippling. The Orientals bloom late on 4- to 5-foot
stems, extending the lily season well into August.
</P>
<P>
   Still another class, yet to be introduced to my garden, are the
Orienpets, a more recent cross between the trumpet and the Oriental
hybrids. They are said to bloom even later than the Orientals, on
even taller stems.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, hybrid lilies are easy to grow in full sun, or
preferably in a spot that gets a little afternoon shade. Lilies
don't require particularly rich soil, but it must be well drained.
If you have a boggy spot in the garden, you can plant meadow lilies
(L. canadense) or Turk's-cap lilies (L. superbum) there, but no
other lilies will tolerate wet feet.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to plant lilies in autumn, and fortunately it's easier
to get the bulbs in the fall than it used to be. Before
tissue-culture propagation came along, lily bulbs were generally
field-grown, dug in late autumn after the foliage dried and then
put in storage for sale the following season.
</P>
<P>
   Lily bulbs never go completely dormant, so excellent storage
conditions were necessary to keep them in good condition. My many
disappointments with species lilies years ago might have been my
fault, but there's at least an even chance that the bulbs I bought
in past springs in little bags at the garden center were dead when
I paid for them.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, bulbs should be planted three times as deep as the
height of the bulb. Because lilies shouldn't be moved or divided
more often than every five years or so, planting them at the right
depth to start with is critical. The hybrids will produce roots
along their buried stem, as well as from the base of the bulb, so
it is better to err on the side of too deep than on that of too
shallow.
</P>
<P>
   Lilies like cool roots, so mulching them or overplanting the
lily bed with a ground cover is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   When the lilies are done blooming, cut off the flower head just
below the bottom bloom, leaving as much of the foliage as possible
to feed the bulb. In autumn, when the foliage is completely brown,
cut it off at ground level to keep winter moisture from entering
the hollow stem and rotting the bulb.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to divide the lilies, remove any loose scales
from the mother bulbs, and plant them. They'll produce
blooming-size plants in a couple of years. Though they may have
been produced by modern tissue-culture techniques, hybrid lilies
can still be propagated the old-fashioned way, which is more than I
can say for those awful squatty sunflowers.

   As the ghastly scale of the death toll in Turkey's earthquake
became apparent in the days after the tremor, so did the tardiness
of the official rescue and relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock and grief of last week, the predominant
sentiment in Turkey this week was anger. Anger at the government
for not reacting swiftly enough to rescue and help survivors. Anger
at the army for not pulling into action sooner. And anger at the
country's bureaucrats for allowing the poorly constructed
buildings, which crumbled like sand castles, to have been put up in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this anger is properly directed. But some of it could
lead to the wrong conclusions about how to avoid such appalling
loss of life _ 13,000 dead by the middle of this week, with many
thousands more believed dead under the rubble _ next time.
</P>
<P>
   It seems incredible that Turkey, which sits on a geological
fault line, had no dedicated rescue team. Not only did the
government fail to train and equip such a force, it also failed to
mobilize the one institution whose strength and discipline are
legendary: the army.
</P>
<P>
   As skilled foreign technicians bored, chiselled and hacked their
way into the mounds of compacted debris, and as Turkish volunteers
ferried in food and dug desperately with their own machinery, tools
and hands, their government froze.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Saturday, fully four days after the quake, that
the army _ admittedly reeling from casualties of its own _ went
into action.
</P>
<P>
   For these two failures, the blame lies squarely with the
government. More complicated, however, is the matter of the flimsy
buildings, a big contributor to the heavy death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comment since the quake, both in Turkey and the
West, has centered on the need for tougher regulation of the
building industry. In the aftermath of such a catastrophe, that is
an easy demand to make. But Turkey had building regulations: they
were evaded (with official collusion) or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is more effective regulation, which is a
different and more difficult thing.
</P>
<P>
   If rules are to prevent the shoddy and reckless work that has
cost many lives _ blocks built on shallow foundations, cement mixed
with too much sand _ they must be designed so that they are
feasible both to obey and to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that were merely ``tougher'' could be quickly
introduced, but in all likelihood would be neither.
</P>
<P>
   There is another problem. The lessons from the earthquakes in
Los Angeles in 1994 (54 deaths) and Kobe, Japan, in 1995 (6,500
deaths) suggest that _ other things being equal _ the critical
factor determining the death toll is the nature of the building
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Weight is the killer: Turks were crushed by the collapsing
structures above their heads. In Japan, heavy-roofed buildings put
up to withstand the frequent typhoons also proved lethal. In
California, timber-framed houses with light roofs, bolted to a
concrete foundation, rode out the tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Before Turkey and foreign well-wishers rush to rebuild heavy
high-rise cement buildings, they might do well to consider
old-fashioned timber.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, of course, that all things are far from equal. The
harsh and unavoidable fact is that natural disasters kill more
people in poor countries than they do in rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy construction is one of the deprivations of poverty. And
though the poor world has no monopoly of bureaucratic corruption,
enforcing rules designed to make buildings safer (and dearer) will
always be easier in countries that are richer and which have more
accountable governments.
</P>
<P>
   This week's outburst of popular Turkish anger at their state for
failing them has been startling. Could it become a force for
change?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, if it prompts more of the humility shown by at least
one member of the government this week _ and if this translates
into a willingness to allow greater openness and freedom in Turkey,
even in ways that challenge the secular creed bequeathed by Kemal
Ataturk in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Turkey's best prospects of becoming a better
governed and more prosperous place may lie in the embrace of the
European Union. Here too some hope emerges from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments have repeatedly snubbed Turkey, refusing to take
seriously its hope of membership and huddling conveniently behind
the objections of its old antagonist, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Eventual Turkish membership would be a matter for delicate
negotiation. But the generous hand held out to Turkey by Greece
this week offers a hope that objections to opening such talks may
yet be overcome. &QL;

   As the ghastly scale of the death toll in Turkey's earthquake
became apparent in the days after the tremor, so did the tardiness
of the official rescue and relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock and grief of last week, the predominant
sentiment in Turkey this week was anger. Anger at the government
for not reacting swiftly enough to rescue and help survivors. Anger
at the army for not pulling into action sooner. And anger at the
country's bureaucrats for allowing the poorly constructed
buildings, which crumbled like sand castles, to have been put up in
the first place.

<P>
   They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work. This half-serious
summary of communist economics contained a kernel of truth: for
Soviet workers, the freedom to pilfer and dawdle made up, to some
extent, for empty shelves and wretched wages.
</P>
<P>
   Like other illusions, it served a purpose for a while, though
that could not last.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet collapse, a different sort of illusion about
the Russian economy has been cultivated in western capitals as well
as in Moscow: ``You Russians pretend to be creating a law-based,
market-friendly liberal democracy. We westerners pretend to believe
you _ and what's more, we pay you for it.''
</P>
<P>
   This new fiction has also served a purpose. By fostering a
climate of determined optimism, both the American and Russian
governments persuaded voters and skeptical legislators that the
promised land of prosperity and reform was just around the corner.
That was politically expedient.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its virtues, the post-communist illusion was
likewise doomed to be shattered _ if only because Russians and
Americans had such different expectations about the ``promised
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans were led to believe that, for an outlay of a few
billion dollars, Russia could be transformed into a country in
their own image: open to American business and cooperative with
American diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Russians were encouraged to think they could enjoy the benefits
of a market economy without the hard slog; and that economic
strength would enable them to flex their muscles, and defy America,
on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Any remaining illusions about the efficacy of western-backed
reform in Russia have been evaporating over the past few weeks with
exceptional speed. Soon there may be nothing left of them, and
Russian-western relations will have to be rethought from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow could be the broadening probe by America's
federal authorities into one of the largest money-laundering
scandals they have ever uncovered: the apparent use of accounts at
the Bank of New York, as well as at several European banks, to
process about $10 billion in ill-gotten Russian gains.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also want to know whether the Bank of New York
was one of a chain of banks through which at least $200 million may
have been diverted from credits granted to Russia by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   This follows an acknowledgment by the Russian central bank that
it channelled tens of billions of dollars, including money received
from the IMF, into a shadowy offshore company in Jersey _ which
then speculated in a lucrative government-bond market that the
central bank was supposed to be regulating.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's admission that ``we were lied to'' by the Russian
central bank about the location of $1 billion in foreign-exchange
reserves in 1996 has done nothing to allay the suspicion that worse
happened both before and after.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's odder political alliances, American
Republicans and Russian Communists are questioning the IMF's $4.8
billion emergency payout to Russia last year. This failed in its
stated aim of shoring up the ruble and probably provided windfall
profits for Russia's financial oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   With elections looming in both Russia and America, skeletons may
come tumbling out of cupboards at a faster pace than anyone in the
Kremlin or the White House can control.
</P>
<P>
   Far from ``civilizing'' the wreckage of the Soviet economy,
economic transactions between Russia and the West are running the
risk of corrupting the western side, if only by forcing it to wink
at practices that would be outlawed in more established economies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a particular irony in the fact that one western party
is the IMF, whose stated purpose is to propagate the virtues of
sound economic policy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IMF's integrity has been compromised, the cause does
not lie in its own sloppy controls; it lies in the collusion of the
American and Russian governments to cover up failures and press the
Fund into treating Russia with greater generosity than its economic
performance would warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The fibbing cannot go on forever, if only because both Russia
(however imperfectly) and America are lively and rambunctious
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration should clear the air and admit some
hard truths about western policy towards Russia. The real aim is
not to create ideal outcomes, but to avert catastrophe: a hard-line
coup, a civil war, a nuclear leak.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding disaster in a country with tens of thousands of nuclear
warheads is undeniably a worthy aim of policy. But if this is the
main purpose of credits to Russia, then America and other western
nations had far better say so rather than pretend to be rewarding
Russia for its government's less-than-impressive economic
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that western governments should be prepared to
take responsibility for whatever emergency aid they give to Russia,
rather than force the IMF to engage in games of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   A policy based explicitly on saving Russia from self-destruction
carries risks too: it creates an incentive for Russia's rulers to
engineer situations that are fractionally short of disastrous, and
then extort credits from the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if western governments suspect the Russian government of
playing this game, they should voice their suspicions _ and make
sure the Russian electorate gets the message. That is better than
conspiring with the Kremlin to deceive voters in both countries. &QL;

<P>
   ``If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood
what I said,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, once told a congressman. Wall Street, however, finds the
Fed's message clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market shrugged off the Fed's quarter-point increase
in interest rates, to 5.25 percent, on Aug. 24 _ just as it had the
Fed's previous rate rise two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing interest rates so timidly, the Fed is allowing
investors to believe that each rate rise may be the last. This
belief is dangerously misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic expansion is now 101 months old, and, like
many Americans this summer, the economy is looking uncomfortably
hot. Even if you believed that the country's potential growth rate
had risen thanks to faster productivity growth, its current pace
would still be unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market is getting ever tighter, with widespread
reports of labor shortages; wage inflation is starting to pick up.
The much-touted slowdown in GDP growth in the second quarter
largely reflected a drop in stock-building, which may rebound in
the second half of the year as firms cushion themselves against the
risks posed by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent figures bear out fears that growth in domestic
demand remains too strong. Consumer spending is being fuelled both
by rising share prices and by a borrowing spree. Robust demand is
also sucking in imports, pushing the trade deficit to a record
level in June.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that consumer-price inflation remains relatively
subdued, at 2.1 percent in July, but it is a mistake to take too
much comfort from this lagging indicator when so many other
forward-looking ones are flashing red.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a mistake to turn a blind eye to other worrying
imbalances in the economy. The Economist has long been fretting
about America's financial bubble. But it is not just the level of
share prices that gives sleepless nights; it is also the fact that
it has been accompanied by mushrooming consumer and corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
   Negative personal savings and the increase in the private-sector
financial deficit to a record 5 percent of GDP all point the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Spending cannot increase faster than income forever. Faced with
this truism, a prudent central bank would have tightened policy
more aggressively by now. Yet even after this week's rise, American
short-term interest rates are still a quarter of a point lower than
they were a year ago, before the Fed eased in response to the
financial jitters caused by Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   Since inflation has edged up over that period, nominal rates
would need to rise to around 6 percent merely to take real interest
rates back to their level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So long as a buoyant stock market and rampant credit expansion
continue to boost growth, it will take more than a few small
interest-rate rises to slow America's boom. Indeed, such timid
moves may falsely reassure Wall Street that the Fed has everything
safely under control _ encouraging the stock market to ever giddier
heights.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the rest of the world economy, which was a
big concern a year ago, has also perked up. Not only has this put
upward pressure on oil prices, it has also made the dollar less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   America's current-account deficit is likely to widen to almost 4
percent of GDP this year. If foreigners' appetite for dollar assets
wanes, the dollar could tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the dollar's strength over the past two years has helped
to hold down American inflation, any weakening would have the
reverse effect, pushing up import prices.
</P>
<P>
   A vulnerable dollar, a stock market that on most measures looks
hugely overvalued, a monstrous overhang of personal and corporate
debt: all combine to make it more likely that America's boom will
end in a hard landing.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this will test the revered (if opaque) Greenspan to the
limit. But his dilemma is largely of his own making: it reflects a
failure to tackle America's economic imbalances earlier, before
they had become so severe. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The stir over whether George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has
used cocaine is not the first and will not be the last example of
America's unique ferocity in testing its elected politicians to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before the country takes another lurch towards regarding moral
ambiguity as a disqualification from office, it makes sense to ask:
which questions are legitimate for voters to ask? Which aren't?
</P>
<P>
   Private matters become public depending on what a candidate says
and the nature of the question in hand. For example, adultery in
itself is not a legitimate matter of electoral scrutiny. It becomes
one if a politician, rather than remaining silent on the subject,
proclaims his fidelity or makes great play of ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to speak out is vital because voters have a right
to know whether somebody is lying, and a lie about a personal
matter is a valid gauge of truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Many people argued during the Monica Lewinsky affair that Bill
Clinton was justified in lying in public because it was a private
matter, and anyone would tell lies to protect their marriage. But
lying in public means deceiving the voters and is a legitimate
matter for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's willingness to speak out also helps decide how far
back enquiry can reasonably go. If he or she talks about the
distant past, it opens that period up to legitimate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, that means the past 25 years, the period he says
he has not taken drugs. So far, there is no evidence that he is
telling lies _ and no one has come forward with accusations about
his behavior. On these grounds, then, voters ought to be satisfied
with his answers so far.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the issue also matters. Not all actions deserve
the same degree of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, many people have argued that, since possession of
cocaine is a felony, Bush should reassure voters that he has never,
ever, taken coke.
</P>
<P>
   His friends might reply that, when it comes to setting a
political statute of limitations, there are different kinds of
offense. A crime of violence, for example, is worse than possession
of cocaine, even though both are felonies.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that Bush's incomplete statements reflect a wider
ambivalence in the public attitude towards drugs. Since so many
Americans have taken them, they are more tolerant of this
particular felony than of others.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Lewinsky affair, journalists have justified
any and all enquiries on the grounds that, because candidates have
been talking about restoring the honor and dignity of the
presidency, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems to disagree. But even if a candidate is not
lying, and even if the issue might not justify public scrutiny,
there remains a further test: voters are entitled to ask whether a
candidate is a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, two questions about double standards were
pertinent. First, could he pass the background drugs tests required
of federal employees? Second, and more significant, did his
personal history invalidate his policies towards drugs?
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush has approved a law that allows judges
to imprison people convicted of selling or possessing less than one
gram of cocaine. In the United States, thousands are in jail for
this, some as young as 14.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a minute that he had sniffed cocaine before he was
24. Would it be wrong of him to support mandatory jail sentences
for young cocaine users now?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should be able to change their minds in good faith,
and voters should be willing to let them. Bush ought to be allowed
to say that he has learned from his mistakes and has concluded that
tough anti-drugs laws work (mistaken as he may be about that).
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly have been more convincing if he had said that
he had used cocaine, that that was the temper of the times and it
was this experience which had persuaded him of the need for tough
anti-drugs policies. But he has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simply refuses to confirm or deny. He has chosen to be less
than candid. It is indeed a kind of hypocrisy _ one with which the
American public, not for the first time, seems happy to go along. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The stir over whether George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has
used cocaine is not the first and will not be the last example of
America's unique ferocity in testing its elected politicians to
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before the country takes another lurch towards regarding moral
ambiguity as a disqualification from office, it makes sense to ask:
which questions are legitimate for voters to ask? Which aren't?
</P>
<P>
   Private matters become public depending on what a candidate says
and the nature of the question in hand. For example, adultery in
itself is not a legitimate matter of electoral scrutiny. It becomes
one if a politician, rather than remaining silent on the subject,
proclaims his fidelity or makes great play of ``family values.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to speak out is vital because voters have a right
to know whether somebody is lying, and a lie about a personal
matter is a valid gauge of truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Many people argued during the Monica Lewinsky affair that Bill
Clinton was justified in lying in public because it was a private
matter, and anyone would tell lies to protect their marriage. But
lying in public means deceiving the voters and is a legitimate
matter for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's willingness to speak out also helps decide how far
back enquiry can reasonably go. If he or she talks about the
distant past, it opens that period up to legitimate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, that means the past 25 years, the period he says
he has not taken drugs. So far, there is no evidence that he is
telling lies _ and no one has come forward with accusations about
his behavior. On these grounds, then, voters ought to be satisfied
with his answers so far.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the issue also matters. Not all actions deserve
the same degree of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, many people have argued that, since possession of
cocaine is a felony, Bush should reassure voters that he has never,
ever, taken coke.
</P>
<P>
   His friends might reply that, when it comes to setting a
political statute of limitations, there are different kinds of
offense. A crime of violence, for example, is worse than possession
of cocaine, even though both are felonies.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that Bush's incomplete statements reflect a wider
ambivalence in the public attitude towards drugs. Since so many
Americans have taken them, they are more tolerant of this
particular felony than of others.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Lewinsky affair, journalists have justified
any and all enquiries on the grounds that, because candidates have
been talking about restoring the honor and dignity of the
presidency, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems to disagree. But even if a candidate is not
lying, and even if the issue might not justify public scrutiny,
there remains a further test: voters are entitled to ask whether a
candidate is a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's case, two questions about double standards were
pertinent. First, could he pass the background drugs tests required
of federal employees? Second, and more significant, did his
personal history invalidate his policies towards drugs?
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush has approved a law that allows judges
to imprison people convicted of selling or possessing less than one
gram of cocaine. In the United States, thousands are in jail for
this, some as young as 14.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a minute that he had sniffed cocaine before he was
24. Would it be wrong of him to support mandatory jail sentences
for young cocaine users now?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should be able to change their minds in good faith,
and voters should be willing to let them. Bush ought to be allowed
to say that he has learned from his mistakes and has concluded that
tough anti-drugs laws work (mistaken as he may be about that).
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly have been more convincing if he had said that
he had used cocaine, that that was the temper of the times and it
was this experience which had persuaded him of the need for tough
anti-drugs policies. But he has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simply refuses to confirm or deny. He has chosen to be less
than candid. It is indeed a kind of hypocrisy _ one with which the
American public, not for the first time, seems happy to go along. &QL;

   DES MOINES, IOWA _ ``I am convinced from evidence in our house
that my husband listened to the grain markets at noon, as he
usually did, heard them go lower, and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enclosed a copy of the letter he left me. It reads:
`The only thing I will regret is leaving (the children) and you.
This farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy, but most
of all grief. All I ever wanted was to farm since I was a little
kid, and especially this place. I know now that is never going to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   This stark letter, written by a farmer's widow to the governor
of Iowa, is an extreme expression of the most severe agricultural
downturn in America since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Iowa State Fair, one of the country's
agricultural showpieces, the talk is gloomy. ``It's the start of
the end of family farming. We can't cover our costs and many will
go to the wall,'' says Leland Fynaardt, of Searsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Severin of Lowden agrees. ``The big guys are coming into
this business,'' he says, while staring bleakly at Rumpelstiltskin,
the winner of the fattest pig in the fair (487 kilos, or 1,071
pounds), who looks like a pink zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are squeezing the heck out of the small farmer and the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the same message is blaring forth: ``It is
not an overstatement to say,'' declares Byron Dorgan, the
Democratic senator from North Dakota, ``that we are approaching the
end-game for family-based agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, it would be a huge change in what is still
America's second-largest exporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, family farms _ a few hundred acres looked after by
a man, his wife and their sons _ have been the weft and weave of
the Midwest. But is family farming really dying?
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic view of one family, with some corn, a few cows,
pigs and chickens on 200 acres _ that died out in the 1960s,'' says
Ray Bardole, who farms 1,400 acres (560 hectares) in Rippey, in
central Iowa's billowing landscape of black earth and waving corn.
</P>
<P>
   He is right: since 1950, the number of farms has fallen from 5.6
million to 2.2 million. Thousands of farmers continue to leave the
land every year, responding to technological changes that have
doubled agricultural productivity over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are different this year. There are unnerving
parallels with the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, which gutted
communities throughout the central states.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, three years of good weather produced bumper crops,
and deep price falls when demand fell in world markets at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been worse. Soybean farmers are harvesting their
third record crop in a row, even while prices have hit their lowest
since 1972, about $4 a bushel. This is less than most farmers' cost
of production. Two years ago, soybeans fetched $8 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in meat prices has been even more dramatic. Last year,
the pork price fell to just $8 a hundredweight. This was even less
than during the Great Depression and a third of the cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Some family farmers will not survive for long. Bankers in the
Midwest are already asking for next year's financial plan even
before this year's harvest is in.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have only survived this long because, in one respect,
they are better off than during the 1980s crisis. Then, the
increase in farm incomes in earlier years had bid up the price of
land, which in parts of Iowa trebled to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the farm woes occurred when the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates to cool off the Reagan expansion, making it
impossible for thousands of farmers to service the debts they had
taken out to buy land at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed raised interest rates this week, farmers'
financing costs are still low compared with what they were in the
1980s. Then farmers' debt-service costs were around 14 percent of
production expenses; they are now 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, then, farmers are in better shape than they were
the last time things got really tough. Still, with prices so low a
renewed shakeout is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1987, the number of farms fell by 250,000. If
the same thing were to happen again, the number would fall to 1.94
million by 2005 _ a 12 percent decline in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of most industries, that would count as a
modest decline. But farmers are not like most other workers _ their
way of life, self-respect and sense of identity are often
intimately entwined with their job.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even those that remain on the land fret that the
relentless growth of corporate farming will leave them as little
more than hired tractor-drivers, a prospect most find humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilbert of the Iowa Farmers' Union explains: ``Turkey and
eggs used to be an essential part of diversified farming. It was
how you learned the business. That's been taken over by one or two
processors. Then came beef. Now three or four packers buy most of
the cattle. Everyone thought it would never happen to pigs. They
were too diversified and easy to raise. But look at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the pig industry has been transformed. Family
pig farms in Iowa, the main hog-producing state (and the
second-largest farm state after California), used to have up to 500
sows, each producing about 20 piglets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, industrial-scale pig warehouses are appearing, with 16,000
sows raising 320,000 piglets a year. The stench from these huge
battery pig farms spreads for miles. But they are only the most
visible and smelliest evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the way in which pigs are marketed. Where
family farmers used to take their piglets straight to market, they
now raise them on behalf of the large warehouse farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a tenth of America's pigs were raised in this
way, under contract. Now two thirds are.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contract-farming system that the family owners now
fear as much as bankruptcy. They have seen poultry, beef, and pig
farming swallowed by the system. The next domino to fall could be
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the firms involved in agriculture, the largest are
already the grain traders and seed producers, most of the latter
owned by big chemical firms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,500) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Last year, Cargill, one big firm, bought the grain-trading
operations of another, Continental. For many, this exemplified the
trend toward greater concentration and monopoly purchasing
threatening farmers. They fear being crushed between these
corporate millstones, and that the big companies will then buy up
their farms.
</P>
<P>
   That is possible. But the pattern of rapidly increasing
consolidation is not quite the unstoppable, Darwinist expansion
that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is nothing relentless or rapid about the
growth of the biggest beef companies. Although a few big firms
dominate slaughtering, it took them 30 years to get to the point
where they slaughter about two-thirds of all cattle, and they still
have only about 22-24 percent of cattle under contract. That share
has been stable for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is nothing mysterious about the rise of these
operations. They succeed where they have a price advantage, as in
the pork business, where superior feeding, veterinary and other
techniques are important. But they do not have this advantage
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, calf raising, which is largely a matter of looking
after cows and calves as they forage, is run by small farmers. It
seems likely that the family grain farms are more like the
calf-foraging operations than the pork factories.
</P>
<P>
   There is no obvious advantage to size. A typical Midwestern
grain farm is roughly the acreage that one family can farm.
Improvements to tractors or fertilizers make it possible for one
person to look after a slightly larger area each year, so farms get
bigger and a few more people leave.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no technological gain to dramatic increases in
scale. So family farms should survive. But not unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bardole shows how they are changing. His farm provides an
income for himself and his family, and his two sons and their
families. About half the money comes from soybeans and corn. But
one daughter-in-law works in a day-care center; one is a speech
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   He runs a pig nursery for a large hog producer. He rents out a
special piece of farm-drilling equipment. And about half of his
soybeans are grown under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I use contract farming as a tool,'' he concludes,
``it's a good deal. If a big company is using me as a tool, then
it's a problem.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, IOWA _ ``I am convinced from evidence in our house
that my husband listened to the grain markets at noon, as he
usually did, heard them go lower, and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enclosed a copy of the letter he left me. It reads:
`The only thing I will regret is leaving (the children) and you.
This farming has brought me a lot of memories, some happy, but most
of all grief. All I ever wanted was to farm since I was a little
kid, and especially this place. I know now that is never going to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   This stark letter, written by a farmer's widow to the governor
of Iowa, is an extreme expression of the most severe agricultural
downturn in America since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Iowa State Fair, one of the country's
agricultural showpieces, the talk is gloomy. ``It's the start of
the end of family farming. We can't cover our costs and many will
go to the wall,'' says Leland Fynaardt, of Searsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Severin of Lowden agrees. ``The big guys are coming into
this business,'' he says, while staring bleakly at Rumpelstiltskin,
the winner of the fattest pig in the fair (487 kilos, or 1,071
pounds), who looks like a pink zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are squeezing the heck out of the small farmer and the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, the same message is blaring forth: ``It is
not an overstatement to say,'' declares Byron Dorgan, the
Democratic senator from North Dakota, ``that we are approaching the
end-game for family-based agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were true, it would be a huge change in what is still
America's second-largest exporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, family farms _ a few hundred acres looked after by
a man, his wife and their sons _ have been the weft and weave of
the Midwest. But is family farming really dying?
</P>
<P>
   ``The romantic view of one family, with some corn, a few cows,
pigs and chickens on 200 acres _ that died out in the 1960s,'' says
Ray Bardole, who farms 1,400 acres (560 hectares) in Rippey, in
central Iowa's billowing landscape of black earth and waving corn.
</P>
<P>
   He is right: since 1950, the number of farms has fallen from 5.6
million to 2.2 million. Thousands of farmers continue to leave the
land every year, responding to technological changes that have
doubled agricultural productivity over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are different this year. There are unnerving
parallels with the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, which gutted
communities throughout the central states.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, three years of good weather produced bumper crops,
and deep price falls when demand fell in world markets at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been worse. Soybean farmers are harvesting their
third record crop in a row, even while prices have hit their lowest
since 1972, about $4 a bushel. This is less than most farmers' cost
of production. Two years ago, soybeans fetched $8 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in meat prices has been even more dramatic. Last year,
the pork price fell to just $8 a hundredweight. This was even less
than during the Great Depression and a third of the cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Some family farmers will not survive for long. Bankers in the
Midwest are already asking for next year's financial plan even
before this year's harvest is in.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have only survived this long because, in one respect,
they are better off than during the 1980s crisis. Then, the
increase in farm incomes in earlier years had bid up the price of
land, which in parts of Iowa trebled to $4,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the farm woes occurred when the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates to cool off the Reagan expansion, making it
impossible for thousands of farmers to service the debts they had
taken out to buy land at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed raised interest rates this week, farmers'
financing costs are still low compared with what they were in the
1980s. Then farmers' debt-service costs were around 14 percent of
production expenses; they are now 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, then, farmers are in better shape than they were
the last time things got really tough. Still, with prices so low a
renewed shakeout is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1987, the number of farms fell by 250,000. If
the same thing were to happen again, the number would fall to 1.94
million by 2005 _ a 12 percent decline in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of most industries, that would count as a
modest decline. But farmers are not like most other workers _ their
way of life, self-respect and sense of identity are often
intimately entwined with their job.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even those that remain on the land fret that the
relentless growth of corporate farming will leave them as little
more than hired tractor-drivers, a prospect most find humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   John Gilbert of the Iowa Farmers' Union explains: ``Turkey and
eggs used to be an essential part of diversified farming. It was
how you learned the business. That's been taken over by one or two
processors. Then came beef. Now three or four packers buy most of
the cattle. Everyone thought it would never happen to pigs. They
were too diversified and easy to raise. But look at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the pig industry has been transformed. Family
pig farms in Iowa, the main hog-producing state (and the
second-largest farm state after California), used to have up to 500
sows, each producing about 20 piglets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, industrial-scale pig warehouses are appearing, with 16,000
sows raising 320,000 piglets a year. The stench from these huge
battery pig farms spreads for miles. But they are only the most
visible and smelliest evidence of change.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the way in which pigs are marketed. Where
family farmers used to take their piglets straight to market, they
now raise them on behalf of the large warehouse farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a tenth of America's pigs were raised in this
way, under contract. Now two thirds are.
</P>
<P>
   It is this contract-farming system that the family owners now
fear as much as bankruptcy. They have seen poultry, beef, and pig
farming swallowed by the system. The next domino to fall could be
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the firms involved in agriculture, the largest are
already the grain traders and seed producers, most of the latter
owned by big chemical firms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,500) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Last year, Cargill, one big firm, bought the grain-trading
operations of another, Continental. For many, this exemplified the
trend toward greater concentration and monopoly purchasing
threatening farmers. They fear being crushed between these
corporate millstones, and that the big companies will then buy up
their farms.
</P>
<P>
   That is possible. But the pattern of rapidly increasing
consolidation is not quite the unstoppable, Darwinist expansion
that it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is nothing relentless or rapid about the
growth of the biggest beef companies. Although a few big firms
dominate slaughtering, it took them 30 years to get to the point
where they slaughter about two-thirds of all cattle, and they still
have only about 22-24 percent of cattle under contract. That share
has been stable for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is nothing mysterious about the rise of these

<TEXT>
<P>
   Illegal substances, and the question of whether or not he
consumed them, have given George W. Bush a spot of bother recently.
In the coming months Bush will, with luck, face equally probing
questions about substance of a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   After months of telegenic grins and a single stump speech, the
Republican front-runner has finally promised a series of policy
speeches. If these are to contain any content at all, it will most
likely come from the governor's chief economic adviser, Larry
Lindsey, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is the man overseeing 12 working groups that are
preparing the Bush economic agenda. Their mission is to give some
meaning to what Bush has so far used as something of a security
blanket, the all-purpose slogan ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Lindsey is enough to understand how he got this
position. Affable, funny, opinionated, and with an evident gift for
explaining complex concepts in plain English, Lindsey is the kind
of economist a straight-talking Texan would warm to.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of that, he is a heavyweight, in the intellectual as
well as physical sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   He was a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers in
the early Reagan years; associate professor at Harvard; author of
``The Growth Experiment'' (a 1990 book that is probably the most
valiant intellectual defense of the Reagan tax cuts); domestic
policy advisor in the Bush Administration; and a governor of the
Federal Reserve for much of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad record for a man who is only 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the Lindsey take on economic policy is pure
mainstream Republican. He talks a lot about incentives and reducing
unnecessary regulation. He favors the partial privatization of
Social Security by diverting a share of payroll taxes into
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Medicare reform that includes choice and means-testing,
lamenting that ``Medicare regulations are four times the number of
pages of IRS regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants greater defense spending. (``We [have] a defense
program run by budget numbers and not by military needs.'')
</P>
<P>
   He wants tax rates ``consistent with sensible incentives'' and
believes that surplus tax revenue should be returned to those who
paid the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so uncontroversial. But there is more to Lindsey than
predictable mainstream opinions, at least judging from his
publications. Although ``The Growth Experiment'' is best remembered
as a staunch defense of supply-side tax cuts, it is the
lesser-known second half that merits rereading.
</P>
<P>
   Here Lindsey set out a tax agenda for the 1990s which might
qualify as a truly radical plan for compassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated a single 19 percent tax rate on all income
(including, flat-taxers take note, on capital gains). The income
threshold up to which no taxes were paid would rise substantially,
but exemptions would be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   His aim was to improve incentives by broadening the tax base and
reducing rates, while at the same time specifically lowering the
tax burden on low and moderate-income Americans. (He suggested, for
instance, extending mortgage-interest relief to poorer tax payers
but limiting its amount, so that the mansions of the rich were no
longer subsidized by the government.)
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond ``The Growth Experiment'' and there is no doubt that
this is a man who cares deeply about tax and regulatory impediments
facing lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He claims an early personal lesson in how red tape is a
proportionately bigger burden for the small guy: in college Lindsey
faced reams of red tape when trying to set up a summertime hot-dog
stall. The experience seems to have scarred him for life.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had professional experience with anti-poverty policy
(as a governor of the Federal Reserve he chaired the Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation, a small government agency that promotes
urban renewal efforts). And he is currently writing a book that
asks whether, and why, the market fails in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the intellectual ingredients for a radical,
compassionate conservative agenda exist. But radicalism is unlikely
to be the hallmark of a Bush agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor would doubtless gulp at some of the more
populist ideas in Lindsey's 1990 book. It is hard to imagine any
Republican, compassionate or otherwise, depriving rich homeowners
of their tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And, steeped in the murky reality of policy advice, Lindsey
himself has become a staunch proponent of incrementalism. Taking
policy changes gradually, he now conveniently claims, makes
economic as well as political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he is too much of a political operator to try and rock
the Republican boat by pushing too far or too fast in any
direction. Nonetheless, he appears to offer at least the glimmer of
a sensible, long-term Republican tax agenda: low rates, fewer
exemptions, and better incentives, especially for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if Lindsey's predictions about the American
economy are correct, then a President Bush in 2001 will not have
the luxury of concentrating on such long-term matters. For Lindsey
has made no secret of the fact that he considers the American
economy to be suffering from an asset-price bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledges there have been fundamental
improvements in America's economy, he has no doubt that Wall Street
is overvalued. As far as he is concerned, the only real issue is
how painful the inevitable bursting of the bubble will be.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, in testimony to Congress, he argued that a tax
cut was needed as an insurance policy against future recession.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy roaring along, his arguments were discounted
(probably rightly) as an opportunistic attempt to justify the
Republicans' political agenda with clever-sounding economics.
Neither then, nor now, does the American consumer's appetite need
fueling with tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, if Lindsey's bubble analysis is correct, the sharp drop in
stock prices he fears might well be followed by economic slowdown,
and perhaps a recession. Then fiscal loosening could be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting to know that Bush is being advised by someone
who is thinking seriously about what to do in bad times as well as
good. On the other hand, if the governor really shared his
adviser's pessimism, he might be wiser not to run at all. &QL;

lesser-known second half that merits rereading.
</P>
<P>
   Here Lindsey set out a tax agenda for the 1990s which might
qualify as a truly radical plan for compassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated a single 19 percent tax rate on all income
(including, flat-taxers take note, on capital gains). The income
threshold up to which no taxes were paid would rise substantially,
but exemptions would be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   His aim was to improve incentives by broadening the tax base and
reducing rates, while at the same time specifically lowering the
tax burden on low and moderate-income Americans. (He suggested, for
instance, extending mortgage-interest relief to poorer tax payers
but limiting its amount, so that the mansions of the rich were no
longer subsidized by the government.)
</P>
<P>
   Look beyond ``The Growth Experiment'' and there is no doubt that
this is a man who cares deeply about tax and regulatory impediments
facing lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He claims an early personal lesson in how red tape is a
proportionately bigger burden for the small guy: in college Lindsey
faced reams of red tape when trying to set up a summertime hot-dog
stall. The experience seems to have scarred him for life.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had professional experience with anti-poverty policy
(as a governor of the Federal Reserve he chaired the Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation, a small government agency that promotes
urban renewal efforts). And he is currently writing a book that
asks whether, and why, the market fails in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the intellectual ingredients for a radical,
compassionate conservative agenda exist. But radicalism is unlikely
to be the hallmark of a Bush agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor would doubtless gulp at some of the more
populist ideas in Lindsey's 1990 book. It is hard to imagine any
Republican, compassionate or otherwise, depriving rich homeowners
of their tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And, steeped in the murky reality of policy advice, Lindsey
himself has become a staunch proponent of incrementalism. Taking
policy changes gradually, he now conveniently claims, makes
economic as well as political sense.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he is too much of a political operator to try and rock
the Republican boat by pushing too far or too fast in any
direction. Nonetheless, he appears to offer at least the glimmer of
a sensible, long-term Republican tax agenda: low rates, fewer
exemptions, and better incentives, especially for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if Lindsey's predictions about the American
economy are correct, then a President Bush in 2001 will not have
the luxury of concentrating on such long-term matters. For Lindsey
has made no secret of the fact that he considers the American
economy to be suffering from an asset-price bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledges there have been fundamental
improvements in America's economy, he has no doubt that Wall Street
is overvalued. As far as he is concerned, the only real issue is
how painful the inevitable bursting of the bubble will be.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, in testimony to Congress, he argued that a tax
cut was needed as an insurance policy against future recession.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy roaring along, his arguments were discounted
(probably rightly) as an opportunistic attempt to justify the
Republicans' political agenda with clever-sounding economics.
Neither then, nor now, does the American consumer's appetite need
fueling with tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, if Lindsey's bubble analysis is correct, the sharp drop in
stock prices he fears might well be followed by economic slowdown,
and perhaps a recession. Then fiscal loosening could be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting to know that Bush is being advised by someone
who is thinking seriously about what to do in bad times as well as
good. On the other hand, if the governor really shared his
adviser's pessimism, he might be wiser not to run at all. &QL;

STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE: CLOTHING OPTIONAL BEYOND THIS POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 29.) 
(th) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Hoppus, the singer and bassist of Blink-182, tells the new
Rolling Stone, ``I know I've got a disgusting body, but I think
it's funny, so I'm gonna make people laugh at it.'' He achieves his
goal by appearing naked, along with the other members of his
pop-punk band, throughout the video for their song ``What's My Age
Again?''
</P>
<P>
   Digitally masked for modesty's sake, the San Diego trio traipse,
love handles to the wind, through the streets of Los Angeles,
reviving what may be the last '70s pop cultural phenomenon to
receive a second life in the '90s: streaking. Since the video began
running on MTV, Hoppus, 29, says he has noted a marked increase in
the amount of female nudity in the audience at his concerts. He is
not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say, `If you guys wanna get naked, it's all right
with us,''' Hoppus told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Why would he protest? As this ridiculously hot summer winds
down, a season that saw beach attendance at all-time highs, skin is
in, no matter how much of it you have. From the latest Perry Ellis
ads, which use the image of a naked woman to sell men's wear, to
``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' which reveals the well-toned bodies of
its mid-40-ish stars, Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, the birthday
suit has become the season's hottest look.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodstock '99 last month, public displays of private parts
were as common as mud. Flea, the bassist whose band, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers, closed the event, performed wearing only his
tattoos, as is sometimes his wont.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, audience members, some of whom were naked
themselves, also expected Sheryl Crow to flash them. USA Today
quoted the somewhat incredulous singer as asking: ``This is a sort
of take-your-top-off kind of day, is that what it is?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, for some, it was. Nakedville, where a group of
nudists had set up at Woodstock '99, was a popular stop, as was a
body-painting booth where $100 bought a full-body paint job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Manhattan, ``Naked Boys Singing'' has taken
up residence at the Actors' Playhouse. The musical revue, an import
from Los Angeles, where it was a long-running hit, celebrates its
cast's flesh with songs like ``Gratuitous Nudity,'' ``Muscle
Addiction'' and ``Nothin' but the Radio On.''
</P>
<P>
   While it received enthusiastic reviews in New York, ``Naked Boys
Singing'' doesn't use nudity to any more noble ends than
titillation and ticket sales. When a brief nude scene like Nicole
Kidman's low-light striptease in ``The Blue Room'' can land an
unremarkable Broadway play on the cover of Newsweek, and Rick
Schroder's bare derriere, exposed shortly after his arrival on
``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' lands him on the cover of TV Guide, nudity for
nudity's sake is bound to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound: Alanis Morrissette was nude in her recent
video, ``Thank U.'' Streaking was the subject of an episode of
``That '70s Show'' last season. An episode of ``Oz,'' HBO's
hard-edged prison drama, is nothing without a glimpse of
full-frontal male nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' has its nudie bar scenes. And the premieres of
envelope-pushing Fox sitcoms like ``Action'' and ``Malcolm in the
Middle'' will use the suggestion of nudity _ these are network
shows, after all _ to get their biggest laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Nudity is threatening to become mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how things have changed since Richard Gere caused a scandal
by appearing frontally nude in ``American Gigolo.'' Where
performers once feared the designation ``skin man,'' as actors who
did nude scenes were once derogatorily called, such stars as Ewan
McGregor and Harvey Keitel have made careers by appearing in the
altogether in many of their movies. They've made their naked bodies
part of their box-office appeal. Likewise, Bob Odenkirk and David
Cross, alternative comedians, often appear naked for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Streaking may originally have been born out of the sexual
revolution, but today it seems an exercise in punkish
nose-thumbing, an extreme sport that never fails to rivet
onlookers, like bungee jumping.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when we feel we have seen it all and done it all _
when that millennial malaise leaves you feeling like ``Oh, what
now?'' _ the sight of a naked body on television, on stage or in a
movie still wakes us up from our stupor. Faced with a streaker, we
become as immature as fraternity brothers on a Mardi Gras road
trip, asking ourselves, as Hoppus might, ``What's My Age Again?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is ``about 13,'' if only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the current fascination with public nudity comes
at a time when laws against it are on the increase. It has been
reported, for instance, that San Diego has begun enforcing dress
codes in areas where nudity was once tolerated, like a popular
strip strip called Black's Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This is a thorn in the side of the 50,000-member American
Association for Nude Recreation. At the group's national
convention, held earlier this month in Oregon, the nearly 1,000
nudists who attended spent much of their time developing strategies
against a tide of anti-nudity legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every do-gooder wants to jump on us,'' one 75-year-old man
told The Associated Press. But that wasn't the most immediate
problem the nudists faced. Unseasonable temperatures in the Pacific
Northwest nearly put the kibosh on the event by forcing attendees
to get dressed. As one naked woman explained, ``Even nudists get
cold.''

QUOTABLE NOTABLES' COMMENTS ON NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOYCE JENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City has always drawn writers, musicians,
artists and intellectuals to it, and they in turn seem never to
tire of talking about it. A sampling of what some have said can be
found at an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, aptly
titled ``Yadda, Yadda, Yadda: Quotes About New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of them express the romance and excitement of the city.
Like this, from the French writer Simone de Beauvoir, who visited
New York on a lecture tour in 1947 and again in 1950: ``There is
something in the New York air that makes sleep useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Duke Ellington, who moved to New York in 1923 and used the
classic Billy Strayhorn tune ``Take the A Train'' as the theme for
his band in 1941. ``The whole world revolves around New York. Very
little happens anywhere unless someone in New York presses the
button.''
</P>
<P>
   Others capture its endless striving. Mark Twain, who at one time
worked as a journeyman printer in New York, compared the city with
potential rivals in 1899: ``In Boston they ask, `How much does he
know?' In New York, `How much is he worth?' In Philadelphia, `Who
were his parents?'''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the singular vastness. In an essay on life in
New York City, E.B. White observed, ``On any person who desires
such queer prizes, New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and
the gift of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The historical society said there were three criteria for its
selection: the people had to be well-known and quotable; they had
to represent a variety of backgrounds and points of view, and
perhaps most important, the society had to have appropriate
pictures or objects to illustrate the author or quotation. (Thus
Ralph Waldo Emerson's observation that ``New York is a sucked
orange'' is accompanied by the panels from orange crates used in
the 1950s.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for whatever reason, some of the quotations that were
left out of the show (which runs until Sept. 26) have a certain
piquancy and insight that would be a shame to miss. Like that of
the temperance crusader Carrie Nation, who during a trip to New
York in 1901 asked the police commissioner, ``Don't you think New
York is an awful bad place?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the notorious Tammany Hall candidate John Hyland,
who declared after winning the 1917 mayoral race, ``We have had all
the reform that we want in this city for some time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of Labor Day signaling the end of summer,
perhaps the most timely quotation is Ogden Nash's. Nash, who often
wrote for The New Yorker, composed a poem titled ``I Always Say
There's No Place Like New York in the Summer, or That Cottage Small
by a Waterfall Was Snapped Up Last February.''

ON THE FIELD AND OFF, GIANT QB TACKLES ALCOHOL ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SINGELAIS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There still is temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Collins said there have been days when, after a round of
golf in oppressive heat, he has imagined how refreshing a cold beer
would taste.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately Collins, a New York Giants quarterback,
remembers how alcohol almost destroyed his career, and his craving
subsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about the downside to it and all the pain it's caused
in my life,'' Collins said. ``I think about how much my life has
improved because I don't have that beer. So I'm very much
anti-drinking right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 26 and in his fifth NFL season, said he believes that
alcohol has been the root of his downfall. In 1996, he was a Pro
Bowl quarterback who led the Carolina Panthers to within one game
of the Super Bowl in only their second year of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has been branded a quitter and a racist. He also
has played for three teams in the past 10 months and has been
convicted of driving while impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Taking steps to resurrect his career, Collins signed a
four-year, $16.9-million contract with the Giants in February and
has served as Kent Graham's backup since training camp began at the
State University of New York at Albany last month.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' arrival made many believe there was a quarterback
controversy, but Graham has put that talk to rest _ for the time
being _ with excellent performances in New York's first two
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate NFL quarterbacks get hurt and have swings in
performance, it's not hard to imagine Collins getting a shot this
season. Buffalo's Doug Flutie and Minnesota's Randall Cunningham
began last season on the bench before injuries to starting
quarterbacks gave them the chance to have career years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rah mentality I have to take is that I will be one play
away,'' Collins said. ``And whatever my role is, it is. I'm
comfortable with that, I've accepted it, and only time will tell
how it plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   A sprained foot suffered during practice kept Collins out of the
preseason game against Jacksonville on Aug. 21, but he is expected
to play in the second half against the Jets on Saturday night at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his job status, Collins speaks like a man who
finally has found peace. During this past offseason, the Giants
offered him help from alcoholism counselor Charlie Stuckey, a
recovering alcoholic who works at a rehab center called Honesty
House in Stirling, N.J., and from Dr. Joel Goldberg, the Giants'
director of counseling services.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Joel said to me is that I have to learn how to have
fun without alcohol,'' Collins said. ``I don't think a lot of
people my age have that in perspective. So much of your social life
involves going out and having a few drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Collins said, has led to severe lapses in judgment. He
blames drunkenness for an episode two years ago, when he directed a
racial slur at a Panthers teammate during a training-camp party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was making a joke, I think because I was drunk,
they didn't know how to take it,'' Collins said. ``I completely
understand that. But they were like, `Was the alcohol a truth
serum? Is that how you really feel?' That kind of thing. I can
truly say there was nothing behind it. It wasn't truth serum coming
out. It was a joke, I tried to be funny, and it backfired on me.''
</P>
<P>
   That incident led to some wariness in the Giants locker room
when Collins arrived. But two African-American players interviewed
for this story say Collins has fit in without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of preconceptions about him, but all he's
showed me is that he's a good guy,'' running back Tiki Barber said.
``I don't like to prejudge people. I like to make my own decisions,
and he's fitting in well here. I think all the guys like him. He
hasn't done anything to show us otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Said defensive end Michael Strahan: ``It's never easy to come in
and fit in with a new team when you're carrying baggage, but he's
fit in well. He's made it easy to accept him.''
</P>
<P>
   While the racial incident marred Collins' reputation, a broken
jaw suffered that same year contributed to his downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   A hit from Denver's Bill Romanowski during a preseason game
broke Collins' jaw in two places. Collins returned in just over
four weeks, missing only two regular-season games, but his weight
dropped from 250 to 238 while he ate through a straw.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had a horrible 1997 season with 11 touchdown passes, 21
interceptions and a 55.7 quarterback rating. The Panthers, 12-4 the
season before, fell to 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore this big face mask (to protect the jaw) and I could
barely move my head,'' Collins said. ``It screwed me up a little
bit. It took me awhile to get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt just as uncomfortable in Charlotte, N.C., which he said
became ``fishbowl city'' when the Panthers got to the NFC title
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers were the biggest game in town, and Collins felt
scrutinized. He said he was reluctant to leave his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he missed Pennsylvania and the Northeast,'' said Gerry
Slemmer, who coached Collins at Wilson High School in West Lawn,
Pa. ``I think (he missed) the climate in this area and just being
close to his family and friends. I think he just missed the rolling
hills and greenery of Pennsylvania. I remember him commenting on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The unhappiness came to a head Oct. 7 of last season. The
Panthers had started the season 0-4, capped by a 51-23 loss Oct. 4
to Atlanta. Three days later, Collins met with Carolina head coach
Dom Capers.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The substance of that meeting has been disputed. Capers insisted
that Collins said his ``heart wasn't into'' football anymore;
Collins has said he's not a quitter, though he declined to say much
about that fateful day in a recent interview.

   ``The allegations of quitting are completely false,'' Slemmer
said. ``He's not that kind of person. It's another example of
things being blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers waived Collins on Oct. 13, six days after his
meeting with Capers. Collins was claimed by the New Orleans Saints
the next day, but the Mardi Gras atmosphere of New Orleans might
not have been the best choice for a player with a drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a couple of times I did go out with my teammates and had
a few beers,'' he said. ``Bourbon Street, that's a big lure. I was
still like, `I don't have a problem. I'll still do this and that.'
I didn't have the kind of perspective I have on it now.''

</P>
<P>
   The alcohol abuse caught up with Collins again Nov. 2 of last
season, less than a month into his stint with the Saints. Collins
was arrested on a DWI charge in Charlotte, of all places, after the
Saints had played the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   There is one lasting image from that brush with the law: a
videotape of Collins leaving jail after posting bail, a cigar in
his mouth and a carefree expression on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty strong memory,'' he said. ``That's like the
basis of what I don't want to get into again.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins started the final seven games for the Saints and
struggled, throwing four touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He became an unrestricted free agent after the season, and
signed with the Giants. Despite limited interest from other clubs,
New York offered Collins a $5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What history tells you is you have to reach for greatness at
the quarterback position,'' Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Collins realizes that greatness remains to be seen, but
if he doesn't, it won't be for a lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   He spent eight weeks at the Menninger Clinic, a drug and alcohol
rehab center in Topeka, Kan. He recalled a pivotal moment in his
recovery in late January, when he met another patient who was a
Hollywood agent. The man persuaded Collins to give sobriety a real
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Look, maybe from here on out you just give it
everything you've got for however long you want to do it,'''
Collins recalled. ```So that way, you're not going to look back and
say I wish I'd done this or that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Collins also has met one-on-one with Stuckey, the alcoholism
counselor in New Jersey, and has attended Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon said Collins hasn't been seeing
Stuckey during training camp, but that he will visit him again
after the regular season starts next month.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he keeps a specific tally of how many days he's
been sober, but he declined to reveal the figure, saying only that
it's ``a bunch of months.'' He said he never goes to bars anymore,
preferring quiet evenings with his new girlfriend. He said he's
sure his behavior is being scrutinized by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lifestyle thing,'' Collins said. ``It's enhanced the
relationships I've had with players on the team. These guys, I know
they're watching me. I go out and get drunk, and I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes haven't all been of a personal nature. On the field,
the coaching staff has tweaked Collins' mechanics, concentrating
not on his right (throwing) arm but on slight flaws, such as the
tendency of his left arm to fly up as he passes.
</P>
<P>
   With alcohol out of his life, Collins' weight has dropped from
more than 250 to about 245, making him quicker in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great with the ball,'' Barber said. ``He puts it where it
has to be. He's got a strong arm. He's gonna be a good quarterback.
Hopefully, we won't have to use him, but if we do, we know he's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless if he gets much playing time as a Giant, Collins
already feels that, in a sense, he's won by cutting alcohol out of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be an alcoholic,'' Collins said. ``There's no
doubt about that. You know what? If thinking I'm an alcoholic is
going to keep me from drinking, so be it. Did I have a drinking
problem? Yes, I did. Did I ever wake up and have to drink a bottle
of Jack Daniels? No. Did it affect my life? Yes. Did it affect my
career? Yes. Has my life vastly improved since I stopped drinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''

   MA'ALEH ADUMIM, West Bank _ Do these burgers violate the Geneva
Convention?
</P>
<P>
   They do when they're sold in occupied territory, according to
pro-Arab groups who sought a worldwide boycott of Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   They won a victory this week when Burger King announced it would
take its brand name off of the new foodcourt counter in Ma'aleh
Adumim's mall.
</P>
<P>
   Ma'aleh Adumim isn't just the ``Home of the Whopper,'' it's a
sprawling development of villas and small apartment blocks with
25,000 people. Though just a mile outside Jerusalem, it is in
occupied territory _ land conquered from the Arabs in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, hungry Israeli settlers continued gobbling burgers
and the local franchise holder vowed to fight the parent company's
decision to remove its name from his counter.
</P>
<P>
   To settlers, Burger King's backtracking sets a precedent they
find hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a symbol. If they back down now, the Arabs will
boycott Jerusalem too,'' said Ma'aleh Adumim Mayor Benny Kashriel,
adding that now he hopes pro-Israeli groups will boycott Burger
King.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Palestinians sometimes eat there too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make a bad name for Burger King, closing a place
just for political reasons,'' said municipal worker Ofer Beck, 35,
a settler who was eating with his daughter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers said the episode reminds them of the boycott by the
Arab world that Jews here faced since before Israel's establishment
and up to the 1990s. Companies that did business with Jews were
often cut out of Arab countries, prompting many companies to avoid
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Arab countries were scheduled next week to
consider an official call for boycotting Burger King. The
restaurant has 46 outlets in Israel but 84 in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Kashriel said Burger King should be as strong as the
Atlanta-based Coca Cola Co. was through the decades when it was
boycotted across the Arab world. The soft-drink giant insisted on
continuing business with Israel, outlasted the boycott and is now
sold throughout the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But to pro-Arab groups _ and at least one pro-peace Israeli
group _that started the boycott five weeks ago, the Burger King
counter was a vehicle for reminding the world that Israel continues
cementing its hold on conquered Arab lands. Foreign investment,
they maintain, just strengthens Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Geneva Convention forbids the settlement of territory
captured in war and the United Nations has called for Israel to
relinquish control of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Israel itself has never even annexed the West Bank,
as it did in disputed annexations of east Jerusalem and the Golan
Heights, also captured in war. The United States officially
considers the West Bank ``occupied territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Oslo accords laid out a plan for handing over
undetermined parts of the West Bank to Palestinian control. That
process is greatly complicated by the nearly 150 Jewish settlements
and 170,000 settlers scattered amid the 1.5 million West Bank
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King cited the ``sensitive'' peace process in a statement
announcing its withdrawal from the mall in Ma'aleh Adumim. It also
said the local franchise owner ``falsely informed'' the Miami-based
fast-food chain that the counter was in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from franchise owner Rikamor Ltd., said that it
never misrepresented the location of the restaurant. Pro-Israeli
groups came to Rikamor's aid Friday, deploring Burger King's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a company that size to issue a franchise and not know
where it is, is a little hard to accept,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein,
executive vice president of the New York-based Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Palestinians also sometimes eat at the restaurant
and that the presence of a Burger King did not ``confer
sovereignty'' to one side or the other. He said he did not want to
boycott Burger King, but hopes it will reverse its decision.

NEW CHIP HAS A SPEED EDGE OVER INTEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Inside Fab 25, a state-of-the-art chip-making
plant owned by Advanced Micro Devices, the scene is almost surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Workers dressed in white, hyper-clean gowns _ their faces
covered by masks and protective goggles _ seem to drift by
silently. Their voices, muffled by the hum of air cleaners and
high-tech equipment and the masks that cover their mouths, are
almost conspiratorial in tone.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds a visitor of the classic sci-fi film ``Invasion of
the Body Snatchers,'' or perhaps George Lucas' first movie, ``THX
1138.'' It's decidedly otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   But in this 80,000-square-foot facility, AMD has drawn a line in
the sand in its ongoing battle against its archrival, Intel Corp.
And the chip it is making constitutes a line that, so far, Intel is
unable to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good feeling to know you have the fastest
processor on the market,'' said Dirk Meyer, AMD's vice president of
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer led the team that made the Athlon, a microprocessor used
as the central brains for personal computers. The chip, which
should begin appearing in personal computers made by IBM and
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. soon, has been getting
enthusiastic reviews by technology publications and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's because for the first time in almost 20 years, AMD has
produced a PC chip that outperforms the top-of-the-line competition
from Intel. One benchmark after another shows that the Athlon is a
more powerful processor than Intel's flagship Pentium III line.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD finally has a part that appears to offer better price
performance than Intel's top-of-the-line chip, and it's currently
available,'' said Joseph Osha, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York. ``Intel essentially has to play catch-up. AMD has a great
product, and if they can convince people they can make it, it might
change the shape of this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, AMD still faces major challenges, and Osha said ``it
will be miraculous'' if AMD succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon is a crucial product for Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD.
The company has been battered by a vicious price war with Intel.
Its longtime strategy of supplying processors for low-priced
consumer PCs has hurt its profitability, and it's been bleeding red
ink.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, AMD posted a loss of $173 million, a
figure that was offset by the sale of Vantis Corp., which it owned.
The company said pricing pressures from its marketplace struggle
with Intel was largely to blame.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day it posted those losses, AMD President S. Atiq
Raza resigned. Raza had come to AMD when it acquired NexGen, a chip
design firm. Technology from NexGen was at the core of the K6
family of processors.
</P>
<P>
   While the K6 has been a strong seller in consumer PCs at retail,
its market share has been shrinking since it peaked in February at
43.9 percent, according to Reston, Va.-based PC Data, a market
research company.
</P>
<P>
   June's figures showed AMD had a consumer-market retail share of
39.2 percent. Intel's share was 52.4 percent, up from 40.3 percent
in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon is the company's bid to crack a market it has sought
to enter for years _ PCs sold to corporations. These systems
typically use higher-end parts and have higher selling prices and
thus greater profits than those found in the consumer arena.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has spent huge sums on its development and to build a new,
state-of-the-art plant in Dresden, Germany, to make the chips. Fab
30, as it's called, is expected to cost about $1.8 billion to
construct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated attempts in the past _ most recently with a
beefed-up version of its K6 line of processors called the K6-III _
AMD has been unable to get PC makers to use its chips on a large
scale in machines sold to businesses. Analysts say there are
several reasons why AMD has been left out in the cold:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the past, AMD has had a difficult time delivering enough
chips to its suppliers. Problems in its fabrication plants have
resulted in a lower number of chips being produced than expected.
</P>
<P>
   _ Intel has developed a powerful brand that's comforting to
corporate buyers, who know that the company's chips will always
work with popular software. This is despite the fact that AMD's
chips have a reputation for compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   _ AMD has been working to develop a following among fans of
fast-action computer games, who often want top performance but
don't always have the money to pay for it. However, corporate types
may shy away from a processor that's touted to gamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a trade show a little while ago, and a guy was
talking to an audience of information system types,'' recounted
Linley Gwennap, chief analyst at Cahners MicroDesign Resources, a
research company that tracks the microprocessor industry. ``He
asked them how many of them had computers at home with AMD chips in
them. About half the audience raised their hands. Then he asked how
many of them would buy computers with AMD chips in them for their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one raised their hands. They are not willing to stick their
necks out at the office to bring these things in.''
</P>
<P>
   Design work on the Athlon began more than two years ago, AMD's
Meyer said, and involved a team of about 120 people, most of them
working out of the company's offices in Austin. The rest were based
in AMD's headquarters in Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said that, from the beginning, AMD set out to design a
chip that would beat Intel's offerings in terms of performance.
Even though the team was two years away from getting a product out
the door, they knew about where they needed to be in terms of the
chip's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past is a pretty good predictor of the future,'' Meyer
said. ``Microprocessor performance has been progressing on a
pretty-well-established track. You can pretty well predict how fast
you need to be, based on the historical trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon processor _ originally called the K7, the next
generation after AMD's K5 and K6 chips _ has outmuscled Intel's
Pentium III chips by adding more of everything that makes a
processor fast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, where the Pentium III chip has one floating-point
unit _ a part of the chip that does high-level mathematics _ the
Athlon has three. Where Intel's chip has a level 1 cache _ a memory
buffer that speeds data into and out of a processor _ of 32
kilobytes, AMD's has 128 kilobytes.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon contains the same extra code used to boost multimedia
performance in the Pentium III chip. It also has its own set,
dubbed 3D Now!, which was used in the K6-2 and 3 chips. And it has
additional 3D Now! instructions, which programmers can use to
further enhance graphics and video.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon also is able to talk to the computer's system board
faster. The chip uses a 200-megahertz system bus, which is the data
pathway used to move information into and out of the chip. Intel's
chips use a 100-MHz system bus.
</P>
<P>
   That system bus has ties to Compaq. AMD licensed the design used
in the Alpha microprocessor, considered the fastest chip available.
The Alpha was developed by Digital Equipment Corp., which Compaq
bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   In comparisons by both print and online technology publications,
computers built around Athlon chips have regularly outpaced those
using same-speed Pentium III chips. For example, the Sept. 21 issue
of PC Magazine has a roundup of the latest microprocessors and the
Athlon comes out on top in all but one of the publication's
benchmark tests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, AMD's Athlon chip is being shipped at 650-MHz clock
speeds, while Intel's Pentium III is only available in 600-MHz
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   And that Pentium III chip is not what Intel originally planned.
When the company mapped out plans for a 600-MHz chip, it hoped to
use a new design, code-named Coppermine. Instead, problems moving
to that design have forced Intel to use a speedier version of the
original Pentium design, code-named Katmai.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wright, AMD's director of consumer marketing, said the
company's ultimate goal is to get into the market for server
computers _ those machines that are at the center of corporate
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rollout strategy for this chip was to get a successful,
high-performance product for the consumer, and from there migrate
into the enterprise market,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the numbers, there's no guarantee that AMD will
triumph. The corporate market is virtually owned by Intel. AMD has
made runs at this business in the past, but analysts and PC makers
say it was tripped up by problems in its fabricating plants.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips are created out of silicon on eight-inch wafers.
Dozens of chips can fit on a single wafer, but the process is a
delicate one. Material as small as a speck of dust can cause a chip
to be defective, and errors with machinery or human operators can
render whole wafers useless. The amount of processors that a
manufacturer can produce is called its yield.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, AMD has had problems with yields, and has been
unable to satisfy the demands necessary to sell to commercial
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are dealing with high-volume products, you have to know
you'll be able to get the parts,'' said Merrill Lynch's Osha.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, a spokesman for Round Rock, Texas-based Dell
Computer Corp., said his company has looked at samples of the
Athlon chip from AMD, but is wary about AMD's ability to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many circumstances, the Athlon delivers good
performance,'' Thompson said. ``We have looked at the business case
for doing a K7-based machine. Our concerns are whether AMD could
deliver at the right time, and in the right volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Thompson said the Athlon chip is interesting enough
technology that ``we will definitely keep our eye on this.''
</P>
<P>
   At Compaq, the division that builds and markets the consumer
Presario line already has announced it would offer an Athlon-based
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we want the highest level of performance
in the systems we offer our customers, and the bottom line is that
Athlon is now the fastest processor available,'' said Mark Vena,
director of consumer desktop product marketing. ``There are some
customers for whom processor speed is the starting point. If you
don't get past that, you don't pass go and you don't collect
$200.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the consumer division is excited about using the
Athlon, Compaq's commercial group is shying away from the chip _
even though it contains Alpha technology that Compaq licensed to
AMD.
</P>
<P>
   A Compaq spokesman cited the fact that, so far, AMD doesn't have
a segmented family of chips that can serve different needs. For
example, Intel has the Celeron for the low end; Pentium II and III
for corporate desktops; and the Pentium Xeon for servers.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change, though. Wright said AMD will soon
introduce different products bearing the Athlon name, including the
Athlon Ultra, which will work in servers that can use more than one
processor; a low-end version, the Athlon Select, to compete with
the Celeron; and a higher performance chip, the Athlon
Professional, for state-of-the-art PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Osha points out that Intel is not standing still, and has such a
stranglehold on the business market that it may now be impossible
for AMD to break through.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes forget that Intel is about more than just the
quality of design,'' Osha said. ``They are a very effective and
very reliable manufacturer. They're also brilliant marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Osha and other analysts point to how well Intel responded when
alternative chip-makers such as AMD and Cyrix threatened to take
control of the market for chips used in sub-$1,000 PCs. Intel
released the Celeron, and while the first versions of the chip were
criticized for performance problems, the more recent releases have
won praise from reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reaction to competition is to run faster and jump
higher,'' said Tom Waldrop, an Intel spokesman, citing the PC Data
retail-market-share numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While Waldrop would not respond to specific questions about the
Athlon as competition for Intel, he did say that buyers look at
more than just performance numbers when choosing a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at how a PC will be used, and about stability
of the platform and compatibility issues,'' he said. ``It's not
just about speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Osha said that if AMD does not succeed in breaking Intel's hold
on the profitable corporate market, ``there will be some kind of
endgame played out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the K7 ends up stumbling, somebody will buy AMD,'' he said.

 &HT;    Instant messaging is revolutionizing the way kids and some
adults communicate
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The moment he arrives home from band practice,
14-year-old Ben Huffman of Bellbrook _ a.k.a. ``Griffyn199'' _
heads to the family den and cranks up the computer for some instant
messaging with his pals.
</P>
<P>
   From his AOL buddy list, Ben sees that his friend Shaun (aka
``Shaunimal'') is already online. Ben zings him with an instant
message. Shaun returns the electronic greeting, and the frantic
keyboard conversation soon turns to Shaun's driver's ed class.
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: Like I didn't want to pass this gigantic semi, and
the guy said ``why not?? you scared of passing him?? Come on you
pantywaist!''
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: he actually said that?
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: yeah
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: oh my gosh!
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: those exact words
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: did he encourage you to drink too?
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: and speed
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: and run red lights?
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: yeah, he reached over to the wheel and swerved the
car over a dog...
</P>
<P>
   Until just a few years ago _ eons by today's cyber standards _
teen-agers used to spend hours on the phone just talking about
nothing. Now they do the same thing on a computer _ with as many
friends as their young brains can juggle at once without exploding.
Teens today spend hours at a sitting shooting the electronic breeze
with online buddies, sometimes five or six at a time, no matter if
they're across the street or across an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot beyond belief. Young kids can be in touch with their
group at any time. And they can be talking to multiple groups at
once,'' said Roger Carlsen, a University of Dayton professor who is
an instructor and consultant in educational technology.
</P>
<P>
   But while instant messaging, or IM, has become the communication
rage among youths, most people older than 30 are more ambivalent
toward the exploding new technology. Some adults view IM as a
godsend for keeping in touch with family members and friends who
may be hundreds of miles away, or an easy way to break the ice when
searching for companionship. Others blast it as an intrusive
nuisance and one more way technology is eroding our privacy and our
sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thin borderline between use and misuse of this
technology, with a potential for a lot of misuse,'' said Carol
Baroudi, author of The Internet for Dummies. ``We're going to be
implanting chips in people's heads next.''
</P>
<P>
   IM systems today alert people when friends and co-workers log on
to their computers, or when someone with an interesting computer
profile is available for an online chat. They can then launch into
an instant typed conversation, if both users agree.
</P>
<P>
   Once turf disputes are resolved and linkages are meshed,
Internet engineers envision a day when people will be able to IM
each other anywhere, any time, whether they're at work on the
computer, at home watching TV or between the two carrying a cell
phone or hand-held PC. Tomorrow's IMs will be text, voice or even
video images.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Baroudi, it means there's no place left to hide
from either friends or work colleagues. ``The boundary between work
life and home life continues to erode, and ultimately I don't think
that's good for us,'' she said. ``We need time to just get away
from it all and recharge our batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 150,000 IM users registering each day with AOL
alone, there's no turning back the technology, says John Leon,
executive vice president of Orconet, a California-based Internet
service provider and an authority on evolving Internet network
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a medium that will have to be dealt with,'' he said. ``I
see more and more of the video aspect coming into play. Like The
Jetsons, if you want to talk to somebody _ boom! _ the camera comes
on and you see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon insists privacy isn't an issue with IM. Instant messaging
software allows users to turn off the program, so that they won't
receive any messages at all. Or they can selectively screen out
those people they don't want to hear from. To users perusing their
buddy lists, it will seem as though they aren't online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to be disturbed (by IM), just shut it off,''
Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   American Online, which pioneered instant messaging and buddy
lists three years ago, says it now has more than 40 million
registered users sending more than 430 million instant messages a
day _ a communication stream approaching the 500 million letters
sent each day via the U.S. Post Office. A separate online service,
ICQ, purchased by AOL last year, has another 40 million members
sending 330 million messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are teens. AOL found that, on average, teens
have at least twice as many buddies on their AOL buddy list as
adults, and often as many as 80 to 100 names.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Huffman, who has 50 to 60 buddies on his AOL list, says he
spends as many as four hours on some days IM-ing his friends.
Instant messaging has made the telephone all but obsolete among his
peers, he said, except when ``you can't find the people you need to
find (online). I'd say half to three-quarters of my friends are
communicating this way now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is quicker than electronic mail but more
personal, and secure, than a chat room, where strangers meet online
and the language often can turn offensive. When one IM user
contacts another, a little window pops up on the computer screen,
where they can exchange messages almost instantaneously while
operating other programs. The IM window can be opened up to as many
as 10 buddies at a time.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's buddy lists, launched in 1996, tell users when their
friends are online. Free Internet software for AOL Instant
Messaging (AIM) enables Net navigators to create buddy lists and
exchange messages, but only with other AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   That exclusivity has rankled another cyber titan _ Microsoft _
which in recent weeks has released rival IM software aimed at
penetrating the AOL system and allowing its users to contact AOL
members online. AOL has called Microsoft's tactics an invasion of
privacy, and keeps erecting an ever-higher electronic fence to keep
interlopers out of its back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts expect the feud eventually to resolve itself
in a free and open IM system, since it's to every Internet
company's advantage to keep computer users online as long as
possible. The goal is to make Internet use more ``sticky,'' as
executives call it, so people will look at ads and complete other
transactions that make money for online services.
</P>
<P>
   IM has been especially sticky for many users. Three years ago,
the typical AOL customer spent only about 14 minutes a day dialed
into the network, sending e-mail, visiting chat rooms or shopping.
Today, with the addition of IM, that figure is up to nearly an
hour. AOL executives hope someday to push the average online time
to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unthinkable? Some adults already have found IMs an indispensable
part of their day.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Mathes of West Alexandria says she can spend upward of 12
hours a day online, especially on snowy days. ``I use the Yahoo
Pager, ICQ, AOL Instant Buddy and MSN ZoneFriends. I have a total
of about 50 people on those friends lists ... lo!'' she said in an
e-mail message to the Dayton Daily News. ``It took my family a
while to get used to the fact that Mom lived online, chatting with
strangers, but I love it!''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's much cheaper than separate long-distance phone
calls, IM has brought Joy Wright of Enon closer to friends and
relatives in other states that she once would have exchanged only
Christmas cards with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of neat that I probably talk every other day with
these friends,'' she said. ``You find out a lot of little things
going on in their lives that you wouldn't otherwise. You get to
hear when they're going to a doctor's appointment, or to a
picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Zimmer of Dayton says that, with IM, she has
``rediscovered'' three of her far-flung classmates from Long
Island's Glen Cove High School in 1964. ``Now, more than 35 years
later .. we are back in touch with the computer and have a standing
`chat date' every week,'' she said in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is ideal for meeting people with shared
interests, some younger users say. It's more intimate than e-mail,
yet less threatening than talking to someone in person or on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bar scene for the '90s and the new millennium,'' said
Steve Glenn, founder of PeopleLink, a California company that has
created a system for users of Internet classified ads and Web sites
to IM each other.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Ganey, a 24-year-old Dayton resident, said he met his
girlfriend online _ 30-year-old Judi Jacobson of Dayton _ after
reading the user profile she posted on AOL and zinging her with an
IM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hi,' and we just started going back and forth (with
messages). After a couple days of chatting, I think I gave her my
phone number and she gave me hers,'' he said. ``We had a blind date
about a year ago, and everything's been pretty cool since.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganey says people are more likely to open up online than in
person. ``It's a safe way to feel each other out,'' he said. ``They
might just casually mention something about themselves and you say,
`Oh, OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that kind of exploratory intimacy, via IM, that
recently broke up his 12-year marriage, says Dave, a 36-year-old
Dayton area resident who asked that his last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife started instant messaging someone she met at work and
it wasn't long before they started an affair,'' he said. ``It
basically got them closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave says it's easy to float illicit suggestions with IM
buddies. ``If they don't take it the right way, you just come back
with LOL (shorthand for ``laughing out loud'') and it gets you off
the hook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many parents say they like AOL's buddy list for their
teen-agers because it keeps them chatting with their friends rather
than seeking out strangers on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Moscowitz, a 14-year-old in Vandalia, says her parents
don't usually mind if she's on the computer, even for hours at a
time, ``if they know I'm talking to my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But UD's Carlsen cautions that parents may be lulling themselves
into a false sense of security. In his work as an Internet security
adviser for school systems, he has found that many teen-agers and
adolescents keep separate buddy lists of people they've met online
and don't tell their parents about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have a `real' buddy list _ the kids at school, from
church, the ones that help them with homework,'' he said. ``And
they can also have another buddy list _ their `virtual friends'
whom they've only met online. They can keep both lists going and go
back and forth between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlsen said it's easy to hide the virtual buddy from parents.
With a single keystroke, ``you can flip over to another screen when
Mom or Dad come into the room,'' he said. Or with Windows 98, kids
can minimize the Instant Message window and hide it below the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying all kids are doing this, but there are many.
Parents shouldn't be so naive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts, such as Internet guru Don Tapscott, author of
Growing up Digital, believes parents worry too much about what
their children might encounter on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says the Internet is safer than, say, going to the drive-in
was for my generation,'' Carlsen said. ``You can't get pregnant
over the Internet.''

 &HT;    Instant messaging is revolutionizing the way kids and some
adults communicate
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The moment he arrives home from band practice,
14-year-old Ben Huffman of Bellbrook _ a.k.a. ``Griffyn199'' _
heads to the family den and cranks up the computer for some instant
messaging with his pals.
</P>
<P>
   From his AOL buddy list, Ben sees that his friend Shaun (aka
``Shaunimal'') is already online. Ben zings him with an instant
message. Shaun returns the electronic greeting, and the frantic
keyboard conversation soon turns to Shaun's driver's ed class.
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: Like I didn't want to pass this gigantic semi, and
the guy said ``why not?? you scared of passing him?? Come on you
pantywaist!''
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: he actually said that?
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: yeah
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: oh my gosh!
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: those exact words
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: did he encourage you to drink too?
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: and speed
</P>
<P>
   GRIFFYN199: and run red lights?
</P>
<P>
   SHAUNIMAL: yeah, he reached over to the wheel and swerved the
car over a dog...
</P>
<P>
   Until just a few years ago _ eons by today's cyber standards _
teen-agers used to spend hours on the phone just talking about
nothing. Now they do the same thing on a computer _ with as many
friends as their young brains can juggle at once without exploding.
Teens today spend hours at a sitting shooting the electronic breeze
with online buddies, sometimes five or six at a time, no matter if
they're across the street or across an ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot beyond belief. Young kids can be in touch with their
group at any time. And they can be talking to multiple groups at
once,'' said Roger Carlsen, a University of Dayton professor who is
an instructor and consultant in educational technology.
</P>
<P>
   But while instant messaging, or IM, has become the communication
rage among youths, most people older than 30 are more ambivalent
toward the exploding new technology. Some adults view IM as a
godsend for keeping in touch with family members and friends who
may be hundreds of miles away, or an easy way to break the ice when
searching for companionship. Others blast it as an intrusive
nuisance and one more way technology is eroding our privacy and our
sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thin borderline between use and misuse of this
technology, with a potential for a lot of misuse,'' said Carol
Baroudi, author of The Internet for Dummies. ``We're going to be
implanting chips in people's heads next.''
</P>
<P>
   IM systems today alert people when friends and co-workers log on
to their computers, or when someone with an interesting computer
profile is available for an online chat. They can then launch into
an instant typed conversation, if both users agree.
</P>
<P>
   Once turf disputes are resolved and linkages are meshed,
Internet engineers envision a day when people will be able to IM
each other anywhere, any time, whether they're at work on the
computer, at home watching TV or between the two carrying a cell
phone or hand-held PC. Tomorrow's IMs will be text, voice or even
video images.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Baroudi, it means there's no place left to hide
from either friends or work colleagues. ``The boundary between work
life and home life continues to erode, and ultimately I don't think
that's good for us,'' she said. ``We need time to just get away
from it all and recharge our batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 150,000 IM users registering each day with AOL
alone, there's no turning back the technology, says John Leon,
executive vice president of Orconet, a California-based Internet
service provider and an authority on evolving Internet network
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a medium that will have to be dealt with,'' he said. ``I
see more and more of the video aspect coming into play. Like The
Jetsons, if you want to talk to somebody _ boom! _ the camera comes
on and you see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon insists privacy isn't an issue with IM. Instant messaging
software allows users to turn off the program, so that they won't
receive any messages at all. Or they can selectively screen out
those people they don't want to hear from. To users perusing their
buddy lists, it will seem as though they aren't online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to be disturbed (by IM), just shut it off,''
Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   American Online, which pioneered instant messaging and buddy
lists three years ago, says it now has more than 40 million
registered users sending more than 430 million instant messages a
day _ a communication stream approaching the 500 million letters
sent each day via the U.S. Post Office. A separate online service,
ICQ, purchased by AOL last year, has another 40 million members
sending 330 million messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are teens. AOL found that, on average, teens
have at least twice as many buddies on their AOL buddy list as
adults, and often as many as 80 to 100 names.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Huffman, who has 50 to 60 buddies on his AOL list, says he
spends as many as four hours on some days IM-ing his friends.
Instant messaging has made the telephone all but obsolete among his
peers, he said, except when ``you can't find the people you need to
find (online). I'd say half to three-quarters of my friends are
communicating this way now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is quicker than electronic mail but more
personal, and secure, than a chat room, where strangers meet online
and the language often can turn offensive. When one IM user
contacts another, a little window pops up on the computer screen,
where they can exchange messages almost instantaneously while
operating other programs. The IM window can be opened up to as many
as 10 buddies at a time.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's buddy lists, launched in 1996, tell users when their
friends are online. Free Internet software for AOL Instant
Messaging (AIM) enables Net navigators to create buddy lists and
exchange messages, but only with other AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   That exclusivity has rankled another cyber titan _ Microsoft _
which in recent weeks has released rival IM software aimed at
penetrating the AOL system and allowing its users to contact AOL
members online. AOL has called Microsoft's tactics an invasion of
privacy, and keeps erecting an ever-higher electronic fence to keep
interlopers out of its back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts expect the feud eventually to resolve itself
in a free and open IM system, since it's to every Internet
company's advantage to keep computer users online as long as
possible. The goal is to make Internet use more ``sticky,'' as
executives call it, so people will look at ads and complete other
transactions that make money for online services.
</P>
<P>
   IM has been especially sticky for many users. Three years ago,
the typical AOL customer spent only about 14 minutes a day dialed
into the network, sending e-mail, visiting chat rooms or shopping.
Today, with the addition of IM, that figure is up to nearly an
hour. AOL executives hope someday to push the average online time
to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unthinkable? Some adults already have found IMs an indispensable
part of their day.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Mathes of West Alexandria says she can spend upward of 12
hours a day online, especially on snowy days. ``I use the Yahoo
Pager, ICQ, AOL Instant Buddy and MSN ZoneFriends. I have a total
of about 50 people on those friends lists ... lo!'' she said in an
e-mail message to the Dayton Daily News. ``It took my family a
while to get used to the fact that Mom lived online, chatting with
strangers, but I love it!''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's much cheaper than separate long-distance phone
calls, IM has brought Joy Wright of Enon closer to friends and
relatives in other states that she once would have exchanged only
Christmas cards with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of neat that I probably talk every other day with
these friends,'' she said. ``You find out a lot of little things
going on in their lives that you wouldn't otherwise. You get to
hear when they're going to a doctor's appointment, or to a
picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Zimmer of Dayton says that, with IM, she has
``rediscovered'' three of her far-flung classmates from Long
Island's Glen Cove High School in 1964. ``Now, more than 35 years
later .. we are back in touch with the computer and have a standing
`chat date' every week,'' she said in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is ideal for meeting people with shared
interests, some younger users say. It's more intimate than e-mail,
yet less threatening than talking to someone in person or on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bar scene for the '90s and the new millennium,'' said
Steve Glenn, founder of PeopleLink, a California company that has
created a system for users of Internet classified ads and Web sites
to IM each other.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Ganey, a 24-year-old Dayton resident, said he met his
girlfriend online _ 30-year-old Judi Jacobson of Dayton _ after
reading the user profile she posted on AOL and zinging her with an
IM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hi,' and we just started going back and forth (with
messages). After a couple days of chatting, I think I gave her my
phone number and she gave me hers,'' he said. ``We had a blind date
about a year ago, and everything's been pretty cool since.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganey says people are more likely to open up online than in
person. ``It's a safe way to feel each other out,'' he said. ``They
might just casually mention something about themselves and you say,
`Oh, OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that kind of exploratory intimacy, via IM, that
recently broke up his 12-year marriage, says Dave, a 36-year-old
Dayton area resident who asked that his last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife started instant messaging someone she met at work and
it wasn't long before they started an affair,'' he said. ``It
basically got them closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave says it's easy to float illicit suggestions with IM
buddies. ``If they don't take it the right way, you just come back
with LOL (shorthand for ``laughing out loud'') and it gets you off
the hook,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many parents say they like AOL's buddy list for their
teen-agers because it keeps them chatting with their friends rather
than seeking out strangers on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Moscowitz, a 14-year-old in Vandalia, says her parents
don't usually mind if she's on the computer, even for hours at a
time, ``if they know I'm talking to my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But UD's Carlsen cautions that parents may be lulling themselves
into a false sense of security. In his work as an Internet security
adviser for school systems, he has found that many teen-agers and
adolescents keep separate buddy lists of people they've met online
and don't tell their parents about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have a `real' buddy list _ the kids at school, from
church, the ones that help them with homework,'' he said. ``And
they can also have another buddy list _ their `virtual friends'
whom they've only met online. They can keep both lists going and go
back and forth between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlsen said it's easy to hide the virtual buddy from parents.
With a single keystroke, ``you can flip over to another screen when
Mom or Dad come into the room,'' he said. Or with Windows 98, kids
can minimize the Instant Message window and hide it below the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying all kids are doing this, but there are many.
Parents shouldn't be so naive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts, such as Internet guru Don Tapscott, author of
Growing up Digital, believes parents worry too much about what
their children might encounter on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says the Internet is safer than, say, going to the drive-in
was for my generation,'' Carlsen said. ``You can't get pregnant
over the Internet.''

 &HT;    GAS CANISTERS COULD START A FIRE, EXPERT CONFIRMS
 &HT;    With WACO.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An infantry weapons expert said Friday that a fire
``could certainly'' have been caused by the type of tear gas
grenade that the FBI has admitted using at the Branch Davidian
compound near Waco, Texas, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cutshaw, an editor at Jane's Defense Information Group
and a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer, said that M-651 CS
canisters use a pyrotechnic charge to distribute a potent form of
the fine particles commonly referred to as tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the right conditions,'' he said, setting off one of
these canisters could ignite a secondary fire. The conditions
include the grenade exploding on something that burns, such as
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week, federal officials had insisted that incendiary
devices were not used at Waco on April 19, 1993, where David Koresh
and about 80 of his followers died in a fire that broke out when
FBI agents attacked the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Now, FBI agents have admitted firing two such military gas
grenades at a concrete bunker some 100 yards from the compound
about six hours before the final assault ending a 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset and before I approved the plan, I made inquiry
as to whether the gas or the devices used for conveying the gas
were incendiary, and I was told that they were not,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said Thursday. ``I was concerned about the
possibility of fire started by such devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns were valid, Cutshaw indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A burning process'' disperses the CS particles that cause
extreme discomfort upon contact with people, he said. A fire could
result if the canister ``lands on something flammable.''
</P>
<P>
   The M-651 CS cannisters can be shot from an M-79 grenade
launcher, Cutshaw said. Congressional investigators reported this
week that the Army provided ``grenade launcher training'' for
federal agents in assisting with the Waco operation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters to research the M-651 CS canisters, Cutshaw
said, ``I was surprised by the paucity of information on this
round. It is very rarely used.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas grenades are designed for riot control, which is not
normally a domestic military mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutshaw said the gas grenades had to come from a military
installation, probably Fort Hood, which is near Waco and provided
much of the other equipment and support. The military assistance
included tanks, helicopters, communications equipment and
anti-terrorism advice.

GOP FINDS PUBLIC CAUTIOUS ON TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Southern Exposure is a weekly political column.) 
(th) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN and CARL HULSE   
 The N.Y. Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican lawmakers returned home this month
offering to give taxpayers some of their hard-earned money back _
$792 billion to be exact. But some are finding tax cuts a
surprisingly tough sell with a skeptical public.
</P>
<P>
   GOP congressmen and their aides concede they have not exactly
tapped a wellspring of constituent support for the tax cut package
adopted by the House and Senate before members headed off for
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, voters are willing to pay less taxes, particularly on
capital gains and estates, though other issues seem much higher on
their radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking to senior citizens, the tax package is not
as important as protecting Social Security,'' said Rep. Jim DeMint,
R-S.C., who added that other constituents are higher on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   He and other lawmakers say part of the reason for the response
is that voters don't understand the GOP intends to protect Social
Security and Medicare, reduce the debt, boost defense spending and
still provide the tax cuts. Once the tax cut program is laid out,
they say, voters are more receptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People down here for the most part are enthusiastic about the
tax package,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C. ``Paying down the
debt is popular. If I had put that package together, I probably
would divert more money to paying down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have mounted a stiff counterattack to the August
public relations effort by the Republicans, with the White House
and Democratic leaders saying the GOP can't meet all its economic
goals. Polls suggest their message is getting through.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to GOP heads of the House and Senate, President
Clinton said the tax cut plan would leave the government
permanently in debt and it would be irresponsible of him to sign
it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have also taken note of the GOP difficulty in raising
a summer clamor for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an education, we hope, to many members,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLOCK'S TICKING
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the national debt, Southern voters have the
opportunity to see a graphic illustration of just how quickly the
federal red ink is mounting these days courtesy of a watchdog group
and conservative Democratic debt hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Coalition, a balanced budget advocate, is now
carting its national debt clock around the region, visiting
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. The
electronic scoreboard ticks off the $3,500-per-second increase in
the $5.6 trillion debt as well as each family's share of the
balance due. Appearing with the trailer-drawn clock in their
communities will be members of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concord's national debt clock allows citizens to see firsthand
exactly how fast the national debt is growing, despite the claims
of some politicians that we have a budget surplus,'' said Harry
Zeeve, an official of the special interest group.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS COUNT
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 Census on the horizon, Southern states are under
the gun to do a better job of counting their kids.
</P>
<P>
   A new study from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which studies
children's issues, found that in 1990 Southern states had the
highest undercount rates when it comes to America's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia had the five
worst rates, according to an analysis of 1990 census data. South
Carolina placed sixth, while Alabama placed 12th and North Carolina
came in at 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Undercounting is a serious problem because population figures
are used to calculate how federal funds are dispersed, including
those for health care and education. Census officials estimate that
roughly 4 million people were missed in the last count, half of
those being children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't know how many children live in a particular
community, we can't ensure adequate school facilities,'' said
Ronald Henderson, director of research for the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Minority children are disproportionately represented in the
undercount, according to the analysis. Officials said unusual
living situations, such as children living with their grandparents,
and cultural differences contribute to the undercount.
</P>
<P>
   PROTECTING PARKS
</P>
<P>
   A prominent land conservancy group is urging Congress to devote
more money to buying up private property within national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger that this land could be sold for development,
bulldozing, clear cutting or for other destructive purposes
constitutes the single greatest threat to the nation's cherished
system of national and state parks,'' said Paul Pritchard,
president of the National Park Trust. The group estimates that
individuals or private entities own approximately 6 millions acres
within national parks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Trust identified 20 high-priority sites _
including the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia and
Everglades National Park in Florida _ as areas with private
property that could be sold.

DEBATING CORRUPTION: CAUSES AND CHARACTERISTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As old as the forbidden fruit, and as hardy a perennial,
corruption is back in.
</P>
<P>
   Take Russia. When the Soviet Union first collapsed, the first
worry in the West was of a Communist revanche. Then it was mass
hunger. Then it was resistance to radical reform. Now, virtually to
the exclusion of everything else, it is ``koruptsiya'' _ the image
of last week's Communists, yesterday's reformers and over-dressed
``New Russians'' amassing billions through plunder and crony
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners who so recently demanded ``shock therapy'' for the
Russian economy now demand to know ``who lost Russia,'' as if it
has moved beyond redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The current reports about huge globs of Russian money flowing
through the Bank of New York only reinforce the notion of a nation
whose entire economy, government and military have succumbed
wholesale to gangsterism, greed, embezzlement, cronyism and
bribery, all with a bewilderingly sophisticated manipulation of
global monetary mechanisms. The fact that many other former Soviet
republics and some Eastern European countries have fallen prey to
the same plague has given rise to hand-wringing about the deep
scars of communism, or to musings about an innate proclivity for
corruption in certain cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The preoccupation with corruption is hardly limited to the
former Communist countries, however. The financial turmoil in
Indonesia and across Asia has focused new attention on corruption
there. James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, has
made control of corruption in client nations a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency International, an organization founded in 1993 by
Wolfensohn's predecessor, Peter Eigen, has developed a ``Corruption
Perception Index'' in which nations are ranked according to the
perceptions of surveyed businessmen. Though essentially subjective,
the listings _ with Denmark, Sweden and Canada currently rated as
least corrupt and Russia, Colombia, Indonesia and Nigeria as most _
have fired debate on causes and sources of the blight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if all this fuss gives the impression that corruption is the
No. 1 problem of the former Communist and developing countries, not
everyone agrees even on what ``corruption'' is, or how evil are its
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fears that the undoubted corruptions of the transition process
have somehow imbedded themselves deep within society and state are
rampant throughout the former Soviet empire,'' wrote Marek Hessel
and Ken Murphy in a report for Transparency International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether real or unreal, such widespread, sometimes even
paranoid, anxieties raise important questions. Is corruption merely
a waste product of economic liberalization, a transitory phenomenon
that will recede as the transition winds down? Or is it something
more sinister, a paralyzing threat to economic growth and Soviet
progress at work?''
</P>
<P>
   For example, much of the plunder of Russia, though obviously
wrong and harmful, may be technically legal, not only because
pertinent laws have not been written, but because it is done under
the rubric of ``privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that crime has played a central role in
building states and fortunes. ``Behind every great fortune,''
Balzac once noted, ``is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   When the excesses of privatization were first noted in Russia,
there was a widespread notion that the country was simply
undergoing a mandatory phase of capital accumulation through
``robber barons.'' Alongside that was an argument that such
cronyism is universal, only that in developed societies it is
legalized through channels such as campaign giving.
</P>
<P>
   There are economists who still argue that corruption on a
certain level serves a beneficial purpose _ that it ``greases the
wheels'' of bloated, underpaid and inefficient bureaucracies,
allowing energetic and aggressive enterprises to break through. One
senior official in Singapore is reported to have said some years
ago that the only thing worse than an overregulated corrupt country
was an overregulated noncorrupt country.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is especially popular among some otherwise
respectable multinational corporations, which argue that they have
no choice but to adapt to local culture when working in developing
or former Communist countries. The same argument could be heard in
defense of the generous ``gifts'' given members of the
International Olympic Committee by officials in Salt Lake City in
their successful bid for the Games. Such practices, in turn, have
prompted some reformers to argue that the developed countries and
their multinationals are the worst culprits in sustaining
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to develop a unified theory of corruption, however,
tend to founder on facts. If communism is the culprit in the former
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, then how to explain that Estonia
has far less corruption than neighboring Latvia? And anyone who
reads about mob activities in the United States, or the coverup by
government officials of dioxin in Belgian poultry feed, or the
assassination of presidential candidates in Mexico, knows that
corruption is thoroughly universal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if there is no one definition, argues Daniel
Kaufmann, the chief corruption fighter in the World Bank as senior
manager of its Governance, Finance and Regulatory Reform Group,
most people ``can tell corruption when they see it,'' and would
prefer to live without it. The Bank's studies, he said, have found
little difference of perceptions around the world _ some cultures
may allow gifts, some not, ``but when it's a payoff to a public
official, they all accept it as corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To Kaufmann and Susan Rose-Ackerman, professor of law at Yale
and author of ``Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences and
Reform,'' corruption is not some national or cultural flaw, but a
symptom of a sick state, and therefore curable through reforms of
incentives, institutions and monitoring mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an economist _ I focus on what can be done, not moral
rearmament,'' said Ms. Rose-Ackerman. ``If there's a procurement
officer anywhere who is in charge of giving out contracts for major
public works projects where there's a lot of money at stake, and if
the process is not transparent, you'll find corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there are people who don't have strong moral
constraints against bribes, and there are differences across
countries and regions, but in my mind, at least, I think of
lowering incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, might mean raising the salaries of civil
servants, or opening government to greater scrutiny, or writing new
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufmann agreed. ``One cannot arrive at the same template for
each country,'' he said. ``They vary very much between places like
Russia and Latin America. There are institutional variables, like
the professionalism of the civil service, regulatory agencies,
political factors. History, of course, matters in a philosophical
sense, but not to the extent that corruption is invariable over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't fight corruption by fighting corruption,''
Kaufmann said. The factors to address are likely to be
macroeconomic stability, politics, market-friendly policies, human
policies, education, institutional development, accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufmann also rejects the ``grease'' hypothesis that corruption
could be useful. A study done jointly with Harvard University, he
said, found that ``firms that pay more bribes are also likely to
spend more, not less, management time with bureaucrats negotiating
regulations, and face higher, not lower, cost of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufmann said the World Bank's approach, used in countries as
disparate as Georgia, Albania and Bolivia, is to treat corruption
``as a symptom of the underlying illness of the state,'' and to
identify which agencies and areas are most vulnerable and weak _
whether the police, the customs service, the regulatory
environment, the judiciary. Working groups are then formed for each
area and prepare draft reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any such reform presupposes a political will to fight
corruption. Where that is lacking, or where corruption sinks deep
enough to become habit, it begins to undermine the state itself.
``My concern with Russia and the former republics is that they've
gotten into a vicious cycle, that they look with skepticism at
anyone with authority,'' said Ms. Rose-Ackerman. ``It ratifies
their belief that they're innately corrupt, and spiral downward.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the figures for Russia offer little hope for reform
anytime soon. On one side, the value of the country's resources is
staggering _ the value of oil alone is estimated at $30 trillion.
The number of bureaucrats charged with managing and privatizing it
already exceeds the total number of bureaucrats in the former
Soviet Union. According to Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist, at
least 70 percent of them take bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet probably the strongest signal President Boris Yeltsin has
sent to corrupt officials was to fire his first corruption fighter,
Yuri Boldyrev, as soon as he began fingering allies of Yeltsin in
the Moscow mayor's office, the State Property Committee and the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Even if curable, Hessel and Murphy argue in their article,
ridding Russia of corruption will take a long time. ``To produce
competent, honest bureaucrats, especially where competence is in
short supply and markets compete fiercely for it by dangling higher
salaries, and where the traditions of bureaucratic integrity are
weak, requires lots of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, they noted, the process began with the civil service
reforms in the 18th century, ``and even the Americans, where some
local governments remain quite corrupt, have a century-old
tradition of competitive civil service.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two neglected jewels of the museum world will close
here in January for a $60 million, three-year-long renovation
during which many of their treasures will tour the country.
</P>
<P>
   The two museums are the National Portrait Gallery and the
National Museum of American Art, both part of the Smithsonian
Institution but many blocks from the Smithsonian's heavily visited
museums on the Mall. They occupy a single landmark building in
Washington's old downtown area, which fell on hard times after the
riots set off in 1968 by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr..
</P>
<P>
   Museum attendance has risen as the neighborhood has improved,
and the area is now bustling with new restaurants, theaters and
office buildings, as well as the MCI Center, home of the city's
professional basketball and ice hockey teams.
</P>
<P>
   When the museums reopen in 2003, they will have more exhibition
space, new lighting and a new, two-acre copper roof, as well as
other improvements. On a recent walk-through with a visitor, Alan
Fern, director of the Portrait Gallery, paused in the
three-story-high library and said: ``It is one of the great
cast-iron rooms in America. It would be great as a reception room,
for dinners, for symposiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Work has begun on removing the concrete caps that had been
poured over the skylights in previous renovations and the
building's stained-glass windows are being restored as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is where Walt Whitman wrote letters home for boys who
were dying,'' Fern said in the main hall, which is two blocks long.
Whitman worked as a nurse for the Union wounded during the Civil
War, when the building was used as a hospital and a morgue. Whitman
called it ``the noblest of Washington buildings,'' and as the war
was ending, it was the site of an inaugural ball for Lincoln's
second term.
</P>
<P>
   Some have called the building the finest example of Greek
Revival architecture in the United States. It was begun in 1836,
the fourth major federal building in Washington after the Capitol,
the White House and the Treasury, and it was built to last.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Broun, the director of the Museum of American Art,
said: ``This is truly a great building, but it was built like the
Pyramids. It's not easily altered.''
</P>
<P>
   The building was the nation's first patent office, and it still
has on display some of the models that were submitted by early
inventors seeking patents. It later served as the home of the Civil
Service Commission and was nearly demolished in the 1950s to make
way for a parking garage before being turned over to the
Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   The building occupies two full blocks, from Seventh to Ninth
Streets NW, with an entrance for the Portrait Gallery on F Street
and another for the Museum of American Art on G Street. When the
renovation is complete, the entrance for both museums will be on F
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the inside workings _ the heating,
air-conditioning and electrical systems _ need to be replaced or
upgraded, Fern said, adding, ``The pipes are giving up, and we are
developing leaks.'' In addition, he said, the museum must comply
with the Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that
public buildings like the Smithsonian's be accessible to the
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real challenge for a building that was started in
1836,'' Fern said. ``We have to balance things, maintain the
architectural integrity but make it accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington firm of Hartman-Cox will be the architects for
the renovation of the building, whose original supervising
architect was Robert Mills, designer of the Treasury Building.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Smithsonian recently bought a nearby building, both
the Portrait Gallery and the Museum of American Art will be able to
shift many nonexhibition functions, like restoration laboratories,
the library and offices, and use the original building to display
more of their collections.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Broun said the exhibition space for the two museums would
increase to 130,000 square feet from from the current 100,000.
``We're going to be able to show more of our collection _ folk art,
photography, prints and drawings,'' as well as paintings and
sculpture, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Both museums have shows opening this fall that will run until
the renovation project begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of American Art will mount the first major exhibition
in 40 years of the watercolors of Edward Hopper. The show will
consist of 56 paintings from the 1920s to the 1940s, among them
beach scenes and houses in places like Cape Cod and Gloucester,
where it will be presented at the Museum of Fine Arts, the
co-organizer of the exhibition, from Jan. 30 to March 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Portrait Gallery will have a show of photographs by Henri
Cartier-Bresson from Oct. 29 to Jan. 9, including portraits of
Truman Capote, William Faulkner, Susan Sontag, Alexander Calder,
Alfred Stieglitz, Robert F. Kennedy, Dr. King, Jean-Paul Sartre,
Coco Chanel, Henri Matisse and Simone de Beauvoir.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you seek to plot the history of us earthlings, then look to
the heavens. As you read this, the last operational crew of Mir
will be back on the soil of mother Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Barring miracles, all that remains for the world's first manned
space station is the knacker's yard: more precisely, controlled
descent to a lower orbit and then burn out in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive me if I recount the story of its life. For the story
of Mir is the story of our times.
</P>
<P>
   When it all began, in early 1986, Russian President Mikhail
Gorbachev had been in power but a year, and his revolution had
barely started. Mir might have been Russian for ``peace,'' but like
that word in the Kremlin's dictionary of propaganda (``the
peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union'' then unfolding in
Afghanistan and elsewhere) the craft was a projection of Soviet
power.
</P>
<P>
   And looking back, the launch of the first module of Mir marked
the last apogee of that power _ the final trick of the conjuror
before his magic box spilled all over the floor.
</P>
<P>
   If power lies in the perception of power, those early months of
1986 were the last time you could make a case that the Soviet Union
was level with, or even marginally ahead of the United States in
the Top Nation stakes.
</P>
<P>
   That January the Challenger shuttle blew up _ a disaster that,
quite apart from shutting down the country's manned space program
for two and a half years, was a huge blow to America's faith in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   And just four weeks later, Moscow successfully launched Mir, the
world's first manned space station. For many a Cold War warrior, it
was an uncanny throwback to the Sputnik in 1957, and Yuri Gagarin's
first manned flight in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, it seemed, were on another roll. Could America keep
up? In fact, Mir was less a roll than a death rattle. A couple of
months later, on April 26, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded,
laying to rest any illusions about the primacy of Soviet civil
technology.
</P>
<P>
   That autumn in Reykjavik, by blocking what would have been the
biggest nuclear arms reduction deal in history, Gorbachev admitted
he had no answer to U.S. President Ronald Reagan's dream of Star
Wars.
</P>
<P>
   The following May, a German teenager landed his Cessna aircraft
next to Red Square, making a mockery of what were supposedly the
most impregnable and ruthless air defenses in the world, which just
four years earlier had shot down commercial jet KAL 007 when it
violated the eastern borders of Mother Russia. At that point, in
retrospect, the game was up.
</P>
<P>
   But Mir went on regardless. Far below it, the Communist empire
would dissolve and the Soviet Union disappear. Presidents and prime
ministers, wars and plagues came and went. But despite the periodic
alarums, you always knew Mir would never meet a Challenger's end.
</P>
<P>
   Its crises were not existential, but the smaller dramas of life
in Russia: leaky pipes, overflowing lavatories, dodgy food, and
intermittent power failures. In short, the daily struggle to get
by.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the Shuttle grew into the sports utility vehicle
of space, comfortable (or relatively comfortable), multi-functional
and reliable as clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   Mir was a Morris Minor of the heavens _ modern enough at the
outset, but by the end a patched-up, worn-out relic.
</P>
<P>
   The records it has set are not flashy hi-tech marvels, but
quintessentially Russian feats of endurance. Ask a Mir cosmonaut
not what he did, but how long he did it for. The answer from Sergei
Avdeyev, a member of this last returning crew, would be 742 days in
all, more than two years, longer than any other human has ever
spent in space.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is gone _ and what next? Space will continue to be
explored, but globalization is taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, Americans, Russians, Europeans and Japanese will
cooperate: not in a new spirit of selfless brotherhood between
nations, but in deference to the realities of a business like any
other, where the bottom line is all, and survival can hinge on a
generous sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Such has been Mir's story of late. The Russian state is broke
and the craft's parent company, the Energiya space corporation, has
simply been unable to find a new commercial backer.
</P>
<P>
   That, I suppose, is progress. But I shall miss Mir hugely. It
made space human, unpredictable and therefore interesting.
</P>
<P>
   When Europeans send up their Ariane rockets from Guyana, only a
launch pad explosion makes the event newsworthy. The Shuttle is a
little better, but its robotic, disembodied efficiency scarcely
sets the pulse racing. ``Houston, do you read me...Over'' _ and for
me, alas, Out.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the choice is between tedium and calamity. There are the
planetary probes of course, mindboggling in terms of time and
distance. But am I alone in failing to palpitate with excitement at
grainy photos of rocks and sundry other indeterminate blobs,
purporting to be proof there was once water on Mars?
</P>
<P>
   Mir however was different. For all the glitches, the space
station has been a huge success. It was meant to stay up for five
years, but managed more than 13.
</P>
<P>
   Over that time it was emblem first of rivalry between the
superpowers, then their wary cooperation, and finally of an
American financial and technological juggernaut with which Russia,
for all its ingenuity and gifts of improvisation, simply couldn't
compete. And for Russia read, right now, the rest of us as well.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder the presidents of Russia and China were making
common but impotent cause at a summit this week about the need for
a multi-polar world, in which there was some counterweight to
America.
</P>
<P>
   They must have had Mir in mind. &QL;

sets the pulse racing. ``Houston, do you read me...Over'' _ and for
me, alas, Out.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the choice is between tedium and calamity. There are the
planetary probes of course, mindboggling in terms of time and
distance. But am I alone in failing to palpitate with excitement at
grainy photos of rocks and sundry other indeterminate blobs,
purporting to be proof there was once water on Mars?
</P>
<P>
   Mir however was different. For all the glitches, the space
station has been a huge success. It was meant to stay up for five
years, but managed more than 13.
</P>
<P>
   Over that time it was emblem first of rivalry between the
superpowers, then their wary cooperation, and finally of an
American financial and technological juggernaut with which Russia,
for all its ingenuity and gifts of improvisation, simply couldn't
compete. And for Russia read, right now, the rest of us as well.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder the presidents of Russia and China were making
common but impotent cause at a summit this week about the need for
a multi-polar world, in which there was some counterweight to
America.
</P>
<P>
   They must have had Mir in mind. &QL;

CLINTONS WRAP UP VACATION IN , HEAD TO NEW YORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ President Clinton will embark on his new
quest Saturday _ getting his wife elected to the Senate _ as the
first family wraps up a weeklong stay in Martha's Vineyard and
heads for the Hamptons in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter,
Chelsea, will trade one old-money, deep-pocket enclave for another
on a working vacation that will net the first lady $600,000 for her
New York exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to take the opportunities he's done
previous summers in the Hamptons to meet with Democratic
supporters, which will raise resources for the DNC and the DSCC,''
said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, referring to the
Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The president will attend three fund-raising events over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Clintons will travel from the Hamptons to the
Finger Lakes resort of Skaneatalas in conservative upstate New
York, where the first lady will be on the campaign trail as much as
the bike trail. The first family will return to Washington on Sept.
3.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will arrive in New York amid a brewing controversy
over the president's offer of conditional clemency to 16 Puerto
Ricans connected to an independence group that claimed
responsibility for a terrorist bombing. Their release from prison
is supported by several New York Democrats as well as the Puerto
Rican governor.
</P>
<P>
   All federal law enforcement agencies opposed the conditional
clemency, sparking accusations the clemency was politically
inspired by the first lady's possible Senate bid. Joe Lockhart, the
White House spokesman, said the first lady was not involved in the
case and ``all views'' were presented to the president before he
made the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons began their Massachusetts vacation with the
president attending his first fund-raising event on behalf of the
first lady during a weekend side trip to Nantucket. A second
fund-raising brunch also was held here.
</P>
<P>
   However, the first lady has spent much of this week battling a
cold. The president read, played golf and rode horses with Chelsea.
The family also attended a clambake.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the president played golf with Britain's Prince
Andrew, the Duke of York; the prince's host Sir Evelyn Rothschild;
and New York banker Tony Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, driving a golf cart with Prince Andrew as his
passenger, joked that he had made a little wager with the Duke of
York whose hereditary line once had a claim on the Massachusetts
colony. ``If he beats me, we have to give him back the island,''
Clinton quipped.

 &HT;    BUSH DRUG FLAP GIVES NATION A CHANCE TO SHIFT POLICY, JACKSON
SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday that the drug
controversy that has dogged Texas Gov. George Bush's presidential
bid presents an opportunity to change the nation's ``extreme''
anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity _ if he doesn't keep dragging it out,
because it's not going to go away _ to say that here's a rich
favorite son who is now caught in a poor man's trap,'' Jackson said
at a breakfast with political reporters. ``This was a land mine
laid for someone else that has now trapped one of our favorite
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has alleged that Bush has ever used cocaine. But after
years of refusing to respond to rumors that he had, Bush said this
month that he could pass White House background checks going back
to 1974. The governor has refused to address whether he was
cocaine-free prior to 1974, when he was 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bush's quandary has already prompted some
proponents of ``zero tolerance'' for drugs and mandatory sentencing
to rethink some of the ``extreme'' anti-drug policies that have
helped push the nation's prison population above 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already there is a renewed discussion,'' he said. ``It would
be a shame to lose a talent of this capacity on that basis. It's a
shame we've lost so many other talents on that basis. So now, you
have a choice: forgive him if he asks for it and change the law, or
enforce the law ... because we must all play by one set of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bush, as well as any other candidate for president,
should have to answer whether he or she had ever used illegal
drugs, because ``draconian drug laws'' and prison construction have
become ``the centerpiece of urban policy'' in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place in the law for youthful indiscretions in the
possession and consumption of cocaine,'' Jackson said. ``He should
answer that question because it's not private, it's public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bush had tried to ``have it both ways'' in
volunteering that he had been faithful to his wife, which he
described as ``taking a shot at Bill Clinton and Hillary's
relationship,'' while avoiding questions about drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bush must make ``a huge decision'' on whether to
acknowledge cocaine use and ask for forgiveness or deny using the
illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if reporters' questions to presidential candidates about
past drug use are improper, the two-time presidential candidate
replied, ``It wouldn't be out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may insist that it is not the business of the press, he
added, ``but on matters of public policy, it is your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he himself would answer if asked whether he had used
illegal drugs, Jackson said, ``It would be no. And I would have to
answer, in part because I spend so much time in schools talking
about it.''

FROM BUGS TO RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Aug. 30)  
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am always on the lookout for a new get-rich-quick scheme,
which is why I was so excited by the news that a Japanese
businessman recently shelled out $90,000 for a beetle.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are apparently in love with bugs, which could
explain why so many of them flock to Orlando, Fla., in the
summertime. Tourism officials may like to think its Mickey and
Pluto that lure Japanese tourists, but its possible the real
attraction is central Florida's abundant insect life.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests at least two moneymaking opportunities,
either one of which could be my long-awaited ticket out of this
dead-end job and into the glamorous world occupied by Bill Gates
and his ilk.
</P>
<P>
   The first idea is simply to sell any and all surplus bugs I have
scuttling around my house, yard and garage to the highest Japanese
bidder. I will specialize in cockroaches, of course, but I will
advertise them as ``palmetto bugs'' because that sounds classier
and will probably net me an additional $5,000 per specimen.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese businessman, who refused to be identified, paid
$90,000 for a 3-inch stag beetle, a black bug that comes equipped
with a nasty-looking set of pincers. Truth be told, it does not
look anything like our common, ordinary, everyday, tool-shed
cockroach, but being the visionary entrepreneur that I am, I do not
see that as an insurmountable obstacle. I will simply set up a cozy
little sweat shop in Indonesia where 12-year-olds can work 16 hours
a day painting my Florida cockroaches black and gluing little fake
horns on their faces. For this I will pay my workers 52 cents an
hour, which is 10 cents more an hour than Nike pays its workers. As
you can see, I will be an aggressive businessman, but a
compassionate one, too.
</P>
<P>
   (I have never been to Indonesia but it would not surprise me if
there is an abundant supply of robust cockroaches available right
there. If so, that would save me a bundle in shipping costs,
savings that I would compassionately pass along to, well ... me.)
</P>
<P>
   I am not so starry-eyed as to think that all my doctored
cockroaches, excuse me, palmetto bugs, would sell for $90,000
apiece. After I sold my first, say, 100,000, the law of supply and
demand would probably take over and I would have to slash prices to
somewhere in the neighborhood of $75,000 apiece. Maybe even throw
in a desiccated mole cricket for free if that's what it takes to
keep sales humming. We international entrepreneurs have to be
flexible, or so I hear.
</P>
<P>
   Once Japan becomes saturated with fake Florida stag beetles, it
will be time to open a much-needed new theme park in the Orlando
area catering to the peculiar fantasies of insect-lovers worldwide.
I haven't really settled on a name for my new theme park, but I'm
thinking along the lines of ``Bug Island'' or, perhaps,
``Creepy-Crawly World.''
</P>
<P>
   For the low, low price of a $60 daily admission ticket ($70 for
senior citizens), you'll be able to choose from a wide variety of
thrilling rides, including Tunnel of Fire Ants, Giant Leech Flume
and Slap Mountain. Our world-famous troupe of Dancing Termites will
perform in the Sawdust Theater at 2, 4, 6 and 8 p.m. Wrestling fans
nt to be on hand with the Giant, Spitting Grasshopper meets
the Voracious Tomato Worm in a steel-cage, loser-leaves-town death
match.
</P>
<P>
   No theme park would be complete without a monorail, and Bug
Island will be no different. But how are you going to observe a
bunch of insects crawling around on the ground from 150 feet in the
air? Simple. At Bug Island, the bugs ride the eye-level monorail
and you just stand there and watch the show go by.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're saying. You're saying, ``Dave, this is a
brilliant concept and you've clearly thought of everything. Would
you allow me to hurl a large sum of money in your direction to help
your dream become a reality?''
</P>
<P>
   Being the aggressive but compassionate businessman that I am, my
answer would be a qualified ``certainly,'' the qualification being
that I cannot accept any contributions smaller than $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   But if you act quickly and you'll receive a free cockroach,
excuse me, palmetto bug, from my laundry room as well as a small
vial of black paint, glue and a set of cardboard horns with which
you can transform your bug into a valuable stag beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Call now; operators are standing by.

THE BEAUTY WORLD FOLLOWS THE MONEY TO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)  
(lh) 
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most fashionable young editors at places like Conde Nast and
Hearst might be expected to wrinkle their perfect noses at the
thought of anyone _ much less themselves _ hawking makeup online.
But how long can a girl sit back and watch her college classmates,
even the ones with no style at all, make a killing on Internet
IPOs?
</P>
<P>
   About as long as it takes mascara to dry. This fall, more than a
dozen well-financed Internet start-ups will begin selling cosmetics
directly to consumers on the Web. Most of those sites will be
shaped by former editors from the top fashion and beauty magazines:
places like Vogue, Elle and Mirabella.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally exciting, because you're involved in all these
areas that you never even knew existed,'' said Wendy Schmid, who
left her job as beauty editor at Vogue earlier this summer to be a
co-editor of one of the new sites, Beautyjungle.com. ``One minute
you're talking about the new eye shadow from Fendi, and the next
you're using words like `universal branding' and `broadband
communications.'''
</P>
<P>
   This exodus from the elegant corridors of the magazine world to
the rough-and-tumble frontiers of cyberspace may seem reckless,
because it's still uncertain whether consumers will actually buy
lipstick shades without trying them on. But lured with stock
options and creative control, they're taking the risk even if the
price may be a loss of status.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years of being royalty at magazines,'' said
Jean Godfrey-June, a former beauty editor of Elle who is now vice
president of editorial content at Beautyscene.com, which is set to
make its first appearance tomorrow, ``it's a little like you don't
exist. People say things like, `She used to be great,' like you're
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The new cyber-editors are hoping all that will change after the
fall debuts, which in the small world of the beauty industry is the
highlight of this season, as eagerly awaited as the fall fashion
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coming explosion of all these sites is foremost on
everyone's mind in the industry,'' said Kate Sullivan, director of
marketing at Nars, which is refurbishing its own Web site for the
fall. ``It's pretty much an obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the so-called ``prestige'' cosmetics _ a
$6-billion-a-year business that includes mainstream lines like
Clinique and niche brands like Trish McEvoy, Face and Nars _ have
been available almost exclusively at department store counters.
Reports that millions of women did their shopping last Christmas on
the Internet has fueled the belief among venture capitalists and
private investors that those same women can be persuaded to buy
makeup _ considered the ultimate touch-and-feel product _ online.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things in the Web's favor, said Sarah Kugelman, the
founder of Gloss.com, is what she calls a general dissatisfaction
with service at department stores. ``There was a time when you got
good, personalized service,'' she said, ``but those days are long
gone. Now, we're going to be able to give you better, more intimate
treatment over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thanksgiving, the airwaves, bus stops and magazines
themselves will be plastered with campaigns for such sound-alike
sites as Beauty.com, Beautyscene.com, Beautyjungle.com,
Ionbeauty.com and Ibeauty.com.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrids of information and commerce, most of the sites will
offer the service journalism found in beauty sections of magazines,
but with an interactive twist. And e-commerce: Their real goal is
to sell. Consumers will be able to place instant orders for the
products they have just read about online.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Eve.com and the other start-ups have encountered a
powerful obstacle: the manufacturers. None of the sites has been
able to land any big names yet. Only small lines like English
Ideas, Joey New York and Bloom, which until now have lacked
high-powered national distribution, have been willing to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make this work, they really need to get big players, and
that's going to take some time and a lot of money,'' said Evie
Dykema, who studies online retail strategies for Forrester Research
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The major suppliers are wary of damaging longstanding
relationships with department stores. Many, like Estee Lauder and
Francois Nars, have Web sites of their own.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the ex-magazine crowd at the new sites to show
manufacturers that these are cyber-environments too cool to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The sites' plans for differentiating themselves in Web design
and editorial features are shrouded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Some may have online beauty consultants or a way for consumers
to scan in photos of themselves and then test makeup interactively.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do something completely different than the
magazines,'' said Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure
magazine, whose own former beauty editor, Martha McCully, is now
developing a beauty Web site for Oxygen Media. ``The great thing
that they have going for them is that they don't have to play by
the same rules. There are no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the former magazine editors insist they will
maintain the kind of editorial integrity that is expected in print
media, meaning they won't push only the products they sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to writing about lots of things that aren't
going to be advertised or sold on the site,'' said Dorothy Schefer,
formerly of Mirabella, who is now the editor and publishing
director of Gloss.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sam Waksal, a biotechnology entrepreneur who, along with
a group of investors, has put more than $40 million into
Ibeauty.com, has a more nuts-and-bolts strategy. The best-financed
of the start-ups, Ibeauty.com plans to offer incentives to
customers in exchange for in-depth demographic information, which
it hopes will be an irresistible lure to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Waksal dismissed the editorially driven approach of his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people who come from fashion magazines think all you
have to do is just throw up an article once a month,'' he said.
``They're going to have a rude awakening.''

 &HT;    LEADERS SAY STATES NEED MORE RESOURCES TO PROBE HATE CRIMES
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government should revise the laws to
give states more resources to investigate hate crimes, civic and
religious leaders said Friday at a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   States have had little trouble prosecuting hate crimes, but
gathering resources in the initial stages of investigations has
been problematic in some cases, said Keenan Keller, minority
counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the panel recounted numerous episodes of hate crimes
among racial, ethnic, sexual and gender lines, including the July
killing spree in Illinois and Indiana by a member of the World
Church of Christ that left two people dead and nine wounded, and
the attack on a Jewish community center in Los Angeles this month.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was organized in part to commemorate the 1963 March on
Washington in which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gave his
historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech. His son, Martin Luther King
III, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Council, gave
the closing address at the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   King said he is frustrated that so much remains to be done so
long after his father's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-two years later we're still trying to find ways to
address'' issues that the elder King fought against, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   King attributed the lack of action to the country's ``hidden
hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to say one thing and do another. America waves the
banner of separation while telling us we all belong,'' he said.
``Until you get to the root of hatred, new hate groups will spring
up where old ones existed.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel discussion was organized by the Center for
Constitutional Rights, a non-profit legal and educational group.

   DENNIS _ Hurricane Dennis buffets fragile Bahamian islands with
gusty winds and threatens to strengthen into a major storm that
could imperil the eastern seaboard of the United States by Sunday.
From hundreds of miles away, Dennis kicks up waves that excite
surfers off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, prompting the
governor to put state troopers on alert. National Guard troops
prepare for storm duty in South Carolina and a hurricane watch is
posted for Florida's east coast. (MManuel/MWilliams/Burritt/JDavis,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

</P>
<P>
   CANE-MAIN _ Hurricane Dennis is now a threat to northern Florida
as the National Hurricane Center issues a warning for Brevard
County north to the Carolinas. The low-pressure system didn't do as
much as expected to push Dennis offshore. (Staletovich, Palm Beach
Post).
</P>
<P>
   CANE-DROUGHT _ One disaster _ drought _ could be alleviated by
another _ hurricane. Farmers in South Carolina, North Carolina and
south Georgia have been rocked by drought this summer. Late-summer
hurricanes Fran and Bertha actually helped the North Carolina
tobacco harvest three years ago when they provided much needed
moisture. Last year, Bonnie meandered along the coast and brought
much-needed rain _ but also blew down corn and tobacco. Some
farmers will be glad to welcome the rain from Hurricane Dennis,
which lingers in the Atlantic. It just depends where they are.
Checking with Texas agriculture people to see what farmers thought
of Hurricane Bret earlier this month. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 22.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA-SHOOT _ Security officers at Frederick Douglass High
School in west Atlanta heard shots and found one man, early 20s,
dead in a car about two blocks behind the school. Police apparently
have in custody three young men seen running from the car. No
students involved. Motive unknown at this time.

   GAWILD-KINGDOM _ Wild Kingdom's Jim Fowler is planning an 1,800
acre wild kingdom of his own on the Georgia coast. The park, to

public-private funds. (Davis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   SCHOOLBUS _ WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley,
celebrities and school officials, all seeking to involve more
parents and citizens in their local schools, take a three-day
``back to school bus tour'' this week through Tennessee, Alabama,
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. (Mollison, Cox News

   GAS-ADDITIVE _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ The courts may decide the fate
of a controversial gasoline additive that has caused friction
between several East Texas cities and the state's environmental
agency. A ban on the gasoline additive methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether
has been sought by officials from Longview, Marshall and Tyler as
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission considered rules

   WACO _ WASHINGTON _ A few days before the fiery and
controversial ending to the 1993 standoff with members of the
Branch Davidian religious cult, FBI officials met with an Army
Special Forces commander from Ft. Bragg, N.C., and a chemical
weapons specialist from the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground to
discuss the Waco siege, records show. The subject of the
discussions was not revealed. In letters dated April 16, three days
before the Branch Davidian compound burned, William S. Sessions,
then director of the FBI, wrote to the Army Special Forces colonel
at Ft. Bragg, N.C., a toxicologist at Aberdeen and the assistant
commander of the First Cavalry Division at Ft. Hood, Texas,
thanking them ``for coming to FBI Headquarters for the discussions
that related to the standoff in Waco, Texas.'' The three letters
were released to Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of Information
Act. (Nesmith, Cox News Service). 30.

<P>
   Car dealers and manufacturers naturally have a love-hate
relationship. Neither can prosper without the other's cooperation
and good will, but tensions are common over everything from
supplies of cars to prices to marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz USA, the DaimlerChrysler subsidiary that sells
Mercedes cars in the United States, is having an especially tense
time with some of its dealers over a new policy aimed at
eliminating negotiation between dealers and customers. Other car
makers have been experimenting with other forms of no-haggle
pricing, but so far only one, the Saturn division of General
Motors, has successfully adopted the approach on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes says its new policy, called NFP, for negotiation-free
process, is meant to turn dealers into ``retailers'' and customers
into loyal, satisfied ``clients,'' according to a manual it
supplies to dealers. But dealers are divided over the policy, which
some think is really meant to restrict their competitive freedom
and carve into their profits. And one who tried to buck the system,
saying it amounted to institutionalizing illegal price-fixing, had
his franchise revoked two weeks ago, for what Mercedes says are
unrelated reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Mercedes and Coast Automotive Group, &UR;  &LR; a Toms
River, N.J., dealership owned by Tamim Shansab, has turned very
nasty. Shansab, 34, has sued Mercedes, several of its executives
and a number of neighboring Mercedes dealers, contending that the
defendants used a variety of underhanded tactics, including
starving him of cars, bribing his employees and spreading negative
rumors among his customers, to punish him for failing to go along
with the N.F.P. policy or with the informal price-fixing that he
said went on earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes, in turn, has sued Coast, contending that it breached
its dealership agreement and accusing Shansab of refusing to comply
with company rules about the use of its trademarks. Each side
dismisses the other's suit as trumped-up nonsense, and no
settlement appears to be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between Mercedes and some of its dealers are
flaring at a time when Mercedes cars and sport utility vehicles are
selling well in the United States. Volume has doubled over the last
five years, and 1999 sales are running ahead of last year's record
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes says it has benign motives for the no-negotiation
policy; it aims ``to build long-term relationships'' by replacing
the ``adversarial nature of price negotiations,'' said Donna
Boland, Mercedes-Benz USA's corporate communications manager.
</P>
<P>
   Several dealers around the country, who would speak only on
condition of anonymity, said there was widespread confusion over
how Mercedes' policy would work in practice. Many are nervous that
their margins, which they say Mercedes has already reduced from 20
percent to 7 percent in recent years, will be squeezed further. And
several dealers said they were skeptical that the policy _ or their
profits _ would survive if the economy slowed and demand slackened.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel K. Skinner, a former secretary of transportation who is
now practicing law in Chicago, said he has been approached by a
group of Mercedes-Benz dealers to explore the formation of a
national dealers association to safeguard their interests. ``A lot
of dealers are concerned about the new program,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes emphasizes in its dealer manual that it will not
dictate prices, as Saturn and most others who have tried a
no-haggle policy have done. Instead, Mercedes dealers are
``encouraged to establish pricing for cars, products and services
appropriate to their market area.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the part that sets Shansab's teeth on edge. He said that
ever since he bought the Toms River dealership, which had defaulted
on its debts, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 1991 and
turned it into one of the top performers in the New York region,
Mercedes officials had repeatedly pressured him to meet with other
area dealers to discuss prices and to refrain from competitive
pricing. ``I was told that if customers shop the dealers and find
that prices are the same, they'll just buy the car at the higher
price and everyone will make more money,'' he said. ``If I went
along, competing dealerships wouldn't target my customers. If I
didn't, I'd suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the new policy, which Mercedes began phasing in early
this year, ``coordination'' of prices among dealers was spotty and
informal, Shansab said, but he contends that the new policy
practically forces dealers to collude. ``It won't work unless you
know what your area dealers charge, and there are penalties for
selling outside your `area of influence,''' he said, referring to
dealers' assigned sales territory. The penalties deny dealers bonus
payments if more than 35 percent of their sales are to customers
outside their territory, according to the Mercedes manual.
</P>
<P>
   Other dealers said that the policy could not work unless
Mercedes policed the dealers and punished those who broke ranks,
and that Mercedes officials had indicated a willingness to do so in
meetings with dealers. But the Mercedes manual says it is voluntary
and that dealers are free to set their own prices.

</P>
<P>
   Experts in antitrust law said Mercedes might be skating on thin
legal ice if Shansab and other concerned dealers are right about
the policy's practical implications. ``The law allows a
manufacturer unilaterally to announce prices and decide whom it
will deal with,'' said Albert A. Foer, president of the American
Antitrust Institute, a research and advocacy group in Washington.
``But if it tries to restructure an existing relationship by
organizing dealers to set prices jointly, this sounds like
price-fixing, and it is illegal per se.''
</P>
<P>
   Foer, who is a lawyer, a former retail executive and a former
Federal Trade Commission official, added that a voluntary program
``might amount to an invitation to collude that really isn't
voluntary, depending on what pressures are brought to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
Law School, said that if Shansab's version of events was accurate,
he was right to refuse to participate. ``It's standard antitrust
advice that if a competitor starts talking about prices,
immediately leave the room,'' Kovacic said. ``Collective action
among rivals concerning prices is very dangerous.'' He added that
any collusion between dealers and a manufacturer to damage an
uncooperative dealer would clearly be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Responding by e-mail to an inquiry about the pricing policy, Ms.
Boland, the Mercedes spokeswoman, said, ``All of our actions are,
and always have been, in compliance with applicable laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Shansab also said Mercedes officials engaged in questionable
practices like demanding bribes in exchange for allocations of
popular models in short supply. Scandals over practices in car
allocation have rocked other auto makers in the past, notably Honda
Motor in the early 1990s and Toyota Motor in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   When Shansab balked at fixing prices and paying bribes, he said,
Mercedes retaliated by cutting his inventory, sticking him with the
least salable models and disparaging his dealership to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boland of Mercedes-Benz said the contentions of bribery
solicitations were part of `` Shansab's tissue of innuendo,
speculation and potentially slanderous accusations.'' She called
Shansab's lawsuit ``spurious and totally without foundation'' and
said it would be ``inappropriate to publicly debate'' the specifics
of his allegations. ``Any allegation of impropriety with respect to
an MBUSA employee is total fabrication,'' she added in an e-mail
message.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes executives named individually in Shansab's lawsuit
referred requests for comment to Ms. Boland or were said to be
unavailable; executives of the neighboring Mercedes dealerships
named in Shansab's suit were also said by employees to be
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One former Mercedes executive, who is not named in the lawsuit,
supported the suit's accusation that the company pressured Shansab
to keep prices in line with neighboring dealers'. That executive,
Wes Simmons, a Mercedes service operations manager for the New York
region from 1994 to 1998, said, ``I heard one official speak of
pressuring Shansab on pricing and urge him to stick with other
dealers and not go below their desired price.'' Simmons said he
also heard an official tell one of Shansab's employees that Shansab
would soon be out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the Mercedes' suit against Shansab, Ms. Boland
characterized things differently. ``We repeatedly attempted to work
with Shansab to improve his operations,'' she said. ``He, however,
has been unwilling to work with us to this end. We had no recourse
but to terminate'' his franchise, she said. ``The simple fact is
that this dealer was deficient in a number of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Shansab said the basis on which his franchise was revoked _
unapproved signs and interior decoration _ was a transparent
pretext. ``They made compliance a moving target, and moved
aggressively once I filed my lawsuit,'' he said. ``They wanted to
cut off my revenue stream and my ability to fight them in court.''
He said he submitted design after design to Mercedes, and received
no response when he asked the company to specify what it was
looking for. Instead, Mercedes began offering to buy him out at
fire-sale prices, he said, and promised his territory to other
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Shansab's Mercedes franchise raises due process
concerns, said Jim Appleton, director of the New Jersey Coalition
of Automotive Retailers, which is looking at the case to see if New
Jersey's franchise protection laws against arbitrary termination
may have been ignored. ``I can't speak to specific charges of
improprieties, but manufacturers have a range of ways to grind down
and intimidate adversaries,'' he said. ``Manufacturers always
respond in ways that bleed small dealers.'' He added, ``That's why
franchise laws recognize that the manufacturer has the upper
hand.''

They have unintended consequences that outweigh whatever benefits
they may provide. For instance, a tax break called flexible
spending accounts encourages extra medical spending on

the remains of the 229 people who died when a Swissair jet crashed
a year ago off Canada's Atlantic coast may have been the simple
part. The hardest part may have been deciding how to handle 23
coffins filled with remains so small they have not been identified.
Only in the last few weeks have Nova Scotia officials, religious
leaders of several faiths and the people of Halifax agreed on a
solution: a mass burial and funeral rites this week to mark the
anniversary of the Sept. 2 crash. By Matthew L. Wald.

   INEPT-LAWS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at some of the laws on
the books that have been enacted with the best of intentions but
that turned out to work at cross-purposes with government policy.
They have unintended consequences that outweigh whatever benefits
they may provide. For instance, a tax break called flexible
spending accounts encourages extra medical spending on
non-essentials while the government's goal is to hold down medical
costs. Government flood insurance emboldens people to build and
occupy homes in flood-prone areas, which the government is trying
to discourage. By David E. Rosenbaum.

   URBAN-ENVIRON-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ Minority leaders from
inner-city communities have found themselves in an unlikely
alliance with big business as part of a national campaign to make
it easier for industry to develop pollution-blighted properties,
commonly referred to as brownfields, by easing the costly clean-up
standards that currently exist. This new approach has created
something of a crisis for the environmental movement. By Raymond
Hernandez.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Tony Shellman steps outside the midtown
Manhattan offices of Enyce, a small clothing designer, he never
knows what his trend-spotting antennae will hone in on.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Shellman, vice president of marketing and design at
the company, went shopping for a new backpack. What he found
instead, was a colorful, rugged, water resistant fabric that his
company turned into jackets for its fall men's line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stumble across some of our inspiration by just walking down
the street,'' Shellman said, explaining that he and the company's
design team are as likely to find inspiration in a hardware or auto
parts store as at a downtown nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Such vigilant design strategies, coupled with nontraditional
apparel marketing techniques, are helping Enyce (pronounced
eh-nee-chay) and other cutting edge fashion companies attract the
attention of the approximately 70 million American young people
dubbed Generation Y.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as department stores seek to lure back the rapidly
growing numbers of younger shoppers, they are increasing floor
space for teen styles and courting trendy urban clothing lines like
Fubu, Mecca, PNB Nation, Sean John, Ecko and Phat Farm, which once
could only hope to find space at specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   For large retailers, the economic benefits of selling to young
customers are too significant to ignore, according to Irma Zandl,
president of Zandl Group, a market research firm that tracks youth
trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest number of teens since the baby boomers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the back-to-school shopping season gets underway, the firm's
research suggests that teens will be clamoring for backpacks with
large, comfortable straps, Velcro closings and lots of pockets,
along with brightly colored sneakers. And the popularity of vests
will be ``huge,'' Ms. Zandl said, especially in bright hues and
fabrics with a high-tech feel.
</P>
<P>
   Generation Y _ the children of baby boomers, born mostly in the
1980s and 1990s and raised in a general age of affluence _ dwarfs
its shorter-age-span predecessor, Generation X, the roughly 45
million people born between 1965 and 1978. Estimates are that this
newest group of consumers already has about $150 billion to $250
billion in spending power each year _ almost a third spent on
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, instead of spending as much on the widely popular
urban clothing styles which had their origins as the baggy,
oversized, logo emblazoned fashions favored by rap musicians and
black street gangs, teen-agers will see fashions that are a little
more streamlined and stylish, combining elements of casual,
athletic and dressier clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even traditional companies like Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.
are revamping their offerings and shifting their focus away from
the baby boom generation that grew up on jeans.
</P>
<P>
   As teens browse among the clothing racks of department and
specialty stores in search of what everybody else is wearing, many
are likely to encounter Enyce's take on the de rigueur look: Button
front woven shirts come in muted oranges, blues and browns, while
Hawaiian-style printed shirts feature leaf, taxi, stamp, skier and
penguin designs.
</P>
<P>
   Drawstring cargo pants are part of the offering, of course. So
are loose-fitting jeans in raw, Belgian and waxed denim, available
in colors ranging from khaki and dark rinse blue to chocolate and
black. Waterproof red and gray snowboarding suits feature a hooded
jacket lined with mesh fabric that absorbs sweat.
</P>
<P>
   There is one item Enyce won't sell, though: vests. ``We let
everybody else do it,'' Shellman said.
</P>
<P>
   But persuading teen-agers to buy what Enyce and other hip
fashion houses are selling is no sure thing. Companies are making a
big bet on one of the ficklest groups of consumers _ as Nike and
Reebok have seen _ who have shown their ability to hurt a brand by
turning away from a style or dismissing poor products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big brands are at an inherent disadvantage when talking to
teens,'' said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, a
research firm. ``They have grown up distasteful and wary of a hard
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Courting a generation of skeptical consumers who have been
weaned on the visual immediacy of MTV and the speed of the Internet
requires apparel marketing strategies with new twists. These
include enlisting high profile musicians to wear specially designed
outfits for concerts and in-store appearances. Within stores, music
CD's are the product giveaway of choice, and disk jockeys even play
records in the aisles between the clothing racks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as always, it helps if parents are befuddled by the
music and the message and maybe even a little wary as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is all the harder for brands popular with baby
boomers to win the allegiance of their children. Levis, in seeking
to reinvigorate its trademark denim line, has picked up on the
strategies pursued by newer apparel companies and has stepped up
its sponsorship of music concerts and events. The company, the
largest apparel maker in the world, sponsors tours for musicians,
like Lauryn Hill, the Grammy award winner who has melded hip-hop
with a smoother Caribbean-style music, and the band Sugar Ray, a
surf 'n ska group. Performers often appear in clothing specially
designed for them by the company, and may get involved in the
design process, as Ms. Hill did.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers customers who purchase any Levis product
a CD compilation of music by lesser known musicians who perform at
Levis sponsored concerts as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the bands are totally relevant, but if you're outside
of the demographic you probably haven't heard of them before,''
said Mitch Berk, president of Entertainment Marketing, which
developed some of Levis new teen-focused promotions.
</P>
<P>
   At many of the concerts that Levis sponsors, the company offers
a special seating area for customers. While teens enjoy the music,
Levis trend spotters scan the area, paying close attention to what
everyone is wearing, Berk added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In-store promotions are part of the strategy as well. Earlier
this month, at Macy's flagship store in New York City, teen-age
girls screamed as Mark McGrath, lead singer of Sugar Ray signed
autographs, kissed cheeks and dutifully posed for photographers.
McGrath wore a specially designed, sweat resistant black T-shirt
and a pair of dark blue Levis 501 jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Trends change quickly. One of the things several companies and
retailers are forecasting this year is that logos on clothing other
than T-shirts will become smaller, eliminating the look of huge,
billboard style banners everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them the pieces you can only wear once a month because
the logos are so big,'' said Jeffrey Tweedy, executive vice
president of Sean John.
</P>
<P>
   Customer surveys also help Sean John stay on top of teen
preferences, Tweedy said, adding that the company uses surveys to
help establish prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Sean John, named after its founder, the rap impresario
Sean (Puffy) Combs, has had strong sales since its clothes began
appearing in March. Retailers said they had often racked up sales
gains of more than 10 percent a week, above average for a new
style.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, like Enyce, also have close ties to fashion
stylists who follow trends and scout unique styles for their
celebrity clients.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of such efforts, Shellman can also offer a running
list of celebrities and style setters who he says have worn the
company's clothing, including 'N Sync, Cindy Crawford, Steven
Spielberg, Jennifer Lopez, Brittney Spears, Usher, TLC and the
Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Among retailers, Macy's executives say the company is willing to
take a risk and try a variety of new styles in its stores. New
products, however, must show strong sales quickly or they are
removed from the store. Enyce fell victim to this in late 1997 and
was removed from the store. The company, which is owned by Fila
Holding, hopes it will regain space in the store early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Trend spotters for Bloomingdale's cover fashion shows around the
world. In addition, favorite trend spotting spots in Manhattan
include Balthazar and Fressen, two restaurants in lower Manhattan,
as well as Jeffrey's Room, a small store in the Fashion District.
``I'm in restaurants and clubs five nights a week, seeing what
people are wearing,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president
for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's. ``You have to cover it on
the runways and on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein predicts that vests will be popular items in a
variety of fabrics. Hot colors will include earth tones, such as
green, brown, rust and rich reds. In addition, clothes will fit
closer to the body. Also, cargo pants and anything with lots of
pockets should do well.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's is also gambling that a new generation of
teen-agers will gravitate toward retro styles inspired by the
coming Broadway musical, Saturday Night Fever. The musical is based
on the popular movie from the 1970s, which glorified the disco
nightclub culture.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing from the line may be a tough sell: Bloomingdales
plans to offer an updated version of the trademark white suit that
John Travolta wore in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing that white suit again, but in a white
microfiber,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Bloomingdales afraid of making a fashion blunder? ``If we
make a mistake, we mark it down,'' Ruttenstein said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Sean John's, Tweedy forecasts that cashmere sweaters, and
jean suits with long jackets will sell well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to some dressier styles, Sean John and Enyce are
among several companies offering a new version of cargo pants with
understated, zippered pockets.
</P>
<P>
   After that, what is the next big must-have look that Generation
Y will be clamoring for?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' confessed Evan Davis, senior vice president of
Enyce. ``After this we probably have to do 3-D.''

   ``In the long run, we're all dead,'' John Maynard Keynes once
said. And many investors may want to similarly dismiss their
value-oriented financial advisers, who often admonish them to shun
the high-priced stocks that have led the market to new highs and,
instead, focus on shares that are cheap on the basis of
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these investors think, a company's stock price will
 &UR; eventually &LR;  reflect its earnings and book value. But how long are
they supposed to wait for those so-called value stocks to climb?
</P>
<P>
   I have a suggestion for such investors: Try supplementing your
value investing with technical analysis, which focuses on
historical patterns of a stock's price and trading volume. In
contrast to value advisers, who look at how the market ought to
behave, technicians examine how it  &UR; does &LR;  behave. Technical
analysis can help keep a value investor from stubbornly fighting
the market for years on end.
</P>
<P>
   There are many types of technical analysis, but the most basic
tools are known as ``support'' and ``resistance'' levels. A stock's
support level is the price from which previous rallies have sprung;
a technically inclined investor who misses one rally will be
inclined to buy the stock if it falls back to the support level.
Enough such buying, of course, makes it difficult for the stock to
fall beneath that level.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a stock's resistance is the price where previous
rallies have failed. Technically minded owners of a stock who
didn't sell at the peak of a previous rally will be likely to sell
if the stock rebounds to that price. With enough selling pressure,
a stock will have difficulty penetrating its resistance level.
</P>
<P>
   Many value investors may find all this sacrilegious. For years,
such investors _ who are focused on fundamentals _ have ridiculed
technical analysis as little better than reading tea leaves. Yet
several academic studies have shown that there is something to it.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of these was published in 1992 by the finance
professors William Brock and Blake LeBaron of the University of
Wisconsin and Josef Lakonishok of the University of Illinois. They
tested various strategies that bought stocks at or near their
support levels and sold them at or near their resistance levels.
After the professors back-tested their strategies over 90 years,
they concluded that technical analysis can beat the market. Other
studies have found that technical analysis works in other markets
as diverse as commodity futures and foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Technical analysis has vindicated itself outside the ivory
tower, too. Every week since December 1983, the Value Line
Investment Survey has published a technical ranking of 1,700
popular stocks. This technical ranking system, whose exact
methodology is proprietary, is different than the system for which
Value Line is famous _ a nontechnical one that has successfully
used earnings and price momentum to gauge stocks' prospects.
</P>
<P>
   According to Value Line's internal calculations, not only has
its technical ranking system beaten the market over the last 15
years, it has performed even better than the flagship stock-ranking
system by 6.1 percentage points a year, on average, not accounting
for commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Technical analysis works because of investor psychology. Keynes
once likened investing to guessing which contestant will win a
beauty pageant. You don't pick the contestant you think is the most
beautiful, but instead the one that you think the judges will
choose. Similarly, a successful investor won't bet on companies he
thinks the market  &UR; should &LR;  value highly, but instead on those that
he thinks the market  &UR; will &LR;  value highly.
</P>
<P>
   Investors needn't give up on their value approach to incorporate
technical analysis. I believe the strategies can complement each
other. If a value investor wants to cut his stock exposure, for
example, then he should sell only those stocks that are near their
resistance levels. Or, choosing between two value stocks that
appear to be equally good bets, he could buy the one that is
closest to its support level.

<P>
   Last week, Americans got one step closer to being able to trade
stocks 24 hours a day. On Wednesday, Marketxt Inc. started a
trading operation that allows investors to buy and sell shares in
200 big companies between 6 and 8 p.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   Extended trading hours is just one way that technology is
remaking the nation's stock markets. Alternative stock exchanges,
known as electronic communications networks, where buyers and
sellers can meet without the intervention of a dealer, are another
technology-driven creation.
</P>
<P>
   A question to ponder: Who, if anyone, is minding the store of
new business ideas that seem to become realities on Wall Street
daily?
</P>
<P>
   Many securities industry veterans fear that the answer is
nobody, even as Americans steadily put more of their assets into
stocks. That makes all the more troubling another new idea _ the
plans by the nation's largest stock exchanges to become publicly
traded entities. Stocks, that is, with the need to produce
impressive earnings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much of this `Let the free enterprise system work'
that is a lot of nonsense,'' said one market sage, James J.
Needham, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and a
member of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1970s.
``The SEC was created to protect investors. I feel that this has
gone much too far without SEC supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Needham thinks the SEC should conduct public hearings into where
the securities markets are headed and how they will get there.
Muriel Siebert, the chairwoman of the Siebert Financial Corp.,
agrees, adding that there should be a moratorium on mergers or
other deals among players in the financial industry while
regulators, executives and investors sort through the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, disputed the notion that
supervision of the changes in the markets has been inadequate. ``No
regulator can create a template and say `March along,''' he said
last week. ``But this commission is going to place the public
interest foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the problem areas, regulation is the most crucial. For
example, what if an investor who felt wronged by his broker filed
an arbitration case against the firm with the newly public New York
Stock Exchange? And what if that firm was the largest shareholder
of the New York Stock Exchange? Would the regulatory arm of the
exchange have the courage to move against its biggest shareholder
if the broker was found to be at fault?
</P>
<P>
   Electronic communications networks, or ECN's, pose their own
risks. The biggest is the potential for a highly fragmented stock
market. For now, the price of General Motors, say, is based on
trades made by investors on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange. But if competing ECN's begin to trade GM shares, the
market in the stock will be disjointed. And if a brokerage firm
owns an ECN, the firm has an incentive to send its customers'
orders to the ECN rather than to the Big Board, even if the Big
Board has a better price on GM stock.
</P>
<P>
   These and other issues need a public airing, Needham said: ``The
viability and safety of the securities markets is at stake here.''

   Debt Load Grows For Poorer Borrowers
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan says personal bankruptcies have grown in recent
years because ``Americans have lost their sense of shame.'' But
analyses of lending data by several researchers suggests another
reason: Banks and credit card companies are loaning increasing
amounts of money to lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Census Bureau survey found that the Americans
having the hardest time paying their bills are single mothers, 28.5
percent of whom reported difficulty making ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Professor David Moss of the Harvard Business School and a
colleague, Gibbs Johnson, who studied Federal Reserve and other
records, say that even as the portion of total income earned by
households making less than $50,000 has dwindled, the share of
consumer debt held by those households has climbed. In 1983, these
households had 45 percent of income and owed 42 percent of consumer
debt, but by 1992 they earned 36 percent of income and held 56
percent of consumer debt.
</P>
<P>
   Another Census report shows that the trend has continued. It
suggests that when job growth slows, many people in cyclical
industries who have high debt loads will seek refuge in bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   _DAVID CAY JOHNSTON
</P>
<P>
   Economic Catch-Up
</P>
<P>
   More bachelor's degrees have gone to women than to men in the
United States every year since 1982. And of last year's 1.8 million
high school graduates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
69.1 percent of the women pursued further education, versus only
62.4 percent of the men. Two possible reasons for the disparity are
opposite sides of the same coin: men's higher earning power.
</P>
<P>
   Women, earning only 74 cents for every dollar earned by men,
``just have a more powerful incentive to get that degree,'' said
Anthony Carnevale, the vice president for public leadership at the
Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The hot economy, meanwhile, may be pulling men away from
college. Some traditionally male fields that pay high school
graduates relatively well, like machine tool-making and
construction trades, are eager for help. And young talent in the
computer industry, another area dominated by men, is being
recruited directly out of high school or after a couple of years of
college. ``I liken it to the big teams drafting high school and
college basketball players by dangling fat salaries,'' Carnevale
said. ``It interrupts their education, unfortunately, but the labor
market is just too good right now to resist.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the all-too-brief best of times at Brooklyn's
Coney Island, elephants in jeweled blankets sat on their tails and
waved their plump forelegs in the warm Atlantic breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Perched atop a water slide called Shoot the Chutes, the
big-bottomed beasts came thundering down, one by one, to smack the
water as only falling elephants can, drenching and delighting
paying customers at an amusement park called Dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   When Dreamland burned to the ground in 1911, a smaller, sadder
water spectacle was built on the same stretch of beach. To control
costs, pigs replaced pachyderms. Splashes were smaller and so were
the crowds. As Coney Island slid still further into dereliction,
pigs followed elephants into unemployment and the water slide
disappeared. Carnival operators tried to delight New Yorkers with
cockroach races.
</P>
<P>
   The devolution of the amusement park in the American imagination
can be quantified. In 1910 when there were 92 million people in the
United States there were 1,500 amusement parks. Today there are an
estimated 273 million Americans and just 600 amusement parks,
according to the National Amusement Park Historical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Roller coasters, the signature contraption of the amusement-park
era, also took a death-rattle dive. There were 1,520 in 1920, but
just 145 by 1979. Nostalgic thrill-seeking has since pushed the
number of roller coasters up to 550.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers, though, cannot explain what has been lost at Coney
Island, the amusement park that invented amusement parks, not to
mention the hot dog. For a splendid decade at the turn of the
century, Coney Island transcended the sleazy carny craft of
separating chumps from their money. It drew daily crowds of 90,000
at a time when 20,000 at a baseball game was a memorable event.
Adorned by minarets and spires and bedizened by more than a million
lights, Coney Island embodied what has been called the
``architecture of exhilaration.'' It connected with New York,
America and the world in a way that no other amusement park has
done before or since, offering visitors not just a good time, but a
jolt of incandescent wonder.
</P>
<P>
   To hear about what has been lost, one can drive to an apartment
on Manhattan's Upper West Side, pick up a novelist named Kevin
Baker and head out to Coney Island. There, amid the cackling of sea
gulls, the rumble of subway trains and the sick-sweet smell of
deep-fat-fried clams, Baker, author of ``Dreamland''
(HarperCollins, 1999), will rhapsodize about a time when a visit to
Coney Island was essential to understanding the American
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What got me writing was a show they had in Dreamland called
`Fighting Flames,''' Baker said. ``A fake tenement was set on fire,
and you would see the fake Fire Department run out and douse it.
Fake tenants would dive from windows. New Yorkers who lived in
constant fear of this happening in their own fire-trap tenements on
the Lower East Side would actually pay money to come out here and
see this. It really struck me that a lot of Coney Island had become
the pageant of their lives, a pageant in which they would see their
best hopes and worst fears for the future played out.''
</P>
<P>
   The decayed look of Coney Island gives Baker's stories an almost
painful poignancy. It's a fallen city by the shore where weeds are
swallowing a rotting roller coaster called the Thunderbolt, where a
weather-bleached sign on a sideshow trailer advertises the
``world's smallest horse,'' where low-income housing projects tower
over the garish remnants of a third-rate carnival.
</P>
<P>
   In his novel, which draws heavily on his 10 years as chief
historical researcher for Harold Evans' 1998 book, ``The American
Century,'' Baker uses Coney Island as a device to illuminate what
it was like to be alive in turn-of-the-century New York. What is
most striking about the amusement-park world that Baker recreates
is the cruelty that Coney Island routinely inflicted on its
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   A trick elevator sends people crashing to the ground. A greased
floor induces fun-seekers of all ages to fall on their faces.
Electrified benches shock patrons seeking rest, encouraging them to
shake a leg and spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great deal of humiliation involved,'' said Baker,
41, whose novel has been optioned to Leonardo DiCaprio's film
production company and who has a two-book contract with
HarperCollins to write a prequel and sequel to ``Dreamland.'' ``The
most amazing humiliation was after a ride called the Steeplechase.
When you got off the horse, you would have to go across this area
where jet streams of air would blow up women's skirts. A totally
mad-looking dwarf would attack you with a cattle prod for the
benefit of your fellow New Yorkers who were watching from the
laughing gallery of the Blowhole Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker contends that the periodic pain of having fun at Coney
Island was an echo of the deeper and more persistent misery of
living in New York when it was struggling to digest the largest
influx of immigrants in its history. It was a time when fathers
deserted families, when mothers worked 16-hour days, when
struggling immigrants made ends meet by taking in roomerkehs, or
boarders, three of whom would often rent eight-hour shifts in a
single bed. And out on the streets there was a poisonous mix of
gangsters, corrupt cops and the politicians who used them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Dreamland'' grows out of a made-up feud between
two real New York gangsters, circa 1910. The bad guy is Gyp the
Blood, whose real name was Harry Horrowitz and who really was a
sadistic bouncer at cheap dance halls on Manhattan's Lower East
Side. Gyp's specialty was breaking a man's back by bending him
backward over his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Gyp is doing exactly that at the start of the novel when he gets
whacked over the head by a shovel. The gangster with the shovel is
Baker's hero, Kid Twist, whose real name was Max Zweibach and who
really did kill six men. In ``Dreamland,'' though, Kid has a sense
of justice and a powerful love for a seamstress who turns out to be
Gyp's sister.
</P>
<P>
   After creasing Gyp's head with the shovel, Kid hides out in
Coney Island. He takes a room in a hotel-turned-bordello that is
shaped like an elephant. Like nearly everything in the novel, the
elephant brothel was a real establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's exuberantly descriptive novel uses the gangster's exile
as a device to walk readers through three spectacular amusement
parks, Dreamland, Luna Park and Steeplechase, which opened in Coney
Island from 1897 to 1904. Before movies and newsreels, they made
Coney Island the place to go not only for rides, games and cheesy
trips to the moon (where green dwarves served cheese), but also for
a glimpse of how the real world worked. They re-enacted pivotal
historical events like the Johnstown Flood and the Boer War. The
line between reality and re-enactment was sometimes difficult to
discern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Boer War was over in 1902, combatants came to Coney
Island to star in a show about the war,'' said Baker. ``The show
went bust and the players went down to South American to fight as
mercenaries. They went from real war, to fake war and back to real
war.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reality asserted itself with a vengeance when Dreamland burned
down in 1911. The other two parks soon lost their shimmer. Huge
crowds, often a million people a day, still came out to Coney
Island until the late 1950s. They came to swim and play and cool
off, but not to sate their imagination. Movies and television had
long since stolen away that role.
</P>
<P>
   Luna Park burned in 1944, and Steeplechase hung on until it was
closed in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was driven back to Manhattan, Baker lamented the
passing of what he called ``hands-on entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to a radio, you watch a screen,'' he grumbled.
``You don't have a dwarf poke you with a cattle prod.''

A NIGHT OUT WITH LL COOL J 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Born James Todd Smith in Queens, LL Cool J once
boasted in song about having gone ``from Hollis to Hollywood.'' On
Tuesday night, he slipped unannounced into the Loews 84th Street
Theater to watch his latest film, ``In Too Deep,'' with what he
called a ``real crowd,'' not the movie industry insiders of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black Fubu _ jacket, jeans and skullcap _ and
Timberland work boots, LL Cool J, a hulking rapper turned movie
star, waited for the lights to dim before creeping into the packed
theater with two friends. Then, sipping a jumbo soda, he slumped
low in his seat and stared up at himself playing God, the
psychopathic drug lord he portrays in the urban police thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not jaded,'' he said later of the audience.
``They're not here to pick the movie apart. They're not here to
talk about scripts and camera angles and cinematographers, you
know. They're here just to watch a movie, and that's who I want to
see it with.''
</P>
<P>
   The raucous crowd had arrived for a screening promoted by the
hip-hop radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM), and when its members began
yelling comments at the screen, LL Cool J yelled right along. After
one of the film's characters said he was going to ``roll up
incog-Negro,'' LL's laughter boomed louder than anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   The participatory call-and-response habits of urban movie
audiences have been a subject of commentary _ and sport _ for
comedians like Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock. At times, the
off-screen wisecracks seemed part of the show. Most of the remarks
were predictions of plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, I bet it's going to be like in `New Jack City,''' a man in
the row behind LL Cool J said. LL Cool J slumped farther down with
a grin. He and his friends murmured appreciatively during the love
scenes, and during a tense moment when God and his gangster crew
burst into an apartment for an ambush, LL Cool J broke the silence
with a rap lyric borrowed from Jay-Z: ``Three in the morning, it's
just us and the guns!''
</P>
<P>
   As the climax neared, LL Cool J popped out to the lobby and
returned clutching a couple of hot dogs. ``I'm not an egomaniac,''
he said later. ``I'm not going to stay in my seat because my big
scene is coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   His face was being projected on two screens in the Loews 84th
Street complex. In ``Deep Blue Sea,'' a shark thriller, he provides
the comic relief as a God-fearing chef. He said he had heard of
actors who could not watch themselves on the screen. ``But that's
crazy to me,'' he said. ``I've got to see my movie to see how I'm
acting, see what little things I can learn about my craft.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience at the Loews whistled and cheered when LL Cool J
made his first leering appearance as God. Later, when he was
stripped down to a tank top for a boxing workout, female voices
could be heard admiring his heavily developed, tattooed shoulders
and arms.
</P>
<P>
   What if the audience hadn't liked his performance? ``I already
know what it's like to get criticized, booed, whatever,'' said LL
Cool J, 31. ``I've had eight albums _ had some hits, some misses.
And I've come from hip-hop to movies. In hip-hop I deal with the
most fickle, brutal, truthful audience _ period.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the lights came on, so did the autograph hounds. He
scrawled LL Cool J on posters as he moved out to a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said he was looking forward to popping into another
theater the following night, maybe in Manhattan, maybe in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the Queens crowd to really bring the ruckus,'' he
said.

`THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE': A MARRIAGE MADE IN OUTER SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Astronaut's Wife'' arrived Friday in a veil of mystery.
How could a thriller starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron be so
bad that New Line Cinema, which has been in no hurry to release
this film, would not risk screening in advance for the press.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: as directed by Rand Ravich, it's actually a lot better
than these circumstances suggest. But as written by Ravich, a
screenwriter directing his debut feature, ``The Astronaut's Wife''
is ridiculously derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one has told the exact story of an astronaut who
experiences two minutes' worth of strangeness in space and then
comes home seeming, well,  &UR; different &LR; . But when his wife, Jillian
(Ms. Theron), becomes pregnant, it hardly seems coincidental to
find her in Mia Farrow's hairdo from ``Rosemary's Baby.'' Ms.
Theron's role in the much sharper ``Devil's Advocate'' was another
variation on that theme.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off an underutilized film noir sensibility, Depp plays
Comdr. Spencer Armacost, who is one part NASA and two parts Elvis.
(``They gon' be pilots, honey,'' he drawls sexily, when told that
Jillian is expecting twins.) Spencer is one of two crew members who
are nearly killed while on a mission, and the other (Nick
Cassavetes) flips out soon after returning to Earth. Spencer is
also madly in love with his wife, which the film emphasizes avidly.
``Hey, Jill, what are you wearing?'' he asks, when NASA lets him
telephone her in mid-flight.
</P>
<P>
   You and I and creatures in other galaxies can guess why Spencer
begins behaving peculiarly later on. But Ravich gives the film a
clean, sensuous look and tarts it up stylishly, doing what he can
to deflect attention from the obvious direction in which the story
is headed. While many of his flourishes are effective and visually
interesting, he also indulges in plenty of overkill. When Jillian
(abetted by Joe Morton as a NASA renegade) is upset by an audio
tape and angrily destroys it, the incinerator's-eye view of the
tape being thrown away is more than we need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Depp moves through the film suavely and imperturbably, never
letting the particulars bog him down. He bats not an eye when
Spencer moves to New York and becomes a corporate executive, for
instance, although the details don't even presume to make sense. He
and Ms. Theron, looking cherubically beautiful, establish a warm
rapport that would seem more natural if the film had anything else
to offer. And as for _ oops! _ the aliens, their designs on the
Armacosts prove to be awfully tepid. This film's answer to the
question of whether there is intelligent life elsewhere in the
universe: not too.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A ``hurricane watch'' was issued Friday for portions of
Florida's eastern coast as Dennis bore down on the eastern Bahamas,
packing winds of 80 miles an hour near its core. Saturday, Dennis
should slowly strengthen, as it sluggishly churns toward the
northwest. The storm is expected draw closer to the Florida and the
Southeast Coast Saturday night, bringing the threat for windswept
rain squalls. Dennis' ultimate path will be tenuously governed by
the complex interactions between it and the nearby jet stream.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions will improve across the Northeast on Saturday as the
lethargic low that has brought much needed rain to many areas
slides off the New England coast. Residual moisture behind the low
will cause clouds and a few showers to linger Saturday morning over
eastern New England. By midday, drier and warmer breezes from the
west will crumble the clouds, bringing increasing amounts of
sunshine. There is still a slight risk, however, for a brief
thundershower over interior New England later Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, high pressure will promote abundant sunshine and
seasonably warm conditions across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.
It will stay mainly sunny and hot from northern Texas and Oklahoma
to the interior Southeast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moisture from former Hurricane Bret will interact with a jet
stream disturbance, bringing thundershowers to the central and
eastern Rockies, while the West Coast stays mainly sunny and very
warm. Developing onshore breezes, however, will cause clouds and
cooler conditions to reach the Northwest Coast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rising Swells
</P>
<P>
   Surf along Florida's eastern coast began to build Friday as
Hurricane Dennis approached slowly from the southeast. Coupled with
a steadily falling barometer and the appearance of feathery cirrus
clouds on the eastern horizon that fan out ahead of a storm, rising
ocean swells once offered a fairly reliable forecasting tool for
mariners and people living near hurricane-vulnerable coasts. This
weather-wise rule dates back to careful weather observers around
the time of Christopher Columbus. With the advent of satellite
technology, such forecasting lores are gradually fading.  &QL;

FOLLOWING THE MONEY AND ARRANGING THE FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, I unleashed five $1 bills and one $20 bill. At the
top of them, I wrote a Web address: www.wheresgeorge.com.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that someone around the country will get the bill,
log in the serial number, and I will automatically be notified by
e-mail where that bill has traveled. And the person logging the
bill will be told the bill is in the database, and they will see a
list of where George (or Lincoln or Jackson or another dead
president) has been.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's useless as can be, but it's interesting. At least I'll
know where my money goes.
</P>
<P>
   I'll report back the first time I get a hit on the dollars, but
don't expect anything anytime soon. The ``hit rate'' for money
entered into the database is only 3 percent, so the chances are
slim, although it's possible for one bill to be entered into the
database in the morning and be reported that same afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Where's George? site, which started just before Christmas,
has more than 22,000 users who have entered 368,537 bills with a
worth of $1.9 million in U.S. currency. (The site tracks bills in
all denominations.) In case you're wondering and don't have a
calculator handy, the average user is keeping track of 16 bills
worth an average of about $5 each.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bills being tracked are dollars _ about three out of
every four. Most of the bills started their journey in New Jersey
(about 95,000 of them).
</P>
<P>
   Here's a route for a dollar bill that started in Pine Brook,
N.J., on June 25: Nineteen days later, the bill turned up in Glen
Rock, about 18 miles away. In mid-August (32 days after the initial
entry), a convenience store clerk received it in Carbondale, Pa.,
nearly 100 miles from where it originally started.

   Furniture Arranging
</P>
<P>
   Want to avoid some heavy lifting the next time furniture needs
to be rearranged? Visit the Ladies' Home Journal Online site:
www.lhj.com. There's a newly expanded Furniture Arranger. It allows
users to try new floor plans on the Web site. Click on the
``special features'' link.
</P>
<P>
   The site is updated from its debut last year when it only
offered living room arrangement. Recently, bedroom and home office
furniture have been added.
</P>
<P>
   Users type room dimensions and select from more than 100
furniture pieces and architectural details to duplicate their room
onscreen. Then they can simply click and drag furniture in the
space.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture arranger provides design and placement tips as the
room is being arranged to help make the final product balanced and
easy to live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Furniture Arranger proved to be one of the most popular
features on our Web site,'' said Myrna Blyth, editor-in-chief and
publishing director of Ladies' Home Journal. ``The addition of the
bedroom and home office will make this an even more valuable and
fun tool for our users.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    LAST COSMONAUTS HEAD FOR HOME AS RUSSIA MOTHBALLS MIR
 &HT;    ATTN EDs: The 8th graf of the story should be updated later
following the astronauts landing; expected at 8:15 p.m. EDT
 &HT;    With MIR-BOX-0828.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With no fanfare and much regret, Russia abandoned the
Mir space station early Saturday as its three-man crew departed the
battered, 13-year-old complex in preparation for its fiery tumble
from orbit early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The completion of Mir's final scientific mission marks the end
of a bittersweet era of Soviet and Russia space exploration that
began with the triumphal launch of the world's first satellite,
Sputnik, in 1957, and the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War over and the Soviet Union gone, Russia can no
longer afford a dominant role in space. It lacks the money to keep
its hobbling space station aloft while also participating in the
new International Space Station being led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mir, launched in 1986, became mankind's first permanently
inhabited space station and was not expected to operate much longer
than five years.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia's status in the world steadily eroding over the
decade, Mir _ which means ``peace'' and ``world'' in Russian _
became an important symbol of the nation's scientific competence
and staying power. With ingenuity, luck and millions of dollars in
U.S. and European assistance, Mir remained in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are leaving with a bitter heart, we are leaving a little
piece of Russia,'' senior cosmonaut Viktor Afanasyev said, before
he and his two crewmates floated from Mir into their space capsule
for their return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Another crew will visit Mir next February or March, but only to
prepare it for its crash into Earth. Parts of the station will burn
up in the atmosphere, while the larger modules will splash into the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmonauts Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev and Frenchman
Jean-Pierre Heignere closed the docking hatches connecting Mir with
their Soyuz-TM spacecraft and detached from the station after 1
a.m. (local time) on Saturday (5 p.m. Friday EDT). They are to land
three hours later in a deserted plain in the former Soviet republic
of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday will be the first day since 1989 that humans have not
occupied Mir, which has made more than 77,000 orbits of earth and
was a laboratory for some 17,000 scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Russia shared Mir _ and its many problems _ with
other nations, including the United States, which sent seven
astronauts aboard between 1995 and June 1998. The station was
plagued by fires, breakdowns and computer failures, including a
1997 collision with an unmanned cargo ship that nearly ended in
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's cash-starved government tried desperately to find a way
to keep Mir alive. It put the station up for sale and even
considered a $100 million offer from a British businessman, which
in the end turned out to be bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Russian space officials concluded that Mir _ costing
between $150 million and $250 million a year to operate _ must die.
The head of the Russian Space Agency said recently that sending
further missions to Mir would be like playing ``Russian roulette in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   In about a week, Mission Control in Korolyov will transmit the
final radio command to shut down the main computer aboard Mir and
the guidance system maintaining the station's attitude in orbit.
Systems will continue to keep the craft heated, but otherwise Mir,
weighing 130 tons, becomes the world's largest hunk of space junk.
</P>
<P>
   American astronaut Shannon Lucid, who spent 188 days aboard the
station, compared the passing of Mir to the sentimental selling of
an old and dear home. ``You've really enjoyed living in the house
and maybe your kids were born there. But then there comes a point
when you need those extra bedroom and you need to move,'' she told
reporters in America.
</P>
<P>
   During its life, Mir became post-Soviet Russia's greatest status
symbol and, in later years as its problems multiplied, its most
embarrassing joke. It developed a cult following _ groups are now
taking up collections to try and keep in aloft _ and became the
punchline of Tonight Show host Jay Leno's monologues.
</P>
<P>
   But space experts agree that Mir gave the world its first
sustained practice at long-endurance space flight, valuable
experience as the 16-nation International Space Station, now being
assembled, takes shape and talk continues of a possible mission to
Mars sometime in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is experience that nobody else in this world has,'' said
Alain Fournier-Sicre, director of the Moscow office of the European
Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A small, grassroots movement to save Mir held a rally in Moscow
last month and attempted to garner collections to save the station,
with little signs of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the New York-based Space Frontier Foundation, an
interest group dedicated to promoting space exploration, has begun
a ``Keep Mir Alive'' campaign and is soliciting donations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russian space officials say they see little that could
change in the next six months to prevent Mir's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to bring the Mir down on the bed of the Pacific
Ocean with honor rather than prolong its service life until serious
troubles occur that will mar its place in history as a unique
example of Russian space engineering,'' said Yuri Koptev, general
director of the Russian space agency.

 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's where we shot `The Pope of Greenwich
Village,''' said Rocco Musacchia, a man whose stocky build, dapper
bearing and silk sport jacket elicited gapes from tourists at the
sidewalk tables along Mulberry Street, in Little Italy. ``Down the
block, we shot `Mickey Blue Eyes,''' he continued. ``And right over
there we shot `Donnie Brasco.'''
</P>
<P>
   Musacchia is a technical adviser for movie-location work. His
most recent assignment was ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' a new romantic
comedy in which Hugh Grant plays a diffident Englishman who falls
for a mob princess and blunders his way into her family's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Musacchia was talking about New York City locations associated
in both cinematic legend and real life with the Mafia, an
organization that he does not concede exists. Asked if a building
on Mulberry Street that once housed Umberto's Clam House was, in
fact, the site of the real-life murder in 1972 of a reputed mobster
by the name of Joseph (Crazy Joe) Gallo, Musacchia ignored the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Musacchia walks a thin line, in his shiny tasseled loafers,
between Hollywood's fascination with the Mafia and the
organized-crime families whose history plays big at the multiplex
as both farce and fact, and sometimes something in between.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Musacchia, who is 60, is proud to be known as a man
with friends all over New York, New Jersey and Connecticut who can
help him open doors and get things done.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he does not want anyone to get the wrong
impression. After all, this is 1999. The Ravenite Social Club, once
the lair of John Gotti, is now a boutique selling home furnishings.
Art galleries have infiltrated the storefront social clubs and
Italian restaurants on Mulberry Street.
</P>
<P>
   In publicizing ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' Grant and Elizabeth Hurley,
the film's executive producer, have suggested that their research
into the New York underworld was assisted by a man who is what they
used to call connected. In the current issue of Jane magazine, Ms.
Hurley, who said she was ``obsessed'' with the Mafia, lavishes
praise on Musacchia, whom she refers to as the link between the
likes of Al Pacino, Johnny Depp and Barry Levinson and the kind of
men who could be on FBI surveillance lists.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN last week, Grant said that Musacchia ``introduced us to
another guy called Jimmy Seven Heads, who then introduced us to
another guy called Tony Mussolini and, one by one, we got deeper
and deeper into that world.'' Speaking to the Cox News Service,
Grant observed that Musacchia's presence seemed to help head off
location problems: ``Anywhere we wanted to shoot, we could shoot,''
Grant said. ``We had no teamsters problems whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant was undoubtedly giving Musacchia undue credit on this
score. Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Film,
Theater and Broadcasting, which oversees location shooting in New
York City, said: ``It's ludicrous! You do not have to deal with the
Mafia to shoot a film in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Musacchia is coy about his ability to provide entree to the New
York underworld, attributing his success to a combination of hard
work, street smarts, exhaustive networking and experience gained
from location work in more than a dozen movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysterious connections, mysterious connections,'' he said with
a laugh. ``The fact is, everything is legitimate today.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1987 federal investigation into mob influence in the record
distribution business, Musacchia, who has also worked in the music
business, was identified in an FBI affidavit as the partner of a
ranking member of the Genovese crime family. He was not charged.
``They gave me immunity,'' he said. ``I took the Fifth and that was
it.'' He denied that he was ever a member of any organized crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   The director John Huston, ``came to my rescue in the film
industry,'' said Musacchia, who was hired as an adviser on Huston's
``Prizzi's Honor,'' despite the bad publicity generated by the FBI
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   In the back room of In Bocca al Lupo, Musacchia sipped his
mineral water. This Mulberry Street bistro, which everybody calls
Cha Cha's, after its owner, John (Cha Cha) Ciarcia, is a haunt not
of mobsters but the actors who play them. The walls are lined with
photos of the mustachioed proprietor posing with Marlon Brando,
Danny DeVito and Danny Aiello, often surrounded by neighborhood
characters who have played bit parts in various mob movies.
</P>
<P>
   One of Musacchia's specialities is finding such characters. In
his chatty personal notes on the front and back pages of the
restaurant's menu, Ciarcia says that he played the role of Marty No
Neck in a 1994 feature called ``Me and the Mob.'' Musacchia, who
has had small roles in a half-dozen movies, including ``Mickey Blue
Eyes,'' also appears in some of the photos.
</P>
<P>
   He said he attributed Hollywood's fascination with such movies
to the family values that underlie Mafia legends. Not everyone
shares his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing good, noble or funny about mob killers,'' said
Stephen Fox, the author of ``Blood and Power: Organized Crime in
20th-Century America'' (Morrow, 1989). Fox added that he was
appalled by ``the ludicrous sociology'' of mob comedies like
``Analyze This,'' in which Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal play a
violent mob boss and his psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   In Musacchia's own family, family values include location
scouting. He says all he knows of the Mafia is what he sees in the
movies, which have been his life since he first helped an uncle who
was doing location work in the 1960s for a Sophia Loren movie being
shot on Mulberry Street. Following in his uncle's footsteps, he has
become part of a network of would-be wise guys, celebrities,
prosecutors and crime reporters who have built careers around the
Mafia and who meet at Italian-American hangouts like Rao's in East
Harlem and form a kind of pseudo-commission ruling on the mob's
narrative mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's actors that want to be wise guys and wise guys that
want to be actors,'' Musacchia said. He said one group of actors
who appear frequently in mob films refer to themselves jokingly as
the Gangsters Actors Guild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was working with Marlon Brando in `The
Freshman,''' John Gotti happened to be at a restaurant across the
street,'' Musacchia said, referring to a 1990 comedy in which
Brando parodied his ``Godfather'' role. ``Brando was like a kid:
`Oh, I got to go meet Gotti!' So I introduced them.'' But who
kissed whose ring?

LEMON DROP KID TO GIVE TRAVERS A TRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Most trainers with an outstanding
3-year-old point him toward the Kentucky Derby, the event that
defines thoroughbred racing in the United States. But veteran
Scotty Schulhofer, who has a top sophomore in Lemon Drop Kid, is
not most trainers. Swimming against the tide, Schulhofer pointed
Lemon Drop Kid toward today's Travers at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Kingmambo, out of a Seattle Slew mare, Lemon Drop Kid
has been a factor on the national scene since he won the Futurity
at Belmont Park last September. This year, he won an allowance race
at Gulfstream, ran fifth in the Blue Grass, and ninth in the
Kentucky Derby. He was held out of the Preakness to run in the
Peter Pan, a prep for the Belmont Stakes in which he finished
third, then won the Belmont June 5. Schulhofer rested him until the
Jim Dandy Aug. 8, the prep for the Travers, and Lemon Drop kid ran
second to Ecton Park, who will also contest the Travers, over a
sloppy track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a little time off after the Belmont, and then ran
in the Jim Dandy to give him a race over the track to set him up
for the Travers,'' said Schulhofer. ``He's doing better than I've
ever seen a horse do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulhofer, has trained four Eclipse Award winners _ Fly So Free
(2-year-old colt, 1990), Mac Diarmida (turf, '78), Rubiano
(sprinter, '92) and Smile (sprinter, '86), and other standouts such
as Colonial Affair, who took the '93 Belmont, and Cahill Road, who
won the '91 Wood Memorial. He knows what he's doing, and, from the
start, the Travers was his goal for Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with a brain can see that I didn't train this horse for
the Kentucky Derby,'' said Schulhofer. ``He had his prep at
Gulfstream, then what I had hoped for was a good effort in the Blue
Grass. But he almost went down out of the gate, and he had a lot of
trouble in that race. He really got nothing out of it. In the
Derby, we were in post 19, and everybody took back, so we were
15-wide around the first turn. Jose (Santos) came back and told me
not to be discouraged because this was a good horse who was going
to keep improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in tight in the Peter Pan, but, coming into the
Belmont, I was extremely confident. And, many people may not
realize that he had Charismatic (who won the Derby and Preakness)
beaten even before Charismatic broke down. He doesn't like an
off-track, and, even so, he ran a big race in the Jim Dandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think he has a chance to win the 3-year-old
championship. Why wouldn't he? If he can win this race, and a
couple of others in the fall, I think you would have to give him
his due.''
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Jeanne Vance, a breeder, Lemon Drop Kid has been
in-the-money in nine of his 12 career starts (12-4-3-2), including
all three on a wet track (3-0-2-1). However, running on an off-
track is not his idea of a good time. That could be a factor in the
$1 million, 130th Travers, run at a mile and one-quarter, as it has
rained hard here, off and on, for the last two days, and Saturday's
forecast calls for more showers. Whether the surface, which was a
sea of slop Friday, will be dry by the 5:12 p.m. post time is
anybody's guess. Simply put, mud moves Lemon Drop Kid down, and
Ecton Park up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has completely different action on a wet track as opposed
to a dry one,'' said Schulhofer. ``He's learning how to handle it,
but I'd like a nice, dry track for the Travers. He ran well enough
in the Jim Dandy. He could possibly win the Travers on an
off-track, we've got a shot, anyway. Even if it rains, we'll get a
check.''
</P>
<P>
   If the track is dry, Schulhofer, who is 0 for 5 in the Travers
(Santos is 0 for 9) loves his horse's chances. ``This is as
confident as I've ever felt going into the Travers,'' he said.
``This horse has never taken a step back, every step has has been
forward. If he missed one oat, I wouldn't be able to sleep. I did
it the best way I thought I could to get my horse here. He's a
late-May foal, and he needed to mature, and I figured he'd run real
well when we hit here.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the Travers would be a great accomplishment. It's a
race I've always wanted to win. If I can get this one, it would be
a hell of a thing. I'm 73-year-old, and I haven't got that many
years left.''

 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raymond Vernon, a specialist in multinational corporations and
international development who taught at Harvard University for many
years, died of complications of cancer Thursday in his Cambridge,
Mass. home. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Vernon was a member of the team that planned and implemented
the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after World War
II. He was a central player in the development of the International
Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT. He joined the faculty at Harvard in 1959 and taught at
Harvard Business School before becoming a member of the faculty at
the Kennedy School of Government in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``His career spanned the world of public service and academia,''
Joseph S. Nye Jr., dean of the Kennedy School, said Friday. Nye
said Mr. Vernon was a ``pillar of integrity, sound reasoning and
clear thinking'' and described him as a ``pivotal member of the
Kennedy School faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim B. Clark, dean of Harvard Business School, said he was ``one
of the most influential scholars of his generation, a true pioneer
in the study of multinational corporations and the international
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Vernon was born in New York City. He graduated from City
College of New York and earned a doctorate in economics at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years he was a government official with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the State Department. He
dealt with issues involving postwar recovery in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of several books, including ``Sovereignty at
Bay: The Multinational Spread of US Enterprises,'' and ``Storm Over
The Multinationals: The Real Issues,'' both of which have been
translated into Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Swedish, and
French.
</P>
<P>
   A world-class oarsman, he was a member of the Cambridge Boat
Club for 40 years and often competed in the Head of the Charles
Regatta.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two daughters, Heidi Vernon and Susan Vernon
Gerstenfeld; four grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

   Now You See It, Er, Now You Don't
</P>
<P>
   The stock price is everything at many Internet start-ups. And
more than a few of them have taken to posting continually updated
prices on their internal computer networks, so employees, many of
them paid partly in stock or options, can can draw minute-to-minute
inspiration from how rich the company has made them.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan Inc., an online mortgage broker, permitted its 200 or so
workers to watch gleefully at their desktops as the company's share
price shot to $74 from $14 after it went public June 29.
</P>
<P>
   But when the shares then sagged back into the $50 range, it
suddenly didn't seem so good for morale, and the stock price was
removed from desktop view at E-Loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't watch it minute to minute and day to day'' anymore,
said Janina Pawlowski, president of the Dublin, Calif., company,
adding that no one complained when employees were notified that the
stock updates would be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies large and small post their stock prices on
internal computer networks, known as intranets, and some, like Ford
Motor, even post their competitors' share prices. But executives at
some Internet companies say they have found that productivity
declines when employees become too focused on price fluctuations.
``We're just not interested in putting distractions in front of our
employees, and watching the stock price is a distraction,'' said
Brian Elk, a spokesman for Priceline.com in Stamford, Conn.
iVillage and Theglobe.com, both in Manhattan, said they had similar
policies. Prodigy Communications, the Internet service provider
based in White Plains, takes the low-tech approach of simply
posting the previous day's price on paper in its lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Some intranet consultants say that not displaying updated quotes
can be just as distracting. ``You can't really keep people from
paying attention to the stock price,'' because workers can seek out
stock quotes on the Internet, said Jakob Nielsen of the Nielsen
Norman Group, a consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Crummey, president of Intranets.com in Woburn, Mass.,
said that regular stock price updates were a simple way for
companies to make sure their internal networks stayed current and
interesting for employees _ instead of being electronic versions of
memos from personnel shoved unread into a drawer.
</P>

   Just Lucky to Be Here
</P>
<P>
   Is Britain's class system and old-boy network being replaced by
hard-charging American-style meritocracy? Quite the reverse, to
hear young British executives tell it.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of board members at 201 British companies
by KPMG Consulting, 51 percent of those age 45 and under said that
having the right contacts or knowing the right people was more
important in climbing the corporate ladder than their own skills.
(Only 29 percent of the older executives agreed.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of the younger executives attributed their
success in part to ``being in the right place at the right time,''
but only 47 percent cited merit; among older executives, the two
factors were mentioned about equally.
</P>
<P>
   The younger crowd was only half as likely as the over-45's to
say they showed up for work regularly before 7:30 a.m. Given their
views on the seeds of success, perhaps they don't see any point.
</P>

   So Are They Siblings or Clones?

   One minute you see a screen full of hipsters in vests singing
Madonna's ``Dress You Up'' in an ad for the Gap. Flip the channel,
and there are RuPaul and some go-go dancers in vests in an ad for
Old Navy. Coincidence, or planned mass fashion movement?
</P>
<P>
   The Gap and Old Navy retail chains are both owned by Gap Inc.,
though they have separate design teams and were at pains to stress
last week that they make their fashion decisions independently.
Still, they chose the same moment to push vests with full force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find it coincidental,'' said Joe Enos, a spokesman
for Old Navy. ``We have two design groups with very strong points
of view, and both felt that the tech vest would be a very strong
item for the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a joint interview, though, Enos and Rebecca Weill,
Gap's director of public relations, repeatedly referred to the
separate design teams with the conjugating ``they.'' ``They look at
trends and fashion on the street,'' Enos said. ``They sense that
something might be hot,'' Ms. Weill said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Gap Inc. concerned about competing with itself? ``No,
absolutely not, because they're such distinctly separate brands,''
Ms. Weill said. Speaking on behalf of both companies again, she
added, ``We both feel good about the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet J. Kloppenburg, a managing director at BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, thinks Gap's two chains could cannibalize each
other somewhat, though she said vests were selling well at both.

 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 1:30 p.m. on 125th Street in Harlem, only 20
minutes after the stealth opening of the newest Papaya King hot-dog
emporium. The debut was unheralded by necessity, because it had
taken three days just to get Consolidated Edison to connect the gas
to the frankfurter grills.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a line of 17 eager frankophiles snaked out the door. At
the counter, Jermel Vanderhorst, 27, a manager of the Blockbuster
Video store next door, was eager to order. ``I've been waiting for
this place to open since July,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The store where Vanderhorst could finally get his two chili
cheese dogs and a grape juice is the prototype of a planned new
global Papaya King empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papaya King has a great brand,'' said Daniel Horan, chief
executive of PK Operations Inc., an entrepreneurial subsidiary of
the Manhattan venture capital firm Founders Equity that plans to
hazard millions of dollars over the next few years to populate New
York, and then the world, with Papaya Kings. ``It has a great
reputation and a great logo,'' he said, referring to the wild
yellow, red and green depiction of a smiling papaya face topped
with a crown.
</P>
<P>
   Horan and his investors hope that the very Noo Yawk pairing of
hot dogs with papaya and other tropical fruit drinks is as
nationally marketable as other mysteriously successful culinary
relationships, like pastrami and rye or peanut butter and jelly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are now just two stores _ the 125th Street
prototype and the flagship store at 86th Street and Third Avenue _
Papaya King has ``a national reputation,'' according to Horan, 32,
who holds an MBA from Yale and worked as a manager at Gourmet
Garage, the high-end Manhattan grocer. Through six decades of
operation, Papaya King has waxed and waned desultorily, at times
establishing satellite stores in Manhattan, far-flung Brooklyn and
even farther-flung Los Angeles. The company found them cumbersome
to manage and less profitable than anticipated; ultimately, they
all were discontinued when their leases ran out.
</P>
<P>
   One store set up in 1973 on Manhattan's Upper West Side was
bought by its managers and renamed Gray's Papaya; it is not
associated with Papaya King. A number of imitators sprang up around
the city, but for years until this month, the flagship Papaya King
store stood alone.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, ``we've been approached by countless people
who wanted to take us national,'' said Peter Poulos, the chief
executive of the original Papaya King store.
</P>
<P>
   Poulos, 61, who joined the family business in 1958, received an
undisclosed fee from Founders Equity for the rights to use the
Papaya King name and has been given a 12 percent stake in PK
Operations. As part of the deal he and several experienced workers
and managers came over from the 86th Street operation to help get
the new store going.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200-square-foot prototype, which cost more than $300,000
to build, showcases its stand-up fare with green and orange neon
and a galaxy of homely signs that, as in the original store, extol
the store's ``Tastier Than Filet Mignon Frankfurters'' for which
``NO ONE, and we mean NO ONE, has our formula!''
</P>
<P>
   Papaya King's $1.29 frankfurters have been lauded by Julia Child
and Bryan Miller, and Zagat's Restaurant Survey calls them ``the
crown jewels of hot doggery.''
</P>
<P>
   The hickory-smoked hot dogs are made of beef seasoned with
garlic, oregano and ``South American spices,'' Poulos said
enigmatically. Casings imported from Germany are used ``because
that gives them a snap when people bite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York was once populated by chains like Nedick's and Orange
Julius that hawked the twin attractions of frankfurters and fruit
drinks in dozens of locations. In 1932, Constantine Poulos, Peter's
father, immigrated from Greece and opened a juice store in
Manhattan; seven years later, he and his wife, Birdie, hit on the
idea of serving frankfurters with papaya, and Papaya King was born.
Now, there is even a Web site: www.papayaking.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today a McDonald's and a Burger King are across from the new
store at 121 West 125th Street, near Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Papaya King is its own subniche of fast food _ tropical
juices in combination with a frank product that is of a very high
quality,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, an independent restaurant analyst
and consultant based in New York. Knapp also happens to be a
Manhattan hot-dog aficionado and Papaya King regular who lives near
the 86th Street neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem is a good choice for expansion, ``since it is not
terribly well served by others with a quality product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the 125th Street Business Improvement District,
Barbara Askins, agreed. ``You can find lots of chicken and burgers
in Harlem, but not many hot dogs,'' she said as she waited her turn
in line.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the notion of a chain of Papaya Kings is promising,
Knapp said, ``because the basic economic model is very strong on a
unit level,'' meaning that individual stores could be highly
profitable. The chain operates efficiently thanks to its ``limited
menu, which means they can deliver product more quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 86th Street store sells 2,000 frankfurters a day and has
annual revenues of more than $1 million. Knapp calculated that the
store's sales per square foot, an important industry indicator,
could be $1,300 or more, ``extraordinarily good for a store of that
size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The business plan, Poulos said, is to perfect the operation and
design of the prototype, then open four to five more company-owned
stores in Manhattan before branching out to other states, possibly
as a franchiser.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many hurdles. The city's robust economy may make
it difficult to find suitable new locations with affordable
commercial rents, Knapp said. And the stores compete not only with
the giant fast-food chains but also with what Poulos contends are
low-quality ``copycats,'' about a dozen  &QC; of them, scattered around
Manhattan. Papaya King has sued some of the imitators to keep them
from too closely imitating the store's name and distinctive logo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``It's much easier to build these things than to run
them,'' Knapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of thumb in these operations is that most owners can
handle up to about six units that are reasonably geographically
close, before they blow up. It takes a different kind of management
to run a larger business.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Horan says no one, no one, is more prepared than
he to launch a king-sized network of Papaya Kings.

GOODS READY TO RENT, STOCKS READY TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Aug. 29)

<P>
   It was just over a year ago that investors were engaged in an
industrial-sized obsession with the stocks of equipment rental
companies _ businesses that rent out everything from bulldozers to
100-foot-long telescopic boom lifts to generators and hand tools.
At the end of July 1998, the industry's bellwether stock _ United
Rentals of Greenwich, Conn. _ was trading at a lofty price of over
$48, or 48 times analysts' estimates of earnings per share for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the romance has faded: United Rentals fell
to less than $11 by fall and closed on Friday at $26.6875, still
44.5 percent below that July 1998 high. Rivals have more or less
followed it down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that rough ride, analysts see much to recommend the
sector.
</P>
<P>
   John Molner, a managing director at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP;
Co., sees two reasons for optimism about this $20 billion industry.
First, it continues to benefit from a national trend _ in which
companies are contracting for use of equipment they once might have
owned. Second, the biggest of the rental concerns are now large
enough to set up lucrative accounts with national customers.
</P>
<P>
   Another positive sign for these stocks is the fragmentation of
the industry, which makes it ripe for consolidation. Despite a
recent acquisition frenzy _ United Rentals has already bought more
than 60 companies this year _ analysts say there are still 20,000
smaller, mostly family-owned concerns across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's selloff in the stocks can be attributed, in part, to
the perception that the rental business is cyclical. Such
businesses were thought to be vulnerable to a downturn as investors
fretted over economic problems in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that people have looked at this as a cyclical
industry,'' said Stefan Mykytiuk, an analyst at Baron Capital
Group, a money management firm in New York. But Baron, he said,
sees a ``very strong'' long-term change toward renting rather than
owning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, analysts expect the industry to grow 15 to 20 percent
a year over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even with a renaissance in cyclical stocks, the
equipment rental issues have generally remained grounded, in part
because of concern about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew W. Jeffrey, an analyst at BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, United Rentals is now trading at just 12.1
times his 2000 earnings estimate of $2.20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another big company, National Equipment Services of Evanston,
Ill., closed on Friday at $8.5625, just 7.5 times analysts'
estimated earnings per share for next year and 33.5 percent below
its 52-week high of $12.875, on June 30. Molner said National has
carved out a sizable business by renting specialty equipment, like
pumps used in oil refineries; rental rates for such equipment are
not particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. He thinks its
stock is worth $17 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Jeffrey started following Nationsrent, based in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. He likes the company's efforts to build a strong
brand name, as well as its wide selection of equipment. He predicts
that its earnings will rise 20 percent annually over the next three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   As for United Rentals, Jeffrey thinks it should trade at 20
times his forecast for 2000 earnings, which would give it a price
of $44 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Mykytiuk also likes United Rentals. ``We think that they are the
one best positioned to capitalize on this growth,'' he said.

OF TECHNOLOGY AND TURNOVER 
</HEADLINE>
 -$ADV29 -NYT  (For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. As owner of a medium-sized business, I've been successful in
retaining a large percentage of my staff _ except for the techies.
In the past year alone, I've had to replace my computer technician
four times. Several of my colleagues have experienced similar
problems. Why is there such high turnover in this field, and how
can I attract and retain good help?
</P>
<P>
   A. The simple explanation for the turnover rate is supply and
demand. Technology workers have the skills, and companies are
desperate for them. So, more and more, keeping these employees
means keeping them happy.
</P>
<P>
   Often, that isn't as easy as it sounds. Providing a strong
salary and benefits package is only part of the equation, said
Laurence Holt, chief executive of Quidnunc, a consulting firm in
New York that helps businesses develop E-business strategies.
Another important factor is the technology itself: If your
company's information systems aren't keeping pace with the changing
market, he warned, your employees may feel that they, too, are at
risk of being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech people are scared of ending up with a resume that locks
them out of the new economy,'' he said. If your company is clinging
to outdated programs and systems, ``be aware that you're making a
decision that makes it tough to retain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnout also poses a serious threat to technology workers'
happiness, said Shawn Landgraf, chief executive of Network
Connections Inc., a high-technology consulting firm in New York.
``It's very difficult for even the most dedicated workers to keep
up with the changing technology  &UR; and &LR;  day-to-day business
activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive work can exacerbate the situation. ``The type of
employee who goes into the technology division gets very bored
quickly doing the same tasks over and over,'' Landgraf said. But
many workers, like help-desk operators and PC technicians, end up
in such situations, hurting their enthusiasm and efficiency, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can take steps to ease the stress and monotony.
Sometimes even little things can help _ adding minibreaks to work
schedules, for example, or giving employees time to go to the
health club, Landgraf said. A work space with lots of windows and
bright lighting can make a big difference in morale and
productivity, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing in a few perks can't hurt either. Quidnunc takes its
employees _ now 150 _ on a vacation each year. Last year, the
destination was northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of water sports and just hung out. It's a big
investment, but we've been repaid several times over,'' Holt said,
noting that Quidnunc's turnover rate is 7 percent, compared with an
industry average of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that you need to start studying your
technology strategy not only for how it satisfies business needs,
but also for how it satisfies your technology staff. Otherwise,
Holt said, your best option may be to hire an outside firm to do
the work.

GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY APPOINTS ITS FIRST MUSLIM CHAPLAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidence that the United States is growing ever more religiously
diverse can be found in city and suburb, wherever new Islamic,
Buddhist and Hindu houses of worship go up.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of that trend, there is the news this month from
Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., the nation's oldest
Roman Catholic university, that it has appointed its first Muslim
chaplain, to serve a staff and student body in which Muslims
comprise a growing minority population.
</P>
<P>
   Imam Yahya Hendi, 33, who has served as a chaplain at the
National Naval Medical Center and the National Institutes of
Health, started work at Georgetown on Aug. 10, said the Rev. Adam
Bunnell, who is the University chaplain and in charge of campus
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgetown is a Jesuit and Catholic university,'' Bunnell
said, ``and we want to keep that as our major identity.'' But, he
added in explaining Hendi's appointment, the university also wanted
to be ``catholic with a small `c','' and to bring all its staff and
students ``into the family, rather than have them ministered to on
the fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell, who is a Franciscan priest, presides over a corps of 20
chaplains, some of whom are part-time. Half are Catholic priests,
the others Protestant, Jewish and Eastern Orthodox. He said the
university, with about 6,000 undergraduate and 6,000 graduate
students, does not know exactly how many Muslims are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's been a growing population in the last decade,''
Bunnell said. ``We assume it's between 5 percent and 8 percent.''
It is also a diverse population, made up of foreign students, the
children of immigrants and converts to Islam, he said. (By
comparison, the university said that in 1998, among those
undergraduates who indicated a religious background, 57 percent
were Catholics.)
</P>
<P>
   Hendi, whose appointment was first reported by Religion News
Service on Thursday, was chosen by a search committee composed
primarily of Muslims at the university, but which also included a
rabbi from the campus ministry and other Georgetown faculty
members. Among the criteria the committee looked for in a
candidate, Bunnell said, was someone who would ``fit into
Georgetown's interfaith climate,'' while also being ``respectful of
the Catholic tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendi, who was born in the West Bank city of Nablus, said he has
a bachelor's degree in Islamic law and theology from the University
of Jordan in Amman, Jordan, and a master's degree in comparative
religions from Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Conn. While studying
for his master's degree, he ``developed an interest in interfaith
work and really began to see its value,'' said Hendi, who is also a
doctoral student in philosophy and comparative religions at Temple
University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He described the Muslim population at Georgetown as ``very
different in terms of their ethnic backgrounds and their academic
interests.'' With that in mind, he said, his first order of
business will be to establish a weekly discussion session for
students and staff on the life of Muhammed, the prophet of the
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Hendi said he looked forward to interfaith discussions on
campus, too, saying he thought something could perhaps be done
around the religious holidays at the year's end, where students
would have an opportunity to talk about their own faith and its
meaning to them. ``To me, the month of December can really be
utilized to bring about some understanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of appointments, one that reverberated among
Greek-Americans recently was that of Metropolitan Demetrios, a
Greek theologian well-known in this country, as the next head of
the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment, by the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate in
Istanbul, followed an increasing and very public restlessness among
Greek Orthodox leaders in the United States angry with the
patriarchate's choice of Archbishop Spyridon as head of the
Archdiocese in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lay people, priests and, eventually, the metropolitans, or
regional leaders of the archdiocese, petitioned Bartholomew to
remove Spyridon. The archbishop resigned on Aug. 19, and the
patriarch transferred him to a jurisdiction in Turkey and announced
that Demetrios would come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Archdiocese said that the new Archbishop, who is
71 and spent more than 20 years studying and teaching in the United
States in the 1970s and 1980s, will arrive in New York on Sept. 15.
Three days later, he will be enthroned in his new office, in a
ceremony to be held at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in New
York.

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Fifteen months after it spiraled downward into its
worst recession in a generation, Hong Kong said Friday that its
economy had stormed back to positive growth in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The government's estimate of growth of five-tenths of 1 percent
from a year earlier puts Hong Kong in the ranks of other Asian
economies, which appear to be recovering from the regional crisis
as swiftly as they succumbed to it.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia have all announced sharply
better economic statistics in recent weeks. And the Philippines
said Friday that its economy had also beaten expectations _ growing
by 3.6 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The abruptness of Hong Kong's comeback caught economists here by
surprise. Most had forecast that this former British colony would
lag its neighbors in recovering from the regional crisis. Even
after Friday's announcement, analysts remained wary of the
territory's immediate prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an astonishing number,'' said Ian K. Perkin, chief
economist for the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ``But if
you're coming out of recession, you want more than one quarter of
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkin said Hong Kong could still be hobbled by two things out
of its control: its close ties to the weakening Chinese economy and
its vulnerability to shifts in monetary policy in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Association of Banks announced Friday that it
would raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point _
mimicking an increase three days earlier by the Federal Reserve.
Rates here closely track those of the United States because the
Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rate increase was widely expected, it pushed down
Hong Kong's stock market by 225.25 points, or 1.66 percent, to
13,383.13. The economic results were released after the market
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the caveats, officials here allowed themselves a
sigh of relief after the relentless gloom of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst time for Hong Kong occurred in the third quarter of
last year,'' said Sir Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's financial
secretary. ``Since then, we have seen some very robust recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you define a recession as negative growth, we are
no longer in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Donald attributed the strong performance to revived consumer
spending and tourism. Retail sales declined just 2 percent in the
second quarter, following declines of 10 percent in the first
quarter and 17 percent last year. Visitor arrivals rose 11.1
percent in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any rude shocks, Sir Donald said Hong Kong should eke
out growth of five-tenths of 1 percent growth for the year. But he
noted that the government had not raised that forecast, which was
made earlier this year, despite the second-quarter numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Hong Kong is still surrounded by economic land
mines.
</P>
<P>
   On the government's list of dangers is a slowdown in the U.S.
economy, a faltering recovery in Japan, overly high interest rates
and, the most unpredictable, the tension between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned one thing,'' said Sir Donald, who has been
lampooned here for predicting that the crisis would be over by last
Christmas. ``If I keep looking at the crystal ball, I will end up
with a handful of broken glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, economists said Hong Kong's recovery differed from that
of other Asian countries because it is still basically a trading
post, which packages and ships goods from China rather than
producing its own exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong does not have the driving force that pushes other
countries out of recession,'' said Dong Tao, an economist with
Credit Suisse First Boston, who predicts that its economy will
contract 1.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also, unlike Thailand or South Korea, Hong Kong does not have
the benefit of a cheap currency. While those countries have
devalued their currencies, the Hong Kong dollar rises and falls in
lockstep with the U.S. dollar. That can make this a very expensive
place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weak economy and a strong U.S. dollar is a painful
combination for Hong Kong,'' said Guonan Ma, a regional economist
with Merrill Lynch here. ``Hong Kong is sandwiched between the
tightening monetary policy of the United States and the slowing
economic growth of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's currency is one reason that asset prices here rose
to gravity-defying levels before the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city is in a deflationary cycle, as the gaudy sale
signs in store windows attest. Salaries and commercial rents are
also falling. A report by Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a real estate
broker, said Hong Kong was only Asia's third most expensive city
for office rents, after Tokyo and Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deflation squeezes margins, so for corporations, Hong Kong is
having a profitless recovery,'' Tao said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Hong Kong's peculiarities, its rebound will lend
further credence to the perception that Asia is returning to health
more quickly than almost anybody would have predicted last year.
Rather than a protracted and painful convalescence, economists said
Asia now looks more like Mexico, which snapped back from its
currency crisis in late 1994 and early 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every Asian country reported an explosive
second-quarter GDP number,'' Tao said. He said the region was
benefiting from sustained strong demand for its exports by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   For Hong Kong, the big wild card is China. The country is
grappling with deep deflation, which threatens to strangle its
growth. Most analysts now believe that Beijing will devalue its
currency, although few think it will act before Oct. 1, the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation of China's currency would have unpredictable
consequences for Hong Kong. It could put pressure on the link
between the Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar. But it would also
make China's exports more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And that could benefit China's middleman, Hong Kong.

U.N. OFFICIAL WARNS OF PROBLEMS UNDERCUTTING AID TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan's leading envoy in
the Balkans said Friday that unless significant political and
economic reforms are made in the region, much of the reconstruction
aid promised to Kosovo by world leaders will be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, the envoy, Carl Bildt, said that the
inefficient use or diversion of aid is a ``major impediment all
over the entire region,'' not only in Bosnia, where there is rising
concern about the misuse or waste of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem, Bildt said, is the persistence of
old-style socialist or communist political and economic systems
with all their built-in faults. Serbia, he said, has been the
biggest drag on regional growth. But what Asians call crony
capitalism is also found in Croatia and Bosnia, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need for reconstruction, needless to say, but there
is a far greater need for reform,'' said Bildt, a former prime
minister of Sweden. ``If we do reconstruction without reform, then
we end up with an aid-dependent place. Bosnia is a good example of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bildt said that Europe and the United States need to turn
attention to long-term political as well as economic change,
especially in Serbia. Success in Kosovo, he said, ``is very much
dependent on what's going to happen to Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a big chunk of land in the middle of the Balkans
that if it does not reform itself it will be very difficult to do
anything substantial with the rest,'' he said. ``Serbia is the core
nation of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has ruled out all but emergency assistance to
Yugoslavia as long as President Slobodan Milosevic, who has been
indicted by the U.N. warcrimes tribunal in The Hague, remains in
power. Bildt, who said he believes that Milosevic will eventually
stand trial, does not advocate waiting for that moment to begin
dealing with the fundamental problems of the country, formerly an
important regional trade hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Milosevic will hang around for much longer,''
Bildt said. ``The country is going so rapidly downhill. You have
the economy contracting this year by either 30 or 40 percent.
That's a collapse with major social consequences. That has to do to
a very large extent with the bombing, but not only.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, which was in many ways a pioneering socialist
economy a few decades ago, has now fallen behind the rest of
Eastern and Central Europe, he said, adding that it could take 15
or 20 years for Balkans just to get back to the economic levels of
1989, the year the Berlin wall came down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the least reformed economy in Europe next to
Belarus,'' Bildt said. ``The problem of Serbia is that it can't be
discussed just in terms of the personality of Mr. Milosevic. That's
only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the problems of
Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bildt said that he welcomes the arrival at the United Nations of
Richard Holbrooke, the new chief representative of the United
States. The United Nations and the United States will be facing
tough decisions on the Balkans in the months and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will make the U.S. a far more active player in the U.N.,''
Bildt said. ``And he brings to the job not only a knowledge of the
issues and a lot of personal contacts but a certain amount of
political clout. That is good. He is highly respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, the architect of the accord that ended the war in
Bosnia, will feel some pressures from Washington to speed up
developments in Kosovo, some diplomats here say. They fear that the
United Nations will be blamed if the situation goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a tendency to underestimate the challenges
ahead,'' Bildt said, and when things go wrong, a search for
culprits in international organizations follows. Bildt, who was
involved in ending the war in Bosnia, said he had learned from that
experience that withdrawing troops or lowering the level of an
international military presence too soon can be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is way too early to discuss troops leaving
Kosovo,'' he said. ``We are there for the long haul. That was one
of the mistakes that were made in Bosnia. There was this belief
that you could go in very quickly and do it primarily as a military
operation and be out after one year. That was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Bildt said, Americans, Europeans and Russians may
have to stay for quite a while.

 &HT;    ARMY TERRORIST EXPERTS ADVISED RENO ON WACO
 &HT;    870&AMP;add. With WACO-CANISTER.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Army terrorist experts, including the commander of
the top secret ``Delta Force,'' attended the 1993 meeting at which
Attorney General Janet Reno approved use of tear gas against
members of the Branch Davidian group near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first indication that the Delta Force, whose presence
at the fatal raid was disclosed this week, was involved in planning
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that during that meeting, she raised numerous
questions about the effect tear gas would have on members of the
rebellious religious cult and, especially, their children.
</P>
<P>
   The military experts reportedly assured her that when tear gas
was used against them, the Davidians would be compelled to abandon
the compound in which they had holed up during a 51-day standoff
with FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of that happening, 80 members of the sect, including its
leader David Koresh and 20 children, died in a fire that consumed
their compound. The FBI has said the fire was started by the
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released to Cox Newspapers on Friday by the FBI
indicate that Col. William G. Boykin, then commander of the Delta
Force, and Brig. Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, then the assistant
division commander of the First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood,
Texas, were the previously unidentified officers who told Reno use
of ``CS gas,'' a potent form of tear gas, would make the compound
``untenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tear gas and the manner in which it was used at Waco have become
an issue in recent days with the disclosure that what the FBI
describes as ``a very limited number'' of military-issue
pyrotechnic gas grenades were used at one point in the final
assault on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation, contrary to Reno's repeated assertion during
recent years, has led to renewed calls by members of Congress for
committee investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., called for a Senate
Judiciary Committee probe of the pyrotechnic grenades and Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., said his House Government Reform Committee would
hold hearings on the matter in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday she was ``upset'' to learn that assurances to
her by the FBI that incendiary tear gas grenades were not used at
Waco were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the controversy over the tear gas canisters, the
Dallas Morning News reported that a ``former CIA officer'' had said
he was told that three or four Army special forces troops at Waco
had taken an active role in the Davidian assault.
</P>
<P>
   That would be illegal under federal laws that prohibit use of
military force against American civilians without a special
presidential waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been previously reported that military officers
were were at a meeting at which Reno was advised to approve the use
of CS gas at Waco, the names of Boykin and Schoomaker were deleted
from an Army memorandum describing the meeting. Both men were among
the original captains of the Delta Force when it was established by
the late Army Col. Charlie Beckwith and both participated in the
failed mission to rescue U.S. hostages from Iran in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   According to the widely circulated memorandum, members of the
Special Forces were at Waco on April 19, 1993, but strictly as
observers, whose activities were within legal guidelines and had
been approved in advance by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which was written on May 13, nearly a month after
the fiery end of the Waco standoff, was a synopsis of an April 14
meeting involving Reno, Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Webster
Hubbell, two Army officers, an ``unknown scientist (expert on CS)''
from the Army and several FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests that advice given to by two Army officers _ both of
whose names were blacked out _ was measured and guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summary, we assessed that if the objective of the FBI was
to make the building uninhabitable, then CS would accomplish
that,'' the memorandum's author _ whose name was also blacked out _
stated. ``We stated that it was our belief that if enough CS was
inserted, eventually the inhabitants would not be able to remain
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the plan which was executed at Waco was an FBI plan,
which neither (name deleted) nor I helped prepare,'' the memorandum
writer said. ``At the same time, I did believe that they had a
reasonable chance of accomplishing their objective of forcing the
occupants out of the building. Their approach was substantially
different than anything that I have encountered. They were not
assaulting the compound and they were not there to rescue anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was surprising to me, but certainly not something of
which I am critical. It is simply a different way of looking at the
situation. I did not believe that the FBI and the attorney general
were trying to force me to support or defend the plan. It was my
belief that they simply wanted any observations that we felt
comfortable providing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boykin has since been promoted to major general and given
overall command of the Army Special Forces Command at Ft. Bragg.
Schoomaker has been promoted to general and is commander of the
multiservice Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   FBI documents released to Cox include letters written by
Sessions on April 16, thanking Boykin, Schoomaker and Army chemical
weapons expert Harry Salem, of the Aberdeen Proving Ground in
Maryland, ``for coming to FBI headquarters for the discussions that
related to the standoff in Waco, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that were discussed here could have ended up being
roadblocks to the successful conclusion of the standoff,'' Sessions
wrote in identical letters to the three men. ``Your frank and
careful discussions contributed significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   A slightly different account of the advice offered by Boykin and
Schoomaker came from Hubbell when he testified before Burton's
committee in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military said (the Davidians) will come out of that
building,'' Hubbell said. ``I mean, I had a general and a colonel
both look me in the eye and say: 'They can't stay in that building.
They will come out immediately.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Besides Specter and Burton, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., issued
a statement condemning the Justice Department for saying the
incendiary devices were not used at Waco, when in fact at least a
few of them were.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last week at the Department of Justice has a familiar
ring to it _ proof of information withheld from Congress and the
American people, an inadequate internal investigation and an
attorney general unaware of what is going on in her own
department,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank in Washington,
declared that use of ``pyrotechnic'' tear gas by the FBI was part
of a 20-year trend it described as ``the militarization of civilian
law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute released a new study on the purported trend,
entitled ``Warrior Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly time that we consider the damage that the
militarization of American civilian law enforcement agencies has
been causing in dramatic incidents like Waco and in may other less
well-known events across the country,'' said Tim Lynch, an author
of the study.

   ADAPAZARI, Turkey _ Amid the scenes of horror and death that
have afflicted this city since the earthquake last week, the
brightest sign of life is a field hospital operated by doctors and
nurses from the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Eight babies have been born here since the quake. One boy was
named Israel, and one girl is called Ziona. Their names are symbols
of how firmly the earthquake has sealed the alliance between Israel
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless the Israelis,'' said one new mother, Serap
Balcioglu, whose child was born blue and seemingly lifeless but was
revived by an emergency team at the hospital. ``They're taking
beautiful care of me. What would we do without them?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Israel and Turkey have built a
strategic partnership that has altered the face of Middle East
politics. Trade and tourism are booming in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli pilots practice maneuvers in Turkish airspace, and
Israeli technicians are modernizing Turkish combat jets. There are
plans for Israel to share its high-tech skills with Turkey, and for
Turkey to send some of its plentiful fresh water to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders, Cabinet ministers and business leaders
agree that this new friendship makes good sense for both parties.
But it took the earthquake to show that it has become more than
political _ and has clearly taken deep root among ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much tourism and so many business and
political contacts between the two countries in the last few years
that almost everyone in Israel feels some kind of personal
connection to Turkey,'' said Benjamin Krasna, an Israeli diplomat
who has spent much of the last week working on earthquake relief
projects. ``You pick up a 16-page newspaper in Tel Aviv and six
pages are about the quake. It shows what Turkey means to Israel
today. Israel sees Turkey as a neighbor, a brother, a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sent relief teams to help after disasters in plenty of
countries, and our people support that,'' Krasna said. ``But those
other disasters didn't provoke the same emotional response among
our people. Things have changed because of the nature of our
relationship with Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel was one of the first countries to respond to news of the
earthquake, which devastated Adapazari and much of the surrounding
area. It sent 350 search-and-rescue specialists with teams of dogs.
They were at work the morning after the quake, and in the days that
followed they found and saved 12 buried people.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital team followed quickly, and set up operations in the
muddy front yard of a damaged official building here. Doctors and
nurses treated hundreds of earthquake victims, and now that the
initial trauma is past they are dealing with infections, broken
limbs and all the other medical problems that are normal in a
community of 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials are now discussing the possibility of
sponsoring long-term earthquake relief projects in Turkey. They may
build a town to replace one of those that were destroyed, or
perhaps assume responsibility for rebuilding hospitals in the
affected area. Top officials of the Foreign and Defense ministries,
accompanied by the director general of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
office, have already been here to survey Turkey's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis are absolutely obsessed with the earthquake,'' said
Barry Rubin, an Israeli scholar who has written extensively about
the Turkish-Israeli relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a psychological as well as a political reason for
this,'' Rubin said. ``Jews and Turks have historically been thought
of as outsiders, especially in Europe. They are two peoples who are
extremely conscious of who their friends are. But even though I've
been following this subject for 10 years, I'm amazed at how many
messages I've received since the earthquake. Israelis want to know
what they can do to help, and Turks want to say how grateful they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Turkey considers Israel an ideal partner. Some
leaders of the Islamic political movement have suggested that
Muslim countries, including traditional enemies of Israel like Iran
and Libya, would be more suitable.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks feel a solidarity with Palestinians, and are deeply
disturbed when they see pictures of Israeli soldiers shooting at or
beating Palestinian protesters in the West Bank. Others complain
that Israel has not been vigorous enough in its condemnation of
Kurdish rebels who have been fighting the Turkish army for years.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, the relationship between Turkey and Israel
has deepened. It is no longer the province only of generals,
politicians and corporate executives, but of the peoples of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what has happened since the earthquake,'' said Hasan
Koni, a professor of international relations at Ankara University,
``it's going to be very hard for anyone to criticize the
relationship. Even people who have been suspicious of Israel must
now see that after the United States, Israel has become the country
we can trust most. That is now clearer than ever.''

   MOVIE-TRAILER (Los Angeles) _ Four whispered words _ ``I see
dead people'' _ made for the most effective trailer of the year. It
turned a late summer psycho thriller, ``The Sixth Sense,'' into a
$200 million surprise (along with some outstanding acting from
Bruce Willis and an 8-year-old boy). Another stunning success this
summer was launched from the trailer of ``Blair Witch,'' which
offered little more than the basic plot and a lot of the movie's
mood. We highlight the increasing impact trailers have on box
office, particularly with the need for films to perform well in the
first weekend of release. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the ``f''

1993, but the recession stalled building. Construction started up
this year, and the first homes are expected to go on the market in

FAMILIAR FIELD FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Revolution met Chicago in early June, the team was in
the process of redefining itself. It took a big step toward that
goal with a 2-0 dousing of the Fire.
</P>
<P>
   But for Saturday's rematch in Chicago, the teams have resumed
their customary identities. The Revolution are desperately trying
to rally for a playoff berth and the Fire are coasting, preparing
to defend their MLS Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have earned only 1 point and been outscored,
17-6, in eight games in the second half of the season. They gained
a confidence boost by earning that point with a competent
second-half effort in tying the MetroStars, 1-1, in regulation
time, then winning the shootout Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zenga attempted to change the Revolution's image when he
was hired as player-coach this season. But he did not significantly
change the team's personnel, and the Revolution have shown little
improvement on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Zenga's goalkeeping early in the season inspired enough
regulation-time victories to give the Revolution hope. And,
whatever happens, they will remain mathematically in contention
into September.
</P>
<P>
   So, whether the Revolution are in the doldrums or sinking, they
are at least in a salvageable position and that was not the case
last season. Then, they were barely hanging onto hope at this time
of the season and were eliminated Aug. 30, Zenga's first game as
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Revolution simply failed in key clashes against
Miami, their most immediate threat for a playoff berth. They have
two similar showdowns upcoming _ against Tampa Bay Sept. 4 and
Miami Sept. 11. The Revolution should remain in playoff contention
until then, but will simply have to take at least 4 points in those
games or once again find themselves in a desperate position.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Revolution must play interconference games
against the Fire and Kansas City (Sept. 8). These matches are not
nearly as meaningful, except as indicators of the Revolution's
morale and resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are not going to play a possession game for
extended periods of time and they are not going to be as dangerous
in attack as even the MetroStars, by far the least successful team
in the league this season. The MetroStars demonstrated a much more
imaginative offense, led by shave-headed Serbian Sasa Curcic, than
the Revolution did in Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Revolution will have to be a battling team, one
that outruns and outworks a presumably less-motivated opposition.
With just a touch of furbizia, as Zenga calls the combination of
guile and tactical awareness, this strategy could succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Zenga did not conceive of the Revolution playing this way.
He wanted the Revolution to establish an organized, secure defense
before the team made all-out offensive commitments. But the defense
has unraveled in the second half of the season, creating some
chaotic times for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution went to their final regular-season game with a
playoff berth at stake in their first two seasons. If they can
match those records after 31 games, there is a chance to salvage
this season.

QUAKE SURVIVORS IN DESPERATE SEARCH FOR THE MISSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ Engin Emir walked up to a nurse in the Bakirkoy State
Hospital in Istanbul and held out a photograph of his 18-year-old
sister, a green-eyed girl with a shy smile and the words ``missing
person'' emblazoned above her curly black hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen her?'' he asked, the desperation in his voice
pulling the nurse closer to the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us she was pulled out of the rubble with a bad head
wound and sent to a hospital in Istanbul, but we can't find her
anywhere. . . . Please, is there anybody who looks like this
here?'' he asked, turning helplessly toward the other nurses who
had gathered around him. They pointed to the photo and shook their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later Emir, 26, a man on a mission to find his
only surviving sibling walked out of the hospital with a dejected
look on his face and tears in his eyes. His older brother,
sister-in-law and their three young children all died in last
week's earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   His baby sister, the girl who could always make him laugh even
when he was crying, was nowhere to be found. While his parents
waited in their Istanbul apartment for the hoped-for phone call
that all was well, Emir got back into his battered white car and
set off for the next hospital on his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not give up until she is found, we will go to every
hospital in Turkey, to every morgue, we will search forever if
necessary because we know she is somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicran Emir is one of the missing, one of the unknown casualties
of last week's earthquake that killed more than 13,000 people,
injured almost triple that number and left an estimated 200,000
people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives are unsure whether the missing are alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some people were pulled out of the wreckage with serious
injuries and sent to hospitals elsewhere in the country before
anyone could identify them. Others, found dead, were photographed
and then hurriedly buried in mass graves because of the fear of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   There are also an estimated 30,000 people still buried in the
rubble, making it even more difficult to know whether someone
really was found injured in the wreckage, as a neighbor said of
Hicran Emir, or will be found later by bulldozers working to
recover bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been everywhere, to the morgues, to the doctors, to
the neighbors, to anyone who might be able to tell us what happened
to my sister, but we can't find any information,'' said Gungol
Erdin, who was also searching for her lost relative.
</P>
<P>
   Erdin's sister, Aysel Coskun, was last seen being bundled into a
white car after she was dragged out of the rubble in the seaside
town of Golcuk. The driver of the car said he would take the
seriously injured 57-year-old woman to the hospital. Since then,
nobody has seen her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she was dead we would have found her either under the
rubble or in the morgue, so she must be alive _ but where?'' asked
Erdin, who has plastered hospital walls with pictures of her sister
and pleas for help.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which was accused by many of being slow to react
after the disaster, has yet to set up a centralized system for
tracking down the unidentified in hospitals or in mass graves.
Friends and relatives must go from morgue to morgue and from
hospital to hospital to look for the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have been running advertisements placed by those
searching for missing relatives, television stations have broadcast
the names, and there are at least three Internet sites where people
can post messages about their searches.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry said it is trying to collate information
about unidentified persons in hospitals and those just missing. But
with information still coming slowly, and thousands of bodies still
under the rubble, it could be weeks before many know what happened
to their relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   For Hicran Emir's family, the wait is excruciating. The
18-year-old girl had gone on vacation with her brother and his
family. The spent the night of the earthquake in Golcuk, a town
along the Marmara Sea that was virtually leveled in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   For four days her father dug into the rubble of the building,
extracting with his own hands the bodies of his son, his son's wife
and his three grandchildren, the youngest eight months old. But he
never found the body of his only daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor said she saw Hicran outside the building. Perhaps she
fell from a balcony when the quake hit. A doctor in the town
identified her from a photograph and said she had been near death
with a serious head injury and was sent on a navy ship to
better-equipped medical centers in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where the trail ends, for now.

<P>
   BLUE HILL, Maine _ This is a fish story, but not the familiar
elemental battle of man against the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, when at least one-quarter of the seafood that humans
eat is cultivated rather than caught, and seafood farming is
considered the fastest-growing segment of American agriculture, a
proper fish story is a complex tale about an aquaculturist _ a fish
farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Against him loom not leviathans but land-based forces: coastal
homeowners, traditional fishermen and state regulators. And the
stakes are not survival in the wild but the face of the coast of
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The fish farmer in question is a corporate one: Atlantic Salmon
of Maine, the largest producer of farmed salmon in the United
States. Its 60 underwater pens, holding 1.4 million fish off the
town of Machiasport, are believed to make up the biggest such pen
farm in the world. To many, it represents the future, as fishermen
follow their landed counterparts through the transition from
hunter-gatherers to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But when Atlantic Salmon proposed raising up to 1.4 million fish
in two new farms _ one next to a pristine, piney island across from
the scenic town of Blue Hill and the other across the bay off Mount
Desert Island _ the plan hit furious resistance that residents (who
include the Rockefellers) insisted was not just a knee-jerk
``not-in-my-bay'' reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fears about property values, the residents have cited
worries about the potential effects on navigation, the environment
and public health. The debate has turned tiny Blue Hill, with about
2,000 year-round residents, into a micro-arena for all the
macro-concerns raised by aquaculture around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Aquaculture advocates said the fight has international, economic
implications as well: whether the infant industry can weather
growing pains and whether the United States, now only a bit player
in fish farming, can position itself to be competitive, or largely
leave the field to the likes of Chile and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of Blue Hill Bay is also a classic Maine struggle,
reflecting the tension between those who favor using the land and
those who favor preserving it. It also raises questions of
aesthetics: Why, the fish farmers ask, is an exhaust-spewing
lobster boat chugging out at 4 a.m. considered quaint, while the
swimming-pool-size steel or plastic salmon pens sticking a few feet
above the water are considered unsightly?
</P>
<P>
   Each side has a point. Blue Hill Bay looks like pure heaven, its
beauty bankable in tourism jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A salmon farm also has a certain industrial appeal, the
pneumatic feed machines sounding like heavy hail as they scatter
pellets into the water, the silvery salmon leaping in their
underwater pens, half a million dollars' worth in each. Such farms
have brought hundreds of jobs here to one of the poorest regions
along the Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, somebody has to lose, and so far, it has been Atlantic
Salmon. Earlier this month, the Maine Department of Marine
Resources turned down the company's request to lease 42 acres. It
cited concerns about low oxygen levels in the water at the Blue
Hill site, which could cause environmental problems if lowered
further, and the possible interference with sail boating and
swimming off nearby Mount Desert Island. Boaters described the
lease area as a salvation tack needed to avoid a shoal.
</P>
<P>
   But no one thinks that ends that. Blue Hill residents said they
expect more lease applications, and Atlantic Salmon officials said
they are considering an appeal, searching for other sites and
wondering about their future on the Maine coast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruckus, aquaculture in Maine _ and in many other
parts of the United States _ is marching forward, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually non-existent a generation ago, aquaculture harvests,
which include seaweed, shellfish and fin fish like salmon, bring in
$60 million a year in Maine and more than $900 million nationwide.
The harvests have been growing nationally at nearly 10 percent a
year for more than a decade. More than half of the salmon, most of
the clams and oysters, perhaps one-third of the shrimp and
virtually all of the trout on American tables are farm products,
say industry officials. Worldwide, aquaculture is a $45-billion
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For policy-makers, aquaculture can seem the logical solution to
the depletion of the wild-fish stocks, satisfying demand and
replacing lost fishing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been nowhere near that simple. The science of
aquaculture is still on a steep learning curve, and many species
cannot yet be successfully farmed. Diseases sometimes crop up,
along with problems like unusually cold water in winter or
parasites that can wipe out entire harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Socially, too, aquaculture is no cure-all: many fishermen _
accustomed to having control over their own boats, their own work
schedules, everything but the weather and the prices _ are
reluctant to take jobs as regimented as those in farming.
</P>
<P>
   Some fisherman resent the aquaculture newcomers. (Though others,
like several interviewed at Atlantic Salmon's Machiasport farm,
said they are happy to have a job with a future, with regularity
and health insurance. In a state where the 1998 per capita income
was under $23,000, aquaculture salaries, which average $35,000 a
year here, can look awfully good.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of who would get to use the coastal
waters and how.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance that has arisen around the Blue Hill fight _
retirees and summer people ``from away'' who joined with native
lobstermen concerned about marine traffic and the loss of trapping
territory _ was highly unusual for Maine. Summer folk and
year-round residents tend to clash over issues like development and
school budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But it was typical for an aquaculture fight, said Joseph
McGonigle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon farming in Washington state has been decimated, McGonigle
said, by ``a combination of wild salmon fishermen and alleged
environmentalists who are largely the riparian homeowners in the
San Juan Islands'' worried about ``million-dollar views.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance in Maine, the Friends of Blue Hill Bay, has
acknowledged that its members are worried about their land values
and the seaside serenity.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, if you've got a half-million-dollar piece of shorefront
here and you put a salmon farm in front of it, what's going to
happen to the value of it?'' said Rusty Duym, a former scallop
fisherman who now teaches marine mechanics. ``And they say nothing.
Well, bull!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the debate goes far beyond real estate. The Blue Hill group,
which included a toxicologist, a retired State University of New
York political science professor, a painter, a travel writer and a
lobsterman on its steering committee, has questioned virtually
every aspect of salmon farming.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Best, a lawyer and the group's leader, said members were
particularly concerned that the current in the bay was not strong
enough to flush the salmon feces and the uneaten feed that can
accumulate under the pens, creating bacterial mats that kill other
marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Such mats can be a problem, acknowledged George Lapointe,
Maine's commissioner of marine resources, and that is why pens must
be placed in areas with high oxygen levels and a strong current.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people who don't like aquaculture will treat these things
like Love Canal, and that's a pile of hooey,'' Lapointe said of the
mats.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Blue Hill group have also challenged the
contention that salmon farming was the most efficient way to
produce animal protein: Just a little over one pound of feed yields
one pound of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The group pointed out that the feed was largely fishmeal made
from wild fish like herring that would normally go to feed other
wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   True, Atlantic Salmon managers responded, but the percentage of
vegetable matter in salmon feed is rising, and with fish stocks
down, fishing must inevitably give way to farming.
</P>
<P>
   Fish-farming advocates like McGonigle of the aquaculture
association maintain that Maine fish farmers adhere to some of the
highest standards in the world and are well-monitored unlike in the
industry's early days of great salmon escapes and pollution
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very steep learning curve in the '70s and '80s,''
he said, ``and much of the environmental horror stories floating
around on the Internet are related to things that occurred in
Norway at the very, very beginning of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Salmon managers have argued that their salmon are so
biologically fragile that no one could be more concerned than they
are about keeping the environment clean. The managers said that the
company's use of antibiotics and pesticides was minimal and that
the fish are vaccinated and leave the hatcheries disease-free.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another point of contention was the potential genetic and
disease danger that salmon-farm escapees pose to the badly depleted
stocks of wild Atlantic salmon that conservationists are trying to
restore.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of that danger was in dispute, but such concerns,
combined with other environmental constraints, do help explain why,
with 3,000 miles of Maine coast to choose from _ nearly 5,000 miles
if the islands' coastlines are included _ Atlantic Salmon ventured
into Blue Hill Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1,300 acres of the Maine coast are under aquaculture
leases, but salmon farmers must stay away from rivers where wild
salmon run and from the nesting areas of endangered seabirds, and
they need water cold, deep and dynamic enough for the salmon to
thrive. Suddenly, the coast doesn't look so big.
</P>
<P>
   Among the worries that the Friends of Blue Hill Bay have raised,
the scariest concerned accusations that fish-farming in Scotland
and Canada was linked to blooms of toxic algae that were eaten by
shellfish and led to fatal outbreaks of amnesic shellfish poisoning
among humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salmon industry says, `Rubbish, there's no evidence,' but
that's what the tobacco industry said,'' said Susan Shaw, the
marine toxicologist who acts as science adviser to the Blue Hill
group. ``I'm a public health doctor, and I think we're doing a
dangerous experiment in our water. Our whole point has been that we
should do a lot of study before we do the experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials and aquaculture experts have vehemently refuted
the claims of linkage between salmon farming and toxic algae
blooms, pointing out that such blooms occurred long before salmon
farming came into existence. The links between fish farming and
harmful algal blooms, ``are completely unsubstantiated,'' Lapointe
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Friends of Blue Hill Bay was getting its way on the need
for more research, having commissioned a study that would look at
everything from the bay's currents to its biological makeup. That
way, members said, the next time a lease proposal comes up _ which
may be in the next several months _ they would have adequate data.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To the fish farmers, all this is about people's reluctance to
accept change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 30 years, fish farming will be accepted,'' said Atlantic
Salmon production manager Steve Swartz. ``It'll be just part of the
natural landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But for now, several of the Friends of Blue Hill Bay
celebrated the rejection of Atlantic Salmon's lease requests the
other day at member Dottie Hayes' house with blueberry grunt, a
midnight-blue New England dessert, and champagne.
</P>
<P>
   As they clinked glasses, they toasted, ``Hurray for the bay!''

 KING RONNIE OF BUGANDA TAKES A BRIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda _ The king was growing wide in the middle and
his people began to worry: When would he get married and make an
heir? Then the sniping started. Some of his aunts even claimed the
king was not the true heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   The talk got nastier when he picked a bride: She was practically
an American and, at age 35, old to be a queen. Besides, her clan,
known as the Edible Rat, lacked a certain dignity because their
traditional role has been caring for the washrooms.
</P>
<P>
   All this intrigue, of course, made Ugandans that much more
transfixed Friday as Ronald Muwenda Mutebi, 43, king of Buganda,
the largest of five kingdoms here, married Sylvia Nagginda Luswata,
an aristocratic Ugandan who graduated from New York University.
Drums pounded. Men with spears and leopard skins danced outside an
Anglican cathedral. Tens of thousands attended a public reception,
which had corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the people agree in one loud voice, he must get down to the
business of producing children, boys in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine months _ or less,'' said Juliet Kiyaga, 28, a guest at
the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is preferable,'' her husband, Barnet, 41, added.
</P>
<P>
   The worry over the king, known as the kabaka, his wife and
future children is more than the usual cultural desire for an heir.
It is rooted in the long troubles of Uganda and the desire of the
people here to see the nation go on now that those troubles are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The father of King Ronnie, as he is sometimes known, was the
first president of Uganda after British colonialism ended in 1962.
Four years later, he was thrown out of the country by the prime
minister, Milton Obote, and the kingdoms were abolished. Idi Amin,
who overthrew Obote, would not let the kings back.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after 1986, when the current president, Yoweri
Museveni, took power, that four of the five kings were reinstated,
not as political leaders but as cultural figures like British
royalty. The institution is still tender enough that Bugandans feel
better knowing this king, who grew up mostly in exile and was
crowned in 1993, has someone else in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuity is so important,'' said Umar Nyanzi, a
41-year-old businessman who has known the king for 12 years.
``Suppose something happens. We would not have an heir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kingdom of Buganda is so old,'' he added. ``You know,
Bugandans, they are so conscious of it _ that sense of belonging.
They know they belong to Buganda, and Buganda is supposed to have a
king.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have argued that the focus on the wedding in
Buganda, in south-central Uganda, which includes the capital of
Kampala, serves only to widen ethnic differences, the cause of so
much trouble in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this was the first royal wedding in Uganda
since 1948, and even people from the four other kingdoms seemed
pleased with the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers in Uganda have been reporting on the wedding in
microscopic detail (One headline: ``Yiga, the man who wakes up the
Kabaka''). Beer labels carry the couple's pictures. Corporations
ranging from the local cellular phone company to Shell Oil have
been tripping over each other to sponsor the event.
</P>
<P>
   Then there has been an inevitable clash of cultures, of Africa
and Europe, of ancient rites and modern sensibilities. The Buganda,
whose history stretches back 600 or more years, were amused two
days ago when palace officials announced that, contrary to
tradition, people were permitted to have sex on the king's wedding
day.
</P>
<P>
   But the king still decided to retain the traditional wedding
ceremony to a 13-year-old virgin from a particular Bugandan clan
earlier this month. Palace officials said the king does not have
sex with the girl and that she can marry later. Women's groups,
though, are outraged, saying that the wedding violates a law that
no one may marry under 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are saying is this is a girl of 13,'' said Judy
Kamanyi, head of the women's group, Action for Development. ``We
are saying you can still find a girl who is 18 and a virgin who
comes from that clan.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention, however, has focused on the king's bride,
Ms. Nagginda. Descended from Bugandan nobility but born in Britain,
she has lived for the last 18 years in the United States, mostly in
New York. She has worked as a research consultant at the United
Nations and most recently worked at the World Bank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She is pretty and smart but some Bugandans are noticeably chilly
when talking about her. One woman at the reception Friday, Sarah
Kayizzi, 28, scrunched up her face when the subject of the new
queen came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think she would make a good person,'' she said hopefully.
``She has been in America since childhood. People have never seen
her.''
</P>
<P>
   People certainly saw her Friday, on live television, starting
when she stepped out of a black Lincoln at St. Paul's Cathedral
here Friday morning at the start of a two-hour wedding ceremony.
She wore a creamy dress, with a delicate veil and a train that
spilled down four steps from the altar and a ways down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   The king wore a robe of midnight blue sparkling with gold and a
huge golden crown that he kept having to adjust on his head in the
heat. Like at all weddings, people seemed stiff and nervous but
before he said his vows, the king lifted his queen's veil, took a
small step back and smiled at her.
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, Barbara Katenda, a 24-year-old loan officer,
said she could now rest easy. The wedding, she said, ``was
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was over age,'' she said. ``He was mature enough.''

WRAPS COME OFF PENN STATE IN PIGSKIN CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ The concession comes grudgingly, pulled out
of him after a series of questions that basically give him no other
choice but to concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, you feel like you've got a pretty good football
team,'' said Penn State coach Joe Paterno. ``This particular year,
I think we're a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Hold everything. Make reservations for the national
championship game in New Orleans in January. Joe Pa likes this
team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he should. With 19 starters returning from last year's
9-3 club, and with linebacker LaVar Arrington _ arguably the best
player in the country _ leading a defense that could have as many
as three first-team All-Americans, the Nittany Lions appear to be
very good indeed.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper. This afternoon, at Beaver Stadium, everyone
gets to see just how good Penn State really is as the No. 3 Lions
meet No. 4 Arizona in the Pigskin Classic, which will officially
kick off the 1999 college football season.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, preseason games are best forgotten as soon as they are
played, with mismatches made by Top 10-type teams eager to get an
easy ``scrimmage'' in the books before they get serious.
</P>
<P>
   But this matchup is different. Arizona, which has 16 starters
back from last year's 12-1 team, is not backing off a bit. The
Wildcats feel that a win over Penn State _ a definite possibility _
will give them the boost they need in the rankings and among the
pollsters to be a factor in the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, which has already been tabbed No. 1 in a couple of
national publications, is looking forward to such an early
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there are very few negatives,'' said Paterno,
beginning his 50th season in Happy Valley. ``When you have a chance
to prepare for a team as good as Arizona, you probably get a little
more out of summer conditioning and preseason practice. Win or
lose, you are probably a better football team when you start the
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona will test the Lions, no question. The Wildcats lobbied
for this game, feeling a win, or even a strong showing, will leave
a lasting impression on the voters about Arizona football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me, if we're going to be confident, I'm going to
say yes,'' said Arizona coach Dick Tomey, whose team has won 16 of
its last 17 games and is using a Holiday Bowl victory over Nebraska
as a jump start into this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey said he likes the challenge his team faces. Highly ranked
team on the road. ``This kind of game is very fun for the players
to be involved with,'' he said. ``That's why kids come to college,
for games like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have star power on both offense and defense, but it
is the offensive side of their game that will create the most
interest, considering Penn State's defensive reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are one of the few teams that have made a
two-quarterback system work. Tomey will sart Keith Smith, but he
has Ortege Jenkins, who set a Pac-10 single-season passing
efficiency record last year, as 1A on his depth chart. The Wildcats
also have running back Trung Candidate, who may be a Heisman
candidate if Arizona can win the way people expect and Candidate
can match his 1,220-yard performance of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State also has two quarterbacks, but there is more
controversy than comfort in that in some circles. Paterno has
designated Kevin Thompson as his starter, although Rashard Casey
has a large support group that has been lobbying for more playing
time for Casey.
</P>
<P>
   All Paterno will say is that Thompson is his starter and Casey
will probably see some playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the critics point out that Thompson is coming off a
season in which he threw more interceptions (eight) than
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the subplots of a game that could very well be
replayed in the Rose Bowl Jan. 1, if not the Sugar Bowl and
national championship game Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, this preseason ```Classic'' could be just that.

VITAMIN RETAILER MOTHERNATURE.COM PLANS TV AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MotherNature.com, an e-commerce retailer, plans to launch its
first television ads next week as part of $17 million marketing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   MotherNature.com, a seller of vitamins, supplements, and
minerals, was established in 1995, and nearly all of its early
marketing efforts were on the World Wide Web, much of it in the
form of banner advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But like many other e-commerce retailers, MotherNature.com has
concluded that banner advertising may not be the best way to
attract new visitors to a company's retail Web site.
</P>
<P>
   On-line advertising ``can be used tactically,'' said Sharon
Rice, the company's vice president of brand marketing. ``But it's
not a good way to build a brand and garner trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Establishing trust may be essential in the fragmented and highly
competitive market of selling vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Among other rivals are Vitamins.com and GNC.com. Companies such
as CVS Corp. operate Web sites where consumers can buy vitamins as
well as prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to grow, MotherNature.com recently announced plans to
seek $57.5 million in an initial public stock offering. Like many
other e-commerce retailers MotherNature.com plans to use a good
part of the proceeds from its IPO for advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company said total industry sales for vitamins and minerals were
just under $9 billion last year. The company said it lost $15
million on sales of $954,000 for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the Internet, but many consumers seem
more comfortable doing business with a retailer that also operates
brick-and-mortar stores they can touch and feel.
</P>
<P>
   MotherNature.com is strictly an Internet retailer with no
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need some level of trust,'' Rice said. ``When you
don't have a store, traditional advertising can help you garner
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rice arrived at MotherNature.com about a year ago, she
decided to test the effectiveness of print and radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   The results were so compelling the company has shifted most of
its marketing dollars off-line, and it hired New York ad agency
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather to develop a traditional brand campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Test ads claim that buying vitamins on-line is better than
buying them in a brick-and-mortar store.
</P>
<P>
   At MotherNature.com's Web site, consumers can get information
about health and vitamins in the privacy of their homes. At
brick-and-mortar stores, consumers have to discuss embarrassing
maladies in public or deal with ignorant clerks, the ads imply.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier radio ads used actress Blythe Danner, who was cast as an
all-knowing and wise Mother Nature. In new ads, Danner is gone; the
company's new Mother Nature brand icon is a stand-up comic selected
after auditions of hundreds of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In one TV spot, Mother Nature declaims on the joys of maca, ``a
natural sex enhancer from Peru.'' In another, she discusses foot
fungus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our search for the perfect Mother Nature was not an easy
one,'' said Ogilvy &AMP; Mather executive creative director Chris Wall.
``Mother Nature does tornadoes, mangoes, and kiwis. What kind of
person would she be? Powerful, smart, knowledgeable _ with a
slightly warped sense of humor.''

IN MEXICO, WOULD-BE HOMEOWNERS HOPE TO WIN A RAFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When Javier Zavala and his wife, Jenny, began
thinking about buying a house, they did not bother going to a bank
to talk about getting a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would have been hopeless,'' said Zavala, 32, a
marketing manager for his family's agro-chemical business here.
</P>
<P>
   The banks in Mexico have been struggling with huge portfolios of
failed loans since a sharp devaluation touched off soaring
inflation nearly five years ago. With a few exceptions, they are
lending only to the biggest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The richest Mexicans, who least need loans and often prefer to
pay cash, can sometimes get mortgages. Some of the poorest
Mexicans, in a form of political patronage, get subsidized loans
through government agencies. But most Mexicans, like the Zavalas,
are out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   In this world of incredibly tight money, though, Mexican
entrepreneurs have devised a cooperative scheme that the Zavalas
and tens of thousands of others are using in hopes of getting
houses.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs form groups of 500 home buyers, all of whom
agree to make monthly payments for nearly 17 years toward homes
valued at as much as roughly $200,000. A raffle is held each month
and the pool of money goes to one lucky member to buy a house. That
person, like the others, keeps paying for the rest of the nearly 17
years, and eventually everyone is supposed to end up with a house.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs adjust monthly payments for inflation, which
is running at an annual rate of 16 percent. Members pay no interest
but are charged administrative fees of about 10 percent, compounded
monthly. So the cost of financing through one of these groups works
out to nearly 30 percent, or a little more than the banks say they
would charge if they were lending for mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative groups are not exactly a bargain. ``But,'' Mrs.
Zavala said, ``the point is, the banks are not approving loans.''
</P>
<P>
   (In the United States, where inflation has been running at 2
percent, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages now cost a little more than 8
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the entrepreneurs do not point out is that
members do not earn interest on money they are putting toward
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts say the cooperatives, known here as
self-financing groups, are potentially dangerous for investors
because they are not regulated by the banking authorities and
monthly payments are not insured, as are deposits in Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are under God's protection,'' said Roberto del Cueto, a
professor at Mexico's Autonomous Institute of Technology who
specializes in banking law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he and others following these groups say they know of none
that have encountered financial trouble or turned out to be run by
swindlers. Federico Castro Romo, the administrative director of
Autofin, which is said to be the oldest and largest of the
self-financing organizations, said the money paid by members was
held in trust.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Campos, an official at Mexico's federal agency for
consumer affairs, said several thousand participants in
self-financing groups had complained of delays in getting the money
for their houses after raffles. In a handful of disputes, she said,
group administrators have paid fines of up to $10,000 and refunded
the money of would-be homeowners. Ms. Campos said she knew of no
cases in which group members had lost their money.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campos estimated that more than 70,000 Mexicans were
participating in these groups.
</P>
<P>
   Similar cooperatives have been used in Korea, Taiwan and
elsewhere, particularly for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   When the banks in Mexico do lend for a home, they demand
pristine credit histories and down payments of up to 50 percent.
``We're being very selective,'' said Ernesto Gomez-Gallardo, an
executive vice president at Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival,
Mexico's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   When the peso was devalued, Mexico's banks were a disaster
waiting to happen. After a decade under state ownership, the banks
had been reprivatized in the early 1990s. Many of the new owners
paid several times what analysts said were fair prices for the
banks. Eager to earn their money back, they went on lending sprees.
Some passed out credit cards in shopping malls, no questions asked.
They accepted small down payments on mortgages, let people borrow
more than their incomes would justify and relied on customers to
disclose their total debt.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Mexican practice, mortgages were issued with
variable rates. Not long after inflation soared beyond 70 percent a
year after the devaluation, home buyers found themselves owing
interest equal to the amount of their loans. And many just walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   The banks tried to repossess the homes. But they were reminded
that Mexican law greatly favors homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, it takes an average of 90 days to repossess a
house,'' said del Cueto. ``In Mexico, it may take six years.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability to repossess quickly is another reason the banks
are reluctant to resume large-scale mortgage lending.
</P>
<P>
   Zavala and his wife, the parents of a 2-month-old son, are doing
business with Autofin. It started more than 20 years ago, financing
cars, and moved into raising money for homes four years ago,
shortly after Mexican banks stopped lending.
</P>
<P>
   Zavala said he was a bit uneasy at first. ``But once I found out
they had been in the business such a long time I felt better,'' he
said. ``And it is working. We've been in the group about two years.
We see people getting houses and more people keep coming into new
groups. So I feel I will get my money out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zavalas contracted for a house worth 450,000 pesos in 1997,
but because of inflation it will now cost about 680,000 pesos, or
$73,500, to buy the same house. Their payments have been rising
steadily to keep pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery each month is tough on the nerves. ``They run
through all 500 numbers so you can see how you ranked,'' Mrs.
Zavala said. ``It's depressing if your number is way down there.
But if you're close to the top, it's encouraging.''

THE UNIVERSITIES' BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 29, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed in
the United States _ on a par with the Northwest Ordinance, the
Sherman Antitrust Act and the statute that established the Federal
Reserve System _ was the Morrill Act of 1862. Justin Morrill was a
long-time legislator from Vermont, and the 1862 act that bears his
name provided for land-grant universities to be established by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Originally chartered to teach ``agriculture and mechanic arts,''
these new universities (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
was one of them) broke the monopoly of the old Eastern citadels of
privilege, and immediately began mapping into the commercial
interests of their communities. They spread far and wide the gospel
of competition among teaching and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   More private universities followed, many of them modeled on the
German system (including Johns Hopkins, Chicago and Stanford.) Then
came extension services, trade schools, research institutes,
community colleges, national laboratories, adult education centers,
and all the rest. The massively decentralized system has been
growing ever since the Morrill Act. No other nation possesses
anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   The past 20 years have seen a new burst of entrepreneurial
behavior in higher education, probably sufficient to rival any of
these past episodes. Some of it was triggered by passage of the
1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which directed universities to license
federally supported research where possible. Some of it stemmed
from the enthusiasm for deregulation; some from the possibilities
inherent in the telecommunications and computer revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for-profit universities have begun to compete for
students with traditional non-profit institutions. Advocates of
distance learning _ meaning methods which rely on software,
videotape and the Internet _ have campus-based instruction in their
sights. The market for post-baccalaureate education is becoming
especially intense. It is a complicated world and growing more so.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly good window for keeping tabs on these
developments is a young magazine called University Business,
written for the administrators who run the system and the people
with whom they routinely work: trustees, deans, vendors, education
lenders, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Named one of the 10 best new magazines of 1997 by Library
Journal, University Business combines lively curiosity with crisp
journalistic skepticism. It may be the most interesting business
magazine startup since Gilbert Kaplan founded Institutional
Investor 30 years ago to cover the fledging money management
industry.
</P>
<P>
   University Business is the brainchild of Jeffrey Kittay, now 55.
An Amherst College graduate and a 1975 New York University Ph.D,
Kittay taught French at Yale University for seven years, then put
his late father's affairs in order. (The elder Kittay, a penniless
immigrant from England at 15, owned a chain of a hundred discount
department stores and, for a time, the underwear maker BVD.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Kittay set out to publish a magazine that would
formulate an audience of upscale academics in the much same way
that Rolling Stone had assembled a readership of the record-buying
young.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of Lingua Franca (that being a fancy way of
saying ``common tongue'') was published in 1990, with an array of
hip, revelatory articles on academic life. They were closer in
spirit to Vanity Fair than to the staid Chronicle of Higher
Education. The magazine, slowly but unmistakably, became a success.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually Kittay's interests began to extend beyond the
professors and wannabes whose antics filled the pages of Lingua
Franca to the problems of the administrators whose task was to fill
those classrooms. The business problems facing universities were at
least as great as those facing anthropology and sociology, and they
were more immediate. With the universe of suppliers of education
exploding, those who ran universities large and small needed all
the help they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Kittay launched University Business. The first issue
featured a savvy narrative of the process by which George Johnson
transformed a backwater commuter school in Fairfax, Virginia, into
George Mason University in less than 20 years. ``GMU was intended
to be a third-rate institution by the state,'' Johnson said. ``I
had to figure out how to bust out of that.'' Bust out of it he did,
lobbying shamelessly, building extravagantly, and paying through
the nose to hire a small galaxy of star professors.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues examined the buoyant growth of schools such as
England's Open University, an enormous specialist in distance
education (it began life in the 1960s as ``The University of the
Air'') that has begun partnering with several US universities,
including Florida State university; the University of Phoenix, with
its 55,000 students in its 98 campuses in 31 states; and Maricopa
Community College District in Phoenix, which with 200,000 students
has become the second largest junior college in America, behind Los
Angeles Community College District.
</P>
<P>
   There is a continual emphasis on the hard, large, and small,
choices in the ``deal-stream'' facing university administrators.
Penn State University sold Pepsi the exclusive right to market soda
in campus facilities. The deal meant $14 million for the university
over 10 years _ but no Coke anywhere on the campus or its 24
satellites. Harvard University and several other brand names signed
exclusive rights to Pangea to market sweatshirts and whatnot in
Europe _ the better to protect trademark infrtingement in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The moral, Kittay tells administrators, is ``Know what you
own.'' At some point, he says, ``You will be asked a question that
can bring you much-needed funds _ and potentially change the way
you do business:
</P>
<P>
   ```Can I resell that course?' `Can we direct-market your
students on college letterhead?' `Can we sell you unused
bandwidth?' `Can we put your name on. . .?' `Would your faculty. .
.?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the proposals will be appalling. Some will open doors
to a very desirable future. Who gets to decide? What are the
limits?''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Manhattan, University Business is a controlled
circulation magazine. That means it is free to the persons holding
high positions whom the magazine is trying to reach, and costs $49
for ten issues a year to those who do not qualify. Advertising
revenues pay the bills. They are $1 million so far in 1999, up from
$333,000 in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, the paper of record has been the Chronicle of
Higher Education. That's likely to continue. But University
Business surely will thrive _ as will the universities themselves.

COMMENTARY: AND THE WINNER IS ... GEORGE W. BUSH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bump in the road, a setback, a boon to his primary opponents?
Puh-LEEZE! The people who dourly predicted dark consequences from
George W. Bush's ``mishandling'' of Snortgate were the same
geniuses who predicted Bill Clinton's imminent demise 20 months
ago. After the avalanche of insinuations that the Texas governor
might have used cocaine and is now engaged in a cover-up, Bush is
in fact, in the words of his campaign adviser Ralph Reed, ``better
off'' than he was before the firestorm started. Far from bungling
his first encounter with adversity, the front-runner handled it
like a master.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, his convoluted answers to the cocaine question were
Clintonesque _ you need a Palm Pilot to chart the chronology of his
non-drug use _ but the political dividends have proven Clintonesque
in a positive sense. Bush has enjoyed an ``uptick'' in the polls,
as Reed described it. He continues to best Democratic adversaries
by double digits and swamps his closest Republican rival, Elizabeth
Dole, by a factor of four.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even though most voters with an opinion on the
subject believe that he is guilty as rumored of the alleged felony
_ just as most voters judged President Clinton guilty of
non-felonious adultery from the outset of Monicagate. Yet no one
cares. Only 11 percent in a CNN/Time poll feel cocaine use
disqualifies Bush from the presidency. More revealingly, the number
of people who think a candidate should not even respond to
questions about cocaine has gone up since the marathon
cross-examining of Bush began.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that Americans have once again proved themselves
to be morally bankrupt, as was widely proclaimed last year? Has the
rise in the Dow Jones average since then made them overlook hard
drugs as well as reckless sex? If the Dow hits 13,000, could a
politician suspected of grand theft auto run for president without
fear of public condemnation? At 20,000, a serial killer?
</P>
<P>
   No, but what this fracas did prove is that the best place a
candidate can be in 2000 is in opposition to the fulminating
moralists in public life, whether those of the press or of Bush's
own party. Clinton's bipartisan legacy is this: Given the choice
between scolds and scamps, the country opts for scamps.
</P>
<P>
   The more the media pile on a politician over a private sin _ let
alone a sin for which there is no evidence or accusations, despite
major investigative efforts by both The Washington Post and The
Wall Street Journal _ the more the public will rally around the
targeted candidate. Just prior to the last push to bust Bush for
drugs, there was a mini-storm in which our Puritan tribunes
reprimanded him for using a four-letter word repeatedly in an
interview in Talk magazine; that may have helped his poll numbers
too. Should someone now come forward and actually accuse him of
coke use, he may enjoy a poll bounce analogous to the one enjoyed
by Clinton after Kathleen Willey appeared on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tormentors have tried to dress up the propriety of the
cocaine question ex post facto by linking it to his hypocrisy on
public policy. As governor, he has signed on to Draconian laws in
Texas that promote jail for first-time drug offenders caught in
possession of minuscule amounts (though jail rarely befalls those
of Bush's station, who can afford the right lawyers). But the many
troubling questions raised by this hard line _ and the failed
national war on drugs it epitomizes _ could have been asked of him
before the cocaine rumors flared, whether he's a hypocrite or not.
Now they'll likely be forgotten again, unless or until the
questions about his own cocaine use get a second wind.
</P>
<P>
   Such is our political culture, in which scandal usurps all else,
that Bush has been able thus far to position himself as a
don't-worry-be-happy candidate, a genial Chauncey Gardener who
seems to believe whatever a beholder hopes he believes. He has been
able to skate by most policy questions, including those drowned out
by Snortgate. Most of the media, for instance, ignored his response
to a question by David Bloom of NBC News about the Kansas' school
board's decision to delete evolution from its recommended
curriculum. Bush fudged it: ``It's up to local districts to make
decisions on how to achieve standards of excellence, as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   If this is how educational excellence is going to be promoted by
a chief executive _ and the hapless Al Gore, seemingly following
Bush's lead, is now also waffling on this question _ the policy
implications go well beyond Kansas. How would a president respond
to similar political pressures by creationists that could threaten
federal funding of scientific research (and academic institutions)
exploring the frontiers of biology and medicine? Will taxpayers
have to foot the bill in future welfare programs for graduates of
evolution-free high schools sentenced to the bottom rungs of the
new economy?
</P>
<P>
   Some voters may be less concerned with what drugs, if any,
passed through Bush's brain than with what other traffic, if any,
did. Though otherwise cooperating with a seven-part Washington Post
profile this summer, this would-be education president would not
permit either Andover or Yale to release his grades.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a South Carolina elementary-school kid at a campaign
photo op this week to name his favorite book as a child, Bush
responded, ``I can't remember any specific books.'' Amidst all the
crackhead cracks on late-night talk shows was David Letterman's
chilling aside, ``I have the feeling that this guy could turn out
to be a colossal boob.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Bush is that he can deflect his critics for
months to come. Not only can he deflect the scandal obsession of
the Beltway media and capitalize on the national backlash against
it, but he can also count on the abrupt flip-flop of GOP moralists
in the aftermath of their post-impeachment election setbacks. As
Sen. Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican, memorably put it _ in a
formulation he has since regretted and then blamed on the movie
version of ``Primary Colors'' _ Bush will be the nominee unless
``he was hit by a bus or some woman comes forward, let's say some
black woman comes forward, with an illegitimate child that he
fathered. ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bush may be the nominee even if this scenario does
come to pass. For all the talk about the governor's alleged
hypocrisy, it is nothing compared with that of some of his
supporters. Tom DeLay, the impeachment Ayatollah who saw himself in
a war of ``relativism vs. absolute values,'' is now a born-again
relativist, suggesting last week that what Bush has ``done as a
part-owner of the Texas Rangers'' matters more than any youthful
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Noonan, who last year inveighed against a president for
prizing winning over telling the truth, has now called upon Bush to
stonewall and expressed latent nostalgia for ``the old tolerance''
of ``normal failings.'' According to the new relativism she posited
in The Wall Street Journal, a sexual fling may be OK too, as long
as it can be deemed a romantic ``love affair'' and doesn't involve
a ``sick manipulator being serviced in the hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, at least, deserves credit for consistency: he
is the only major Republican to rue (and acknowledge) the news that
his party's foremost champion of moral renewal, Newt Gingrich,
carried on with a congressional aide 23 years his junior. Bennett
has also called upon Bush to answer the cocaine question, though
with a loophole: Cocaine use is ``a serious matter,'' but ``how
serious depends on facts and circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of conservative campaigning against the '60s
and ``secular humanism'' and boomer self-indulgence, what has
happened to change the equation? The virtuecrats have a fresh-faced
boomer of their own who might lead their party back into the White
House. ``I think we run the risk here of looking like when it's a
liberal Democrat we're willing to be serious about these things,
but when it's one of our own we're going to use a different
standard,'' said Gary Bauer this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer, like the few other GOP presidential wannabes still
implicitly criticizing George W. Bush's evasiveness on drug use
(Orrin Hatch, Steve Forbes), is a loser. For Republicans in 2000 _
much like Democrats in '92, when Bill Clinton parsed the Gennifer
Flowers questions _ winning is everything. Bush _ having proved so
early that only the despised press will call him on youthful
indiscretions, real or imagined _ has emerged from his first crisis
in a position that is nothing if not win-win.

MASSACHUSETTS DUCKS CONTAMINATED, EPA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ducks on the Housatonic River in Western Massachusetts have been
found to contain potentially cancer-causing PCBs at more than 200
times the allowable levels, the EPA reported Friday, making them
among the most contaminated ever found in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high level of contamination, state public health
officials have issued a preliminary advisory about eating wild
waterfowl _ specifically, wood ducks and mallards _ just weeks
before the state's duck hunting season begins Oct. 11. They have
also asked the US Fish and Wildlife Sevice to look into alerting
other states along the ducks' migratory routes as well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The advisory calls for avoiding any waterfowl from the
Housatonic River, and for limiting intake and taking precautions
with any wild ducks caught elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high PCB levels and upcoming duck hunting season, we
are moving as quickly as possible to make the public aware of these
results and provide some guidance on the appropriateness of
consuming waterfowl,'' said John DeVillars, the regional
administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are ``confirmation of the need to move forward
aggressively with a cleanup'' of the site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the major duck flyways in this region are along the
Atlantic seabord and along the Hudson River valley in New York, so
the location of this contaminated site in Berkshire County means it
will directly affect fewer hunters than if it had been in those
areas. According to H. Heusmann, waterfowl biologist for the state
Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, 8 percent of the state's
approximately 10,000 waterfowlers hunt in the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were routinely used in the
manufacturing of transformers for electric power lines, until their
developmental and probable cancer-causing effects were discovered
in the 1970s. Many such transformers were manufactured at a General
Electric plant in Pittsfield from the 1930s until 1977, when PCBs
were banned, and it has long been known that the Housatonic River
was seriously contaminated by the now-closed plant. PCBs are very
stable compounds that, once in the environment, persist for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year now, the EPA and other agencies have been
undergoing intensive negotiations with General Electric about plans
and a timetable for a cleanup, virtually all of which is to be paid
for by the company, and a final consent decree is expected in the
next few weeks, DeVillars said. The cleanup is expected to cost
``well over $200 million'' and last ``well into the next decade,''
said EPA spokesman Peyton Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Svirsky, the EPA's project manager for the Housatonic
cleanup, stressed that ``we are at the very beginning of this
study,'' and it may well be that other animal species may be
affected. The agency also is looking into other ways people might
be affected by the contaminated river, such as direct exposure from
wading along the shore by hunters or other recreational visitors to
the state forests that border the river.
</P>
<P>
   Svirsky described the study to sportsmen meeting in Lee in the
Berkshires Thursday night. She said some reacted as though they had
always assumed there was PCB contamination in the birds, while
others said, ``Oh, my God, I'm really worried about my health
now.'' She said one hunter said he ate as many as 30 ducks in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The provisional advisory issued Friday by the state Department
of Public Health explained that PCBs, which accumulate over time in
the fatty tissues of animals and humans, are associated with
developmental problems for infants and unborn fetuses, damage to
the immune system, and a probable cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory suggested that people should avoid consuming any
waterfowl from the affected area of the Housatonic, from Pittsfield
to Great Barrington. It also suggested that anyone eating wild
waterfowl (except migratory Canada geese, which are believed to be
unaffected) from anywhere in the state should limit such meals to
no more than twice a month. They should also skin the ducks and
remove all fat before cooking, discard the stuffing after cooking,
and refrain from using any drippings for gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks served in restaurants or sold in stores are farm-raised
and are not subject to these warnings, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Official warnings against eating fish (as well as frogs and
turtles) from the river have been in place since 1982, but this is
the first time waterfowl from the area have been tested.
</P>
<P>
   Levels of PCBs found in the flesh of ducks caught last summer,
when adjusted for fat content according to US Food and Drug
Administration standards, were found to average 648 parts per
million _ more than 200 times the FDA's ``tolerance level'' of 3
ppm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one six-month-old wood duck was found to have an
adjusted level of 3,700 ppm _ more than 1,200 times the tolerance
level. And the average concentrations in the 25 ducks tested were
17 times higher than those found in ducks at a heavily
PCB-contaminated Superfund site in Wisconsin, which is one of two
states (along with New York) that have already issued advisories
against eating wild waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test results are further evidence of the serious damage to
the Housatonic River,'' said Bob Durand, secretary of the state's
Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. ``We must expedite
cleanup efforts to protect wildlife habitat along the river from
further PCB contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   For control purposes, testing was also done at nearby Three Mile
Pond in Sheffield, which is considered uncontaminated. While the
results there were much lower than on the Housatonic, many of those
ducks also exceeded the FDA tolerance level.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Public Health maintains a
hotline for any residents of western Massachusetts concerned about
PCB exposure, at 1-800-240-4266. They will provide interviews and
free blood tests to determine exposure levels.

HOW COOL: PIGGING OUT ON BABES AND BEER 
</HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX - Life is good for Jimmy Kimmel. &QL; 
He's the co-host of Comedy Central's ``The Man Show'' with Adam
Carolla. He's also the co-host of Comedy Central's ``Win Ben
Stein's Money'' with . . well, guess. He and Stein shared a Daytime
Emmy for their work this year.
</P>
<P>
   And coolest of all, he's in a beer commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beer commercial is great,'' Kimmel said after a 10 a.m.
phone call roused him from bed. ``One day you go do it and they
just keep paying you.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with all this, Kimmel doesn't get what the fuss is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The beer guzzling, the exploding dog poop, the women jumping on
trampolines in slow motion. ``Especially'' the women jumping on
trampolines in slow motion. What is it about ``The Man Show,''
wonders Kimmel, who once attended Arizona State University, that
sets some people off?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always surprised when people get upset by stuff,'' Kimmel
said. ``To me, it's a comedy show. Relax. It's not like we're
bursting into somebody's home and setting their bed on fire. We're
just screwing around.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only ones. Shows like ``The Man Show'' and Fox's
``The X Show'' make no apologies for their testosterone-laced
humor. Whether it's a backlash against political correctness or a
willingness to laugh at something that's funny no matter how
distasteful (``There's Something About Mary'' made a few bucks at
the box office, you may recall), crotch-scratching, babe-ogling,
Bud-swilling guys have more and more outlets for their interests.
Kimmel is more than happy to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bachelor party without the hassle of getting
married,'' the Comedy Central Web site says of ``The Man Show,''
and that's an apt description.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's good or bad is up to you. No one feels iffy about
buxom women in short skirts bouncing on trampolines. You either
think it's funny or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't water it down at all,'' Kimmel said. ``It is a show
for guys. There are women who like it, but that is purely
incidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, you'll notice, pulls no punches. Never was that more
clear than at a gathering of television critics last month in
Pasadena, Calif. What's the difference, a critic asked, in having
women dance as the ``Juggy Dance Squad'' and putting people in
blackface and calling them the ``Darky Dance Squad''?
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for one thing, you're an idiot,'' he said. He and
Carolla then declined to answer, saying they wouldn't dignify such
a question with a response.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after answering trampoline questions, Kimmel lifted his
own shirt and jumped up and down, an event best described in two
words: not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   So how much of this is really Kimmel, and how much of it is the
guy's guy we see on TV?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a souped-up version of me,'' Kimmel said of his
television persona in an interview last week. ``It's part of my
life. It's not everything. I took the kids to see ``The Iron
Giant'' the other night. But that's not exactly what the audience
is going to be interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Kimmel, 31, who comes off like the ultimate bachelor,
has a wife and two children. He and his wife met at Arizona State,
where Kimmel ``drank a lot, didn't go to school a whole lot, like
most of my fellow students.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a very serious student. ASU is a school where all the
good-looking girls from neighboring states come to get tans.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the mid- to late '80s. While at Arizona State, Kimmel
worked as an intern in local radio, doing things like writing
satirical songs about then-Gov. Evan Mecham. When a Seattle radio
station offered him a job, Kimmel bolted Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, he was fired. He came back to Phoenix and parked
cars. He got a radio job in Tampa. He got fired. He got a job in
Palm Springs and, in an unusual move, kept it. He moved on to
Tucson and, yes, got fired, again for ``just causing trouble in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio gigs are, of course, notoriously fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that, but I don't know anybody that's been fired as
many times as I have,'' Kimmel said. ``I set a new standard.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally moved to Los Angeles, and hasn't been fired since. He
was the spokesman for the Fox network for a couple of years and
then landed the Stein show.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Man Show'' is Kimmel's true love. He hatched the idea
after a producer asked him to co-host a talk show with a woman and
urged him to appeal to a female audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving home and was kind of depressed,'' Kimmel said.
``I didn't want to turn into Gary Collins. I thought, `I gotta do a
men's show. A ``man'' show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So he called Carolla, who liked the idea, kind of.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's a great idea. It's never going to get on
anywhere.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After an abortive attempt at another network, Comedy Central
gave ``The Man Show'' the green light, paving the way for such
stunts as Kimmel and Carolla breaking hilariously in front of
``Star Wars'' fans who had waited weeks in line to see ``Episode I:
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite (stunt) was when we went around and convinced
women to sign away their right to vote,'' Kimmel said. ``Nobody
knew what suffrage meant.''
</P>
<P>
   His ambitions remain predictably lofty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to drive Oprah out of the country,'' Kimmel said.
``We're trying to force her to Canada. We think we'll be safe in
Canada. People will like her.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it?
</P>
<P>
   ``And Rosie O'Donnell, too, while we're at it.'' &QL;

MAKING SPANISH OFFICIAL PUTS BORDER TOWN IN CENTER OF DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ Right away, the nasty letters and cuss-filled
calls began pouring in to this sun-parched border town. One after
another, they reminded residents where they live, and their
cumulative vitriol confused the three officials who constitute
local government.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say they don't understand why the rest of the
country cares how they conduct city business. What matters is that
the people who live in El Cenizo participate. So with little
discussion and no dissension, the city commission voted early this
month to hold its monthly meetings and all official functions in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The decision made this tiny town along the Rio Grande the first
to declare an official language other than English. It also put El
Cenizo at the center of the debate over government's role in
helping _ or forcing _ immigrants to learn a language other than
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it is the United States, but what happens if
people want to know what is going on?'' said Mayor Rafael
Rodriguez, elected last November along with the two city
commissioners. ``I don't want to create problems with the federal
government, because we have enough problems. But this is right for
our community. It will give people more confidence and help them
communicate if they can do it in Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before this month's vote, Spanish was the language of El
Cenizo, a smattering of ramshackle houses and dusty roads located
about 15 miles downriver from Laredo. Many of its 7,800 residents
speak little or no English, among them the mayor, who concedes he
crossed the border illegally 20 years ago and has since become a
naturalized citizen. Children often translate for parents, and
locals who are bilingual tend to prefer Spanish among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the new policy makes perfect sense, as does another
designating El Cenizo a ``safe haven'' for undocumented immigrants
who make their way to the town.
</P>
<P>
   That one sets precedent, too. Although some other cities such as
New York and Los Angeles forbid their employees from turning in
undocumented workers to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
only El Cenizo threatens dismissal or recall for assisting the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Zuniga, an INS spokesman at the regional headquarters in
Dallas, said he does not expect the new policy to interfere with US
Border Patrol operations in El Cenizo, which he called part of a
``hot corridor for illegal immigration.'' The agency also has no
plans to challenge the local ordinance, which town officials said
was intended to reassure residents that they were safe in City Hall
rather than to condone illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everthing we've done is about making people feel more
comfortable, more like a family,'' said Commissioner Gloria Romo.
``It's not our business to help the INS. . . .And if you want
people's participation, their cooperation, you have to speak in
their language. You understand more in your first language even if
you're bilingual.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Christina Flores, who was at City Hall to help distribute
sacks and boxes of free food to needy residents, ``This is the
United States and people should speak English, but a lot of people
don't. What I think is they're making a big deal out of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone along the Rio Grande, however, considers the
Spanish-only policy harmless. Although official documents will be
printed in both Spanish and English to comply with state and
federal regulations _ and meetings translated into English if a
resident so requests _ some worry about the message being sent to
Mexican-American youngsters in El Cenizo and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher at nearby Kennedy-Zapata Elementary School put it
with a shrug after asking not to be identified by name, ``The only
thing I can tell you is that the kids' attitude is: If our official
language is Spanish, why do we have to learn English?''
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the policy to stand without challenge, and El
Cenizo's commission is bracing for a lawsuit of some sort.
Officially, Texas Governor George W. Bush has noted his belief that
government business should be conducted in English ``as a general
principle.'' Unofficially, his administration considers it a local
matter and has no plans to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   To Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of the Virginia-based
advocacy group English First, that hands-off policy could encourage
other cities with large immigrant populations to follow El Cenizo's
example. Calling the town America's ``very own Quebec,'' he added
that it only encouraged a separatist attitude among non-English
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nation of immigrants, we have to be able to communicate
with each other...,'' Boulet said. ``This is a wakeup call, first
to George W. Bush, who seems to think that being against
English-only will get him Hispanic votes but who doesn't mind this,
and then to our own federal government, because if we're not going
to insist on a common language, we can expect more like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people who oversee El Cenizo insist they are not out to
set a trend, or to help residents avoid learning English. As Romo
said, English classes for adults are held at the local community
center. Many attend.
</P>
<P>
   With no police station, no fire station, no garbage pick-up, and
no shortage of unpaved roads, officials and residents say they
understand that speaking English is the only way out of a town
where the average household income is just $7,423 a year. What work
can be found is in Laredo, and cars snake their way north in the
mornings in a one-way traffic jam that reverses itself in the
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Along with plans to push economic development and bring some
jobs home, Romo and Rodriguez said the town's progress depends on
overcoming the same citizen apathy that plagues most anywhere in
America. In the past, maybe a dozen people typically crowded into
the converted house that passes for City Hall each month. At least
twice that number is expected at the meeting in September.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall the other day, Ildalia de Leon was already a center
of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived most of her life in El Cenizo, and she prides
herself on knowing everyone and everyone's business. She also
speaks no English, and the commission's recent decision heartens
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make me more a part of things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation applauds the decision, too. But several
of them said they know better than to shun English, unless they
want to spend the rest of their lives in low-paying jobs in
southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows they still have to learn English,'' said Rene
Gonzalez, a high school freshman and aspiring computer programmer
who came here from Mexico when he was a small boy and mastered
English in less than two years. ``At any job, the manager always
speaks English. My parents don't speak it, but they made sure I
did.''

 &HT;    Man found shot near Atlanta school
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Rochelle Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As students at a northwest Atlanta high school were
wrapping up their day Friday, a man ran into the school and told an
off-duty police officer that someone had been shot to death just
behind the school property.
</P>
<P>
   Officer W.M. Calloway, working an extra job at Frederick
Douglass High School, found the man sitting inside his car, riddled
with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police helicopters buzzed above the school while parents waited
for their children in their cars. Most of them did not know that a
homicide had occurred on the street bordering the back side of the
school's property.
</P>
<P>
   The killing and the search did not disrupt the school's routine.
Students learned something had happened behind the school only
after Principal Samuel Hill told them in his end-of-the-day
announcement that there had been an ``incident'' off the property.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also told the children to avoid the area and watch the
evening news if they wanted details, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertie Hulin, the mother of two Douglass students, reeled off
security measures in place at Douglass: metal detectors, off-duty
police officers patrolling the hallways, student identification
cards. ``When you come up here (after school) they are looking in
your car to make sure you are a parent,'' Hulin said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the shooting, the same uniformed officers who
roped off the murder scene with yellow tape had responded to
another call just two blocks away. A 50-year-old man had been
struck by a Chevrolet Suburban and killed on impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, busy day in Zone 1,'' said Lt., J.C. Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Identifications were not available on either of the men because
their next of kin had not been notified.

ABORTION ISSUE ROILS GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internecine warfare over abortion is breaking out
in Republican presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that GOP candidates George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole
have been trying to douse flared up this week when the National
Right to Life Committee, several leading conservative columnists,
and some staunch antiabortion rivals pounced on Arizona Senator
John McCain for suggesting that abortion should remain legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an impulse in the Republican Party to make its
platform pro-life but be operationally pro-abortion,'' GOP
presidential candidate Gary Bauer said. A Christian conservative
who headed the Family Research Council, Bauer pledged this week to
fight that impulse and a growing public perception that Republicans
have ``wobbly knees'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   All nine GOP candidates oppose abortion rights. But they don't
agree on the details, like exceptions for rape or incest, litmus
tests for appointing judges, and a constitutional prohibition
against abortion. And because a majority of Americans support
abortion rights, the candidates also can't agree on how vocal to be
in their views.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on McCain, who has a 16-year record of championing
antiabortion rights legislation in Congress, looked like a shot
across the bow from some social conservatives alarmed that the GOP
is losing its spine on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain does not have a case of ``wobbly knees,'' said Howard
Opinsky, his spokesman, who called Bauer's statement ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Long Tobias, political director of the National Right
to Life Committee, said McCain is deliberately softening his
antiabortion stance to appeal to Republicans who support abortion
rights. ``He is trying to straddle the fence,'' Tobias said. ``I
could be cynical and say the reason why is that he is running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning this week in California, McCain declared he was
``pro-life'' and ``unequivocal'' in his support for overturning Roe
v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that affirmed abortion
rights. McCain clarified his remarks, reported in the San Francisco
Chronicle last weekend and repeated on CNN, explaining that before
repealing Roe, measures had to be in place to reduce the demand for
and risks of illegal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a point where (Roe) is irrelevant and could be
repealed because abortion is no longer necessary,'' McCain told the
Chronicle. ``But certainly in the short term, or even the long
term, I would not support the repeal of Roe v. Wade, which would
then force X number of women in American to (undergo) illegal and
dangerous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The flap is likely to have consequences beyond McCain's
campaign, however, because the Arizona senator is not the only
Republican candidate striking an accommodating chord on the
abortion issue. Bush says the GOP should retain its ``pro-life
tenor,'' but the Texas governor says he would not make antiabortion
views a qualification for judicial appointees or commit to choosing
a running mate who opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush and McCain, Dole would permit abortions in cases of
rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother. Dole, the former
president of the American Red Cross, says she considers herself
``pro-life'' but has intimated that as president she won't push an
antiabortion agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, an adviser to publisher Steve Forbes, a candidate
who has made opposing abortion a campaign centerpiece, said the
issue ``cannot be finessed much longer'' because the Republican
field is sharply divided between antiabortion activists and
passivists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the Washington Beltway, Republican rank-and-file
voters want to know which candidate will use the bully pulpit to
defend the unborn,'' Mueller said. ``If Bush, Dole, and McCain say
they can't do anything about that, then people will want to know
why they are running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition, said that the GOP pendulum is slowly swinging ``in our
direction,'' and that the harsh reaction to McCain's ``sensitive''
remarks means social conservatives know it and fear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bauers and the Forbes and the Buchanans are getting
eclipsed, and they are not scaring our mainstream candidates,''
Cullman said. ``There is an important shift this year, which is
it's OK to be more moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who put little focus on abortion in his 1996 campaign,
also is leading a drive to ensure that the GOP platform safeguards
support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
Commentator Patrick J. Buchanan has threatened to leave the GOP
race and run as a third-party candidate if the party abandons the
so-called Human Life Amendment, which is hallowed to antiabortion
activists and Christian conservatives and has been part of the GOP
platform since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says that to be the ``inclusive'' party of all
Republicans, the GOP must drop the prohibition language on
abortion. Dole and Bush have said that because the Human Life
Amendment has no chance of being enacted, the party should downplay
it.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the National Right to Life Committee, the capital's
most powerful antiabortion lobbying group, has said little publicly
on Bush and Dole's back-off on abortion, but it issued a news
release calling McCain's statements an ``opportunistic flip-flop
... to curry favor with certain political elites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dole and Bush would both be better than McCain,'' Tobias said,
adding ``there is reason to be concerned'' about them, too. ``But I
don't think the arguments of Bush and Dole sound like they were
written by our opponents, and McCain's do.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, which raises large amounts
of unregulated ``soft money'' for its political action committee
and is a leader in campaign issue-advocacy advertising, has been an
ardent opponent of McCain's proposals to ban soft money and
restrict issue ads. The committee, critics say, has more reasons
than abortion to torpedo McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say the National Right to Life Committee has been
waiting to lurch at McCain over campaign finance reform, and so
they seize on one quote on abortion, taken out of context, to do
it,'' an aide to the Arizona senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias acknowledges the committee disagrees with McCain on
campaign finance but says that has no bearing on the abortion
issue. ``There's no legitimacy to that charge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said an adviser to another GOP candidate, adding
he had ``no doubt'' McCain's advocacy of overhauling campaign laws
motivated the committee to attack him on abortion. ``Now that they
have raised hell, I don't see how they are going to be able to go
on saying Bush and Dole's positions on abortion are irrelevant.''

RAYMOND VERNON, 85, PIONEER SCHOLAR IN FIELD OF GLOBALIZATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)   By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raymond Vernon, who helped shape the postwar system of
international trade as a government official and influenced
thinking about the global economy as a scholar, died on Thursday at
his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said his daughter, Heidi Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon was a member of the Marshall Plan team that guided the
economic revival of Europe after World War II, and worked on the
development of the International Monetary Fund and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After serving in the government in
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of State
for nearly two decades, he went to Harvard University in 1956 and
never left.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Vernon first led an ambitious three-year research
project on the New York metropolitan region, supported by the Ford
Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which was regarded as
a pioneering work in urban studies. Afterward, at the Harvard
Business School and later at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
government, Vernon focused for decades on the study of the
international economy _ especially the increasing role played by
multinational corporations and the limits to governmental power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Vernon was the father of globalization long before people
used that term,'' said Daniel Yergin, an author and business
consultant. ``His work has had a phenomenal effect on several
generations of thinking about how the global economy works.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon's books on these subjects _ including ``Sovereignty at
Bay'' in 1973, ``Storm Over the Multinationals'' in 1977, and
``Beyond Globalism'' in 1989 _ were influential and often
far-sighted.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Commanding Heights,'' a 1998 best seller by Yergin and
Joseph Stanislaw, the authors, recognizing the scholarly foundation
laid by Vernon in the study of relations between government and the
global marketplace, wrote, ``It is impossible to write about these
issues without acknowledging the profound intellectual impact that
Prof. Raymond Vernon has had on them over the half century.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim B. Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School, called Vernon
``one of the most influential scholars of his generation, a true
pioneer in the study of multinational corporations and the
international economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 1, 1913, in New York City, Vernon was one of four
children in a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. His father,
Hyman, drove a truck delivering seltzer water to restaurants and
bars in the Bronx, and Vernon and his two brothers helped their
father heft the crates of seltzer on and off the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Their family name was Visotsky, but the children changed it to
Vernon, beginning with Raymond's older brother, Sidney. Recalling
her uncle's explanation, Heidi Vernon, said he changed his name to
improve his chances of being accepted into medical school. All four
of the siblings _ Sidney, Leo, Raymond and Corrine _ earned
doctoral degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon received a bachelor's degree from the City College of New
York in 1933, and earned a doctorate in economics from Columbia
University in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   At the SEC, where he worked from 1935 to 1946, Vernon handled
various assignments from studying the behavior of floor traders and
specialists on the New York Stock Exchange to planning securities
enforcement programs. While at the State Department, he was one of
the negotiators who brought Japan into the GATT trade system and
helped secure nondiscriminatory treatment for Japanese exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, as acting director of the Office of Economic
Defense and Trade Policy, he oversaw trade with the Soviet-bloc
nations and encouraged their trade with non-communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon's economic perspective, according to Yergin, who knew him
for many years, was shaped by having grown up in the Depression and
by his years at the SEC. ``He believed in markets, but he also saw
the weaknesses _ where they can go wrong,'' Yergin said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Vernon went to Harvard to head a three-year study of
the New York metropolitan region. His urban studies project
concluded with a measured though prescient projection _ continued
growth and prosperity for the three-state region, but decline for
broad swathes of the region's inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon began his research into multinational corporations in
1965. His early work anticipated that multinationals _ as
efficiency-seeking enterprises _ would transfer labor-intensive
work on standardized products to developing nations. In ``Storm
Over the Multinationals'' he analyzed how the pragmatic decisions
of increasingly global companies held increasing sway over economic
forces once controlled by governments, like trade flows and levels
of investment.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when European nations tried to combat the power of
American multinationals by fostering the creation of state-owned
``national champion'' corporations, Vernon predicted early on that
the tactic would prove to be poor policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His view was that state-owned enterprises could not compete
with the investor-owned multinationals, which are more flexible,''
said Robert Stobaugh, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business
School. ``His research became part of the foundation for the
privatization push of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Short and wiry, Vernon was an athlete until cancer slowed him
down last year. An avid oarsman, he could be seen daily at dawn on
the Charles River in his single scull. He competed for decades in
the annual Head of the Charles crewing competition. Icy winters did
not cool his competitive zeal. In his 80s, in fact, he set a world
record for his age group in one class of ``indoor sprints,'' rowing
machines with odometers attached. He was a member of the Cambridge
Boat Club for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great sadnesses of his life,'' said his daughter,
Heidi, ``was that he was not able to be on the river these last
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon's wife of 60 years, Josephine, died in 1995. Vernon is
survived by his two brothers, Sidney and Leo, and his sister,
Corinne; and by his two daughters, Heidi Vernon of Newton, Mass.,
and Susan Vernon Gerstenfeld, also of Newton, Mass., four
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon, the renowned student of multinationals, was once
employed by a multinational-in-the-making. In 1954, he went to work
for Forrest Mars Sr., who built the Mars candy empire. Vernon was
placed in charge of planning, finance and new products. He oversaw
the development effort that led to chocolate-covered peanut M&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   The new peanut variety was a success, and, in the candy
industry, Vernon was called ``the man who put the crunch in
M&AMP;M's.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon's foray into the private sector was short-lived, since he
went to Harvard after less than two years in the candy business.
But he would always talk of his M&AMP;M exploits at family gatherings,
impressing the younger members of the Vernon clan, recalled his
daughter, Heidi. ``He told the grandchildren that he was the person
who figured out how to get the letter M on each and every piece of
candy,'' she said, ``and they'd all believe him.''

TEXANS BRACE FOR NEW WAVE OF LAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 29) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Beginning this week, Texas motorists will have
some new reasons to practice highway safety.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid crashing head-on into new state laws, they may have to
give up that extra glass of wine with dinner and make doubly sure
their kids are buckled up in the car.
</P>
<P>
   One new law lowers the legal standard for driving while
intoxicated from the longtime .10 percent blood alcohol content to
.08.
</P>
<P>
   Another requires all children younger than 15, including those
riding in the back seat, to wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   And drivers had better be advised that the 18-wheelers with whom
they share the road will now be able to drive _ legally _ as fast
as autos on major highways.
</P>
<P>
   These are among more than 1,000 new laws, passed during last
spring's legislative session, that go into effect this week,
affecting everything from alcohol use and guns to health care,
schools, taxes and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some laws will save Texans money. Others won't.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans will have their electricity rates frozen under a new
electric deregulation law. But all motorists will have to pay $2
more for their cars' annual safety inspections.
</P>
<P>
   An education reform law that gave schoolteachers a $3,000-a-year
pay raise will have varying effects on local property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget experts said the law includes more than $1
billion in tax relief, an average of 6 cents per $100 valuation
statewide, so taxpayers in some school districts will see their
taxes cut. However, taxpayers in other districts will pay more,
depending on a district's debt, property values and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texans who cannot afford to pay the property taxes on their
homes, meanwhile, will have the new option of working them off, if
their local governments are willing.
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of some of the significant new laws
facing Texans. Some will go into effect on Monday and some on
Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HIGHWAY SAFETY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The law lowering the legal level of intoxication for drivers
to .08 percent blood alcohol content long has been a major priority
of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The group hopes it will remove
Texas' dubious distinction of leading the nation in
alcohol-involved traffic deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this law means is that if a driver is at all impaired,
his chances of getting caught and punished go up on Sept. 1,'' said
MADD spokesman Bill Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol-related traffic deaths totaled 1,748 in Texas in 1997,
according to the most recent data from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. That was 434 more lives than were lost in
similar crashes in California, the most populous state, which has
had the lower DWI standard since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the new seat belt law, children through age 14 must wear
seat belts in the front or back seat. Children ages 2 and younger
will still have to be in child safety seats.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new law allowing large trucks to drive as fast as cars _
up to 70 mph during the day and 65 at night _ on interstates and
other major highways may provoke controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say various studies have shown that highways are
safer if cars and trucks are traveling at similar speeds. And most
other states already have the same speed limits for trucks and
cars. But the Texas Department of Public Safety, which patrols
state highways, has some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law will present one of our greatest challenges,'' said
DPS spokesman Tom Vinger. ``The bigger you are, the more you weigh,
the faster you go, the longer it takes to stop. Car drivers need to
be aware of that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The higher truck speed limits won't apply to farm-to-market (FM)
roads and ranch-to-market (RM) roads. The limit on those roads will
remain at 60 mph during the day and 55 at night for trucks. Lower
speed limits also will remain posted for trucks and autos on some
interstates and other major highways in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature considered passing a related bill that would
have increased speed limits to 80 mph on some rural sections of
interstate highways. But sponsors let that bill die, partly because
they didn't want the 80 mph limit applying to trucks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The $2 increase in vehicle inspection fees means motorists in
Harris County will pay $25.50 for their cars' annual safety and
emissions inspections.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SCHOOLS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ In addition to raising teachers' pay, the new education law
will take steps toward one of Gov. George W. Bush's priorities _
ending social promotion in the public schools. Children entering
kindergarten this fall will get extra help if they are diagnosed
with reading problems. They will have to pass the state standards
test, beginning in the third grade, to be promoted to the next
grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ School districts will be required to include strategies for
preventing and dealing with violence in their annual campus
improvement plans. And they will have to report the number and
types of violent and criminal incidents occurring on each campus.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GUNS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Juveniles accused of delinquent conduct will be automatically
detained by police if they are caught with firearms, and judges
will determine when they can be released. A judge must hold a
hearing within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cities and counties will be unable to sue gun manufacturers
for damages caused by firearms unless the Legislature grants
permission.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UTILITIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The freeze on electric rates will apply to customers of
Houston's Reliant Energy and other investor-owned utilities, who
serve approximately 80 percent of Texas' electric customers.
Additionally, the new deregulation law will reduce rates for
residential and small commercial customers by 6 percent in January
2002. Also in 2002, customers can begin shopping around for their
electricity suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new telecommunications law will lower the cost of placing
long distance calls within Texas. But it will allow Southwestern
Bell Telephone Co. to increase the cost of some optional services,
such as caller identification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another law will prohibit ``cramming'' _ the adding of
unauthorized charges to a person's phone bill _ and provide other
consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ABORTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the session's most highly publicized laws _ a measure
requiring parents to be notified before their minor daughters can
have abortions _ technically goes into effect Wednesday. But it
won't apply to any abortions performed before Jan. 1. In the
meantime, judges will have to work out procedures for allowing
pregnant young women to seek court intervention to avoid telling
their parents of their abortion plans. The Texas Department of
Health also will be required to develop informational materials
advising young women of their rights under the new law, of
alternatives to abortion and of health risks associated with
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TAXES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ A school district or other local government may permit people
to perform teaching chores or other public services in lieu of
paying property taxes on their homes. Only people 65 or older could
perform such work for cities and counties, and they would work
their taxes off at the rate of $5.15 per hour, the federal minimum
wage. A certified classroom teacher could work school taxes off by
teaching at a junior high or high school and receive a maximum tax
credit of $1,000 a course a semester. A school board also could
permit a business to pay off its taxes by ``lending'' a similarly
qualified employee to teach classes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OPEN GOVERNMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ An overhaul of the state's Public Information Act is designed
to make it easier for Texans to obtain governmental records. Among
other things, the new law shortens from 60 days to 45 days the time
the state attorney general has to resolve open records disputes and
requires disclosure of contractual terms that governmental bodies
sign with private companies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HEALTH CARE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ A new law creates a health insurance program for low-income
children. Largely funded by part of the state's proceeds from the
tobacco settlement, it will begin enrolling children by next spring
and eventually may serve as many as 445,000 youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-employed doctors will be allowed to negotiate contracts
with managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Safety regulations will be imposed on the use of anesthesia in
outpatient settings. Hospitals and surgical centers already were
covered.
</P>
<P>
   _ It will be illegal to sell infant formula, certain
over-the-counter drugs and contact lenses at a flea market.
</P>
<P>
   _ It will be illegal to sell products containing ephedrine to
people younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CRIME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Repeat sex offenders released from prison could receive civil
commitments to outpatient treatment and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ If requested by the defendant, the judge in a capital murder
case will have to tell the jury that the defendant, if sentenced to
life, would have to serve 40 years, actual time, before being
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CIVIL JUSTICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Protection from liability is offered businesses that make a
good faith effort to correct their year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limits are placed on the Texas attorney general's authority to
hire outside lawyers. This law was promoted by the high legal fees
in the state's anti-tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
POLITICS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Political candidates and committees will have to file their
finance reports electronically for posting on the Internet by the
Texas Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BODY PIERCING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ People younger than 18 will have to have their parents'
permission to get most body parts pierced. The law doesn't apply to
earlobes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Minimum fine for illegally parking in a handicapped parking
space is increased from $100 to $250.

TRAVEL WOES TEST TEAMS BEFORE KICKOFF CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ If the game is anything like the trip
here, Ohio State and Miami are in for quite an adventure when they
meet in the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' team plane was delayed for two and a half hours
in Miami by bad weather on Thursday night. Once it took off, it was
diverted from Newark Airport to Kennedy International Airport, and
the team was then bused back to its hotel in Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a mild inconvenience compared with what the Ohio
State players went through.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes' charter flight Friday from Columbus, Ohio, was
canceled because of mechanical problems. Another plane was flown
from Newark, N.J., to Columbus, but it would not hold all the
players' luggage. The rest of the luggage was due to arrive later
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two-and-a-half-hour delay cut into Ohio State's practice
schedule Friday. After their workout, the players had to put on the
same clothes that they had worn on the flight _ and wear the
clothes to a social gathering with the Hurricane players Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been bad so far,'' Na'il Diggs, the Buckeyes'
senior linebacker, said during an afternoon news conference.
``Hopefully, everything will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Things could get worse for Diggs' unit on Sunday, because the
Buckeyes will be missing the starting linebackers Chris Kirk and
Courtland Bullard. Kirk is academically ineligible, and Coach John
Cooper suspended Bullard for one game for breaking a team rule.
Cooper would not elaborate on what Bullard had done. Neither player
made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second straight season in which one of the Buckeyes'
key linebackers has been academically ineligible heading into the
season. Last year, Andy Katzenmoyer was teetering on the brink of
being ineligible for the entire season before his summer school
grades got him re-instated to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruit student-athletes, and they all know what their
responsibilities are,'' Cooper said. ``We're not very happy about
what has happened to us academically, and we're taking steps to
correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has known about Kirk's academic difficulties, so he was
able to work Jason Ott at the middle linebacker position during
training camp. Ott is a sophomore who played in 10 games last
season, but for a total of only 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard had battled his fellow sophomore Tim Cheatwood at
outside linebacker during camp this summer. Cooper and the members
of the Ohio State defensive unit who were at the news conference
here Friday expressed confidence that Ott and Cheatwood could fill
in well for Kirk and Bullard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like shaving the top,'' Diggs said regarding the
loss of Kirk and Bullard. ``It's not a personnel problem. We're
just not as deep anymore. We've had to move a couple of linebackers
around, and we've talked to them to make sure they know what

   ISRAEL: SABBATH CRISIS AVERTED
</P>
<P>
   A political crisis was defused over the transport of a huge
electrical turbine on the Jewish Sabbath. Ultra-Orthodox parties,
which had threatened to quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition,
were temporarily assuaged by a compromise agreement: The electrical
company's turbine, which was to be transported on the Sabbath
because it will move only at three miles per hour, was loaded
before sundown, will be unloaded after sundown and will be driven
by a non-Jewish truck driver.

<P>
   The Basque separatist group ETA suspended peace talks with the
government, accusing it of seeking political gain from the
negotiations last May. But the rebels stopped short of halting
their unilateral cease-fire observed since Sept. 16. Their latest
statement to the Basque news media, on Thursday, came a day after
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar blamed the rebels for stalling and
charged that they are ``afraid of peace.''

   Hardline Protestants said they were considering legal action to
try to overturn a British ruling that the Irish Republican Army had
not broken a cease-fire with its purported involvement in killings
and gunrunning. Jeffrey Donaldson, a member of the Ulster
Unionists, was quoted by The Guardian as saying the idea is under
consideration, but no details were given. The ruling was supported
by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and by the Irish
government.

 &HT;    ARMY TERRORIST EXPERTS ADVISED RENO ON WACO
 &HT;    870&AMP;add. With WACO-CANISTER.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Army terrorist experts, including the commander of
the top secret ``Delta Force,'' attended the 1993 meeting at which
Attorney General Janet Reno approved use of tear gas against
members of the Branch Davidian group near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first indication that the Delta Force, whose presence
at the fatal raid was disclosed this week, was involved in planning
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that during that meeting, she raised numerous
questions about the effect tear gas would have on members of the
rebellious religious cult and, especially, their children.
</P>
<P>
   The military experts reportedly assured her that when tear gas
was used against them, the Davidians would be compelled to abandon
the compound in which they had holed up during a 51-day standoff
with FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of that happening, 80 members of the sect, including its
leader David Koresh and 20 children, died in a fire that consumed
their compound. The FBI has said the fire was started by the
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released to Cox Newspapers on Friday by the FBI
indicate that Col. William G. Boykin, then commander of the Delta
Force, and Brig. Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, then the assistant
division commander of the First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood,
Texas, were the previously unidentified officers who told Reno use
of ``CS gas,'' a potent form of tear gas, would make the compound
``untenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tear gas and the manner in which it was used at Waco have become
an issue in recent days with the disclosure that what the FBI
describes as ``a very limited number'' of military-issue
pyrotechnic gas grenades were used at one point in the final
assault on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation, contrary to Reno's repeated assertion during
recent years, has led to renewed calls by members of Congress for
committee investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., called for a Senate
Judiciary Committee probe of the pyrotechnic grenades and Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., said his House Government Reform Committee would
hold hearings on the matter in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday she was ``upset'' to learn that assurances to
her by the FBI that incendiary tear gas grenades were not used at
Waco were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the controversy over the tear gas canisters, the
Dallas Morning News reported that a ``former CIA officer'' had said
he was told that three or four Army special forces troops at Waco
had taken an active role in the Davidian assault.
</P>
<P>
   That would be illegal under federal laws that prohibit use of
military force against American civilians without a special
presidential waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been previously reported that military officers
were were at a meeting at which Reno was advised to approve the use
of CS gas at Waco, the names of Boykin and Schoomaker were deleted
from an Army memorandum describing the meeting. Both men were among
the original captains of the Delta Force when it was established by
the late Army Col. Charlie Beckwith and both participated in the
failed mission to rescue U.S. hostages from Iran in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   According to the widely circulated memorandum, members of the
Special Forces were at Waco on April 19, 1993, but strictly as
observers, whose activities were within legal guidelines and had
been approved in advance by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which was written on May 13, nearly a month after
the fiery end of the Waco standoff, was a synopsis of an April 14
meeting involving Reno, then-FBI Director William Sessions,
then-Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, two Army officers,
an ``unknown scientist (expert on CS)'' from the Army and several
FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests that advice given to by two Army officers _ both of
whose names were blacked out _ was measured and guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summary, we assessed that if the objective of the FBI was
to make the building uninhabitable, then CS would accomplish
that,'' the memorandum's author _ whose name was also blacked out _
stated. ``We stated that it was our belief that if enough CS was
inserted, eventually the inhabitants would not be able to remain
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the plan which was executed at Waco was an FBI plan,
which neither (name deleted) nor I helped prepare,'' the memorandum
writer said. ``At the same time, I did believe that they had a
reasonable chance of accomplishing their objective of forcing the
occupants out of the building. Their approach was substantially
different than anything that I have encountered. They were not
assaulting the compound and they were not there to rescue anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was surprising to me, but certainly not something of
which I am critical. It is simply a different way of looking at the
situation. I did not believe that the FBI and the attorney general
were trying to force me to support or defend the plan. It was my
belief that they simply wanted any observations that we felt
comfortable providing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boykin has since been promoted to major general and given
overall command of the Army Special Forces Command at Ft. Bragg.
Schoomaker has been promoted to general and is commander of the
multiservice Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   FBI documents released to Cox include letters written by
Sessions on April 16, thanking Boykin, Schoomaker and Army chemical
weapons expert Harry Salem, of the Aberdeen Proving Ground in
Maryland, ``for coming to FBI headquarters for the discussions that
related to the standoff in Waco, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues that were discussed here could have ended up being
roadblocks to the successful conclusion of the standoff,'' Sessions
wrote in identical letters to the three men. ``Your frank and
careful discussions contributed significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   A slightly different account of the advice offered by Boykin and
Schoomaker came from Hubbell when he testified before Burton's
committee in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military said (the Davidians) will come out of that
building,'' Hubbell said. ``I mean, I had a general and a colonel
both look me in the eye and say: 'They can't stay in that building.
They will come out immediately.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Besides Specter and Burton, Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., issued
a statement condemning the Justice Department for saying the
incendiary devices were not used at Waco, when in fact at least a
few of them were.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last week at the Department of Justice has a familiar
ring to it _ proof of information withheld from Congress and the
American people, an inadequate internal investigation and an
attorney general unaware of what is going on in her own
department,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank in Washington,
declared that use of ``pyrotechnic'' tear gas by the FBI was part
of a 20-year trend it described as ``the militarization of civilian
law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute released a new study on the purported trend,
entitled ``Warrior Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly time that we consider the damage that the
militarization of American civilian law enforcement agencies has
been causing in dramatic incidents like Waco and in may other less
well-known events across the country,'' said Tim Lynch, an author
of the study.

 &HT;    Hurricane a blessing? In parched South, maybe
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hello, Dennis. Goodbye drought?
</P>
<P>
   If Hurricane Dennis dumps tropical rains from Florida to
Virginia on Sunday and into next week, the storm could be just the
tonic to help quench a thirsty South, parched by drought the last
17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said Dennis and other tropical storms headed toward
the United States could help replenish the water-strapped South,
which is running 2-foot rainfall deficits in some places. Among
those who would rather get their rain some other way is Ray Allen,
a 56-year-old North Carolina farmer who tends 500 acres in
Elizabethtown, 80 miles inland from Myrtle Beach, S.C. _ a
potential coastal target for Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricanes are not our friends,'' said Allen, whose crops were
drenched by afternoon rains not associated with the coming of
Dennis two days this week. ``Winds will hurt you more than the rain
will help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of rain already has damaged his corn crop. More than 40
percent of his tobacco crop _ including the most valuable plant
tips _ remains in the field. Last year, Hurricane Bonnie blew apart
39 percent of his tobacco. The storm dropped 20 inches of rain in
some parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, probably you hear farmers say that a hurricane made
their crop,'' Allen said. ``But I'm not sure. I think they tear up
more than they ever help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Dennis was moving less than 10 mph Friday. One
computer model showed an inland storm system pushing Dennis out to
sea. Another had it brushing Florida before coming perilously close
to Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend now looks like it will get caught in a low pressure
trough and head northeast so most of the rain would stay on the
coast,'' said Jan Jackson, a meteorologist in Blacksburg, Va., one
of the driest places in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A direct hit is what's needed to ease water problems in places
such as Atlanta and the Research Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a glancing blow, Georgia will probably not get
enough rain to be beneficial,'' said David Stooksbury, Georgia's
state climatologist and a professor of engineering at the
University of Georgia. ``Basically, it's going to have to go right
over us to have much of a beneficial impact.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, Tennessee and South Carolina have asked for
federal assistance to help farmers recover drought losses. In
Georgia, nearly 80 percent of the state suffers from a moderate to
severe drought, especially in the southern farm regions.
</P>
<P>
   Severe drought has seared Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.
Roanoke's reservoirs have dipped to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   If Dennis or other tropical storms penetrate deeply inland, ``it
could have quite an impact,'' said Jackson, the Virginia
meteorologist. ``Usually this time of year, that's what ends
droughts.'' A drenching of 6 to 8 inches over several days would be
optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the rain will be welcomed,'' Stooksbury said. ``But the
trick is getting the rain without getting enough to have
flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto lingered over Georgia for
five days, drenching some places with 28 inches of rain, turning
country roads into canals. Nearly 700 billion gallons of water
washed into the Flint River between Albany and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any rain we're going to get is helpful. But we also don't want
6 inches in six hours,'' Stooksbury said. ``That will cause untold
problems. Even in agriculture, we can't say everyone wants rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Dennis could produce up to 15 inches of rain along the
Georgia coast, Georgia Emergency Management Agency Director Gary
McConnell said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hurricane Bret washed across the southern tip of
Texas then pushed to the middle of the state. The storm destroyed
$27 million of cotton.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it soaked the inland Rio Grande Valley, which
grows a bountiful crop of grapefruit and oranges. But drenching
rain could seriously damage Deep South cotton and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torrential rains would only hurt some of those big tobacco
leaves,'' said Bob Graham, chief agricultural statistician for
South Carolina, which counts flue-cured tobacco as its top cash
crop. ``It would probably destroy them.

CHURCH IN VENEZUELA HALTS CONFRONTATION BETWEEN CONGRESS AND
ASSEMBLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ An agreement brokered by the Roman Catholic
Church Friday has averted, at least temporarily, a dangerous
political showdown between the Congress and the rival
Constitutional Assembly, which earlier this week stripped the
legislature or its authority to pass laws.
</P>
<P>
   Under an accord announced Friday afternoon by Monsignor Hernan
Sanchez Porras, the president of the Venezuelan Conference of
Bishops, congressional leaders agreed to abandon their plan to
convene a special session Saturday in defiance of the decree
approved by the assembly Wednesday night. In return, the assembly
agreed to begin a ``dialogue'' with legislators and to establish a
joint commission to discuss their differences.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly, elected last month, is dominated by supporters of
President Hugo Chavez, a former army colonel who took office in
February promising to lead a peaceful social revolution here. The
Congress, by contrast, is controlled by traditional political
parties that Chavez describes as corrupt and ``moribund'' and who
have criticized his plan for a new Constitution as little more than
a power grab.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government wants to eliminate any organ that it does not
absolutely control,'' said Omar Barboza, a leader of Accion
Democratica, one of two parties that has dominated Venezuelan
politics for 40 years. ``We're living in a country without laws
right now, dependent on a handful of people in the Constitutional
Assembly who think they are the owners of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation here has also begun to generate uneasiness in the
United States, which in recent years has been the largest market
for Venezuelan oil but has largely remained silent about
developments since Chavez came to power. On Thursday, James Foley,
a State Department spokesman, said Washington was ``deeply
concerned'' about the assembly's ``attempt to limit the authority
and competence of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing this nation of 23 million people in a televised
speech Friday afternoon, Chavez praised the accord, but attacked
Congressional leaders as ``saboteurs'' and an out-of-touch
political elite ``dead and buried by the will of the people.'' He
denied any intent to install a dictatorship, saying that it is his
opponents who are trying to undermine democracy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why a special session if Congress is in recess, if at this
moment the Constitutional Assembly is installed in the capital and
everything is moving along as planned?'' the president asked
rhetorically. ``It smells of a provocation to me,'' he went on, a
``macabre show'' intended to ``cause a tempest in a teapot.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what there will be for Congress and the assembly to
discuss under the new accord remains unclear, since Chavez's
supporters made clear that they do not intend to budge from their
position that the assembly is all-powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to maintain our decree,'' Aristobulo Isturiz, a
vice president of the assembly, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The vague, face-saving agreement was enough, however, to defuse
a situation that earlier in the day seemed about to erupt in
violence. Friday morning the National Guard had to be called in to
restore order outside the Congress building after the Caracas
police proved unable to disperse angry protesters who had assembled
there, even after tear gas and water cannons were used.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Chavez had gone to the building in order to
prevent legislators from making good on their promise to reconvene
Congress, which had declared a recess last month precisely in order
to avoid a confrontation with the assembly. The pro-Chavez
contingent was quickly met, however, by supporters of the
traditional parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to defend the right of our parliamentarians to
enter their own house,'' said Guillermo Arocha, 34, a lawyer and
sympathizer of Accion Democratica, the more left-leaning of the two
parties. ``We elected them with our votes, and no one has the right
to remove them through a coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Arocha was Manuel Contreras, a member of Copei,
the center-right Social Christian party. The two groups have always
been bitter rivals, but both men stood shoulder to shoulder,
joining chants of ``Democracy Yes, Dictatorship No'' and the
singing of Venezuela's national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite our past differences, we have to be united now because
the future of democracy in this country is in danger,'' Contreras
said. ``Hugo Chavez wants to turn Venezuela into a dictatorship and
is using the Constitutional Assembly for his own nefarious
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both the pro- and anti-Chavez groups were armed
with sticks, and fistfights between them broke out throughout
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that at least 30 people were injured in the
clashes, but no arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators present at the scene complained to reporters that
police and National Guard units were working in concert with the
Chavez supporters to keep the lawmakers from entering Congress.
Still, at the height of the confusion, one group of deputies
climbed a fence and, to the cheers of their supporters, made their
way into the building, where the assembly was already in session.

VAUGH PUTS DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS BAD FEELINGS 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Mass. _ It's been a lousy season of defeat, frustration,
and pain, but Mo Vaughn credits his new employer near Disneyland
with replenishing the oxygen in this place he still calls home.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in the twilight of his Fenway Park career, Vaughn
said he had grown sick of the Boston spotlight, tired of his fights
with Red Sox management, and beleaguered by the headlines spawned
by his off-field behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Anaheim Angels slugger said it has taken the
continent he has placed between himself and his life under the
microscope in New England to make him feel at ease here again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird and those guys came here and played all season here
and then went back home,'' Vaughn, in town for a weekend series
against the Red Sox, said Friday in an interview. ``This was my
home, so I never got an opportunity to breathe. I felt that it was
time to go because I felt that it was just like I was getting
suffocated in my own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like now I can just be myself and enjoy this
area. I wasn't enjoying it anymore. I'll probably always work (in
California), but I don't think I'll ever live out there. I might
always live here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vaughn, settling into an easy chair in his expansive home,
said if his home-run heroics or fielding finesse fade into the mist
of baseball history books, he intends to make his work with
inner-city youth in Boston and beyond his lasting legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the skill to be able to sit down with any kid and _
without even knowing him _ have a great time,'' said the
31-year-old Vaughn, a Connecticut native. ``I'm able talk to them
and make them feel like they can go out and be a better person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to try to find ways to service these kids.
And this is where my base is. We can go from here to the West
Coast, but we're never going to start out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn's career with the Red Sox, for whom he hit 230 home
runs in seven seasons, ended amid acrimony and accusation last
November, the star slugger's less conspicuous Boston address has
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Mo Vaughn Youth Development Program in Boston's Dorchester
neighborhood remains open for business and the boss is regularly
checking in on the after-school program that stresses education and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's still with us,'' said 16-year-old Chantel Daley, who was
working at one of the center's computers this week. ``He kept his
word that there still would be a program and there is. We're lucky
to have someone like Mo to keep us focused and keep us studying.''
</P>
<P>
   If the contretemps between Vaughn and the Red Sox front office
sometimes assumed an air of unreality, there was nothing phony
about Vaughn's connection to the students for whom he has been a
source of money and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real genuine. The kids really respond to him,'' said
Leonard Zakim, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League of
New England and co-founder of Team Harmony, the region's largest
inter-racial gathering of young people, where Vaughn has been a
star attraction. ``This guy comes up to me at the end of last
year's event and says to me, `Tell me when to come back next year.'
I mean that's music to your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who provides about one-third of the youth development
program's $300,000 budget, said his connection with Boston
youngsters ``just exploded'' _ a link he said has grown stronger
over time. ``It's like a big train that just gets bigger and
bigger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn considers taking his youth tutoring program to the
Internet sometime soon, he is looking forward to reshaping his
baseball career after the cellar-dwelling Angels ride out the final
weeks of a dismal 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been hurt for a whole season,'' he said. ``This is
a big off-season for me. I'm excited about that. The only thing I
wish that didn't happen is I wish I didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' $80 million man injured himself in the first inning
of the season's first game, when he nearly broke his left ankle
after plunging into the Cleveland Indians' dugout. What followed
was a stint on the disabled list, a nagging staph infection, and a
subpar season with a last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was greeted by a mixture of cheers and boos when he made
a less than spectacular return to Fenway in May. He went 1 for 11
in a weekend series. He was out of the lineup Friday night so he
could attend the funeral of a close friend's mother in Stoughton.
He acknowledges that the frenzy of Fenway Park seems a long way
from the relative tranquility of Anaheim's Edison International
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it were tougher,'' Vaughn said. ``I think everybody at
one point in time should have the opportunity to play on the East
Coast either in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore or Boston. It
teaches you to play with more intensity on an every-day basis and
it keeps you accountable for what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn that meant sports-page headlines for game-winning
grand slams. It also meant embarrassing news stories about a
nightclub fight in 1995 that kept him out of the lineup and a 1998
drunk driving arrest after an accident on Interstate 95. He was
later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the baseball was over, it never stopped, and that's what
I didn't like about it,'' Vaughn said of the scrutiny he said he
endured. ``I couldn't go anywhere and relax. It got too much for
me. It was crazy. You heard people telling about how much I love
the spotlight. I hated it. I loved the people to talk about what I
did on the field. That was nice. But after a while, I don't think I
would ever have made it another seven years here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have another life besides here. I didn't go home in
the off-season. I didn't go anywhere. I just stayed in this area. I
felt suffocated. I just didn't think I was going ever to get away
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that Vaughn's departure would hamstring the
1999 Red Sox, the team is roughly where it was a year ago _ behind
the Yankees and in contention for a wild-card playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, Vaughn said he has encouragement and some advice for
his old teammates that he wished he had heeded himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of those guys,'' he said. ``They're my model of
consistency. I would hate for them to have a terrible season. ...
The one thing I've learned that I wished I had done when I played
here was to just play because you can't win those wars with
management. The fans get involved. Then they start booing you and
it's just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he is now philosophical about his departure for the
West Coast. In end, he said, both sides got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got mad with the baseball organization because I feel like
they tried to make me out to be something that I wasn't,'' he said.
``I think it was getting down to a point of where it was take-down
time. To me, I felt like I was starting to get strangled, you know
what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still got where I wanted to be and they got what they
wanted. You waste time being angry. It's not important. We've all
moved on and all gotten what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected dividend of his work in California, where he has
a home overlooking the Pacific, is that he now knows where he will
work and where he will live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved to California for baseball reasons,'' he said. ``But
for personal reasons, Boston has done a lot for me. I've made a lot
of connections here. I have a lot of friends here up and down the
line through the community, throughout the State House and
throughout the mayor's office. This is my home. I love the
atmosphere here. The kids that I have are here and I'm not ever
going to give that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he has left his name on his development program for
a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have no choice but to succeed,'' he said. ``I want
success. Some people might think we're going to draw back and leave
the situation alone. But we're going to intensify the situation and
make it better. I told the kids we're lucky to have been able to
last this long under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to be able to adapt and change. I told them they
don't have it that hard. I'm the one who has to go fly across the
country.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They have promised each other to be on their best
behavior, not to make their famous rivalry the stuff of U.S.
foreign policy for the next 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the new U.S.
representative at the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, are
offering the expected diplomatic nostrums of friendship and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely pleased that the Senate has acted,'' Albright
stated less than an hour after Holbrooke was confirmed earlier by
the Senate this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always on the same side, everyone knows that despite
what games they want to play,'' Holbrooke declared during his first
day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the pleasantries lies a competitive relationship
between two strong personalities, each keen to make their mark at
the end of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke wasted no time in jumping out of the starting blocks.
He left Friday for his old stomping ground, the Balkans, a place on
which he was conspicuously silent during the war in Kosovo but
where now he says he wants to push the embattled U.N. operation
into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Albright leaves next week for a two week round-the-world trip
that spans the Middle East, where she hopes to bring the Israelis
and Palestinians together for a reaffirmation of the most
agreements on Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank, known as the
Wye accords. From there, she goes to out-of-the-way New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh floor of the State Department, where Albright and
her coterie of close aides sit, there is nervousness. Albright's
chief handler, her spokesman, James Rubin, has been protective of
the secretary's role as the face of U.S. diplomacy, a position that
will be robustly challenged by Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, on Capitol Hill and at the think tanks,
foreign policy experts are waiting with anticipation for at least a
good show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to make a real effort to get along,''
said Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
``Madeleine knows the power of the perch of the United Nations. She
has used it herself. Holbrooke is not going to take a vow of
silence and there is always bound to be some tension between a
strong U.N. ambassador and a secretary of state.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, in fact, insisted that the post of representative to
the United Nations be restored to Cabinet rank before she took it
in the first Clinton administration, using it as a way of injecting
herself more forcefully into foreign policy discussions than some
of her most recent predecessors. Holbrooke, for his part, is a
proven master at the fine Washington art of press management.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Albright will be outflanked by Holbrooke, who
has deeper government experience, soaring confidence and an
instinct for how to get things done. He has a good relationship
with National Security Adviser Samuel Berger. He has easy dealings
with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who some State
Department officials think may end up playing the role of traffic
cop between Albright and Holbrooke as they jockey over turf.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright could benefit from Holbrooke. They will have to
work together this fall to persuade Congress to release enough
money to pay some of the $1.6 billion the United States owes the
United Nations. Ideologically and substantively, on issues from
NATO expansion to Iraq, they differ little. They have pledged,
colleagues say, to work together to present a more coherent and
forceful foreign policy than the Clinton administration has managed
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the built-in tensions are rife. Both Albright, 62, and
Holbrooke, 58 _ both longtime fixtures of the Democratic foreign
policy establishment _ were considered by Clinton for the job of
secretary of state at the start of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   She won in a tight contest. Holbrooke had negotiated the peace
agreement that ended the fighting in Bosnia. She had been a vocal,
sometimes abrasive, U.S. representative at the United Nations. That
Clinton was able to announce that he was naming the first woman to
serve at the helm of the State Department did not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Now Holbrooke is taking the job she held, which brings Cabinet
rank and a seat on the National Security Council. Thus, Holbrooke
is not directly under Albright's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Both have made their most recent reputations in the Balkans, an
area where they have disagreed in tone and may continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Albright argued forcibly that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic would only yield with the use of force. As the Kosovo war
drew closer, she barely disguised her belief that negotiating with
Milosevic was a fruitless exercise. Though the air war dragged on
far longer than she expected, she expressed vindication at the end
and her staff threw confetti on her at a victory meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is the administration's most energetic
negotiator, was sent to Belgrade by Albright on two last missions
to meet with Milosevic before the war began. Holbrooke was under
instructions from the secretary not to negotiate with Milosevic, a
position that Holbrooke appeared to chafe under at the time. During
the war, Holbrooke participated in the daily meetings at the White
House, often by a video link from New York. One participant in
Washington recalled how Albright sat tensely at the table, teeth
barely unclenched, as Holbrooke critiqued the various views
expressed in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kosovo is virtually a protectorate of the United
Nations patrolled by NATO and other troops, Holbrooke will be
intimately involved in trying to make the place operate properly.
</P>
<P>
   But there are larger issues on which the secretary and the
representative may well have to work out differences.
</P>
<P>
   How hard and how fast should the administration push for
Milosevic's ouster? What should be the future status of Kosovo: to
remain as part of Serbia or to be urged toward independence?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To work on all of this, Holbrooke will have a strong ally and
friend at the National Security Council, Christopher Hill, until
recently the ambassador to Macedonia. Hill starts work at the
council next week (Aug 30).
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns in the Albright camp that Holbrooke, who was
assistant secretary for Asia in the Carter administration, may try
to move into China policy. On Iraq, they appear to share the view
that the United States should keep up its air strikes and work
toward the ouster of Saddam Hussein. Both, according to Gelb, have
an interest in trying to get the United Nations Security Council to
work as a place where the United States can work out its conflicts
of interest with Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say that Holbrooke and Albright know they cannot
afford a repeat of the conflict in the Carter administration
between National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance. In that situation, neither official emerged a
victor.
</P>
<P>
   And here, the secretary in Washington and the representative in
New York, have larger sights. Albright is searching for a legacy,
probably to be found in her role in Kosovo. And Holbrooke needs to
show in the next 17 months that he is the kind of person Vice
President Al Gore wants as secretary of state if he wins the
presidency.

   A tightly knit community of 2,000 Haitian immigrant families
nestled between sugarcane fields and a sprawling industrial park,
this shantytown called Hope is still trying to recover from the
damage brought by Georges last September, when the hurricane flung
entire homes into the nearby fields and killed three residents.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's hurricane season now entering its peak, the
thought of another storm like Georges is bringing both dread and
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us very nervous, like you can't imagine,'' said
Nicolas Jean-Baptiste, 30, the elected leader of this squatters
group, which, like hundreds of other immigrant enclaves, receives
no steady government funds or services. ``Last year, we all stood
out in the rain because we were afraid our houses would blow away.
What if something like that or stronger hits this year?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this nation of 8 million people, residents have been
crossing fingers, saying prayers and offering wishes since early
this summer, in hopes that this year's rainy season not be like
last year's, because despite its booming economy and its
flourishing tourism industry, the Dominican Republic is struggling
to rebuild itself after Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents and international experts blame the government of
Dominican President Leonel Fernandez, who announced a $650 million
emergency aid program immediately following the hurricane. But much
of the money hasn't been available, observers say, because of
political bickering between Fernandez and legislators who oppose
him.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks in September, Georges marched across the Caribbean
with unusual precision and force, tearing through 17 Caribbean
islands, causing billions of dollars in damage and killing at least
400 people before turning and hitting the southern United States.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Hispanola, which the Dominican Republic shares
with Haiti, was hardest hit. With winds raging about 110 mph,
Georges sliced along the island from east to west, swelling rivers
and lakes that overflowed and buried villages under tons of mud and
left thousands stranded on rooftops for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   International aid poured in, including a total of $90 million
from the US government and help from New York City, which funneled
money and rebuilding efforts directly to San Pedro Macoris, the
hometown of Major League slugger Sammy Sosa and the country's
baseball capital.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't helped solve the country's chronic housing
shortage. Before the storm, the country lacked an estimated 40,000
homes. Georges left another 100,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   At Batey Esperanza, where most of the residents work either on
surrounding farms or at one of the duty-free factories down the
highway, government officials built a few cinderblock huts to
replace the corrugated tin-and-plywood shacks, but haven't been
back since November.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, about 4 percent of the country's tourist hotels and
resorts were heavily damaged, but most of them were up and running
again within a few weeks, rebuilt with private funds and insurance
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the recovery reaches the poor and rural people
last,'' said Antonio Maldonado, a technician at the Dr. Carl Thomas
George Hospital in San Pedro Macoris, which had its roof blown off
by Georges. ``The international help we received was definitely
bigger than what we got from our own government.''
</P>
<P>
   Government emergency officials were also sharply criticized for
missteps both before and during the hurricane. Rather than warn
residents on the southern coast who were most vulnerable, the
director of the civil defense agency predicted the storm would head
further north.
</P>
<P>
   Only when it became clear that Georges was heading directly for
the island did officials begin implementing disaster measures
including opening shelters. But by then, experts said, it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   In Santo Domingo, the country's capital, some shelters were
opened only after the city was pounded with angry waves and
torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, questions linger over whether the Fernandez
government made an honest mistake or whether it was trying to limit
panic by not issuing earlier warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say whether it was a decision or an error,'' said
one US official in Santo Domingo who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Either way it was a mistake that made the situation
worse afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials pledge that things have changed as a result
of the lessons learned from Georges.
</P>
<P>
   The civil defense agency, whose director was replaced with a
former military general immediately after the hurricane, has put
new warning procedures into place. And despite heavy damage to much
of the country's banana and sugarcane fields, officials say much of
the Dominican Republic's agricultural sector has been revitalized.
</P>
<P>
   But the scars of one of the deadliest storms in the Caribbean
remain scattered throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   A rusting, 50-foot barge which was washed ashore during the
storm still wobbles in the shallow waters along Santo Domingo's
shore-line drive; there are tree stumps everywhere where palm trees
were swept away; and San Pedro Macoris' beloved Tetelo Vargas
baseball stadium is still undergoing repairs before winter league
ball begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as important as a home or a school,'' said Josue
Hernandez, 45, a construction worker helping to rebuild the
butterscoth-colored stadium, which lost its roof and three light
poles. ``But it means a lot to us and it gives us a feeling of
pride. We need that.''

 &HT;    Wildlife resort will bring animals close
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ Internationally known wildlife expert Jim
Fowler hopes a 1,800-acre wildlife park he's planning for coastal
Georgia will revolutionize the way people view animals and the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have big open habitats where the animals can have normal
social interactions,'' he said of Jim Fowler's Wildlife Resort for
Animals and People. ``We'll have safari camps and lodges where you
look out over the water hole at night and watch the animals coming
to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler even envisions packs of wolves racing out of the woods to
chase safari vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having wild animals come close to you is exciting and
stimulating to people of all ages,'' he said. ``What the passengers
won't know is that the wolves get a food reward at the end of the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This resort will revolutionize the way people experience
wildlife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's group, PAWS, and private investors will spend $84
million on the park _ including up to $24 million for animals.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia native who maintains a 1,000-acre wildlife ranch on
family land near Albany, Fowler was on the coast Friday for U.S.
Rep. Jack Kingston's (R-Savannah) announcement of a $1.5 million
grant from the U.S. Economic Development Authority to Glynn County
to fund water and sewer lines to the park area. ''Without this
federal support, the cost of providing water and sewer services
would have made the project unfeasible,'' Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   The Branigar Organization, the real estate development arm of
International Paper Co., also is donating $1 million toward the
utility lines.
</P>
<P>
   The park, scheduled to open in spring 2001, pulled in the
federal funds because of the economic benefits it will bring the
area, said Vernon Martin, executive director of the Coastal Georgia
Regional Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   The park is expected to lure visitors from the almost 40,000
vehicles that pass by on Interstate 95, as well as from the rapidly
growing Georgia coast and inland areas. Fowler's resort will be
just a few miles from the popular Glynn County resorts of Jekyll,
St. Simons and Sea islands and is less than 60 miles south of
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the park is projected to create 500 permanent jobs
when it opens _ some for residents of nearby counties where
unemployment is high.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, attendance is expected to reach 1.3 million
annually _ more than the attendance at the World of Coke in
downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be one of the largest economic development
projects ever to occur in Glynn County,'' Martin said. ''It is
compatible with the environment and will yield tremendous economic
benefits for local businesses and governments in this region.''
</P>
<P>
   To be built on two tracts along I-95 just south of the Altamaha
River, the resort will feature native American wildlife on the
eastern tract and exotic animals, primarily from Africa, on the
western tract, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The resort is designed to make money but not to exploit
wildlife, Fowler said. Woods, wetlands and freshwater lakes will be
protected and animals will be cared for by experts. The facility
will feature living history exhibits, including re-creations of the
Indians who once lived here, and wildlife such as wolves, bison and
panthers that roamed the coastal plain centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife park also will include rehabilitation facilities
for ill or injured animals.
</P>
<P>
   None of the animals at the park will be taken from the wild.
Some will be orphaned or abandoned; others will come from breeding
programs, Fowler said, including programs operated by PAWS.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, who holds zoology and geology degrees, has lent his
expertise to the design and operation of numerous wildlife areas in
Georgia and elsewhere, including the Cheehaw park near Albany.
</P>
<P>
   He and his associates formed the limited partnership PAWS _
Parks and Wildlife Services _ several years ago to take over
private wildlife operations around the country whose owners were
unable or unwilling to continue them. Some PAWS operations care for
endangered cheetahs or rare horses; others rehabilitate injured
animals or reintroduce wildlife in parts of the country where
native species have been lost, said Bill Roose, Fowler's partner in
PAWS.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have successfully developed breeding programs for a lot of
these animals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for wildlife education and conservation is always hard
to come by, Roose said, but the new park is expected to pay for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The park is set on part of an 8,000-acre tract the Branigar
Organization is developing into a mixed commercial-residential
community. Called the Golden Isles Gateway, it is one of two major
Branigar ventures along I-95 in Georgia that each will attract more
than 20,000 new residents, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said he believes the park, which will include lodging,
restaurants and other retail components, all designed around a
wildlife theme, can be both a commercial and an educational
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of park will help visitors reconnect with nature and
convince them of the importance of preserving natural lands and
wildlife,'' he said. ''Very few zoos or parks have the capability
or the interest in doing this. But as our country and our world
become more and more crowded, our quality of life ultimately
depends on it.''

MILLER, GREENE TRIUMPH IN 200-METER RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Winning is contagious, says coach John Smith,
and champions beget champions. He was speaking of the long term,
but he might as well have been describing what had, in a mere 41.67
seconds, just unfolded on the track in front of him as first Inger
Miller (21.77) and then Maurice Greene (19.90) won their
back-to-back 200-meter races Friday night at the World
Championships of Track and Field.
</P>
<P>
   For Greene, who Sunday won the 100-meter title, it was his
second gold medal of the week, making him the first double-gold
winner of the meet and giving him a shot at three as he heads into
the 4 x 100 relay. For Miller, who took silver in the 100, it was
the biggest win of her career, capping a week that saw her run one
personal record after another in the rounds of both the 100 and 200
and Friday night run the fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``PRs, PRs, PRs,'' said the 27-year-old Miller, amazed, after
the race. ``I don't even know what to say, but next year, you know
what everybody? It's not a one-woman show anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That woman would be Marion Jones, absent from the final after
suffering back spasms in Wednesday night's semi and failing to
finish the race. Miller's 21.77 pushed Jones's 21.81 into second
place on the world list for 1999; between the two they own the
fastest nine times of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Jones, still in town, had wished her luck in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones has gotten most of the attention, it's been a
breakthrough season for Miller, who in January joined Smith after
years of being coached by her father, Lennox Miller, the 100-meter
Olympic medalist from Jamaica. ``She didn't leave her father,''
said Smith. ``She changed coaches and got her father back.'' Miller
agreed: ``It's great. Now I've got him just as dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Miller's volcanic progress _ her fastest 200 had
been 22.10 coming into the final _ Smith pointed to a nearby TV
monitor showing her and Greene in a giddy embrace after their
victories. ``See that picture of Maurice hugging her?'' he asked.
``That's where that half-second came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sprinters train in Los Angeles under Smith as part of HSI
(Handling Speed Intelligently), a club of about 20 track athletes
who view themselves as family. ``We are all brothers and sisters
together and that gives us so much confidence,'' said Miller of the
group, which also includes Ato Boldon, the Trinidadian who is
injured and whose 200 world title Greene claimed Friday night, and
American hurdler Larry Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Miller's flamboyant celebration at the finish
line, where she dived to the track, rolled onto her back and
gleefully bicycle-kicked her legs into the air, Greene was subdued,
dropping to one knee and briefly sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still crying inside,'' said Greene, more than an hour
later.
</P>
<P>
   Greene _ who hasn't run a serious 100-200 double since high
school _ paid a visit to Boldon's hotel room to plot strategy for
Friday's race. The plan: get out early in front of Francis
Obikwelu, the Nigerian sprinter whose 19.84 in the semifinal gave
him the fastest 200 of the year. It wasn't as hard as they thought
it might be, given Obikwelu had a false start and then was forced
to hang back in the blocks to avoid a second and, with it,
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``That false start was nothing else but (Obikwelu thinking)
`9.79 is behind me,' '' analyzed Boldon, referring to Greene's
world-record time in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   Obikwelu (20.11) ended up third, behind silver-medalist
Claudinei Quirino da Silva (20.00) of Brazil. American Kevin Little
was sixth in 20.37. As he was for the 100 final, Olympic silver
medalist Frank Fredericks of Namibia, reportedly suffering from
sciatica, was a late scratch.
</P>
<P>
   To Greene, the task was simple. ``After I saw Inger win,'' he
explained, ``I just had to go out there and do it for the group.''

VAUGH PUTS DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS BAD FEELINGS

<P>
   EASTON, Mass. _ It's been a lousy season of defeat, frustration,
and pain, but Mo Vaughn credits his new employer near Disneyland
with replenishing the oxygen in this place he still calls home.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in the twilight of his Fenway Park career, Vaughn
said he had grown sick of the Boston spotlight, tired of his fights
with Red Sox management, and beleaguered by the headlines spawned
by his off-field behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Anaheim Angels slugger said it has taken the
continent he has placed between himself and his life under the
microscope in New England to make him feel at ease here again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird and those guys came here and played all season here
and then went back home,'' Vaughn, in town for a weekend series
against the Red Sox, said Friday in an interview. ``This was my
home, so I never got an opportunity to breathe. I felt that it was
time to go because I felt that it was just like I was getting
suffocated in my own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like now I can just be myself and enjoy this
area. I wasn't enjoying it anymore. I'll probably always work (in
California), but I don't think I'll ever live out there. I might
always live here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vaughn, settling into an easy chair in his expansive home,
said if his home-run heroics or fielding finesse fade into the mist
of baseball history books, he intends to make his work with
inner-city youth in Boston and beyond his lasting legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the skill to be able to sit down with any kid and _
without even knowing him _ have a great time,'' said the
31-year-old Vaughn, a Connecticut native. ``I'm able talk to them
and make them feel like they can go out and be a better person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to try to find ways to service these kids.
And this is where my base is. We can go from here to the West
Coast, but we're never going to start out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn's career with the Red Sox, for whom he hit 230 home
runs in seven seasons, ended amid acrimony and accusation last
November, the star slugger's less conspicuous Boston address has
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Mo Vaughn Youth Development Program in Boston's Dorchester
neighborhood remains open for business and the boss is regularly
checking in on the after-school program that stresses education and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's still with us,'' said 16-year-old Chantel Daley, who was
working at one of the center's computers this week. ``He kept his
word that there still would be a program and there is. We're lucky
to have someone like Mo to keep us focused and keep us studying.''
</P>
<P>
   If the contretemps between Vaughn and the Red Sox front office
sometimes assumed an air of unreality, there was nothing phony
about Vaughn's connection to the students for whom he has been a
source of money and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real genuine. The kids really respond to him,'' said
Leonard Zakim, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League of
New England and co-founder of Team Harmony, the region's largest
inter-racial gathering of young people, where Vaughn has been a
star attraction. ``This guy comes up to me at the end of last
year's event and says to me, `Tell me when to come back next year.'
I mean that's music to your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who provides about one-third of the youth development
program's $300,000 budget, said his connection with Boston
youngsters ``just exploded'' _ a link he said has grown stronger
over time. ``It's like a big train that just gets bigger and
bigger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Vaughn considers taking his youth tutoring program to the
Internet sometime soon, he is looking forward to reshaping his
baseball career after the cellar-dwelling Angels ride out the final
weeks of a dismal 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been hurt for a whole season,'' he said. ``This is
a big off-season for me. I'm excited about that. The only thing I
wish that didn't happen is I wish I didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' $80 million man injured himself in the first inning
of the season's first game, when he nearly broke his left ankle
after plunging into the Cleveland Indians' dugout. What followed
was a stint on the disabled list, a nagging staph infection, and a
subpar season with a last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was greeted by a mixture of cheers and boos when he made
a less than spectacular return to Fenway in May. He went 1 for 11
in a weekend series. He was out of the lineup Friday night so he
could attend the funeral of a close friend's mother in Stoughton.
He acknowledges that the frenzy of Fenway Park seems a long way
from the relative tranquility of Anaheim's Edison International
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it were tougher,'' Vaughn said. ``I think everybody at
one point in time should have the opportunity to play on the East
Coast either in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore or Boston. It
teaches you to play with more intensity on an every-day basis and
it keeps you accountable for what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn that meant sports-page headlines for game-winning
grand slams. It also meant embarrassing news stories about a
nightclub fight in 1995 that kept him out of the lineup and a 1998
drunk driving arrest after an accident on Interstate 95. He was
later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the baseball was over, it never stopped, and that's what
I didn't like about it,'' Vaughn said of the scrutiny he said he
endured. ``I couldn't go anywhere and relax. It got too much for
me. It was crazy. You heard people telling about how much I love
the spotlight. I hated it. I loved the people to talk about what I
did on the field. That was nice. But after a while, I don't think I
would ever have made it another seven years here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have another life besides here. I didn't go home in
the off-season. I didn't go anywhere. I just stayed in this area. I
felt suffocated. I just didn't think I was going ever to get away
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions that Vaughn's departure would hamstring the
1999 Red Sox, the team is roughly where it was a year ago _ behind
the Yankees and in contention for a wild-card playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   From afar, Vaughn said he has encouragement and some advice for
his old teammates that he wished he had heeded himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of those guys,'' he said. ``They're my model of
consistency. I would hate for them to have a terrible season. ...
The one thing I've learned that I wished I had done when I played
here was to just play because you can't win those wars with
management. The fans get involved. Then they start booing you and
it's just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he is now philosophical about his departure for the
West Coast. In end, he said, both sides got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got mad with the baseball organization because I feel like
they tried to make me out to be something that I wasn't,'' he said.
``I think it was getting down to a point of where it was take-down
time. To me, I felt like I was starting to get strangled, you know
what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still got where I wanted to be and they got what they
wanted. You waste time being angry. It's not important. We've all
moved on and all gotten what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected dividend of his work in California, where he has
a home overlooking the Pacific, is that he now knows where he will
work and where he will live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved to California for baseball reasons,'' he said. ``But
for personal reasons, Boston has done a lot for me. I've made a lot
of connections here. I have a lot of friends here up and down the
line through the community, throughout the State House and
throughout the mayor's office. This is my home. I love the
atmosphere here. The kids that I have are here and I'm not ever
going to give that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he has left his name on his development program for
a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have no choice but to succeed,'' he said. ``I want
success. Some people might think we're going to draw back and leave
the situation alone. But we're going to intensify the situation and
make it better. I told the kids we're lucky to have been able to
last this long under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to be able to adapt and change. I told them they
don't have it that hard. I'm the one who has to go fly across the
country.''

   When the first biotechnology companies went public, back in the
1980s, slick stockbrokers likened the investment opportunity to
buying Xerox or IBM at its initial public offering. So when the
genomics companies tapped the public markets a decade later, it was
no surprise that the analogy that brokers made was to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more than a germ of truth to this genomics pitch.
If you believe that some companies have the potential to create a
new industry, or to alter the rules for an existing one, then those
are stocks to own for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis behind the genomics companies is that deciphering all
the genes that make up the human genome, or the sum of the body's
genetic information, will prompt huge changes in health care. In
this vision, gene-based diagnostic tests will predict disease years
or decades before it occurs, and drugs of extraordinary specificity
will prevent or cure illnesses like cancer, heart disease and
stroke _ without side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The major drug companies have already paid hundreds of millions
of dollars to the genomics companies to gain access to their data,
and the betting is that the health care system will one day pay
billions for genomics-based drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The shares may be volatile, and investors may want to use big
movements as trading opportunities, but basically, those who
believe the thesis may want to own these stocks almost regardless
of how expensive they become. And those who don't believe it, of
course, may want to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of two of the biggest gene merchants have been on a tear
as investors have reacted to several gene-related discoveries
announced by Human Genome Sciences Inc., based in Rockville, Md.
Shares of Human Genome, the early player and the only one to take
its own drugs into clinical trial, are up 85.4 percent since Jan.
1. They closed on Friday at $65, nearly three times their 52-week
low of $22.75 last September. The stock of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, based in Cambridge, Mass., has tended to follow
that of Human Genome, even though Millennium has yet to develop
drugs of its own. But it has reaped over $1 billion from corporate
partnerships and plans to acquire a drug later this year. At
$59.125, it has more than doubled since Jan. 1 and is up sixfold
from its September low.
</P>
<P>
   The other two big genomics stocks are in companies that sell
genetic data bases to major drug companies. In comparison to those
in the first category, their shares seem like value stocks. Celera
Genomics Group of Rockville, Md., was spun off from PE Corp.,
formerly Perkin-Elmer Corp., at $21.3125 a share in May; it closed
on Friday at $25.50. Shares of Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Palo
Alto, Calif., closed at $24.50 Friday, down 32.1 percent since Jan.
1, largely because of the perception that an independent Celera
poses a threat to its core business.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, recommends a basket of Human Genome, Incyte and Celera.
``Own all three, because what you want to do here is get a position
in what will clearly be the basis of medicine in the 21st
century,'' Murphy said. He thinks Human Genome could hit $150 by
2002 but he has not established targets for the others.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy excludes Millennium from his portfolio because it has
diversified into agriculture and diagnostic sectors, and he no
longer sees it as a pure genomics play. But that assessment is not
universal.
</P>
<P>
   Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a health care stock
research firm, thinks Millennium has the best business model for
both finding partners and prospering on its own. ``What is
important to remember is that up to now, the majority of drug
discovery successes of smaller companies had to be shared with
larger companies,'' he said. ``It is quite likely the future will
be no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Most big-selling drugs are pills, which must be based on small
molecules produced through medicinal chemistry, the province of the
big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium has chosen to first establish a robust scientific
infrastructure, and from there to create very lucrative
partnerships, where a substantial portion of the combined success
will still become the exclusive property of Millennium,'' Mehta
said. ``If you are going to buy one stock and put it away for your
grandchildren, which will it be? We have recommended Millennium for
a long time.'' The stock surpassed his $50 price target last month,
and he has yet to calculate a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts say Millennium's future remains dependent on
the success of its partners or the acquisition of a compound that
may become a successful drug, for which it will have to compete
with the same deep-pocketed companies it partners with. Human
Genome Sciences is alone among the genomics companies in having
created drugs _ three of them, all undergoing clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to favor companies that not only supply genes or data
bases to corporate partners but, most importantly, can develop
their own drugs,'' said C. Anthony Butler, an analyst with Lehman
Brothers, which took Human Genome Sciences public in 1992. So far,
he added, that means Human Genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what just one drug will do for your value,''
Butler said.

 &HT;    In Atlanta, Bush backs gun laws
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas widened his support for
gun control measures Friday at a campaign stop in suburban Atlanta,
backing an increase in the minimum age for gun ownership and a ban
on certain large ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control measures face an uncertain fate when Congress
returns after Labor Day. But Bush, responding to reporters'
questions, said for the first time that he supports raising from 18
to 21 the age at which people can buy handguns. He said some
ammunition clips for large-caliber weapons should be banned, and
repeated his support for instant background checks on gun show
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are reasonable measures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been the scene of several gruesome gun incidents in
the past three months, and polls have found that suburban voters
are increasingly inclined to back some restrictions on gun
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, in July, Mark O. Barton killed nine people at two
Atlanta day trading firms before using his gun to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that any of the measures Bush endorsed would
have prevented any of the incidents in and around Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also repeated his opposition to a waiting period
for gun purchases, and he emphasized his continuing support for gun
rights. ``I believe innocent people, law-abiding citizens, ought to
be allowed to own a gun. I believe they ought to be allowed to hunt
and protect themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called, as he has before, for stricter enforcement of
existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a consequence and it should be called jail,''
Bush said about people who use a gun in the commission of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came at the end of a three-day swing through the
Carolinas and Georgia at which Bush returned to his core campaign
themes after being sidetracked last week by questions about drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   He attended two fund-raisers in Georgia that were expected to
bring in $750,000. Bush's campaign coffers exceed those of his
Republican competitors combined.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up the support of three more Georgia Republicans in
Congress, Saxby Chambliss, Nathan Deal and John Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Neutral in the presidential campaign, Georgia Republican Party
Chairman Chuck Clay surveyed a crowded ballroom at the Renaissance
Waverly Hotel and said, ``It's not lost on me that when you look at
the players in this room, this is the team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   A previously undecided state lawmaker, Rep. John Wiles, said he
would back Bush after hearing him talk to reporters at a
church-based social service center.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one I've talked to has raised the drug thing at all,''
Wiles said. ``It's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At a session with local journalists, Bush said he believes
voters want to know what he stands for. ``They're more interested
in what we discussed around this table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit to the Ministries United for Service and Training
center in Marietta highlighted his support for faith-based
anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush suggested a program's roots in a church, synagogue or
mosque should not disqualify it from public funds, even if
religious obligations are imposed on those it helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for leadership to say, here's a goal, helping
the homeless or feeding the needy,'' he said. ``Are they achieving
the goal? If the answer is yes, then as a society we ought to say
thank you from the bottom of our heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The facility Bush toured receives about a quarter of its $1.1
million annual budget from government grants. Executive Director
Nancy Morris said participants in her programs do not have to
attend religious services.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you receive funding, the rules say you will not
proselytize,'' Morris said. ``We don't want to do that anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Bush encountered on his tour was Charlene
Young, 40, a recovering crack addict.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I was burned out,'' she said. ``I needed to
be told how to live again.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said she volunteered the story of her addiction to the
governor, who did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had heard that Bush had ruled out drug use for the
past 25 years, but that he had refused to say any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't matter to me at all,'' she said.

ABORTION ISSUE ROILS GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internecine warfare over abortion is breaking out
in Republican presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that GOP candidates George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole
have been trying to douse flared up this week when the National
Right to Life Committee, several leading conservative columnists,
and some staunch antiabortion rivals pounced on Arizona Senator
John McCain for suggesting that abortion should remain legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an impulse in the Republican Party to make its
platform pro-life but be operationally pro-abortion,'' GOP
presidential candidate Gary Bauer said. A Christian conservative
who headed the Family Research Council, Bauer pledged this week to
fight that impulse and a growing public perception that Republicans
have ``wobbly knees'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   All nine GOP candidates oppose abortion rights. But they don't
agree on the details, like exceptions for rape or incest, litmus
tests for appointing judges, and a constitutional prohibition
against abortion. And because a majority of Americans support
abortion rights, the candidates also can't agree on how vocal to be
in their views.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on McCain, who has a 16-year record of championing
antiabortion rights legislation in Congress, looked like a shot
across the bow from some social conservatives alarmed that the GOP
is losing its spine on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain does not have a case of ``wobbly knees,'' said Howard
Opinsky, his spokesman, who called Bauer's statement ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carol Long Tobias, political director of the National Right
to Life Committee, said McCain is deliberately softening his
antiabortion stance to appeal to Republicans who support abortion
rights. ``He is trying to straddle the fence,'' Tobias said. ``I
could be cynical and say the reason why is that he is running for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning this week in California, McCain declared he was
``pro-life'' and ``unequivocal'' in his support for overturning Roe
v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that affirmed abortion
rights. McCain clarified his remarks, reported in the San Francisco
Chronicle last weekend and repeated on CNN, explaining that before
repealing Roe, measures had to be in place to reduce the demand for
and risks of illegal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a point where (Roe) is irrelevant and could be
repealed because abortion is no longer necessary,'' McCain told the
Chronicle. ``But certainly in the short term, or even the long
term, I would not support the repeal of Roe v. Wade, which would
then force X number of women in American to (undergo) illegal and
dangerous operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The flap is likely to have consequences beyond McCain's
campaign, however, because the Arizona senator is not the only
Republican candidate striking an accommodating chord on the
abortion issue. Bush says the GOP should retain its ``pro-life
tenor,'' but the Texas governor says he would not make antiabortion
views a qualification for judicial appointees or commit to choosing
a running mate who opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush and McCain, Dole would permit abortions in cases of
rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother. Dole, the former
president of the American Red Cross, says she considers herself
``pro-life'' but has intimated that as president she won't push an
antiabortion agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, an adviser to publisher Steve Forbes, a candidate
who has made opposing abortion a campaign centerpiece, said the
issue ``cannot be finessed much longer'' because the Republican
field is sharply divided between antiabortion activists and
passivists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the Washington Beltway, Republican rank-and-file
voters want to know which candidate will use the bully pulpit to
defend the unborn,'' Mueller said. ``If Bush, Dole, and McCain say
they can't do anything about that, then people will want to know
why they are running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition, said that the GOP pendulum is slowly swinging ``in our
direction,'' and that the harsh reaction to McCain's ``sensitive''
remarks means social conservatives know it and fear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bauers and the Forbes and the Buchanans are getting
eclipsed, and they are not scaring our mainstream candidates,''
Cullman said. ``There is an important shift this year, which is
it's OK to be more moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who put little focus on abortion in his 1996 campaign,
also is leading a drive to ensure that the GOP platform safeguards
support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
Commentator Patrick J. Buchanan has threatened to leave the GOP
race and run as a third-party candidate if the party abandons the
so-called Human Life Amendment, which is hallowed to antiabortion
activists and Christian conservatives and has been part of the GOP
platform since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says that to be the ``inclusive'' party of all
Republicans, the GOP must drop the prohibition language on
abortion. Dole and Bush have said that because the Human Life
Amendment has no chance of being enacted, the party should downplay
it.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the National Right to Life Committee, the capital's
most powerful antiabortion lobbying group, has said little publicly
on Bush and Dole's back-off on abortion, but it issued a news
release calling McCain's statements an ``opportunistic flip-flop
... to curry favor with certain political elites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dole and Bush would both be better than McCain,'' Tobias said,
adding ``there is reason to be concerned'' about them, too. ``But I
don't think the arguments of Bush and Dole sound like they were
written by our opponents, and McCain's do.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, which raises large amounts
of unregulated ``soft money'' for its political action committee
and is a leader in campaign issue-advocacy advertising, has been an
ardent opponent of McCain's proposals to ban soft money and
restrict issue ads. The committee, critics say, has more reasons
than abortion to torpedo McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say the National Right to Life Committee has been
waiting to lurch at McCain over campaign finance reform, and so
they seize on one quote on abortion, taken out of context, to do
it,'' an aide to the Arizona senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias acknowledges the committee disagrees with McCain on
campaign finance but says that has no bearing on the abortion
issue. ``There's no legitimacy to that charge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said an adviser to another GOP candidate, adding
he had ``no doubt'' McCain's advocacy of overhauling campaign laws
motivated the committee to attack him on abortion. ``Now that they
have raised hell, I don't see how they are going to be able to go
on saying Bush and Dole's positions on abortion are irrelevant.''

ALLEN SIGNS TWO-YEAR DEAL WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Defensive line, linebacker, and cornerback were
listed as their greater needs the past few days, but the Patriots
shifted slightly by tying the knot with running back Terry Allen on
a two-year deal, finalizing a courtship that began when Allen was
discarded by the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who simultaneously placed running back and kick
returner Derrick Cullors on injured reserve (losing him for the
season) after arthroscopic knee surgery revealed ligament damage,
finally got their price with Allen, who will be paid a $400,000
base salary and a $100,000 signing bonus with incentives that could
bring Allen's salary up to more than $1 million if he gains over
1,400 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, Allen, who has rushed for 6,881 yards in eight
seasons, must rush for 701 yards to earn an additional $250,000,
1,000 yards for $500,000 more, and 1,200 yards for $750,000 in
additional money.
</P>
<P>
   It behooves Allen, whose best season was in '96 when he rushed
for 1,353 yards and 21 touchdowns, to meet those incentives because
anything he earns would be paid to him in a guaranteed bonus the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Allen's agent, Tank Blank, who is currently
appealing a three-year suspension from the NFL Players' Association
for alleged recruiting misconduct, was asking for a signing bonus
of $4 million or a one-year deal for that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Allen didn't receive much interest at those prices and even the
Barry Sanderless-Detroit Lions said thanks, but no thanks,
following their recent workout of Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was consumated Friday morning, but really agreed to
Wednesday night, pending Allen's successful workout and physical
Friday at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Allen probably won't play in the exhibition season,
acknowledging at his press conference in Foxborough before boarding
a team bus for the airport and Tampa Bay, that he hasn't worked out
much and was thinking more of retiring than playing.
</P>
<P>
   The signing expends most of the Patriots' available cap space,
though the team can add depth to their areas of need by
restructuring existing player contracts or cutting veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   What Allen's advent does for Kevin Faulk, another Black client,
is unknown, though coach Pete Carroll seemed to have some idea of a
desirable game plan for the rookie and the 31-year-old veteran
during a telephone news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Terry is in good shape, it gives us a very good 1-2
punch,'' said Carroll. ``But who's one and who's two, we haven't
figured that out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't go this route last year when they drafted
Robert Edwards in the first round. There was no thought in making
Edwards an understudy to a veteran. While the Patriots have said
repeatedly they feel Faulk is durable, in recent days Carroll has
redefined Faulk as a ``15-18'' carries-per-game runner. Carroll
also said he would like to take advantage of Faulk as a returner, a
deeper concern now with Cullors out for the season. Limited by
ankle problems, Allen has averaged about 15 carries per season the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will Allen's arrival hinder or help Faulk? The
Patriots think it will help. Carroll insisted that he would never
let Faulk's development be slowed by Allen's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I would never allow that to happen,'' said Carroll. ``I
see it as a positive. Kevin runs hard and and he'll be able to do
so knowing Terry is there, and we can use him in the return game,
which should help us overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who averaged 4.7 yards per carry last season with the
Redskins, is also considered a tough inside runner has a nose for
the goal line and rarely gets pushed back or loses yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Allen feels he'll be able to get back in the proper playing
condition over the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work hard to get myself in shape,'' Allen said.
``I'm not that far gone, but I've got work to do. I haven't stayed
in shape. I had basically hung up my spikes, but I had an
opportunity to come to a good football team. I want to win a
championship and that's why I took advantage of this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he stayed out of negotiations with New England and
Detroit until a deal was in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my agent I didn't want to hear about it until it got
close,'' he said. ``I was happy being away and I didn't have to
come back to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen also said he's accustomed to the mentor role, having
played it in Washington the past two years and prior to that in
Minnesota. He said at times he's played it too well, having lost
his job in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd like for me to come and teach Kevin some of the little
things he doesn't know, like how to make it through a complete
season and what to look for when a defense lines up a certain
way,'' said Allen. ``I accepted this role a long time ago. When I
got to Washignton they had younger guys and I had to go out and
share time with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he no longer even speaks about his reconstructed
knees, a sore spot for him for many years, but he did say his
ankles, which have caused him to miss playing time each of the last
two seasons, are also healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to prove to myself,'' said Allen. ``The
only thing I haven't done is win a championship, that's the only
thing I haven't been able to do that I'm looking forward to here.
With this lineup, with a great quarterback, receivers, and a tight
end, at least I won't have to face all the eight-man fronts I've
seen over the years. You can't play defense that way against these
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear he'll have much trouble with the Patriots'
playbook, either. The offense in Washington under Norv Turner, a
disciple of Patriots offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, is
similar to the one in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry gives us maturity at the position,'' said Carroll, who
said the Patriots have been looking for a leader at the running
back spot the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's presence is not expected to affect Lamont Warren as the
third-down back, but it would certainly take reps away from him.
Unlike Warren, Allen is not considered a good pass receiver. One
player who may be affected most by the move is Harold Shaw, who was
being used as a complement to Faulk.

THIS TIME, DJINDJIC SAYS, HE'S READY TO `GO TO THE END' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, _ Zoran Djindjic has been refining his
plans _ and there have been a lot of them _ but he now seems ready
to roll the dice to try to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At 47, the urbane and telegenic leader of the Democratic Party
thinks it's his last chance to rid the country of Milosevic and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Huge street protests in the winter of 1996-97 petered out after
88 days, with Milosevic still in power, but Djindjic vows that this
time he's prepared ``to go to the end,'' though he can be vague
about what that means exactly. In an interview, he said he would
lead demonstrations, beginning with a Belgrade rally on Sept. 21,
until Milosevic resigns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that means his only options are victory, arrest or
exile, Djindjic shrugged. Later, he said that ``if Serbia enters
the new century with Milosevic at its head,'' he himself will
retire from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic must be gone ``by the end of October or early
November,'' Djindjic said. But he recognizes that Milosevic may not
be and that his strategy may have to be revised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ordinary people are not ready to take the risk, we will
lose,'' he said. ``But if they are not ready to be on the streets,
I'll be ready and try to lead them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his pragmatism and modern sensibility, Djindjic, with
less to lose, now seems more radical than his opposition rival, Vuk
Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement. That has made him more
attractive to Washington, which had long mistrusted the
German-educated Djindjic as being ``too European.''
</P>
<P>
   While Draskovic has been pushing for early elections under freer
conditions, possibly on Nov. 7, and Milosevic's aides have
themselves been suggesting an early vote, Djindjic says that free
elections will not be possible while Milosevic is president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the interview Djindjic said clearly for the first time
that his party and the larger opposition coalition, the Alliance
for Change, would have to participate in early elections, even with
Milosevic in power _ that they could not credibly boycott the vote,
as they did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But they would try to organize the election as ``a referendum on
Milosevic,'' he said, running slates of candidates that do not
include party leaders but would be headed by respected
non-politicians like Dragoslav Avramovic, the former Central Bank
head who brought down Yugoslavia's hyperinflation in 1994, and
Momcilo Perisic, the former army chief of staff fired by Milosevic
last November.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said he felt he had assurances that these men would
agree to lead such a slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd say OK to elections but have 2 million in the streets to
wait for the results as a kind of electoral control,'' he said. He
would hope that street pressure and the imploding of the government
would cause Milosevic to step down, so that ``truly free
elections'' could then take place with all party leaders running.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said he hopes to step up street pressure slowly but
surely, giving the government no pretext for a crackdown. ``We can
avoid many victims if we keep a daily pressure on Milosevic to
weaken him, to confuse the army and the police, and to isolate him
inside the regime as much as outside in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Under enough pressure, ``I believe Milosevic and his wife will
leave if they see they have lost,'' Djindjic said. ``I don't
believe they are brave enough to fight to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, pointing to Milosevic's indictment on war
crimes charges, think that the Milosevics have little alternative
but to try to preserve their positions, and that they would not
trust promises of safety from cronies, let alone opposition
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, trained as a philosopher, said the fate of the
Milosevics is not his concern. ``Milosevic is not a criminal but a
logical consequence of a part of our history,'' he said.
``Milosevic is a cause of our problems, but he is also, in an
important sense, a consequence of them. But if Milosevic remains in
power, and the effort to democratize fails, there will be a further
period of state disintegration.''
</P>
<P>
   But few see many signs of serious cracks in the government, and
some analysts regard Djindjic's new radicalism in part as an effort
to compensate for having fled Serbia during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djindjic is simply trying to find his way back to political
life,'' said Milan Milosevic, a respected political analyst and no
relation to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the opposition has totally overestimated the
possibility of revolution in Serbia because of the loss of
Kosovo,'' Milan Milosevic said. ``Djindjic has no chance as a
revolutionary, but all this has helped him to survive politically.
And by choosing this more radical path, he has rallied his troops
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic portrays himself as progressive, thoughtful and
sophisticated, and portrays politicians like Milosevic and
Draskovic, with their concentration on nationalism, traditionalism
and primitive communism, as ``antimodern.''
</P>
<P>
   Insights like that have made him an attractive candidate to the
urban educated in Serbia who want closer ties to Europe and the
rest of the world, especially after the fiasco of the war with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Though his rally speeches are improved and popular, he is not a
natural rabble-rouser like Draskovic. In a way, he is trying to
ride popular discontent as much as to lead it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Serbs may be angry but they are not
especially enamored of the opposition leaders. Asked in a poll
published on Thursday in Nin magazine which opposition leader
``will lead us out of the crisis,'' 68 percent of Serbian
respondents said ``none,'' while another 20 percent were undecided.
Some 4 percent chose Draskovic, 2.5 percent chose Avramovic, the
former Central Bank head, and 2 percent, Perisic, the ousted army
chief-of-staff. Only 1.5 percent chose Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the unknown margin of error in the poll were large, the
conclusions are fairly vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, said Milan Milosevic, is that ``all
opposition leaders are fascinated with the masses.'' Although they
only pulled 10 percent of any city's population into summertime
rallies, ``they see 10,000 people in front of them, and they
imagine it's a million.'' And, he said, they never do the kind of
serious local political organization that Milosevic's party has
always done, and in fact refined since it transformed itself from
the Communist Party.

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: Communist Party.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Radovanovic, an independent journalist, called Djindjic ``a
strange mixture of pragmatism and hysteria, and you never know
which will prevail.'' Djindjic ``seems wholly pragmatic, and then
something tips him over, and he's capable of overthrowing his
plans. And Vuk Draskovic drives him crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Djindjic who was most responsible for the breakup of the
opposition coalition, called Zajedno, or Together, when he went
back on his promise to back Draskovic in his 1997 presidential
campaign and instead boycotted the elections, Radovanovic said. He
noted that in 1993 Djindjic negotiated his own coalition deal with
Milosevic, pulling out only at the end, although four from his
party joined the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996-97 protests, ``Djindjic was spoken of as a
Serbian Vaclav Havel, and he thought he could run the opposition,''
Milan Milosevic said. ``But he had big problems with Draskovic, who
saw himself as the king of the streets'' and who, once betrayed,
engineered Djindjic's ouster as Belgrade mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that and the 1997 election boycott, Djindjic ``for
two years has been out of the game and in crisis, and his party has
been in crisis, too,'' Milan Milosevic, the analyst, said.
</P>
<P>
   He made matters worse by fleeing the country during NATO's
bombing campaign, his life under threat. State propaganda took full
advantage and called him a coward, a traitor and a tool of NATO,
charges Draskovic's party echoes, though less crudely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djindjic's effort to build bridges to Germany and France
seemed a very premature reconciliation with NATO powers,'' Milan
Milosevic said. ``So his only option was to try to take advantage
of popular discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as Djindjic, the Alliance and Draskovic have explored one
strategy after another, the summer has been wasted in disputes and
a now-dead plan for a transitional government of experts that
Milosevic was never going to accept.
</P>
<P>
   And the period after the capitulation in Kosovo _ when the
Milosevic government was rocked on its heels and seemed extremely
shaky, with the army and police unsure _ was not exploited, even
though the opposition probably could have united both those angry
with Milosevic for prosecuting the war and angry with him for
losing it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Serbs nearly expelled from Kosovo under NATO eyes,
it is easier for Milosevic to argue that the war was worth
fighting, given the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition never seems to anticipate anything,''
Radovanovic said. ``They only react to Milosevic and to events, and
to the insults of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Milosevic's suggestion of early elections has further
divided the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Djindjic, despite all the confusion and the skepticism, is
steeling himself. ``I believe that this is the last opportunity to
get rid of Milosevic,'' he said. ``It's not just the last chance
for me, but for us as a country.''

NFL WINDFALLS COULD BE TAXING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest plan for pro football in Los Angeles sounds good in
theory. It would use ``incremental tax revenue'' to pay for
Coliseum parking structures.
</P>
<P>
   Incremental tax revenue is money the government would take in
because football games would bring additional business to hotels,
restaurants and car-rental desks.
</P>
<P>
   If a Super Bowl were played in a refurbished Coliseum, for
example, and a downtown hotel filled an extra 20 percent of its
rooms with beer advertisers and sportswriters, the tax on those
room bills would be mailed directly to the Bureau of Parking
Structures.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear yet whether the Coliseum project actually could
be made to pay for itself this way. City accountants are still
trying to put dollar figures on the construction cost and the
incremental revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of that equation is the harder to estimate. How
much will visiting football teams spend for cab rides? Or for ice
for the training room? Or for Saturday-night movie tickets?
</P>
<P>
   I thought I should help by calculating the tax revenue from
sources the city accountants might otherwise overlook:
</P>
<P>
   $634,000 from moving-van company hired to deliver new team's
equipment to Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   $634,000 from moving-van company hired to remove new team's
equipment from Coliseum when it moves to Tulsa after four years
here.
</P>
<P>
   $12,000 from sales of handguns to visiting Cowboys head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   $762,000 from emergency medical clinics for treating spectators
beaten up by visiting Raiders fans.
</P>
<P>
   $99,700 from traffic helicopter pilots for overtime pay earned
covering Sunday-afternoon gridlock on Harbor Freeway (110) at
Martin Luther King Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   $5,430,000 from auto-body shops for repairing the roofs of cars
overturned in Super Bowl championship celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   $86,856,000 from tattoo parlors frequented by visiting players.
</P>
<P>
   $236,000 from ``in-room entertainers'' whose calendars really
fill up when Cowboys are in town.
</P>
<P>
   $79,663,000 from law firms hired to defend city, league and new
team against inevitable Al Davis lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   $449,000 from sales of autographs by players to young fans.
</P>
<P>
   $19,000 from biplane pilot toeing banner advertising ``Busty
Babs Dancing Tonight at Slobberin' Sid's Saloon.''
</P>
<P>
   $12 from Slobberin' Sid, willing to work for practically nothing
on choreographing cheerleaders' routines.
</P>
<P>
   $3,895,000 from limousine companies shuttling players to and
from their community service work at local homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   $64,870,000 from law firms hired to defend players against
battery charges following bar fights.
</P>
<P>
   $44,000 from glass shops asked to undo damage after players
throw bar patrons through windows.
</P>
<P>
   $2.79 from waiters for one year's tips from players.
</P>
<P>
   $459 from drug store for Warren Moon's weekend supply of
Metamucil.
</P>
<P>
   $827,000 from optometrists for updating referees' eyeglass
prescriptions at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   $54,000 from private security company hired to protect fans from
Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   $6 from hotel renting room to Eugene Robinson for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   $271 from Cade McNown for parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   $56,000 from loan sharks ``helping out'' fans surprised to hear
price of tickets at will-call window.
</P>
<P>
   $978 from John Madden to park bus at hotel for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   $67,000 from hospitals for treating quarterbacks' concussions.
$446,000 from hospitals for treating elderly coaches sickened by
Gatorade showers on sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   $1,744,000 from beach parking fees paid by citizens with no
reason to stay home Sundays if the Broncos aren't on television
every week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these are only a fraction of the possible benefits of
bringing pro football back to Los Angeles. Add them all up, and it
appears that paying for parking structures should be the least of
our worries. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ERVING TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the ninth day of Wimbledon, Alexandra Stevenson sat behind a
dais, as isolated as a new kid in the cafeteria. And people stared.
Around the world, they inspected her features as closely as fine
print. Was there a resemblance? Was she Dr. J's love child?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard enough to be 18 and deal with the normal insecurities
and heartbreaks brought on by crushes who never call. But on this
day, in front of everyone, her most intimate rejection might as
well have been broadcast over the loudspeakers of home room.
</P>
<P>
   This was painfully awkward. This was the day a newspaper report
identified Julius Erving as her father, a story accompanied with
his adamant denial of parentage. How do you think she felt, when
she knew the truth?
</P>
<P>
   Declining to comment on the report, and Erving's denial,
Stevenson seemed to shrug off the rejection, as if to say,
Whatever. A typical teen-age reaction when confronted with an issue
that cuts a little deeper than they are prepared to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Erving's reaction was to lie. He did it without regard for the
impact it might have on the vulnerable psyche of an 18-year-old
girl. For some, it's comfortable to explain away the initial
response of Erving as a panic attack. But for weeks, Erving was
aware of the article the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel was preparing
to run. He could have devised a more compassionate response. Only
when the evidence was undeniable did Erving release a statement and
admit the truth.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of behavior was only a continuation of the 18 years
Erving spent as the detached father of Alexandra. He eventually put
out a statement acknowledging he was her father, put the onus on
Alexandra to contact him, and removed himself from the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Erving has said nothing since, and did not return phone calls
Friday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. Open begins on Monday, he can hide in his
executive digs, tucked away in the Orlando Magic complex while his
daughter continues to deal with the fallout of a bombshell. When
the frenzy begins at Flushing, Erving can remain the absentee
father while Alexandra's mother, Samantha, shuttles her daughter to
the National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   As a visible fixture on the grounds, Samantha Stevenson will
continue to be blistered for her unethical behavior as a female
sportswriter who slept with an athlete, and ridiculed for becoming
mayor in the community of dysfunctional tennis parents. Yes,
Samantha's plan to raise Alexandra as a tennis phenom seems part of
some genetically engineered fairy tale. Yes, Samantha should be
condemned for becoming the caricature of a female sportswriter on
the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's so simple to trash her. After all, she is one of us.
One of the media. For once, we actually know the newsmaker in a
controversy because she has been in the cubicle next to us. So
almost every item of office gossip about Samantha has found its way
into publication over the last month, from rumors about the sexual
innuendo in her line of questioning to the way she buttoned her
blouse. It's the same mentality defense lawyers have used in rape
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Samantha was asking for this. Somehow, no one wants to
blame Erving for cheating on his wife. Sometimes, icons like Erving
just get a free pass on responsibility. Who questions Michael
Jordan's social consciousness? Does it bother anyone that Larry
Bird doesn't reach out to his estranged daughter?
</P>
<P>
   There's always an excuse for immunity. In Erving's case, well,
hey, at least he provided child support through a lawyer. But that
arrangement only makes Erving a caretaker of his own distinguished
and lucrative image. It's an image that was worth a $1 million
salary when the Orlando Magic needed a public relations makeover
and hired the Hall of Fame player as an executive in 1997, a move
made to add a touch of class on the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the criteria for class these days? As a polished
symbol of all that was graceful and dignified in the game, Erving
has loudly decried the selfish acts of Gen-X players who put
themselves above the NBA, players exactly like Steve Francis. The
21-year old out of Maryland pouted when he found himself banished
to the outpost of Vancouver on draft day and forced the Grizzlies
to trade him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This act of selfishness is the kind of example Erving might have
used when he once questioned the credibility that today's players
have with the public. What credibility does Erving have now?
</P>
<P>
   In the moment of truth, he denied his own daughter, a pattern
Erving established long ago. Plastered with a bold name tag at age
8, Alexandra approached Erving at a basketball clinic and looked
into the oval eyes shaped like her own.
</P>
<P>
   He said nothing, and she walked away. Rejection can be cruel,
but it's easiest for Erving this way.

SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS WANTED IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RYAN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Lyskawa looked everywhere for bus drivers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a severe driver shortage, the owner of the largest New
England-based school bus company was finally chased from his padded
office chair into the driver's seat of a big yellow bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got boring real quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to fend off a repeat performance behind the wheel this
year, Lyskawa, like other bus company officials in the region _
launched an unprecedented recruitment drive: parking buses with
``help wanted'' banners on the side of roads, running ad campaigns
on radio and television and even offering up to $300 bonuses for
drivers who recruit other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The expensive campaigns succeeded, the companies say _ barely.
``We're going into the year with our nose above water, but we don't
have any spares,'' said Lyskawa, who owns Bruce Transportation
Group in Hudson, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   About 980,000 students will start classes in Massachusetts
public schools in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a wake up call for Lyskawa and other bus company
managers across the country. For almost a decade, they faced an
increasing shortage of drivers, but a booming economy made the
situation drastically worse in the 1998-99 school year, creating
the biggest driver shortage in at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of job opportunities has left fewer and fewer people
willing to endure the extensive testing and training required, just
so they can earn $10 an hour, part time, driving more than 70
screaming kids to and from school, said Carl Eastman, executive
director of the School Transportation Association of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a stock market crash, suddenly there would be a lot
of bus drivers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyskawa's company is looking to hire 30 more drivers in
Massachusetts. And Laidlaw Educational Services, the largest
company serving the region, is looking to hire 250 more drivers in
New England and New York, said Jim Igo, regional director of driver
development and safety. The company spent twice as much money this
year in the area trying to attract qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly a national problem,'' said Michael Martin,
executive director of the National Association for Pupil
Transportation. ``In a marketplace where there are more jobs
available than people looking, it becomes a question of benefits
and attractiveness of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   To many, the job is inherently unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to have satisfaction in their job and feel
appreciated,'' Eastman said. ``School bus drivers do not sense
enough appreciation on behalf of the general public. They're
transporting 77 or even 84 lives, but they're seen as a nuisance by
some commuters.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a bus driving job, applicants must have a commercial
driver's license. That calls for completing a minimum of 35 hours
training, four written tests _ including questions about air brakes
and hazardous materials _ three driving tests, and an inspection
test that requires them to be familiar with more than 100 parts of
the bus, Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
   They must also submit to drug and alcohol testing, a criminal
background check, a physical examination and a check on their
driving record.
</P>
<P>
   One in five applicants at Bruce Transportation Group never
becomes a driver, Lyskawa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want to go through all (that) for a job that in a
lot of communities pays $10 or less an hour and carries with it no
benefits?'' Eastman said. Because the work is part time, most
drivers do not get health benefits, officials said. The average
driver works four hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a full-time job that people can support a family on,''
said Paul Keith, Laidlaw's general manager who oversees the area
including Boston schools.
</P>
<P>
   Boston bus drivers average 40-hour weeks, a $16.54 hourly wage,
and get 80 percent health coverage, as well as paid vacation days.
Because of that, Keith has about 50 more applicants than jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The average Boston driver also has more than 10 years
experience, a rarity in an industry that has an annual turnover
rate of about 8 to 10 percent, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That rate has grown to 15 percent for Lyskawa, causing him to
pour almost half a million dollars into recruiting over the last
year _ more than four times what he spent just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He offered bonuses of $100 to drivers who lured in any qualified
applicant and $200 for an already trained applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get anybody, but I tried,'' said
driver-turned-dispatcher Judy Mahoney, who donned a ``Safe Drivers
Wanted'' shirt and hit local job fairs. ``People complain about the
pay and dealing with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that experts say the shortage may continue, bus company
officials may have to keep battling to avoid ending up in the
driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hope,'' said Laidlaw's Igo. ``Especially after
spending a million dollars on recruiting.''

   The 3,100 drivers at C.R. England Inc., a trucking company in
Salt Lake City, got a big raise this month, their first in nearly
three years. They now average about $35,000 a year, but it is not
enough. Even their boss says so. ``The truth is, these guys are
underpaid for what they do,'' said Dan England, chief executive of
the company, which is family-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's 500,000 long-haul drivers are in tough
straits. Inflation has eaten at their pay, and the raises that are
just beginning to come through have not restored the buying power
that existed for these drivers in the late 1970s. The
re-engineering of the American economy started then, and is still
having its effect today, helping to explain two contradictory
trends: Pay has deteriorated for many Americans and wage inflation
has been mild, even as unemployment has fallen and labor shortages
have developed in some industries.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-road drivers are Exhibit A. They take the biggest rigs
up and down the country, their trips often keeping them on the road
for two or three weeks at a time as they deliver cargoes and pick
up new ones for destinations far from home. Most are paid by the
mile driven. Before deregulation, those mileage rates rose in step
with inflation. With deregulation, however, many more companies
entered the long-haul business, the new competition held down
shipping rates, unionization fell sharply and mileage pay
stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of raises, the drivers have tried to keep up with
inflation by driving more miles, often violating the 60-hour-a-week
work limit imposed by the federal government on interstate truck
drivers to insure that they get enough rest to drive safely. A team
led by Dale L. Belman, a professor at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, surveyed more than 500 drivers in the last two
years and found that the average driver worked 65.7 hours in seven
days; 25 percent of them squeezed in 75 hours in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are sitting outside a Wal-Mart waiting three hours for
your truck to be unloaded, you are on duty, but your wheels aren't
turning,'' Belman said, explaining one of the subterfuges. ``So you
pretend that the unloading time is sleep time, and that gives you
three more hours to run up miles.'' Others who load and drive
moving vans log time they spend loading as rest time. ``These
practices have always existed,'' Belman said, ``but they have
gotten worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the stagnant wages and the hardships, why don't the
drivers go into other work? After all, many jobs go begging these
days, and the unemployment rate is very low. Industry executives
say that long-haul drivers are indeed departing and that there is a
genuine shortage of drivers. England, for example, says 73 of his
2,500 rigs are parked and idle for lack of drivers. He has
responded by raising the average mileage rate he pays by 3 cents on
Aug. 1, to 32.5 cents, the first increase since 1996, when the rate
rose by 1 cent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver who has been with me for a year generally makes in
the mid $30,000's, which is pretty good for an unskilled person,''
said England, whose wage rates are roughly representative of the
industry's. But to solve the labor shortage, he said, annual pay
would have to rise by nearly a third, to $50,000. That isn't
beginning to happen in long-haul trucking, even counting
performance bonuses that some truckers are paying. Why? England
says he can't get price increases from his customers to pay such a
wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mileage rate went up 3 cents this month, and we are trying
to get back at least 2 cents from our customers,'' he said. ``We
are not going to make that. We will have a hard time passing along
wage increases until a shipper calls for trucks and can't get one.
That has not happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But while England sees labor shortages as a result of the
inadequate pay, Belman says that he and other industry executives
confuse job turnover with shortages. ``They don't distinguish
between drivers switching jobs and not enough drivers,'' said
Belman, who is also director of the University of Michigan's
Trucking Industry program. A typical driver, who has only a high
school education, he said, really can't leave the road and expect
to go on bringing home $35,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That much income requires 3,000 hours of driving time a year, 50
percent more than the normal work year in America. With so many
hours, the mileage rate works out to the equivalent of $11.60 an
hour. Even if the drivers could earn $14 an hour for a 2,000-hour
work year in another field _ a high hourly wage, given their skills
_ their annual income would shrink to $28,000, Belman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there is a lot of movement between trucking companies,'' he
said. ``You are a driver who is getting home only every 2.5 weeks,
and a recruiter says his company will get you home every two weeks,
and you switch.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all this amends common wisdom. In a deregulated,
competitive industry like long-haul trucking, where union
membership (in the teamsters) has fallen to 10 percent of the
workers, from 30 percent in the 1970s, the scramble for drivers
does not easily produce higher pay or wage inflation _ particularly
when the drivers do not see a viable alternative.

CLINTON WARNS INDONESIA OF CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has warned the president of
Indonesia that relations with the United States will be seriously
damaged if there is mass violence during next week's referendum on
self-rule in East Timor, senior administration officials said
Friday. The United States effectively has veto power over
international loans to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Clinton's letter to President B.J. Habibie was
intended to put him on notice that he will be held responsible if
the Indonesian military fails to crack down on the
anti-independence militias that have been responsible for several
recent killings in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The former Portuguese colony, which was invaded and annexed by
Indonesia in 1976, is scheduled to vote Monday on whether to become
an independent nation or an autonomous region within Indonesia.
Most experts on the territory are convinced that after two decades
of repressive Indonesian rule, voters will seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to reveal the exact wording of
the president's warning in a letter sent this week, but one senior
official said the threat of curtailing international loans and
other aid through the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank was not stated directly in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's implicit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior official said: ``It's a very tough letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government has been promised nearly $50 billion
in loans from the IMF to deal with the aftermath of the Asian
economic crisis, which has crippled the economy of the vast
archipelago nation.
</P>
<P>
   A three-member congressional delegation that just returned from
East Timor said that mass violence was a strong possibility next
week, especially given the close ties between the well armed
anti-independence militias and the Indonesian military and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst fears are coming true,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, who led the delegation last week and who supports the
immediate use of peacekeeping troops there, possibly including
Americans. ``I predicted this. The civilian forces, the Indonesian
police, are not going to stop these thugs. They're openly
associating with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said that if there is widespread violence next week, he
would push the administration to punish Indonesia under a 1977 law
requiring the United States to vote against World Bank loans for
countries that systematically violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has largely brushed aside questions about
the possibility of an armed peacekeeping force in East Timor,
saying instead that it supports the use by the United Nations of
unarmed civilian monitors and military observers. It has insisted
that the Indonesian government take responsibility for keeping the
peace in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to underline the fact that the Indonesian
government itself has placed its credibility on the line here,''
said James Foley, the department spokesman. ``The responsibility
for maintaining law and order is East Timor is very much the
responsibility of the Indonesian authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., who joined the congressional
delegation last weekend in East Timor, said it was clear that the
Indonesian military and police were working closely with the
militias, and that an armed international peacekeeping force was
vital. ``I think we should have had it in there already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the third member of the delegation, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.,
said, ``I think you've first got to make the strong, strong case
that we expect the Indonesians to live up to their agreements and
to provide a safe and secure environment for the elections. If they
don't, then the consequences should be severe.''

RED SOX STILL FIRST IN FANS' HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox are still No. 1 according to sports fans. Asked to
name their favorite pro team, the latest numbers show Boston's
favorite baseball team still holding a slim lead over the Patriots,
with the Bruins a close third and the Celtics a distant fourth. On
behalf of ESPN, Chilton polls fans across the country each week on
national and local issues.
</P>
<P>
   The last time around, in April 1997, the numbers were
approximately the same, with the Red Sox holding a 17.5 to 15
percent lead. This time, after a year-long poll (July 1998-June
'99), the Red Sox are still in first, just ahead of the Patriots
(21.2 to 19.8).
</P>
<P>
   According to Chilton, the only time the Red Sox have given up
the lead came after the 1995 baseball player strike, when the
Patriots held a 19.4 to 18.5 lead over the Bruins, with the fans
apparently so mad at the time, that the Sox finished third (13.8).
</P>
<P>
   However, the most interesting aspect of this survey is the way
the Bruins have separated themselves from the Celtics, and are
closer to the top than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In this opinion, there were several surprises in the overall
poll. For example, one would think local NFL fans would probably
vote either the New York Jets of Bill Parcells and many ex-Patriots
as their second-favorite NFL team. Wrong. How about the New York
Giants, who have had such a great following here dating back to the
1950s, prior to the birth of the Patriots, when they were the only
show in town? Wrong. Local NFL fans chose Denver second. The Jets?
They didn't make the top five. And the Giants slid to fifth, after
the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   A similar result with local NBA fans. After the Celtics, you
would almost guarantee that Larry Bird and his Indiana Pacers,
would be the second local favorites. Wrong. The Chicago Bulls took
that spot. The Pacers came in fifth, behind the Lakers and Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   How about this _ when Boston fans were asked to name their
favorite overall professional athlete, none of our own won. Michael
Jordan finished first, ahead of Drew Bledsoe, Ray Bourque, Doug
Flutie, and Nomar Garciaparra. No Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Martinez didn't get a sniff when the local major league
baseball fans were picking their top five. Nomar finished first
ahead of Mark McGwire, Mo Vaughn, Roger Clemens, and Cal Ripken.

   What is happening to us as a society? The word is around that
the caddies who are scheduled to work at the Ryder Cup in Brookline
are complaining about not being paid enough. The players involved
receive a $5,000 stipend for playing, and the caddies usually get
5-7 percent of what their golfer earns in a tourney, 10 percent if
the player wins.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to get money out of the PGA, why don't these
guys get it from their pros? Thankfully, not everyone is scrounging
for the money. Some 1,500 local volunteers will work a total of
40,000 hours for free in and around The Country Club, trying to
make everything work better.

   Patriot Nation was all pumped up this week after their favorite
football team toasted the Cowboys last Saturday night. Let's just
say that if they escape Tampa Bay without getting worked over
Saturday night, they might really have something to get excited
about.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to preseason games, the Cowboys are perfect
guests. Jerry Jones makes sure he schedules the teams in preseason
that sell out, so he can take home the biggest checks. Dallas coach
Chan Gailey doesn't get excited about exhibition games. He hasn't
won one yet and is riding an eight-game losing streak. In the last
five years, the Cowboys are 6-14 in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs are a little different. The last time the Patriots were
in Tampa, three days after Drew and Associates went diving in the
Mosh Pit, the Bucs belted them all over the field and made Bledsoe
a punching bag. At the moment, Tampa Bay might have the best
defense in pro football. They have given up just 10 points this
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion to Pete Carroll is to get Bledsoe out of action as
fast as he can, because the Buc pass rushers are a nasty bunch.
Warren Sapp has lost 40 pounds and has been manhandling people.
Incidentally, one of the surprises of the Tampa camp is wide
receiver Darnell McDonald, a seventh-round choice. One of the
Patriots' surprises, Michael Bishop, is also a seventh-round
choice. Both played at Kansas State last year.
</P>
<P>

   Whoever said Mo Money wouldn't hit his weight when he left
Fenway Park was right. He's only hitting .263 . . . Thirty-two
years ago, Lou Connelly got smart and left sportswriting to take a
real job at Suffolk University. He recently retired full time,
taking away two of the highest honors Suffolk gives out to
distinguished alumni, although his biggest achievement at the
school probably was having all five of his daughters graduate. Lou
is best remembered by his colleagues in the Boston media for once
predicting the exact attendance at a Red Sox game in Tiger Stadium,
to win the press box pool . . . The Celtics' Richard Pond says the
team is definitely not for sale, as reported recently in an Atlanta
paper. ``There was nothing behind the story,'' said Pond. ``The guy
that wrote it was guessing that since we didn't spend the money to
sign Ron Mercer, we must be trying to trim the payroll to set up a
sale. Although I think that if someone came up to Paul Gaston and
said they wanted to buy the club for $400 million, there might be
some interest.''

</P>
<P>
   Matt Hasselbeck, who has won a job with the Packers with two
super back-to-back outings against the Jets and Broncos, talking
about Brett Favre:``When I came here as a rookie last year, Andy
Reid (now the Eagles' head coach) was our quarterback coach. Andy
told me not to pay any attention to what Brett did mechanically.
Brett doesn't do his footwork the way coaches want him, and he
doesn't read the pass patterns the way they want him. But Andy told
me, pay attention to the way Brett is a leader on the team; the way
he communicates with the other players, and how he motivates the
team. Brett is a special guy, both as a player and a person. He's
dedicated to having a great year.'' Matt credits his seemingly
improved passing since his Boston College days to ``guys who can go
get it and catch it, better than I had at BC. These people (pro
pass catchers) can make up for some throws that aren't that good.''
. . . A standing ovation for Julie Rotondi from Thayer Academy, who
has just finished one of the best summers any local tennis player
has had nationally in a long time. Julie has been ranked sixth in
the nation in the 18 and unders, after finishing the national clay
and hardcourt championships. What makes this so noteworthy is that
she is the only one in the top 15 who is not a tennis academy
pupil. In other words, she doesn't spend six hours a day on the
court, all year in some camp, far away from home. She is an
all-around athlete who was named MVP in the prep basketball
championships her sophomore year.

<P>
   Here is an up-to-date scouting report from someone who has
watched Terry Allen play every game in recent years: ``If they use
him right, and limit his amount of carries, he could help them out.
Terry has lost a step and been injury-prone the last two years with
the Redskins. He is still a hard-nosed runner inside the tackles,
with great instincts. He's always had great vision, in picking the
right place to run. He hasn't lost that. What he has lost is the
quickness he used to have. He could still hit the hole pretty good
at the end of last season, but he didn't have the second surge to
get him past the linebackers. If they use him right, and he has
anything left, he can help them. But if they play him full time,
he'll get worn down, and get hurt again.'' . . . The Boston College
football practice field has been afflicted with the same dumping
conditions that many golf courses are battling these days. Geese
are leaving their droppings there on a regular basis, so the school
has purchased a dog to chase the offenders away. The athletic
department has decided to have a contest to name the dog. The
winner gets 10,000 tickets to the Northeastern game. Just kidding.
The prize will be decided later. If you think you have a winner,
send it to Chris Cameron in the sports public relations department
. . . The Globe's Bob Holmes, who heads our school sports staff,
has come up with the idea of naming the top high school football
players of the century in Massachusetts and is looking for the top
10 players who performed in this state since 1900. If you know
someone you feel merits this honor, outside of yourself or your
family, send the name, and the stats, to back up the selection.
</P>

<P>
   Buffalo Bills watchers are telling me that Doug Flutie is doing
it again. Last year Doug rescued Eric Moulds from the scrap pile
and pitched him into the Pro Bowl, making him one of the most
dangerous receivers in the league. Now they say Flutie is working
the same magic with rookie Peerless Price, the speedy wideout from
Tennessee . . . The AFC East could well produce the rookie of the
year. Cecil ``The Diesel'' Collins has been outstanding for the
Dolphins, and may be the runner that puts Jimmy Johnson over the
top. The Dolphins banged around the Bucs in a three-day scrimmage a
couple of weeks back, and Collins ran all over a very good Tampa
defense. However, it was hard to look better than Edgerrin James
did last week in his NFL debut against New Orleans. The Colts' top
pick _ the guy the Patriots tried hard to trade up and get on draft
day _ even had some of the Saints folks say he was better than
Ricky Williams, whom New Orleans picked first . . . By the time it
is sold out (which will be soon because there are only a couple of
hundred seats in the 2,600-seat Symphony Hall remaining), the night
honoring Arnold Palmer will raise $100,000 for the Francis Ouimet
Scholarship Fund. The money will be donated in the name of his
father, Deacon Palmer, who taught Arnie how to play. Tony Bennett
and John Williams are putting together a special musical night to
pay tribute to the golf legend . . . Carl Yastrzemski thinks Jimy
Williams should be a leading contender for manager of the year.
``For any manager to do the job that he has done this year, with
all of the problems they have had, and losing Flash Gordon for the
season, is incredible.''

INVESTING WITH: RICHARD S. BRODY OF PPM AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., August 29.) 
(jt) 
 By HILARY ROSENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The career of Richard S. Brody disproves the notion that
consultants are better at giving advice than doing the job
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As an investment consultant for seven years in the 1980s, Brody,
now 45, helped corporations and foundations pick the money managers
they used for their retirement plans or endowments. He focused not
only on returns, but also on the nature of organizations that are
most successful at investing. ``The best organizations I saw had
small team structures with very experienced people and a very
well-thought-out investment philosophy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Brody got the chance to show that he was more than
talk. The Prudential Corp. PLC, the $216-billion British insurance
giant that is not related to the similarly named American company,
hired him to run equity investments at PPM America Inc., its United
States institutional money management unit in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   One goal was to merge the roles of research and portfolio
management. When those duties are separate, Brody said, analysts
spend precious time marketing their ideas to portfolio managers,
who may ultimately not understand them. Moreover, he strongly
believes that meeting with the top management of potential
investment targets is crucial to value investing: he and the four
other manager-analysts make roughly 200 visits a year to companies.
</P>
<P>
   The system appears to work. For the five years ended June 30,
PPM America's large-cap value stock portfolio, with $7.3 billion in
assets, has returned 25.52 percent annualized, versus 23.64 percent
for the Standard &AMP; Poor's/Barra Value Index. (Individuals cannot
invest in PPM's large-cap portfolio, or its $170 million small-cap
portfolio, which has returned 19.31 percent, annualized, for the
five years ended June 30, versus 15.01 percent for the Russell 2000
Value Index.)
</P>
<P>
   In picking its large-cap stocks, PPM America starts with a
universe of about 800 companies with market values of at least $1.5
billion. That collection is divided among five portfolio
manager-analysts according to their industry specialties.
</P>
<P>
   To identify stocks that are inexpensive relative to the market,
Brody and his team use standard price-to-earnings ratios. But they
also pay attention to two ratios based on the so-called enterprise
value of a stock, which he defines as the market value plus the
debt and minus the cash on a company's balance sheet. These
multiples are the enterprise value-to-cash flow and enterprise
value-to-revenue. Because enterprise value accounts for net debt,
Brody believes it makes for a more valid comparison among stocks
and indexes than, say, price to cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the manager-analysts try to figure whether the market has
reason for valuing the companies so inexpensively. If they suspect
that a stock is undervalued after studying financial statements,
news reports and brokerage firm research, they start interviewing
management. The research-intensive process explains the low number
of stocks in the fund _ 55 or fewer _ and the low turnover rate of
35 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, PPM America's manager-analysts began looking into
the Promus Hotel Corp., based in Memphis. Promus merged in 1997
with the Doubletree Corp. and suffered through a management-level
culture clash. A new chief executive, Norman P. Blake Jr., arrived
last December, but the market reacted coolly to his strategic plan,
which included a quality improvement program and a stock buyback.
In May, the company announced that earnings for 1999 and 2000 would
be lower than expected. In two days, the stock fell from $31.25 to
$24, just 11 times analysts' estimates of 1999 earnings a share;
its enterprise value was just seven times estimated cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Brody and Samuel A. Yee, a manager-analyst, talked with
management and _ despite the lower earnings forecasts _ came away
impressed with Blake's sensitivity to Wall Street's concerns. In
early July, PPM America started buying Promus stock at $27.83 a
share; it now trades at $26.1875, or 12.1 times estimated 1999
earnings. PPM expects the stock to rise to 20 to 21 times estimated
earnings within three years. Analysts expect the company's earnings
to increase 6 percent in 2000; PPM thinks the company can do
better.
</P>
<P>
   In late July 1998, the stock of Computer Associates
International, a software developer in Islandia, N.Y., fell 46.3
percent after the company lowered its sales expectations as a
result of the Asian economic crisis. Heather A. Kang, a PPM America
manager-analyst, sat down with executives and concluded that there
was too much uncertainty to justify an investment.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, at the end of March, Computer Associates
announced the acquisition of Platinum Technology International, and
Ms. Kang reconsidered. PPM America started buying at $41.68 a share
in late April; the stock now trades at $51.75, or 19.3 times
analysts' estimates of earnings a share for fiscal 2000. Ms. Kang
expects the stock price to climb more than 50 percent over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   PPM America recently added to its holdings in Kmart, though
Brody conceded that the company's stock performance has been
disappointing lately.
</P>
<P>
   PPM's interest was piqued in 1997 by the retailer's plans to
compete more aggressively with rivals like Wal-Mart Stores. That
August, PPM bought shares at $14.02, or 4.7 times estimated cash
flow for that fiscal year. They rose to over $20 in June 1998 but
then began a long decline, as same-store sales growth _ for stores
open at least a year _ did not meet Wall Street expectations. The
stock dropped from $18.1875 in May of this year to $13 on Aug. 10,
and PPM America met with management in the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kang said that despite the recent weakness, which she
attributed to interest-rate worries affecting many retail stocks,
Kmart's management remained committed to its strategy The stock
closed on Friday at $13.25, or 10.6 times analysts estimates of
earnings for the January 2000 fiscal year. PPM said it believed
that the stock could rise to $25 in one to two years.

 &HT;    Phenix City, Ala., plays hooky to cheer favorite sons
 &HT;    By Susan Gast
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHENIX CITY, Ala. _ When the shoulder-high brigade of 11- and
12-year-olds from this eastern Alabama town rallied to win the U.S.
championship game of the Little League World Series, they put a
Southern swell of pride into the fans back home.
</P>
<P>
   As the Phenix City All-Stars blasted ahead of Toms River, N.J.,
construction workers grabbing a quick bite at The Lunch Box in the
city's aging business district weighed the merits of employment
against those of watching the game. When the team closed out a 3-2
victory and won the right to face Japan for the world title today,
the place went crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I still have a restaurant left,'' said Jerry Ham,
owner of the 4-year-old breakfast-and-lunch cafe. ``I think I could
have served (anything) and they wouldn't have known the difference.
Everyone's ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen men gathered in Nard's Barber Shop ``were stomping and
yelling and screaming on every pitch,'' said police Chief Preston
Robinson, who used his lunch break to get a haircut and watch
television.
</P>
<P>
   Phenix City trailed 2-0 when the game was delayed by rain
Thursday night. When the action resumed Friday morning, Phenix City
quickly scored quick runs, then shut down Toms River, the defending
champions.
</P>
<P>
   As the game ended, a celebration swept through South Girard
Junior High School, home to several team members, as students,
teachers and administrators chose television over books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students were cheering and clapping in classrooms and in
lunch,'' Assistant Principal Derek Hembree said. This city loves
sports. In the 1980s, its Dixie Youth and Dixie Major teams won a
handful of national championships. For years, the city hosted the
Alonzo Stagg Bowl for Division III football, and it still talks
about getting the game back. The citizens once rose up against
construction of a new hospital because it would mean dismantling
the 40-year-old Garrett's Baseball Stadium, named for a former
elementary school principal.
</P>
<P>
   Phenix City (population 29,088) is snuggled up against the
Chattahoochee River, the Georgia state line and Columbus, Ga. It is
north of the beach and south of the snow, so ``you ask anybody, and
the best thing to do here is to play ball,'' said Frankie Holmes,
who played third base on the 1982 Dixie Youth championship team and
has followed the All Stars with more than a little interest.
</P>
<P>
   The parks and recreation director, Max Wilkes, who played on the
city's first Little League team in 1952, said the city has a
history of strong programs. But this year is different, residents
said, because it has given the city national exposure. Through the
magic of ESPN2, the young players publicized the name of their home
town across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Residents appreciate the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenix City's been put on the map now,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has brought a lot of positive publicity,'' Hembree said.
``In the past, there have been negative things publicized about
Phenix City. Perhaps this will change the public's perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Hembree and other citizens referred to what resident Barbara
King and others call ``the Phenix City Days.'' In the 1950s, the
city gained notoriety as ``Sin City,'' a hot bed of gambling and
prostitution that led to a massive government cleanup effort and
the assassination of state attorney general nominee Albert
Patterson. The situation led to a movie, ``The Phenix City Story.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was a different time and a different Phenix City, local
folks say, and they are excited to have something positive put them
in the spotlight. A crowd of 1,000 gathered to watch the game
Thursday night on giant-screen televisions at the city's
amphitheater. Local businesses raised money for the players'
parents to attend the games. American Family Life Assurance in
Columbus flew local and state dignitaries to Williamsport, Pa., on
a private airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The support is far from over. Plans are being made to celebrate
the boys' homecoming, win or lose. The players are scheduled to fly
into Atlanta at 5:30 p.m. Sunday, then be transported by van or bus
to ceremony at the city's Idle Hour Park about 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m. Monday, a major public celebration will be staged
at the amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   The players will be carried by stretch limo from Idle Hour Park
to the amphitheater, Chamber of Commerce executive director Victor
Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been bugging their coach about getting a limo ride,''
Cross said. ``So we're going to give them one.''

 &HT;    Holyfield minister must tell about ties
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Fayette County judge ruled Friday that Evander
Holyfield's minister must give a deposition in the high-stakes
divorce case involving the heavyweight boxing champion and his
estranged wife, Dr. Janice Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Creflo Dollar of World Changers Ministries refused to
attend a deposition in June, claiming pastor-parishioner privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Ben Miller said Friday that some personal
aspects of Dollar's relationship with Holyfield are indeed
privileged, but he also said Dollar must provide financial
information to Janice Holyfield's lawyer, John Mayoue.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield did not attend the hearing in Fayetteville, but his
wife did.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar is a leader in the ``prosperity gospel'' movement, which
teaches that God promises wealth and health to the faithful.
Holyfield is one of 20,000 members of the church in College Park.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is prosperous, having grossed $92 million in prize
money alone from five fights since his October 1996 marriage to
Janice Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he's determined that Holyfield gave $403,000 to the
church in 1998, yet donated $3.9 million to the church in the 60
days before the champ filed for divorce last March 26. Mayoue said
$3 million of that came in one check five days before the divorce
filing.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also wrote checks for $150,000 to Dollar personally,
Mayoue said.
</P>
<P>
   Lecora Bowen, a lawyer for World Changers, argued that digging
up the financial information that Mayoue wanted would be a burden
on church employees. She said Dollar's relationship with Holyfield
was privileged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's required to appear in court, it will have a chilling
effect,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller ordered Bowen and Mayoue to set a deposition date in 10
days, or else he'd set one. Mayoue said he wants further
documentation of Holyfield's donations, plus records of when
Holyfield has had counseling sessions with Dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue said he didn't want to know the content of the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar could not be reached for comment Friday. A secretary at
his office said he was attending a meeting in New York. Bowen did
not return voice mail asking for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's personal lawyer, noted that the boxer
and his other lawyers did not oppose the Dollar deposition. He said
information from Dollar probably would help the champ in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue also asked Miller to rule on whether a prenuptial
agreement existed. Miller turned him down on procedural grounds,
but invited him to request a summary judgment later.
</P>
<P>
   Miller told Barry McGough, Holyfield's divorce lawyer, that he
might have to prove that a prenuptial agreement did exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect you'll be able to do that,'' Miller said to
McGough.
</P>
<P>
   McGough and Mayoue said they'd worked out an agreement on a
third issue: how to serve a subpoena to a woman who Mayoue alleges
in court documents lives in Holyfield's mansion in north Fayette
County.

 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Hundreds of man-made fires are burning
again in remote areas of Indonesia, blackening vast areas of rain
forest and sending pungent smoke across several nations.
</P>
<P>
   The fires, mostly set by owners of large plantations to clear
land on Borneo and Sumatra, reached a peak two years ago, when
thick smog dimmed the sun in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand
and the Philippines, as well as Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Now some environmental groups are warning that this could be
another disaster year, and officials from 10 countries in the
region met in Singapore Wednesday to press Indonesia to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we hope that it will not be worse than it was two
years ago,'' said Dedi Jefri, an official of Indonesia's leading
private environmental group, Walhi. ``But actually if the
government does not take preventive action, it could be at least as
bad this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report this month, Walhi said at least 441 fires were
burning as the dry season got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Though the smog is far thinner than at its peak two years ago,
it has already caused some airlines to divert flights and is blamed
for a collision of a barge and a tanker off Sumatra two weeks ago
that cost 10 lives.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be little anyone can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure, Indonesia passed laws in 1997
forbidding the use of fire to clear land during the dry season,
from July through October. Officials said 176 companies were
suspected of using the method. But so far, not one has been
successfully prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   With the government weak and distracted by politics and
continuing outbreaks of violence, a former official said, there was
little hope of effective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The companies involved are powerful and well connected, and the
revenue from the plantations is desperately needed as Indonesia's
economy continues to founder, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A British environmental group, Down to Earth, said in a recent
report, ``The forest fires are a symptom of the crisis in
Indonesian politics, economics and forestry policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups estimated that the fires in 1997 destroyed
25 million acres of forest land and caused losses to Indonesia of
nearly $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore this week, Emmanuel Nabet, managing director of
Spot Asia, an international supplier of geographic information,
said nearby countries were losing patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see a very interesting meeting because
Indonesia's neighbors seem to be fed up with the situation,'' he
said in a report by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The smog has been most troublesome to Malaysia, where in 1997 it
turned noon into dusk and forced residents of the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, to wear surgical masks.
</P>
<P>
   For fear of scaring off tourists, the response in Malaysia this
year has been to declare that there is no smog. On Aug. 5 the
government there announced it would no longer publish regular
updates of its pollution index. Malaysian officials blamed the smog
for a 13 percent drop in tourists in 1997, to 6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing alarming,'' said Environment Minister Law
Hieng Ding. ``Why do you all trust CNN? People can see for
themselves.'' CNN and foreign newspapers and magazines have shown
pictures of Kuala Lumpur's skyline blurred by smog.

 &HT;    Spencer re-signs, gets new sponsor
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ No matter how Jimmy Spencer performs in
tonight's Goody's 500, he has already had a successful weekend at
Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Carter, owner of the No. 23 Ford, awarded Spencer a
one-year extension. Carter also confirmed Friday that the team has
a multi-yearcommitment from a sponsor. K-mart, which sponsors
Carter's other team with driver Darrell Waltrip, is expected to
make an announcement concerning Spencer at Darlington next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big relief,'' Carter said. ``Now that we have those two
things out of the way, we can begin to prepare heavily for next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Off track
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, driver of the No. 43 Pontiac, could announce
today that he has agreed to a three-year extension with Petty
Enterprises. . . . Johnny Benson is expected to reveal early next
week that he will be leaving Roush Racing at the end of the season.
. . . Cal Wells, who will own a Winston Cup team sponsored by Tide
next season, met twice this week with Wally Dallenbach, who will be
released by Hendrick Motorsports at year's end. Wells is scheduled
to arrive at Bristol Motor Speedway today to possibly offer a
contract to Dallenbach. ``If (Wells) does not let me know by the
end of the weekend, it's time for me to move on and look at other
avenues,'' Dallenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Tough day of practice
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin, Kevin Grubb and Davey Blaney crashed during the
first Busch practice Friday. They were unhurt and used backup cars
in the race later in the evening. . . . Bobby Labonte was not
injured after wrecking the right rear of his car during the second
session of Cup practice.
</P>
<P>
   Busch merger
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Ridge Motorsports merged its Grand National team with
Joe Gibbs Racing on Friday. ``Our collaboration can only make us
better, in the shop and on the track,'' said Gary Bechtel,
president of Diamond Ridge Motorsports. Joe Gibbs Racing fields
Winston Cup teams for Bobby Labonte and Tony Stewart and one
full-time Busch team for driver J.D. Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   One-race deal
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine will be behind the wheel of the No. 30 Pontiac in
the Goody's 500 tonight. Bodine signed a one-race deal with Eel
River Racing, which released driver Derrike Cope on Wednesday. Team
officials will hire a permanent replacement by next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a driver with racing experience who would
mesh quickly with the guys on our team,'' Eel River owner Jack
Birmingham said. ``We have a good motor plant, car and equipment
ready for an experienced driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, who has 98 career Winston Cup starts, will be making his
season debut on the circuit. He has been a last-minute substitute
for Bill Elliott and Kyle Petty, among others. ``I'm always excited
about racing,'' Bodine said. ``This is a situation where Eel River
Racing needed some help, I've been friends with (crew chief) Barry
Dodson a long time and he asked me to help them out.

 &HT;    The start of something ... unknown
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ North Carolina State reminds University of Texas
linebacker Anthony Hicks of UCLA because of similar
spread-the-field offenses and a feisty quarterback who is equal
parts passer, runner and Marine-tough guy and who is sacked once a
month. Uh, that would be a Bruins team that outscored Texas 97-34
the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   No, free safety Quentin Jammer claims, the Wolfpack seems more
like Texas Tech with its multiple formations and premier skill
personnel.Would that be the Red Raiders who beat the Longhorns
42-35 a year ago or the ones who won 24-10 the year before? Or does
it matter?
</P>
<P>
   They're both wrong, Major Applewhite said. If Mike O'Cain's club
has anything in common with a recent Texas opponent, the Longhorns
sophomore quarterback picks Texas A&AMP;M. Yeah, that would be the Big
12 champion Aggies, but at least the Longhorns beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play hard, they're very fundamental,'' Applewhite said of
North Carolina State, ``and you know if the defense gets them the
ball, the offense will make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   All of those flattering comparisons suggest an intriguing
matchup tonight that will be hotly contested, will be as smooth as
sandpaper and will be an excellent start for one team picked to
probably only flirt with its respective conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the 80,000-plus fans who will cram into
refurbished, repainted Royal-Memorial Stadium in the school's first
sellout for a home opener in eight years are crossing their fingers
that this Texas team reminds them somewhat of last year's Texas
team. Little chance, that, except maybe on the scoreboard. After
all, the only Heisman winner at the game will be 44-year-old Earl
Campbell in his Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Complex seat.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Brown's missing that guy in the wedding gown, but his own
honeymoon continues. He has no star running back like Ricky
Williams, no veteran offensive front like the one that sent three
linemen to NFL camps, no emotional linchpin on defense like
linebacker Dusty Renfro. In fact, Brown bemoans Renfro's absence
almost as much as Williams'.
</P>
<P>
   Says Brown, the most vociferous coach in America, ``This is the
quietest football team I've ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He, of course, makes up for it. What his team lacks in
verbosity, hopefully it will make up for in ferocity. And velocity.
A balanced offense. More speed. Better depth. And a wide receiver
who might remind N.C. State followers of their own departed Torry
Holt.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone play corner? Can any two? (Questionable). Will
Applewhite be as effective with a less effective ground game? (Bank
on it.) Can four pseudo-tight ends replace one legit Derek Lewis?
(Maybe by November.) If Kwame Cavil develops into Wane McGarity
reincarnate, who's going to develop into Kwame Cavil? (Montrell
Flowers.) Does Cedric Woodard have to play end (yes) or can Cory
Redding blossom there as a freshman and allow Woodard to team with
Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers for a killer rotation at tackle?
(Maybe by November.)
</P>
<P>
   Will Chris Simms beat out Applewhite before the second snap?
(No, but his dad, Phil, could.) Is Anthony Hicks 100 percent? (Try
80.) Does the tasteless Joe Jamail Arch that looks like the
entrance to a Disney World ride mean that $5 million doesn't buy
what it used to? (Obviously it doesn't.)
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line on this bottom-line university, this should be a
very good football team, one that should improve with every month
ripped off the calendar. It'll be different from 1998, for sure,
but it is entirely capable of going 10-2 or even better. No
opponent is a lock to beat Texas.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least half of the 12 games on the schedule,
including tonight's, should rate as tossups at best. Count
Stanford, Rutgers, Rice, Baylor, Oklahoma and Iowa State as strong
chances for UT victories. If they split the other six, that comes
out to 9-3, which has a nice ring to it. Maybe not a Big 12
championship ring, but then again, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the fact that Applewhite is the best quarterback in the
league, Hodges Mitchell and Victor Ike are a suitable tag team, and
Bull Reese will concoct a salivating defense that might actually
stop the pass someday, the pick here is a 9-3 record starting with
a stirring 31-24 win tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation hasn't been as high around these parts since 1991
when Texas came off a sensational 10-2 season. But that Longhorns
team stumbled out of the gate, at midseason, coming out of the
locker room, again at the finish line and everywhere else a 5-6
team could stumble.
</P>
<P>
   The players have noticed the heightened expectations in Austin,
but that's almost a separate sport in these parts. Thousands have
flocked to the Longhorns' practices and scrimmages this month, and
even 460 eager females ranging from teeny-boppers to grandmas
flocked to campus for Brown's women's coaching clinic, more than
triple last year's number.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty wild,'' Applewhite said. ``One lady asked me
and Cedric to strip.''
</P>
<P>
   The two politely declined. Who knows, maybe the Longhorns
program that has raised hope only to dash it just as abruptly for
the last 15 years has finally dropped the tease.

   But Bowden came in at the same time that South Carolina hired
Lou Holtz, and the state's attention has been riveted on Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the son of Florida State's Bobby Bowden has gotten his
share of notice, and he says Holtz's arrival has not been a
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of grass to mow here,'' Bowden said. ``In
recruiting, maybe it's made it more difficult, especially with his
background and history of success, than if (South Carolina) had
hired an assistant (from another team).''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, 12-0 at Tulane last season, knows he isn't likely to
approach half that many wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college football, you can't cut the players and trade for
others and draft others. You have to go with what you've got,'' he
said. ``It's like having an ugly baby. You can put a hat on it and
put glasses on it and take it out and bring it back home, and
you've still got an ugly baby. Most of our good players are
younger. ``We don't have a returning offensive line starter for the
first time in 55 years. We were next to last in the ACC in every
defensive category but one, and we were last in that one. We only
have five home games. We open against seven bowl teams (actually
five). We were 103rd in the nation in turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers will feature Bowden's no-huddle, fast-paced offense
that brings everything from options to pulling centers, guards and
tackles. The players _ particularly the receivers _ are happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was run, pass, run, run, run, run,'' senior
flanker Mal Lawyer said. ``This offense isn't complicated, but
you've got to be in shape. There's no loafing, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the players in shape, Bowden instituted a conditioning
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been through anything like this in my life,'' said
Brian Wofford, who has caught 78 passes for 1,064 yards and 10
touchdowns at Clemson. ``If I had to, I could go full speed for 60
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback job has not been decided among Brandon Streeter,
Woodrow Dantzler and freshman Willie Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer said he can't wait for the season to start. ``Last year,
we were wondering how bad somebody was going to beat us. This year,
we're wondering how bad we're going to beat somebody.''

 &HT;    Jayhawks roll the dice against Irish
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An ``opportunity game,'' Terry Allen calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, an opportunity for what?
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Kansas Jayhawks played in a so-called
``opportunity game'' _ an early-season 12th game _ they had the
opportunity to get their heads handed to them, 42-0 by top-ranked
Florida State in the 1993 Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was head coach at Northern Iowa then. Now, the third-year
Kansas coach takes his Jayhawks into South Bend, Ind., today to
play No. 18 Notre Dame, preaching the hopeful philosophy that those
who ignore the past are not necessarily condemned to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of people around here who were here for
that (Florida State defeat),'' Allen said. ``But we're taking a
little different approach. The mental approach for us is that it's
an opportunity game, and we'll have two weeks after it to get ready
for what we're considering our true opener.''
</P>
<P>
   After today, the Jayhawks don't suit up again until they play
host to Cal State-Northridge on Sept. 11. But in joining Texas
today as the only two Big 12 Conference teams making their 1999
debuts, they get a stern test from Bob Davie's Irish, who return 11
starters from a 9-3 team.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas was a relatively late addition to the game, dubbed the
Eddie Robinson Classic in honor of the retired Grambling coach,
after Notre Dame's negotiations with Indiana fell apart. The
Jayhawks could earn as much as $1 million for the national
television appearance, and also got two extra weeks of practice.
</P>
<P>
   But there are what Allen concedes as ``inherent risks'' for the
Jayhawks, who return nine offensive and five defensive starters
from last year's 4-7 team. The major risk is getting pounded in
front of the nation, which is why a large number of players stayed
in Lawrence, Kan., this summer to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provided extra motivation,'' running back Henri Childs said
early this week, ``because we knew we can get blown out if we don't
play well. Everybody wants to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So are they? Yes, if running backs David Winbush of Killeen
Ellison and Mitch Bowles get support from a line missing three
starters from 1998, if all four new starting linebackers live up to
their athleticism that Allen likes, if quarterback Zac Wegner can
avoid another concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Those are big ``ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting ready for this game has been a real positive
experience,'' Allen said. ``For us, this is a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But for what?

 &HT;    Lions to snap to attention
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ From the simple blue-and-white uniforms his
players wear to his basic black coaching shoes, Penn State's Joe
Paterno is football's most conventional coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Paterno, 72, has decided to begin this season in an
unconventional way. His No. 3 Nittany Lions play host to No. 4
Arizona in the Pigskin Classic (1 p.m., Channel 2) today before an
expected overflow crowd of more than 96,000 in Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno was not alone in his thinking. This weekend marks an
unusual beginning to the season, as five of the preseason top 12
teams play games that could have an effect on the national
championship. This degree of risk-taking in August is
unprecedented, but, coaches say, there is a method to their
madness.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno, in his 50th season at Penn State _ 34th as head coach,
seems to be taking the biggest risk.
</P>
<P>
   With 19 starters returning and what could be the best defense in
school history, Penn State is a near-unanimous pick to win the Big
Ten and contend for a spot in the Sugar Bowl, this season's
designated national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   With a schedule that already included Ohio State, Michigan,
Purdue and a Sept. 18 trip to improving Miami, no one would have
blamed Paterno for passing on an early game against an opponent
such as Arizona, which has won 16 of its past 17 games and is the
heavy favorite to supplant UCLA as Pac-10 champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Paterno, knowing how good his team could be, did not want
his players to ease into the season. He wanted to get their
attention early, and this game has done that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there are very few negatives,'' Paterno said. ``When
you have a chance to prepare for a team as good as Arizona, you
probably get a little more out of summer conditioning and preseason
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, you are probably a better football team when you
start the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of a big game early gets an advantage toward the
national championship. And the loser still has plenty of time to
work its way back up the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical reason for playing the game is that the top
two teams in the Bowl Championship Series standings will play for
the national title. Those standings are derived from coaches' and
writers' polls, computer polls and teams' records and schedules. If
several teams go undefeated, victory in an extra game like this
could provide the percentage points to finish in the top two.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekend's other big games:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 1 Florida State plays host to Louisiana Tech and its great
quarterback, Tim Rattay. When Auburn bought its way out of a Sept.
2 opener with the Seminoles, Louisiana Tech became the replacement.
On offense, the Bulldogs are a better team, but the Seminoles might
have the nation's best defense.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 18 Notre Dame opens at home against Kansas in the Eddie
Robinson Classic. The Irish return 11 starters from a 9-3 team and
hope to get ready for next week's trip to No. 8 Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Year Two of the Mack Brown era begins without Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams, as the No. 17 Longhorns play host to
under-rated North Carolina State in the Black Coaches Association
Classic. A lot of North Carolina fans are pulling for the Wolfpack
to beat Brown, a former Tar Heels coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J., No. 12 Miami tries to prove
it is back as a power when it plays No. 9 Ohio State in the Kickoff
Classic at Giants Stadium. Ohio State suffered huge losses from its
11-1 team, and many people are predicting an upset.

 &HT;    With Holt gone, Wolfpack's Coleman can take wing
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Imagine catching 52 passes in a single season
and being described as the other guy on offense.
</P>
<P>
   That was Chris Coleman's predicament last season at North
Carolina State. At 6 feet and 205 pounds, he had the size, speed,
strength and sweet hands to be a star on any other team but his
own.
</P>
<P>
   But the star billing belonged to All-American Torry Holt, who
caught 88 passes for 1,604 yards, an average of 18.2 yards per
catch. Holt was the first wide receiver selected in April's NFL
draft, going to the St. Louis Rams with the sixth overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was almost an afterthought in his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   But what a talented afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of fed odd each other,'' Coleman said earlier this
week. ``When they double-covered him, I'd be open. We were cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman can expect plenty of attention tonight when his Wolfpack
takes on the University of Texas at Royal-Memorial Stadium. He'll
likely line up at flanker, split end or wide receiver, with UT
cornerbacks Joe Walker and Ahmad Brooks both getting the chance to
defend him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing about Coleman is he is as good of a receiver as
we're going to play this season,'' said UT defensive coordinator
Carl Reese. ``He's going to be their stat guy this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL scouts tend to agree. The early report on Coleman is he
likely will be a second- or third-round draft pick. However, the
National Scouting Report gave Coleman such a glowing recommendation
that it appears the wideout can only help his draft situation this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is compiled by NFL scouts, called Coleman ``a
great kid'' while using the adjectives ``explosive and versatile''
to describe his play. The scouts didn't mention a downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to use his physical strength,'' the report said,
which also referred to his ``outstanding work ethic'' and his
penchant for spending long hours in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was the best wide receiver prospect in North Carolina
when he starred for Shelby Crest High School, the state 4A champion
in 1995. He was recruited by every school in the Atlantic Coast
Conference except Florida State. UT Coach Mack Brown, who was
directing North Carolina at the time, went after Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``N.C. State made it look like that they needed me early,''
Coleman recalled. ``Mack Brown was like, it just seemed to me,
that, `If we get you great, if not, we're Carolina.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said this week: ``I think when we recruited Chris, at the
time, we had a lot of good receivers on the team. He's a really
good player for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, teams often double-covered Holt, the Wolfpack's deep
threat, leaving Coleman in single coverage. At times, defenses
would use a two-deep zone against Holt, leaving Coleman sometimes
isolated on a much slower linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia tried the double-coverage approach on Holt last season,
and Wolfpack quarterback Jamie Barnette and Coleman combined for
nine catches and 158 yards. Coleman had a 144-yard game against
Baylor and caught six passes for 98 yards in the Micron PC Bowl
against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hard guy to tackle,'' Reese said. ``You miss him, and
you're going to bounce off of him like a pingpong ball. He's going
to go on and make a play if we miss him.''

 &HT;    UGA V ready to bury the bone

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ He won't be Georgia's most successful bulldog, but
none has been more famous.
</P>
<P>
   Uga V, Sports Illustrated cover boy and movie star (``Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil'') will retire this season as
Georgia's mascot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not ready to go another season,'' athletics director
Vince Dooley said. ``Bad knees, I think.'' Actually, it's
arthritis, owner Sonny Seiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The solid-white English bulldog makes one of his last two public
appearances today at the football team's annual Picture Day. He
also will patrol the sideline during the opener against Utah State
Sept. 4, before passing the bone to Uga VI in a ceremony before the
South Carolina game Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Under Uga V, Georgia is 64-39-1, without an SEC title. His
father, Uga IV, was 77-27-4 and won two SEC championships.

PARDONS SHOW BUSH'S FORGIVENESS OF OTHERS' YOUTHFUL INDISCRETIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a young man at Yale University in the 1960s,
George W. Bush stole a Christmas wreath off the front door of a
business as a fraternity prank.
</P>
<P>
   He got caught, but the misdemeanor charge was dropped by the New
Haven, Conn., police.
</P>
<P>
   As governor almost 30 years later, Bush pardoned Janie Burrell
in 1996 for joining friends in stealing Christmas wreaths off doors
in her Jasper, Texas, neighborhood when she was 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he thought, `I was in the same situation.' It was really
harmless,'' speculated Burrell, whose 1990 escapade became a blot
on her record that caused her problems as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been asking for forgiveness of his youthful
indiscretions since becoming a Republican presidential candidate,
mostly in answer to questions about possible illegal drug use prior
to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But Burrell says the press should quit hounding him. ``It has
nothing to do with what he's doing now,'' she says. ``Everybody
messes up as a kid, but they are fine when they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 4 1/2 years as governor, Bush has granted pardons to
16 people _ nine of those who could fall into the category of being
``young and irresponsible,'' _ terms he uses to describe his own
youth. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Those pardons were granted to adults who committed minor
property crimes or marijuana possession offenses, mostly when they
were in their late teens or early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   A few more serious crimes also have been pardoned. Two pardons
went to men proven innocent of rape. Five other pardons went to
adults who committed a variety of offenses, ranging from hot
check-writing to transporting undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Supreme Court Justice Al Gonzales was Bush's general
counsel when most of the pardons were granted. Gonzales says Bush
made his decisions from about 300 applications based at least
partly on the age of the offenders and what they had done with
their lives since the original arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question about it that someone who had committed
an offense many, many years ago when they were young had a better
shot of getting a pardon, but no guarantee,'' Gonzales says.
</P>
<P>
   In his own case involving theft during his college years _ an
episode that came to light last year _ Bush joked that he ``went
out and tried to liberate a Christmas wreath.'' The charges against
him were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Along with pardoning the woman who committed a similar crime,
Bush has granted three pardons to people who had drug offenses as
youths. The recipient of one of those turned into an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Raney, who came from a prominent family in the small town
of Waxahachie, south of Dallas, was convicted at age 28 of a
misdemeanor in 1988 for growing a marijuana plant in his back yard.
He paid a $500 fine and spent a day in jail.
</P>
<P>
   After assurances that Raney had turned his life around, Bush
granted him a pardon in 1995 so that he could become a local deputy
constable. Less than four months later, Raney was arrested after he
admitted stealing cocaine from a suspect during a roadside bust.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's other two pardons for drug offenses have not caused him
any problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he pardoned Cynthia Lynn Roeper Retherford of Broken
Arrow, Okla. Twenty years earlier, Retherford, then 19, was
convicted in Brazoria County for possession of what was then a
felony amount of marijuana but now is a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Retherford, a mother and church fellowship leader, told Bush she
needed to cleanse her criminal record so she could become a
second-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush in 1995 granted a pardon to Donald Dodson of
Austin who was convicted at age 18 of felony possession of an
amount of marijuana that would have been a misdemeanor one year
later after the Legislature changed state law.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson said he was trying to impress two girls when he lit a
marijuana cigarette from a half-ounce bag on the table at his
brother's apartment in 1972. About that time, police walked in
looking for his brother's roommate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught literally red-handed,'' Dodson said. ``They let
the girls go because they started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lived in Texas from 1968 to 1974 when people like Dodson
found out the state had some of the nation's toughest and most
unforgiving drug laws. These are some of the years Bush will not
discuss in terms of possible drug use on his part.
</P>
<P>
   A life-long Democrat and a one-time union organizer, Dodson
applied for a pardon from Democrat Ann Richards when she was
governor. He needed a clean record so he could be the executor of
his mother's estate. But his case languished until the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush pardoned me, and it had nothing to do with my
political affiliations or giving money to anyone or anything. They
just did the right thing,'' said Dodson, now an employee for the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for Bush's administration and the people
who work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the questions about Bush's possible drug use, Dodson
says, ``If he can say he hasn't done anything in 25 years, people
should just leave him alone.''

STOCK MARKET PLAYING BIGGER ROLE IN INFLATION POLICY, GREENSPAN
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. _ Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said Friday that the booming stock market now plays an
increasingly significant role in the Fed's debate over inflation
but stopped short of calling the market overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of
goods and services'' when making decisions about interest rates,
Greenspan said. In effect, he was labeling what he called the
``extraordinary increase in stock prices over the past five years''
as one of the major economic forces capable of pushing up the
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, a run-up in stock prices has been viewed as
reflecting a strong economy and profitable companies. The economy
drove the market. Now the opposite is more and more the case,
Greenspan suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, in response to Greenspan's remarks, which were
delivered at an annual conference on monetary policy issues
organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, fell
moderately Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 108.28
points, or nearly 1 percent, closing at 11,090.17 in light trading.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, mildly expressed in the day's trading, appeared to
be that if the Fed saw an inflationary force in stock prices, it
might raise rates again to slow the economy. Higher rates normally
bring down stock prices because they raise the payoff from
alternative investments, like Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular rise on Wall Street in recent years has added
considerably to the wealth of millions of families and also to the
value of the nation's publicly owned companies. Families and
companies have spent _ or borrowed against _ part of the windfall
from that gain as well as the increased value of real estate to buy
additional goods and services. Their increased spending has helped
make the economy boom.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's remarks suggest that stock prices have become a more
important target in the Fed's manipulation of interest rates.
Controlling inflation remains the goal of interest rate changes,
and that point was made repeatedly at the conference Friday. But
Greenspan signaled that rising stock prices, and to a lesser extent
rising real estate prices, must take their places alongside such
traditional inflationary forces as tight labor markets, rising
wages, shortages of goods and services that develop when demand
outstrips supply, and the changing value of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong economic growth since 1996, inflation has
remained unusually mild. The Fed, as a result, has been reluctant
to push up interest rates very much _ a reluctance that helps to
feed the stock market. If a speculative bubble develops and the
market finally crashes or declines sharply, the Fed's position is
that it will step in then to minimize the damage by lowering rates
and making money easier to borrow. Meanwhile the Fed will view the
market as another potentially inflationary force, Greenspan said,
but will not attempt to influence the market itself.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer period, Greenspan elaborated on his
speech. He said the Fed would intervenue in financial markets only
to correct sharp rises or falls in stock prices that might send
shock waves through the rest of the economy. The real issue, he
said, is a credit squeeze _ a sudden reluctance of lenders to lend
_ whether markets are rising or falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't respond to gradually rising or falling asset
prices,'' he said. ``We do respond to seizing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists attending the conference here saw in Greenspan's
speech a sort of addendum to the statement that the Fed issued on
Tuesday, when it announced a quarter-point increase in the federal
funds rate at which banks lend one another money overnight, raising
it to 5.25 percent, and pulling up other short-term interest rates
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate increase plus a similar one in June, the
statement said, ``should markedly diminish the risk of rising
inflation going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets initially saw in that statement a possible
signal that the Fed was probably finished raising interest rates
for a while. But for Alan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon
Institute, Greenspan's explicit addition Friday of the stock market
as an inflationary force might mean more rate increases in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan is saying, `I am not certain I am all done or not
all done, but you are making a mistake if you think I am all
done,''' Meltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Having identified the booming stock market as a potentially
inflationary force, Greenspan said that a lot more research needs
to be done to determine why people are willing to make such risky
investments and then, turning on a dime, flee them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to
the way our economy and our financial markets work now and in the
future,'' he said, ``it has significant implications for risk
management and, by implication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan was careful to avoid going as far as he had in the
past in worrying about the stock market. In December 1996, he
questioned the ``irrational exuberance'' of investors on Wall
Street, causing a brief but sharp sell-off in markets around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he said that while stock prices seem unusually high,
he cannot conclude that the market is overvalued. Stock prices, for
example, should reflect corporate profits, and Greenspan noted
instances in which profits have been both overstated and
understated in recent months, with the bottom line being that
profits may be understated, thus helping to justify a rising
market.
</P>
<P>
   But he added an important caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not seem likely, however, even should all of the
appropriate accounting adjustments to earnings be made,'' he said,
``that such adjustments can be the central explanation of the
extraordinary increase in stock prices in the past five years.''

<P>
   MIDWAY ATOLL _ Souvenir T-shirts on this remote atoll smack in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean carry the message ``Little Island,
BIG History,'' in salute to the famous battle fought here that
became a World War II turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Another chapter was added Friday morning, when the U.S. Coast
Guard Cutter Kukui towed into harbor a 140-foot fishing boat
carrying 120 illegal immigrants from the People's Republic of
China, destination unknown. The passengers, most appearing to be in
their late teens or early 20s, were evacuated down the cargo dock,
flanked by armed Coast Guard and Immigration and Naturalization
Service security, to a nearby gymnasium where they will be
processed and housed. Sixteen handcuffed males, the ship's crew, or
``enforcers,'' as a Coast Guard spokesman termed them, followed in
single file.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, circumstances aboard the boat, which had been
adrift 330 miles north of Midway in the Pacific for a month after
its propellor shaft came off, mirrored those of the Chinese ship
captured in Savannah on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were pretty poor,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Phil
Eno, who led a team that rescued the disabled vessel Wednesday.
``People were jammed into the cargo hold, sleeping next to
overflowing buckets of urine. There was vomit next to what little
food that remained. Several were malnourished and dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   All documentation for the ship and its passengers was believed
to have been destroyed by the time the crew placed a mayday call.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the events, Mark Thompson, president of the privately
held, Cartersville-based Midway Phoenix Corp., which took over
operation of Midway in July 1997, said it underlined the necessity
of keeping the atoll open after the historic naval base was
decommissioned. The base closing in October 1993 ``didn't make any
sense to me. The U.S. had a need for this island. They're not
making any more property and this is an important strategic U.S.
possession out here in the Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is also president of Cartersville-based Phoenix Air
Corp., a longtime Defense Department contractor that had used
Midway for years for electronic air warfare training missions and
as a refueling stop. The new corporation successfully bid to
operate the atoll in a unique public-private partership when
possession was passed from the Navy to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, which could not keep the island open.
</P>
<P>
   Midway Phoenix has turned the atoll's only occupied land, Sand
Island, a National Wildlife Refuge, into a low-key ecotourism
attraction popular with birders, sportsfishermen, volunteer
naturalists and retired military making return visits. Numerous
historic military structures remain, including the base galley,
which will supply meals to the unexpected detainees from the
People's Republic. Island manager Mike Gautreaux says they will be
fed staples such as rice, noodles and vegetables during their stay,
which officials believe could take to two months, pending delicate
negotiations with the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The 99 men and 21 women will be held in a 1950s gymnasium that
has separate restroom facilities.

BUSH FUND-RAISING MACHINE PLOWS AHEAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., S.C., N.C.)   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the early front-runner
for the Republican presidential nomination, Friday wrapped up a
three-state, three-day campaign swing through the Southeast that
yielded what aides estimated was another $1.1 million in campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It was proof that the fundraising juggernaut of the Bush
campaign rolled on, undiminished by any sense among his supporters
that Bush was so firmly in the lead, in terms of both national
surveys and his first-place finish in the recent Iowa straw poll,
that they could start breathing easy and closing their check books.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were looking ahead to the general election in
November 2000, and they were going for broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need coattails in North Carolina, so we need him to have a
landslide in North Carolina,'' said Randy D. Doub, a lawyer who was
one of many hosts of a $1,000-a-head fundraiser at the Sheraton
Imperial Hotel in Durham, N.C., on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Doub was referring to congressional and state races in 2000 that
he wanted Republicans to win, and he seemed to be assuming already
that Bush would end up in the White House, his path to glory
smoothed by the treasury he was amassing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was expected to raise $500,000 Saturday from a
$1,000-a-plate luncheon here and a dinner in Plantation, Ga., with
the same price tag. The federally-mandated limit for individual
donations to a campaign is $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $37 million that Bush had reported raising by June
30 was by far the most that any presidential candidate had
accumulated at such an early point in the race. It also raised the
question of how quickly Bush could continue to rake in the cash,
given the number of contributors he had already tapped.
</P>
<P>
   This week's tally, from a series of five $1,000-a-head events,
provided the answer: There was plenty more where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in late August, and we've been out on the road for
2-1/2 months, and that spirit is still there,'' said Don Evans, the
Texas oilman who is heading Bush's national fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and other officials with the Bush campaign said they would
not specify how much additional money they had raised before the
end of the current quarter on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But in speeches this week, Bush said that more than 105,000
people had now donated to his campaign; at the end of the last
quarter, the figure was about 74,000. If the new donors gave at a
similar rate, Bush has easily added more than $10 million to his
treasury and may be over the $50 million mark at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are keeping up a remarkable pace,'' said Ari Fleisher, a
spokesman for Elizabeth Dole, who places a distant second behind
Bush in most national polls of Republicans. In a four-day swing
last week through Western states including California, Mrs. Dole
raised about $165,000, Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly Bush's best week. In California at the end of
June, Bush raised an estimated $5 million. But the terrain he
traversed this time around _ South Carolina, North Carolina and
Georgia _ is not as famously fertile with donors, and the Bush
campaign had held fundraising events here already.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.1 million that aides said he had raised did not subtract
what it cost Bush and his aides to put on and attend the events,
but the Bush campaign is renowned for its fiscal prudence in such
endeavors. The fund raiser in Durham, N.C., for example, consisted
of serve-yourself appetizers _ arrayed buffet-style under an ice
sculpture of an elephant _ rather than a sit-down dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Graham, a co-chairman of the event, said that he has been
amazed at the ease of raising money for Bush. To illustrate the
point, he opened his suit jacket to reveal an inner pocket bulging
with $1,000 checks.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a lawyer from Raleigh, N.C., said the humming economy
was one explanation for the phenomenon, but that another, perhaps
more potent reason was the hunger of people who did not like
President Clinton to banish all traces of him, including Vice
President Al Gore, the early front runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get someone else in there, and this guy looks
like a winner,'' Graham said, referring to Bush. Bush's swing
through the Southeast included just as many events that raised no
money at all, and the selection of places he stopped _ including a
school in Florence, S.C., and a mostly privately funded social
services center in Marietta, Ga. _ emphasized two of the principal
themes of his campaign: improving education and encouraging
religious organizations and charities to do more to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush presented those efforts as the bulwarks of compassionate
conservatism, a phrase that has become a lynchpin of his identity
and a mantra in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for all the contributions and support that have come his way,
Bush said he was grateful but not complacent. ``I also know that
I've got a lot of work to do,'' he said.

GREENE, MILLER WIN 200-METER CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Maurice Greene drove all the way from Kansas
City to Los Angeles to train with John Smith on campus at UCLA;
Inger Miller only had to drive a few miles west. But they both had
to say a form of goodbye to someone special to get to the same
place, and Friday the two American sprinters got the same reward: a
gold medal in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's made him the first man in the 16-year history of the
World Track and Field Championships to sweep the 100 and 200.
Miller's made her the first member of her very speedy family to win
a major sprint title: her father Lennox won a silver medal and
bronze in the 100 in the Olympics for Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   They have trained together with Smith's group of track stars,
HSI, since the beginning of this year, when Lennox stopped coaching
his daughter. And after Miller had won her race in a very fine time
of 21.77 seconds and Greene had won his in a fine enough time of
19.9, the two teammates embraced each other on the Mondo track in
Seville and shared a few tears and encouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   Both had won against diminished fields. Marion Jones, the
American who has dominated this event for the last three years, was
unable to defend her title after injuring her back in the 200
semifinals here. Neither was the defending men's champion Ato
Boldon, who is out with a leg injury, and the 1993 men's champion,
Frankie Fredericks, withdrew several hours before the final with an
nerve injury in his left hamstring. But Miller and Greene still had
to seize their golden opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can say I'm a little more proud of Inger than
myself,'' Greene said. ``Because I've seen the changes she's had to
make, leaving her father. I know how hard that is, because I had to
do it: leaving a close coach of mine to come to California.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller came late to sprinting; she did not begin competing until
her sophomore year at Pasadena Muir High School after transferring
there from a school that had no track and field team. ``My dad
never pushed me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But once she found out how fast she was, it was only natural
that her father coach her, which he did successfully until last
year, when father and daughter, who trained alone, made a mutual
decision that Smith could take her to a higher level, just as he
had done with Greene and Boldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the difference has been atmosphere and intensity,''
said Miller, who remains close to her father: he was in Seville for
Friday night's final. ``The thing is John's philosophy and my dad's
is relatively the same. John has a few modern twists to add to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has known Lennox since he was running at USC and Smith at
UCLA. ``It was like somebody handed some very fine-tuned tools over
to me, and it was up to me to not mess it up,'' said Smith, who
among other things, has got her to bring her head forward as she
sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Greene handed himself over to Smith in 1996 after failing to
qualify for the American Olympic team, bidding farewell to his
high-school coach and mentor Al Hobson. Since then, Greene has
established himself as the world's dominant sprinter, winning two
consecutive world titles in the 100 and breaking the world record
in the event in June with a time of 9.79 seconds. He missed that
record by just 0.01 of a second last Sunday during his spectacular
victory here. Friday's performance was not quite as eye-catching _
four other men have run faster 200s this year _ but then Greene was
no longer the same fresh-legged man who arrived in Seville 10 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To try something I've never done before and take my body to
places its never been before, I just feel great,'' Greene said.
``This is what I worked all year for, and it feels wonderful. Those
were tears of joy out there, and I'm still crying inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Obikwelu of Nigeria had caught Greene's and many others'
attention by unexpectedly winning his 200 semifinal in the world's
fastest time this year: 19.84 seconds, which was 0.08 seconds
better than Greene's personal best. With that gap warily in mind,
Greene decided that he would push Obikwelu hard in the opening
meters in an attempt to throw him off his rhythm and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A false start from Obikwelu only helped Greene's cause, and when
the race began for real, the American in Lane 3 made up the
difference in the stagger with the Nigerian in Lane 4 in a hurry.
The Nigerian would have to settle for the bronze medal behind
Claudinei Quirino Da Silva of Brazil in a disappointing time of
20.11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put pressure on somebody like that, either he runs 19.6 or
he's going to fold,'' said Boldon, who is here as a television
commentator _ a position to which he is well suited _ and who
talked tactics with his friend Greene the night before the race.
</P>
<P>
   With Obikwelu folding, all Greene had to do was control his
speed down the stretch, although Da Silva was closing the gap in a
hurry when Greene crossed the finish line. ``He still ran 19.9 dead
tired,'' Boldon said of Greene admiringly. ``Two years ago, his
personal best was 20.5. I think this is a testament to the kind of
shape he's in.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller set three consecutive personal bests in the 100, taking
the silver behind Jones, And Friday she set another one in the 200
by a whopping (in track terms that is) 0.33 seconds. More
reassuringly it was the best time of the year: Jones' best in 1999
is 21.81. And what made the time all the more impressive was that
Miller ran alone for most of the last 100 meters: Beverly McDonald
of Jamaica took the silver in 22.22 and her countrywoman Merlene
Frazer the bronze in 22.26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I wanted her in the race,'' Miller said of Jones,
who she has been competing against since high school and with whom
she spoke briefly in the hotel before the final. ``I feel bad for
her, because I know how it feels. But we've got plenty of time to
race, and after she rehabs, I'm sure she'll come back strong, and
we'll have a good rivalry going next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Miller will keep working out in an environment that
has elements of sibling rivalry with Greene and Boldon and the rest
of John Smith's high-spirited charges who specialize in running
fast and, in Boldon's words, ``talking trash.'' And as Smith
watched Greene and Miller embrace in Seville, he held up that image
of camaraderie as an explanation for her remarkable improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where that half second came from,'' he said. ``It's
like a domino effect. Champions beget champions.''

Monkey,'' a script he and his partner have just begun.
</P>
<P>
   But, back to the stage. James (d'Arcy is his middle name, a
French-Irish family name) is at the Alliance Theatre this month and
next for the musical ``Chess,'' the company's 31st season opener.
The seldom-seen show has a checkered history _ and a terrific score
by no less than Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus of Abba. Yes,
Abba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music was the first thing that I became attached to,''
James, 31, says enthusiastically, his blue-green eyes dancing with
excitement. ``The music is much more than I expected it to be in
its intricacies. It's very operatic. You realize, `Oh, these guys
really know what they're doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Chess' may be one of the most complex musicals ever
written,'' says director David Bell, who chose the piece for
Atlanta. ``What I love about it is that it examines on so many
levels the way games affect our lives. It is modern and sexy but
also epic.''
</P>
<P>
   Metro audiences will see Bell's version of the show, one he's
done to acclaim in Chicago, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. It combines
his vision with bits and pieces of the London original, the
short-lived Broadway version and an Australian production.
</P>
<P>
   James was the first casting call Bell made. He plays Anatoly,
the supremely talented, affable Russian chess champion who finds
himself in a romantic triangle. New York actors Kim Huber (``Beauty
and the Beast'') and Sean McDermott (``Miss Saigon,''
``Falsettos'') play the other angles. Atlanta favorites Rebekah
Baty and LaParee Young are part of the 22-member cast.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly ``pours most of himself into the game,'' James says of
the character he's grown to love and respect. ``It is the place
where he finds refuge.'' Eventually he ``realizes that his soul
hasn't been nurtured the way that his brain has been all his
life.'' That's where Florence (Huber) comes in.
</P>
<P>
   James found his own love not long ago. He celebrated his first
wedding anniversary with New York actress Jennifer Prescott last
week. They met doing ``Carousel'' at Lincoln Center in 1994. James
also has done the off-Broadway musical ``Floyd Collins,'' and
``Blood Brothers'' and ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway. A ``Les
Miz'' tour brought him to Atlanta in 1993, but he remembers little
of the city from that trip. This time, he has settled in just fine.
He's got enough food in his fridge to impress guests, and CDs by
pop artists Jason Faulkner (formerly of Jellyfish) and Michael Penn
cued up on the CD player by his bed. They're a natural for the
Michigan kid who grew up singing to the radio and still favors pop
above most other musical genres.
</P>
<P>
   Bell calls James one of the best actors he's ever worked with.
</P>
<P>
   It's an opinion others share.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Yeston, who wrote the Tony-winning Broadway musical
``Titanic,'' in which James played stoker Fred Barrett, calls him
``a star of the future.'' He provides ``that rare combination of
brilliant musicality, keen intelligence and a great range of
subtlety in his acting,'' Yeston told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard in musical theater to find people who truly can
act and truly can sing, but Brian is that rare commodity,'' says
composer Jeanine Tesori (off-Broadway's ``Violet'').
</P>
<P>
   Such praise would make the Northwestern grad blush. Even after
his Broadway success, numerous workshops and a Kennedy Center
Honors appearance for Charlton Heston in 1997, James sees his
career as a process. He hasn't even had a paying theater job since
``Titanic.'' Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Acting is ``like planting seeds,'' he says. ```Titanic' was an
opportunity to get a real rich, ripe seed. You just stick it in the
ground and put it behind you and hope that it will continue to grow
along with your talent.''

 &HT;    TV host's case may raise MS awareness
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Julia Coleman was shocked to hear this week that her 3
p.m. daily TV date, Montel Williams, has multiple sclerosis because
he looks as ``fantastic'' as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But she, of all people, should know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first was diagnosed with MS 10 years ago, I spent most
of my time explaining the disease because my friends would all say,
`But you look so well, you look so good,''' said Coleman, 53. She
lives in Lithonia, Ga. with her daughter and uses a motorized
scooter to vacuum, cook, do the laundry and get around inside and
out. ``But that's the thing with MS, everyone has the disease
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a popular daytime television talk-show host, disclosed
this week he may have had the disease the past 10 to 20 years
before it was properly diagnosed this year. The 43-year-old said he
just came off a painful bout of the relapsing disease, but he's now
taping next season's shows.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' form of MS, ``relapsing-remitting,'' is the most
common form at initial diagnosis. Within 10 years, half receiving
such a diagnosis will steadily worsen to the
``secondary-progressive'' stage, such as leg paralysis and
cognitive dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Richard Pryor and 1960s beach-movies actress Annette
Funicello have advanced cases. Major league relief pitcher Stan
Belinda of the Cincinnati Reds learned he had relapsing-remitting
MS last fall. With drug therapy, he's back on the team roster.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple sclerosis is caused when the body's immune system
attacks the central nervous system. It strips away the insulation
of nerve fibers, called myelin, forming lesions, and interferes
with movement transmissions from brain to body. Weakness and
numbness, stiffness and imbalance can occur, but the majority of MS
patients do not become severely disabled, say experts of the
Shepherd Center, an Atlanta hospital specializing in spine injuries
and neurological diseases.
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 Americans suffer from multiple sclerosis,
including 7,000 in Georgia. While doctors can offer a normal life
span for MS sufferers, they can't predict how badly the disease
will progress _ or even when or if it will _ for individual
patients. Some people die of complications from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, multiple sclerosis strikes twice as many
women as men, and whites are twice as affected as other races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montel had two strikes against him in getting diagnosed _ he's
a man and an African-American,'' said Cynthia Bishop, Shepherd
Center's MS nurse and team leader. ``I think doctors have a lower
threshold of suspicion when it comes to African-Americans,
especially for black males, because it's just not that common.''
</P>
<P>
   Because MS symptoms are so vague _ fatigue, blurred vision,
slurred speech and muscle spasms _ many sufferers can go years
before a diagnosis, Bishop said. An MRI scan picks up white spots
in brain tissue that signal multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have zillions and zillions of patients who've been
misdiagnosed,'' Bishop said. Among the wrong diagnoses: chronic
fatigue syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar disc disease and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Midlevel to upper-income, well-educated people living in urban
regions also seem to be disproportionately affected. Among Shepherd
Center's 1,200 multiple sclerosis outpatients are numerous lawyers,
physicians, computer programmers, teachers and nurses, said Ismari
Clesson, who manages the center's MS clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Clark found out he had multiple sclerosis in 1985, when he
was 42 years old and director of marketing at a major corporation.
But extreme fatigue and spasticity in his legs forced him in 1991
to take long-term disability.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate for the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Clark drives a
van with hand controls from his east Marietta home to get to
meetings and support groups, where he's a peer counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot walk. I'm either in a wheelchair or a motorized
scooter. But everything else is fine _ my speech, my eyes. Of
course, I have typical bladder problems like other MS patients,''
Clark said. ``But it's really just the nerves going to my legs have
been eaten away. I can stand up beautifully, but as far as taking
the necessary steps to walk, I just can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many MS patients have found relief through three injectable
drugs approved this decade, known as the ABCs _ Avonex, Betaseron
and Copaxone. They slow progression of the disease. But they are
extremely costly _ $12,000 annually _ and some insurance companies
deny coverage, Clesson said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Virginia Close-Harris of Bainbridge, rely on a
healthful diet, not medication, to help her through her 10-hour
workdays. The 38-year-old is the founder and executive director of
Bainbridge Advocacy Individual Network, which serve 400 clients in
eight counties.
</P>
<P>
   The former athlete found out on her high school graduation day
she had multiple sclerosis. She's gone on to start a nonprofit
independent living resource group for disabled people, and she's
raised her nephew single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, you just didn't hear about people with MS.
And if they had it, they didn't talk about it,'' said Close-Harris,
who uses a wheelchair to get around. ``There was no one there to
tell me about the bed sores, the bladder infections, all those
things to expect. Montel is a courageous guy for going public. I
think it's really going to help awareness.''

 &HT;    Seed savers glean heirlooms from gardeners
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ University of Georgia anthropologist Bob Rhoades
knows firsthand why heirloom seeds are valuable. During the drought
of 1998, he planted a few blue goose beans, an old-timey variety,
next to the more familiar plants from a local store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't touch them, didn't water them or anything,'' Rhoades
says. ``When I came home after being gone for most of the summer,
all my Kmart plants were ruined, but the blue goose was green and
full. I was shocked at the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardy blue goose may be his most recent experience with
heirlooms, but Rhoades has been an advocate of seed saving for
years. Since 1993, he and colleague Virginia Nazarea and their
students have been operating the Southern Seed Legacy project at
UGA, with a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   From gardeners across the South, they collect seeds of
old-fashioned plants, reliable varieties no longer widely available
in stores, grown by loyal gardeners season after season. They
locate these ``seed savers'' through ads in market bulletins, send
out surveys and newsletters and even rely on word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoades and Nazarea worked with such programs in Peru and the
Philippines before establishing one at Georgia. This summer,
Nazarea and some UGA students set up a seed exchange network in
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeds, the UGA researchers have also saved _ in
the South and in South America _ the gardeners' memories of the
plants and even their cultivation histories, such as the conditions
under which they have done well. Were the potatoes hilled? Did the
melons prefer a little shade? Acquiring that kind of firsthand
knowledge, known as ``memory banking'' _ a practice that Nazarea
pioneered and champions _ is crucial to a successful heirloom plant
program, Rhoades says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seeds now sold commercially for large-scale farming
are hybrids and can be used for only one growing season. Heirloom
plants generate seeds that can be replanted year after year without
losing their characteristics, providing the same taste and texture
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For many gardeners, that familiarity and link to the past is
reason enough to save their seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in Florida grows a little sugar cane because his family
used to make syrup from it,'' says Eleanor Tison, an anthropology
graduate student who has worked with Rhoades and Nazarea. ``For a
lot of people, the fact that they were still growing a particular
crop tied them into their past and their community.''
</P>
<P>
   In studying cowpeas _ the ubiquitous black-eyed pea is one
variety _ Tison found that seed savers in different parts of
Georgia call the same pea by different names.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberty County, a gardener grew ``red peas'' specifically for
cooking in hoppin' John. With their copper color, the peas look
like old pennies, which may explain why they came to symbolize
coins in traditional Southern New Year's Day feasts. A little
farther south, another gardener called the same red peas
``Seminoles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Keheley of Cobb County, a lifelong seed saver who has
donated his collection to UGA, until recently planted a yearly
garden filled with fruits and vegetables he had eaten since
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Keheley told Tison how, when he was young, he and his brothers
would scatter melon seeds among the cotton they planted for their
father. As the cotton grew, it shielded both watermelons and ``plum
grannies,'' baseball-size melons whose intoxicating fragrance made
them ideal offerings for the boys' sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer the heirlooms have done extremely well,'' says
Rhoades, who grows some of the seeds on his Oglethorpe County farm.
``It seems like these heir-
</P>
<P>
   looms were adapted to non-irri-
</P>
<P>
   gating conditions. The point is their toughness, quality and
taste. They're not bred to grow real big and fast.''
</P>
<P>

per year, entitles you to the ``Southern Seed Legacy Resource
Directory,'' a guide to Southern seed savers and the seeds being
saved and offered. Included is information about farmers' markets,

 &HT;    Athens' music scene again talk of indie fans
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ So, where's the ``new Athens?''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase has long been code, at least among indie-rock fans,
for whatever city boasts the latest, greatest local new music
scene. Athens earned the distinction in the early 1980s, when the
emergence of the B-52's, Pylon, R.E.M. and other acts put the
college town on the map in a way University of Georgia football
never had.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Athens has reclaimed the title. R.E.M. seemed to
acknowledge as much when it invited the groups Olivia Tremor
Control and Elf Power to open a show during its three-night stand
at Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better than ever,'' says David Barbe, 35, who led
the band Mercyland a decade ago and now produces records at Chase
Park Transduction, the 2-year-old studio he co-owns that has become
a popular stop for many of the next-wave Athens acts. ``Granted,
there was some excitement in the early '80s. It was a new thing,
and it will never happen again. But the quality and quantity of
bands coming out of here is at an all-time high. The really good
stuff, what's really good about it is it's all unique. And it's
unique in a really melodic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bands to listen for include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Neutral Milk Hotel _ Perhaps the most lauded of the new acts.
Neutral Milk Hotel features singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum and
creates ambitious, art-wise pop that recalls 1970s progressive rock
without the cringe factor. Its second CD, ``In the Aeroplane, Over
the Sea'' (Merge), cracked the coveted Top 10 in the Village
Voice's poll of more than 500 rock critics nationwide for best
albums of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Olivia Tremor Control _ A great live band, the five-piecer
bills its albums as soundtracks to unrealized film projects. The
sound is playful psychedelic rock, punchy and tuneful, reflecting
influences as diverse as classic Beach Boys, Sun Ra and the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Star Room Boys _ A longtime Athens act that has recently
released a first-rate country album, ``Why Do Lonely Men &AMP; Women
Want to Break Each Other's Hearts'' (Strictly Bush). The quintet
belongs to an old guard that has never really gotten its due. These
honky-tonkers, influenced by the Bakersfield sound, are emotionally
connected classicists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Macha _ The quartet features brothers Joshua and Mischo McKay
and uses an unusual variety of instruments (hammered dulcimer, Moog
synthesizer, vibraphone, Indonesian percussion, a toy zither) to
create vibrantly textured rock with a dreamlike undertow. Travels
through Southeast Asia have profoundly affected Macha's direction.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jucifer _ The most unabashedly ``rock 'n' roll'' act on the
new Athens scene, the boyfriend/girlfriend duo of Ed Livengood
(drums) and Amber Valentine (guitar) has the most potential to bust
loose in these rage-filled days of Limp Bizkit. Livengood slams his
kit like a maniac while Valentine cranks out hot-rodded Black
Sabbath riffs on an instrument that appears to be covered in shag
carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have more time to get weird,'' reasons Joshua McKay,
33. ``I think it's the monotony of the same four square blocks of
stomping ground. You want to add some color.''
</P>
<P>
   As McKay, who grew up in Florida and Texas, notes, the city's
zealously guarded social ecosystem has made it easy to be in a
touring band. The success of R.E.M., and that group's activism on
issues such as historic preservation, has helped to set a local
standard. And the fact that Athens has embraced rock 'n' roll as
part of its identity for almost 20 years is probably the main force
behind the renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills, part of the old guard, says he keeps
up with the city's music scene but doesn't feel R.E.M. has much in
common with it. ``Some of it's great, some of it isn't,'' he
contends. ``Jucifer's got a cool angle on things. But it doesn't
remind me of R.E.M. People are too self-aware now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true. Where R.E.M. had the luxury of originating in a
vacuum, bands such as Macha and Olivia Tremor Control are emerging
in a pop world where alternative rock is old news and the Internet
connects every stray dot. That makes it difficult to be blissfully
obscure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most fertile I've seen it,'' says Jason Walden, 27,
head of artist development for Atlanta-based Capricorn Records. The
former Athens resident is working on a compilation showcasing the
``two handfuls'' of bands he believes are defining the city's
scene. Also coming up are full-length releases by Hayride, the
Glands and Jucifer, whose 1998 CD, ``Calling All Cars on the Sunset
Strip,'' released on its own Crack Rock label, will be reissued.
Jucifer's aggressive, wall-shaking rock couldn't be further removed
from the sonic experimentation of Elf Power. Except that Elf Power
bassist Brian Helium shares a house with Jucifer's Valentine and
Livengood. It's a sign of how interconnected the scene is, where
the waitress that serves your black bean burger tonight will be
spotlighted in Spin magazine tomorrow. It's a sign, also, that the
bands have shaken free of the R.E.M.-wannabe syndrome that once
reigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the R.E.M. baggage finally went by the wayside,'' says
Helium, who will join his band mates and various guest musicians
onstage at Chastain tonight. ``You had people coming in looking for
the pot of gold. People thought they could jump on the R.E.M.
bandwagon. Those morons finally left town.''
</P>
<P>
   In a basement bar, the members of Elf Power polish off quick,
last-call beers after practice at an adjacent art space dubbed the
Poverty Rock Cafe. They're excited to be playing for a packed
amphitheater of 7,000: The band's usual audience is a fraction of
that. It's an occasion that prompts vocalist Andrew Rieger to
laugh, because of how it emphasizes the scale of each band's sphere
of influence.
</P>
<P>
   He tells of an encounter the band once had in Orlando. Its van
had broken down, and Elf Power was suddenly dependent on the
kindness of strangers. Who happens upon them? ``We met,'' Rieger
says, ``this woman with a Mike Mills tattoo on her breast!''

 &HT;    As band continues to confound critics and commercialism, it
succeeds by making music that's true to its heart and mind
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ R.E.M. could have taken the easy route. Boxed set.
Bloated, $75-a-ticket greatest hits tour. A line of ties at
Nordstrom. But nearly two decades after emerging from Athens, Ga.
as the Next Great Thing, and two years into one whopper of a
midlife crisis, the band has apparently made a choice that no
marketing consultant would recommend. Its members want to keep
making music that interests them. Vital music. Music from the heart
and head. To heck with the commercial and critical consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beneath a Crayola blue sky on a secluded patio at L.A.'s
Greek Theatre after the band's first American show in four years,
multi-instrumentalist Mike Mills recites the point once again, like
a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make music to sell. I make music to scratch an itch,''
he says, his blond hair blowing around his sunburned face like
something out of a travel ad. ``If the records sell, great. If they
don't, (forget) 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in one of the theater's cluttered dressing rooms, lead
singer Michael Stipe wears this attitude on his sleeve. His
tie-dyed T-shirt screams sarcastic cockiness, with the words ``Time
Is Money'' spray-painted like pink graffiti on his right shoulder.
He's sick of answering questions about the future of his band now
that drummer Bill Berry has retired and R.E.M. is a trio _ ``Oh,
come on, we've talked about this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe doesn't give a rat's tail that the latest album ``Up'' has
had sluggish sales since its release last October. ``So what,'' he
says, rolling a cigarette. ``Focusing on how much things cost, or
how many units got pushed, shouldn't be a priority. I'm interested
in pushing forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, Stipe and band mate Peter Buck have been tossing off
quotes like these for years, but the young Turk image has been
increasingly hard for aging fans to swallow _ particularly those
who find themselves confronting the inevitable compromises of
middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Risk is not a welcome word at record companies, where executives
find comfort in Eagles' reunions and the mallish mindlessness of
the Backstreet Boys. Whether you think it's a smart move or not,
even sweet pop songbird Mariah Carey has sensed changing musical
tastes and made a rap record.
</P>
<P>
   But as R.E.M. arrives in Atlanta for the first of three sold-out
shows, it's clear this tenacious commitment to artistic vision is
more than posturing. Quite the contrary. When the world was
watching to see how the band would work as a threesome, R.E.M. made
one of the most introspective and experimental albums of its career
(``Up'').
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some serious problems making the record,'' Mills says.
``We were still in our period of doubt and questioning how to do
things. We had to discover and redefine R.E.M. But I think we found
it. I'm incredibly happy and enjoying this.''
</P>
<P>
   The band tiptoed into promoting the CD like a teenager being
coaxed to audition for the school play, first flatly refusing to
tour, then enthusiastically landing at center stage, from a tour of
Europe to an appearance on TV's ``Sesame Street.'' The first two
American shows in California were buoyant, 2 1/2-hour celebrations
of the band's new material and rich body of work, with sets that
boldly pushed the envelope with the band's latest psychedelic
sounds (``Lotus'') alongside radio hits (``Man on the Moon'').
</P>
<P>
   ``A band like this should grow and do new things,'' says Sean
Demery, music director at 99X, Atlanta's new-rock station. ``Thank
God they experiment, 'cause you only get one shot at this life on
Earth, so why not make it amazing and interesting? R.E.M. is not a
cookie-cutter band. They put out consistent, quality work that's
often totally unpredictable. I think that's why when we ask our 99X
listeners who their favorite bands are, R.E.M. is always at the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Demery concedes that ``Up'' didn't connect with a lot of
listeners and that sales were ``soft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't have as much to do with R.E.M. as what is
going on with radio and record companies right now,'' he says. ``I
try not to read trade magazines, but they are telling program
directors that bands like Korn and Rage Against the Machine and
Limp Bizkit are the thing. Well, they are a thing, not the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to alternative
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is listening to consultants. Eighteen-year-old
Jonathan Yaffe, a student from San Diego, is in line for R.E.M.'s
first show at the Greek Theatre along with girlfriend Emily Pigott,
also 18. Clutching a poster of the band, he says he feels
completely ``alienated'' from the rage-oriented rock that dominates
alternative radio today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved `Up,'' he says. ``It has so much more variety than a
lot of music people my age listen to. It's not all fast flurry,
like Korn. It's more folkie. It has more to say. It doesn't really
fit into a straight genre. I think R.E.M. has something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Stipe, however, isn't saying much _ at least to the press on
this day in L.A. But after an assistant knocks on his dressing room
door and sweetly asks if he has a moment for his hometown paper,
the mercurial lead singer agrees to give us ``five minutes.'' It
turns into 20.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe appears happy and confident about the band's first U.S.
show, rummaging through his wardrobe _ ``You're not going to make
me comment on my clothes again, are you?'' _ and chatting with
``Uncle Doug,'' a friendly family member who looks a bit like the
late actor Forrest Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe is the band member who most exudes the aura of enigmatic
artist. If somebody gave him a mood ring, today it would be
flashing a rainbow of colors. At one moment, he can be
contemptuous: ``Everyone's got their opinion and they are all
valuable, unless they write for certain magazines.'' The next,
coyly famous: ``Sure, all my Hollywood friends are coming out to
the show, but I'm not going to name names.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite often, he'll let down his guard to reveal remnants of the
shy, naive kid from Decatur who was lucky enough to turn his
artistic quirkiness into a multimillion-dollar career. In the
middle of the conversation, he hops up to put in his contact
lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the record was finished, we started talking about
how (messed) up it was, trying to mutate from a four-piece into a
three-piece. There were divisions, but it worked out,'' Stipe says,
as backing musicians launch into the sound check for the second
show. ``Hear that? We're writing new stuff. That's a new song
they're playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. executive vice president Andy Schuon admits the
label waited anxiously ``to see how R.E.M. creatively jelled
together'' as a trio. ``But when they delivered the album, we were
genuinely as excited as they were,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The critically praised ``Up'' didn't produce a hit single and
has sold about 600,000 copies, far less than R.E.M.'s mega albums
of a decade ago. The 1991 CD ``Out of Time,'' for example, sold 4.2
million copies. In light of the band's big contract, industry
insiders and observers have speculated about how long the label
will hang in there without scoring big at the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Schuon vehemently rebuffs the notion that Warner Bros. will ever
abandon R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we have a long, many-album partnership with R.E.M. We
never expected to make money back on one record,'' Schuon says.
``We as a company feel like ultimately the best thing to do is be
partners with them, give them their artistic space to do what they
want to do. Ultimately, we'll get a great return on our investment.
We're not running around freaking out about (the sales of ``Up'').
We'd all love to sell more copies but, at the same time, if it's an
album they are proud of in a long history with Warner Bros., in the
end it will work out.''

   LOS ANGELES: it will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   In for the long haul
</P>
<P>
   Music critic Anthony DeCurtis, who is working on a biography of
the band, says R.E.M.'s monster deal was, in a way, a retroactive
pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Warner Bros. want them to have a gigantic hit?
Absolutely,'' he says. ``But remember, R.E.M. made a lot of money
for Warner Bros. early on. They played their original contract out
at a time they were having huge hit records, and it was a contract
that was favorable to them in 1989. They kind of dutifully followed
their contract out at a time when Warner Bros. was making a great
deal of money. A lot of bands would have renegotiated immediately
after success like that. So some of their last deal was payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing to think about is that there is still a
prestige factor to having R.E.M. on your label. They are a band
that younger bands look to as a model. Neil Young hasn't sold a lot
of records lately, but it's a good thing to have him on your label.
These guys are only 40 now, which in rock terms is not tremendously
old. ``Up'' was an experimental record. I'm not sure anybody would
listen to that album and say it was chock-full of hits. I think the
band would love to have a hit, but they don't live and die for it.
I think it is very possible for them to make a very successful,
commercial record. If they decide they want to do that, they could.
Certainly they don't have to worry about money. Beyond a certain
point, it becomes a question of what you want to do. Given a
choice, they will make the records they want and not have hits.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. may well be in a place few rock acts find. After nearly
two decades, band members still speak to each other, seem to enjoy
making music and care about their work. Sure, they've been
mainstream hitmakers, but largely by accident. The decision to stay
together and launch this American tour seems anything but
commercially driven.
</P>
<P>
   Observes Atlanta concert promoter Peter Conlon, ``This is one
band that is totally true to themselves. They aren't motivated by
commerciality. What we like or dislike isn't going to influence
these guys. I went down to Ticketmaster when tickets went on sale
for Chastain, and I watched three shows sell out in 22 minutes.
They could have done three weeks here and sold out every show. And
I think it's because this is a band that makes the right decisions
and does the right thing, like Eric Clapton or John Lennon. They
still live in Athens. They aren't calling you up from their place
in Malibu. They really haven't sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever preconceived notions people have about us, I hope
they will be surprised. We thrive on contradiction. We all do, as
human beings. We as a band personify that.''
</P>
<P>
   _R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe
</P>
<P>
   ``I see R.E.M. right now as a band that is still trying to
discover what its footing is in wake of significant things that
happened in its own world and significant things that have happened
in the music world. Peter Buck once told me, `I feel like we're too
old to be cutting edge and too young to be legends.' That's kind of
the place the band is in right now, which is an awkward state. This
is a scene dominated by Korn and Limp Bizkit, and that is not
R.E.M.'s world.''
</P>
<P>
   _Rock music critic
</P>
<P>
   Anthony DeCurtis
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one of the crown jewels of our roster. People in this
company walk around with a lot of pride for R.E.M., and they are
part of the soul and fabric of the company. They are an established
album act, known as the hippest band in America.''
</P>
<P>
   _Andy Schuon,
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. Records
</P>
<P>
   ``Hipness is merely a perception and sometimes a media creation.
I think R.E.M. is way hip. But in terms of the hot thing, well,
that torch passes every six months. It's more a matter of keeping
in touch with popular culture and knowing what people are into.''

<P>
   THE ATLANTA SHOWS:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO EXPECT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The stage: Compared to the pyrotechnics of monster-arena
shows, R.E.M.'s look is low-key but highly effective. Hanging over
the stage is a curtain of scaffolding containing dozens of quirky,
neon light icons _ a banana, a coffee cup, a revolving video
camera, a lotus, a smiling dolphin and (of course) a man on the
moon. The signs blink and move on cue as the band goes through the
set list. At one point, a neon hand with the number 30 appears. In
L.A., we asked R.E.M. manager Bertis Downs its meaning. ``I don't
know,'' he said, laughing. ``It's an enigmatic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The set: R.E.M. has been doing a different set each night,
usually 22 songs. They are a mix of old favorites and new material
from ``Up,'' typically opening with the ``Hey! Hey!'' of ``Lotus.''
R.E.M. has gone as far back as 1986 to resurrect tunes from the
album ``Lifes Rich Pageant'' (``Fall on Me'') and tosses out a few
chosen gems each night. In Los Angeles, show No. 1 featured
``Everybody Hurts,'' which disappeared from show No. 2. Both sets
closed with ``It's the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel
Fine).''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The seats: If you don't have tickets, you're out of luck. All
three R.E.M. shows in Atlanta sold out in 22 minutes. But fans can
hear Tuesday's entire concert live on new-rock station 99X. Tune in
at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The band: As usual, Michael Stipe and his dance moves dominate
the show. Mike Mills gravitates from bass to keyboard, while Pete
Buck rolls out a few Elvis kicks. Joey Waronker, former drummer for
Beck, is on drums. Scott McCaughey is on guitar, Ken Stringfellow
on keyboards.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Donald Sultan was riding high. He was
represented by a prestigious gallery, some of his paintings were
selling for more than $100,000 each and the Museum of Modern Art
gave him a one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   His investments, though, were not as stellar as his art.
</P>
<P>
   Methodical as an artist, he was as impulsive and haphazard as
any amateur when it came to choosing stocks. ``I did what everybody
else did _ I got tips from friends,'' Sultan, 48, said recently,
sitting in a book-lined office in the rear of his Spartan loft in
TriBeCa. In the studio, two assistants were preparing the linoleum
tiles on which he applies tar, the first step toward his trademark
images of flowers, egg shapes and smoke rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend, and he told me what to buy,'' Sultan said of
his investments. ``I bought a bunch of stuff. Then the stuff went
down in value. I called him and he said, `Oh, I sold mine.' He
wasn't a broker or anything, and he said, `I can't take care of
your money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan panicked. ``I knew I needed someone'' to take charge, he
said. After all, he had a family to help provide for, and he saw
his limitations as an investor. ``But I didn't know how to find the
right person,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the spring of 1992, he stumbled upon a solution. He was
introduced to Fayez Sarofim, the Houston-based art collector and
legendary investor, who was managing about $28 billion and had
accumulated a personal fortune that Forbes magazine estimated at
more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard about Fayez from a friend who had invested with
him,'' Sultan said. ``When the market crashed in 1987, this friend
called and asked Fayez what to do, and Fayez said, `Go fishing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked his answer, because I am someone who panics, and I
wanted someone who would say that,'' Sultan added.
</P>
<P>
   Sarofim, an Egyptian-born investor who came to this country as a
young man, approaches investing with much the same philosophy as
Warren E. Buffett: Buy carefully and hold. His firm, Fayez Sarofim
&AMP; Co., invests for individuals and is also the adviser for four
mutual funds: three for Dreyfus and one for Global Asset
Management. Whether buying paintings or stocks, he goes for
established, brand-name properties, and he hangs on to them for
years, selling reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interview over lunch at the private Coronado Club in
Houston, the slightly disheveled and somewhat shy Sarofim described
his investment strategy metaphorically. ``Most people have the idea
of finding a needle in a haystack _ they miss the objective of
going for the haystack,'' Sarofim said. ``I buy the haystack'' _
proven companies like Philip Morris, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the ones that have been screened,'' Sarofim said. ``You
only live so long. Why eat green bananas?''
</P>
<P>
   He has also loaded up on the works of a brand-name roster of
artists, including Donald Sultan. ``The first painting I bought was
by a lady in Houston,'' Sarofim said. ``It was $300, and I enjoyed
looking at it. But it is still worth $300. At the time, it was all
I could afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he could afford more, he bought a painting by the
American Impressionist Childe Hassam for $1,100. ``I sold it at
$25,000,'' Sarofim continued, speaking softly. ``Today it is worth
$400,000. Hassam was a known quantity. The value of the painting
went up. My biggest mistake was selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarofim, 70, still owns his first Sultan work, which he acquired
soon before the men first met, when Sultan visited Houston in the
spring of 1992 for a one-man show at the Meredith Long gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two men had expressed an interest in being introduced,
Long, widely considered Houston's leading dealer, took Sultan to
Sarofim's offices, where paintings by Helen Frankenthaler, Frank
Stella and Roy Lichtenstein crowded the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, as Sultan and Sarofim indulged a shared passion for
cigars, the talk turned to stocks. The artist told the investor
how, on the advice of a friend, he had sold some shares of Abbott
Laboratories to take a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fayez winced, and I said, `Why are you wincing?''' recalled
Sultan, who still talks with the slight Southern drawl of his
native North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You had a very smart friend who advised you to buy
the stock, and you should not have sold it,''' Sultan said. ``Then
I grew panicked again.''
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Sultan returned with Sarofim to his offices. The
desk and the floor around the investor's feet were piled high with
a jumble of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was a guy merged with the flow of capital
around the world,'' Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked, ``Fayez was watching monitors and running this
huge investment company,'' Sultan recalled. ``I thought I would be
kind of silly if I didn't ask. What did I have to lose? So I asked
if he would take care of my money, and he said yes. And I said, `It
isn't very much.' He told me it didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan, who declined to put a figure on his wealth, was well
aware that at that time he was not in the same bracket as most of
Sarofim's clients; they generally give him discretion over
portfolios of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sarofim, though he had met other artists in the course of
his collecting, ``no one had ever asked me to manage their money
before,'' he said. ``It surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such relationships _ or at least more informal ones
between artists and investment professionals _ are not at all
unusual, though one is more likely to evolve when artists are
better established, and when they have known a collector for years.
``The odd thing about Donald, as far as I am concerned, is that he
did it early on,'' said Irving Blum, who was a co-owner of the Blum
Hellman Gallery in New York, which represented Sultan in the 1980s
but has since closed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the perks of being an artist, of course, is the access it
can provide to luminaries in other fields. ``Artists are glamour
people, and money people go out of their way to help them,'' one
leading dealer said. ``It is only possible for successful artists.
They provide the ego gratification to the money people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, when Roy Lichtenstein was in his late 40's and his
paintings were selling for large sums, he became friendly with
Robert J. Denison, a hedge fund manager with First Security as well
as a collector, when they played tennis together in Southampton,
N.Y. ``Roy began to ask me questions about investing, and I
recommended stocks,'' Denison recalled. ``He had an extremely
curious mind. But he never paid me for investment advice. I didn't
want to cross that line.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Noland, the color-field artist probably best known for
his paintings of circles, recalls getting informal _ and valuable _
investment advice from the well-known investor Leon Levy, now
chairman of the Oppenheimer Management Corp.'s New York-based
funds.. The two men are friends and neighbors in Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
   What helped give Sultan confidence in Sarofim was the investor's
reputation as something of a recluse, obsessed with his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who manage money for artists who want to be
part of the scene,'' Sultan said. ``They make me nervous. I always
have the feeling that they will end up in Bermuda on drugs with
your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarofim was not a fixture on Houston's social scene, nor was he
known to spend time hobnobbing with artists on his periodic visits
to New York. He also did not treat Sultan any differently from his
wealthier clients.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of managing his money as trying to protect him from
himself,'' Sarofim said. ``Most people get into danger because they
have too much energy. What we all want is to save money so we can
have security in our old age. But very few people can handle money.
It makes them impulsive. One businessman listens to another. They
buy on tips.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarofim is particularly cautious about selling stocks because of
tax consequences. ``If you have $1 that compounds at 15 percent, in
20 years it will be worth $16.37,'' he said. ``If you trade $1 that
makes 15 percent, in the same period it will be worth $5.02,'' as
capital gains and transaction taxes diminish the profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sarofim tends to hold stocks for years, selling as rarely as
possible, a strategy that minimizes capital gains taxes and
expenses. The biggest mutual fund he manages, the $4.8 billion
Dreyfus Appreciation fund, has a turnover rate of just 1 percent,
according to Morningstar Inc. Other funds in Morningstar's large
blend category (meaning funds that own both growth and
value-oriented stocks with larger market capitalizations) turn over
79 percent of their portfolios, on average, in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sultan wasn't always the most patient investor, he fell
under the spell of Sarofim's buy-and-hold formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody ever makes any money buying and selling
stock,'' Sultan said. ``They have to make money by keeping the
stock.'' Still, he used to love to watch the television program
``Moneyline News Hour'' for its accounts of daily trading action.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I didn't think there was a word of truth ever spoken on
it,'' Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as investing in brand-name artists or stocks gives Sarofim
some security, Sultan has felt secure enough with his brand-name
money manager to hand over his finances and concentrate on his
work.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Sarofim has a proven track record. He does not
release numbers on his performance for private clients. But on
average, since he began managing Dreyfus Appreciation in 1990, the
fund has returned 20.04 percent a year, through Aug. 20. That
compares with 18.32 percent, on average, for the universe of large
blend funds tracked by Morningstar, ranking it 53rd among the 155
such funds that have existed for the entire period.
</P>
<P>
   It has, however, lagged behind the broader market: the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has risen an average of 21.2 percent
annually in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan's own income has its ebbs and flows. He weathered the
art-market downturn of the early 1990s, and with the recent
recovery, some of his works are again selling for six figures. To
make the best of what he has, he turns to Sarofim for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I went with Fayez, I had picked some stocks myself,''
Sultan said. He had mimicked many individual investors by buying
companies that he and his family _ his wife, Susan Reynolds Sultan,
a film producer and screenwriter; daughter, Frances, now 18, and
son, Penn, now 11 _ were familiar with. ``I bought the Gap because
that is where the kids shop, and I bought Disney. And the Gap
didn't do anything, so I called him and said: `What should I do?
Maybe we should sell it.' Fayez didn't think so because it was the
best retailing stock. The next day, it started to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought some zero-coupon bonds for the kids. I bought one for
my daughter and one for my son, to help pay for their schooling. So
Fayez said: `Sell some bonds.''' Over the years, Sarofim pointed
out to him, stocks have produced a better rate of return. So Sultan
sold half of the bonds he had bought for himself, but he kept the
other half, as a hedge, as well as the bonds for the children's
education.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have become good friends and generally spend time
together when Sarofim is in New York or when both are in Aspen,
Colo., skiing with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Their work styles have more in common than is initially
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan may be a panicky investor, but his painstaking, complex
technique as an artist makes it impossible to complete a picture
quickly. He works by applying tar, plaster, rubber and, finally,
color to linoleum tiles _ a process that gives his starkly simple
paintings richness and density. It also means that a single
painting can take up to a month, so that Sultan's annual output is
12 to 18 paintings, though he also makes prints and works on paper.
``He produces a relatively small number of paintings,'' said Ann
Freedman, president of Knoedler &AMP; Co. in New York, the gallery that
now handles Sultan's work.
</P>
<P>
   Like many professionals, Sultan has little time to educate
himself on finances, and his faith in Sarofim allows him to pay
only minimal attention to his investments. The artist knows, for
example, that he has stock in companies like Merck and Philip
Morris, a regular account and a Keogh. And he says he has done
well, though he is not certain what his precise returns have been
over the years. He looks at his balance every month, he said, ``but
just to see if it went up or down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he discuss his investments with friends. ``Artists
don't compare themselves to each other based on money,'' he said.
``Nobody really knows what money other artists have. They don't
care that much. The measure is the work and how you think your work
is perceived. How the museums are. How you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1951, Sultan grew up in Asheville, N.C. His father had
wanted to be a painter, but he felt he could not earn a living at
it and went into the tire business instead.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Sultan at first wanted to be an actor, and as a
student at the University of North Carolina gravitated toward
filmmaking. But he gave that up when he realized that he would have
to spend a lot of time raising money. Painting, he said, gave him
``complete control over my own expression.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York in 1975, at first supporting himself by
helping artists construct lofts during the day and painting at
night. Then he got a full-time position as a handyman in the Denise
Rene gallery, a job that lasted until the gallery closed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Sultan won a $2,500 grant from the New York State
Council on the Arts. That money enabled him to work full time on
his art. ``By then I had started to show at a couple of places and
to sell enough work to keep going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His paintings initially sold for $1,800, but by 1988 some of
them were selling for more than $100,000 each. After his art took
off, Sultan bought a house in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and rented an
apartment in Paris on the fashionable Rue Marbeuf, just off the
Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, though, art prices slumped. ``All hell broke
loose,'' Ms. Freedman recalled. ``There was a certain nervousness
in the marketplace. You don't have to be a genius to know that
people get used to a certain life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said he just kept working, but linking up with Sarofim
clearly gave him some comfort that he would not fritter away the
money he had already earned.
</P>
<P>
   Many people advise investors to work with several different
managers, so they don't make all their bets with a single strategy.
But Sultan, the painter of egg shapes, has ignored warnings about
placing all his eggs in Sarofim's basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy because I love him,'' Sultan said, ``and I don't
know anything else about it.''

FORMER MEXICAN DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL INDICTED FOR DRUG
TRAFFICKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Capping years of investigation in a case that has
roiled relations with Mexico, U.S. prosecutors Friday detailed a
25-count narcotics and money laundering indictment of Mario Ruiz
Massieu, a politically influential former Mexican deputy attorney
general arrested in New Jersey in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, unsealed on Monday by a Houston grand jury,
represent the first felony charges brought in the United States
against Ruiz Massieu, who had close ties to the family of former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The indictment charges that
Ruiz Massieu used his position as Mexico's top anti-drug official
during 1993 and 1994 to obtain large bribes from drug traffickers.
It accuses Ruiz Massieu of sending a top aide to make 25 trips from
Mexico City to Houston, ferrying a total of $9 million in cash,
packed in suitcases, for deposit in two Texas banks.
</P>
<P>
   While Ruiz Massieu was deputy attorney general, the indictment
charges, he ``did receive large sums of United States currency in
the Republic of Mexico from individuals associated with drug
traffickers.''The unsealing of the indictment was first reported in
Friday's editions of Mexican newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ruiz Massieu's lawyer, Cathy Fleming, continued to
deny those charges, saying that her client's family was ``a very
prominent and rich family in Mexico'' and that the money was family
money.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment reflects an abrupt about-face by the Clinton
administration, which for years after Ruiz Massieu's arrest at
Newark Airport on March 23, 1995, had been reluctant to embarrass
the Mexican government by prosecuting such a senior official. Law
enforcement agents, led by the U.S. Customs Service, pressed
federal prosecutors for years to charge Ruiz Massieu with drug
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Clinton administration officials for several years
worked instead to return him to Mexico, at first through
extradition and more recently by seeking to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu was named Mexico's deputy attorney general in early
1994, largely because of his influential connections. His older
brother, Jose Francisco, was the No. 2 official in the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party and had been married to President
Salinas' sister.
</P>
<P>
   He first fell afoul of authorities in Mexico, not because of his
ties to traffickers, but because of official accusations that he
mishandled the investigation into the September 1994 murder of his
brother, Jose Francisco. President Salinas' brother, Raul, was
later convicted by a Mexican judge of that killing.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment comes four years after the former Mexican
official fled his country for the U.S. and was subsequently picked
up for attempting to take about $40,000 out of the United States
without reporting it, in violation of U.S. Customs regulations. He
was held for several months at that time, and then released on bond
and placed under house arrest. Since then, immigration officials
have sought to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu was taken into custody Thursday night by U.S.
Customs, Drug Enforcement Administration and Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents at a home in Palisades Park, N.J., where he
has been living under house arrest. He is also being monitored by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, pending the outcome of
the efforts to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu, in handcuffs and leg manacles, listened to a court
translator as U.S. Magistrate Joel Pisano ruled that he would be
released on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond. He will continue
to live under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu still faces arraignment in Houston, where the case
is slated to be tried. Ms. Fleming, said that her client was not a
risk to flee and ``was happy with the protections of the U.S. legal
system.'' She said that he was innocent of the charges and wanted
only an opportunity in U.S. courts to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming had harsh words, however, for U.S. officials, who
she said had descended upon the home that Ruiz Massieu shares with
his wife, Maria, and 10-year-old daughter, Regina, without warning
and without giving her notice of the Houston indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little outraged that the government didn't call us,''
she said as she stood on the steps of the federal courthouse here
after Friday's appearance by her client.

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to deport Ruiz Massieu rather than to prosecute him,
senior Clinton administration officials argued that his presence in
the United States would damage relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the change in U.S. position, John Russell, a
spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department said: ``His presence is
no longer a problem in foreign policy because we developed a
criminal case against him and backed it up with this indictment.
The Mexican authorities are now helping us in this and are no
longer seeking extradition.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After Ruiz Massieu's brother was killed, President Salinas put
Ruiz Massieu in charge of the initial investigation, but after
several weeks he resigned his post and began to publicly accuse
high-ranking ruling party politicians of blocking his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu's arrest on March 3, 1995, at Newark Airport came
as he was fleeing Mexico, days after the arrest and indictment in
Mexico of Raul Salinas, the former president's brother, on charges
of murdering Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, aides to President Ernesto Zedillo told reporters
that they had evidence of Ruiz Massieu's ties to drug traffickers.
But he was never charged with narcotics crimes in Mexico until last
July. Instead, the Mexican government originally charged him with
crimes related to what they called the deliberate mismanagement of
the investigation of his brother's murder.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a Mexican judge convicted Raul Salinas of that
killing, after a trial in which the government argued that Ruiz
Massieu, while directing the initial investigation, had falsified
evidence in order to cover up Salinas' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico sought four times to extradite Ruiz Massieu in relation
to the alleged coverup, but several American judges turned down the
requests, calling the evidence collected in Mexico and presented in
court by Justice Department lawyers slapdash and sullied by police
brutality in Mexico. Those refusals represented a stinging
embarrassment both to Mexico and to the Clinton administration. In
an interview Friday, Eduardo Ibarrola, a deputy Mexican attorney
general, called Ruiz Massieu's indictment in the United States a
``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that Ruiz Massieu is going to be in jail,
either in Mexico or in the United States,'' Ibarrola said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senior Clinton administration officials sought
repeatedly to return Ruiz Massieu to Mexico, lower-ranking U.S. law
enforcement officials continued to collect evidence tying the $9
million that Ruiz Massieu had deposited in Houston banks to drug
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1997 civil trial in Houston, a former Mexican federal
police agent described how corrupt police working with traffickers
delivered suitcases full of cash, derived from a cocaine shipment,
to Ruiz Massieu in a car parked outside the Mexican attorney
general's headquarters in August 1994. The Houston jury found that,
and other evidence of Ruiz Massieu's ties to traffickers,
sufficient to confiscate the $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. law enforcement officials said at the time that the
same evidence was sufficient to justify Ruiz Massieu's immediate
indictment. But they complained that Clinton administration
officials were dragging their feet because of political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview Friday, Shelley Altenstadter, the Customs
Service's special agent in charge in Houston, said that in the 1997
civil case, prosecutors needed only to show that there was a
``preponderance of evidence'' that Ruiz Massieu's money was derived
from drugs. In order to convict him of drug crimes and money
laundering, prosecutors will have to prove his drug ties ``beyond
all reasonable doubt,'' a higher standard, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Altenstadter said that a turning point in the case came last
year, when Robert E. O'Neill, a Washington-based Justice Department
official, was named to serve as a special federal prosecutor for
the Ruiz Massieu case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're able to convince somebody to appoint a special
prosecutor, then your case moves right along,'' Ms. Altenstadter
said.

   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ The Beast of the East was knocked down with
one devastating swing of the bat Friday, and it did not get back
up. Phenix City, Ala., scored three runs in the second inning to
earn a 3-2 victory over Toms River, N.J., pulling off the biggest
upset of the Little League World Series tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toms River had a 2-0 lead and its star pitcher, Casey Gaynor, on
the mound Friday morning when the United States championship
resumed after Thursday night's rainout. But whatever advantage Toms
River, the defending Little League World Series champion, had was
stolen by Phenix City when William Gaston drilled a home run over
the right-field fence with two out in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston's home run, which cut Toms River's lead to 2-1, started
Phenix City's stunning comeback. Phenix City scored two more runs
in the second inning and then held on tight to defeat Toms River in
front of 11,000 fans at Howard J. Lamade Stadium to claim the U.S.
title and a berth in Saturday's World Series championship game
against Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tears of disappointment flowed freely in the Toms River dugout
after the game. The parents, friends and townspeople who had made
the five-hour drive from Ocean County, N.J., for the game stood in
shocked silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that home run off Casey, we knew that we could hit
him,'' said Bryan Woodall, the Phenix City pitcher who held Toms
River to two hits Friday. ``It definitely got our confidence up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston's home run, only the second one he has ever hit, shocked
him as much as it shocked Toms River. But he knew the ball was gone
the moment he connected, and he raised his arms above his head and
pumped his fists. When he reached home plate, he was mobbed by his
teammates, who had sprinted out of the dugout to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking fastball,'' Gaston said, ``and that's what I
got.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phenix City players found new life as the Toms River players
hung their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor, who shut out Phenix City, 6-0, last Sunday and had not
allowed a run in 31 consecutive innings before Gaston's home run,
was rattled when the rangy outfielder hit the home run. After that,
Gaynor was roughed up for four straight singles and two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough today,'' said Mike Gaynor, who is Casey's father
and the Toms River manager. ``I think the pressure got to Casey. It
broke my heart to see that. It's a shame he felt like he needed to
carry the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering the go-ahead run, Gaynor was replaced by Eric
Campesi, who retired the final 11 Phenix City batters. But the
damage had been done. Toms River, which was attempting to become
only the third team to advance to the World Series final the year
after winning it, managed just three hits Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Toms River players stood on the steps of
their dugout and applauded the Phenix City team. The Toms River
fans, too, stood and cheered for the other team as the Phenix City
players jumped into a pile of bodies on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're 12 years old,'' said Gloria Cummings, Bobby Cumming's
mother. ``It's not the end of the world for them. They'll snap
right back.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was suspended in the second inning on Thursday after
Toms River had taken a 2-0 lead and chased Colby Rasmus, Phenix
City's best pitcher, from the game. But just as the second inning
began, the skies opened and washed out the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the people up there rooting against us, and with the
way Casey Gaynor was throwing last night, we were happy to get out
of there,'' said Tony Rasmus, the Phenix City manager, who quit one
of his jobs to come to Williamsport. ``The rain gave us a good
chance to take a deep breath and start all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the United States championship was our goal all
along,'' he added. ``I can't really describe the feelings. You
start out believing the U.S. championship, but a part of you never
really believes that it can become reality.''

 &HT;    Carrying out certified wood promise will be tough for Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot's promise to stock an environmentally
friendly warehouse could be one of its biggest challenges yet.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Atlanta-based home improvement retailer
squelched the war cries of environmentalists when it announced it
would stop selling products with wood from endangered forests by
the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, activists applauded the new policy and declared an
instant cease-fire on their 2-year-old protest against Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the company will phase out certain types of wood,
including cedar, redwood and lauan, unless they are independently
certified to comply with environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Wood from endangered forests is generally not used for
construction lumber. It is frequently found in products such as
drawer handles, kitchen cabinets and paint brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Arthur Blank said the company ultimately plans
to require all of its wood-containing products to come certified
from the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to vote with our purchasing dollars for the products
that are certified,'' Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics behind the new policy, though, present a mammoth
task.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the supply of certified wood is scarce. Only 1 percent
of the world's forest products are certified, which generally means
they come from environmentally responsible, well-managed
timberlands. And even as forest companies move toward
certification, a policy like Home Depot's requires buy-in from
every company in the entire supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The first steps in Home Depot's wood purchasing policy took more
than two years to chart out because of the complexity of the issue,
said Suzanne Apple, vice president of community affairs. Forestry
has been a testy issue since the late 1980s. As environmentalists,
governments and the public battled over how to tackle the loss and
degradation of older forests, managed forestry became one of the
first solutions. Certification is one of the newest weapons in the
fight. There are generally two types of forest-related
certification. Entire forests can be certified, which essentially
ensures that the owners are growing as much timber as they harvest
and that they meet several economic and social criteria. To meet
one set of widely accepted standards, foresters must prove that
they're protecting the habitat and bio-diversity of the land. And
they also have to provide socio-economic benefits to the
surrounding community, said Debbie Hammel, director of forest
conservation program for Scientific Certification Systems, which
conducts third-party environmental audits. ``It's not just about
the environment,'' Hammel said. ``We look to see if they are paying
a fair wage, if they run a safe facility and if they are
financially viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional teams of foresters, ecologists and economists run the
checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we may bring in an anthropologist, for example, if we're
working in an area with indigenous people,'' Hammel said. A forest
certification could take up to six months, she said. Annual audits
are conducted to maintain certification.
</P>
<P>
   The second certification, known as ``chain of custody''
certification, tracks the trees leaving the certified forest as
they work their way through each stage of the production and
distribution line, from the sawmill to the retailer's loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   At the sawmill level, the process is relatively simple. Logs
from certified forests are kept separate from those from
uncertified forests. The mill then runs a separate shift for the
certified lumber to keep it from the uncertified lumber.
</P>
<P>
   It's a straightforward process if the certified lumber goes
straight to the retailer or lumberyard. But if the wood goes to
another manufacturer to be used in other products, the
certification process can unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Raw materials may go through several manufacturers before the
finished product is made. And tracking the wood through the supply
chain gets tougher with increased reliance on global sourcing,
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood is being shipped from New Zealand to China to make toilet
seats for the United Kingdom, for heaven's sake,'' Hammel said.
``Each manufacturer that's involved in the distribution process
would have to be certified.'' Costs of the initial evaluation could
range from pennies per acre for a large operation to 40 cents an
acre for a small forest with less than 100 acres, Hammel said. The
cost of an annual audit ranges from a couple of hundred dollars to
$7,000. The forests audited by Scientific Certification Systems
currently range in size from 20 acres to 2.2 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said it doesn't know how much its new policy will
cost the company. Home Depot expects its top 20 to 30 suppliers to
bear the brunt of the new policy. Some forest product companies
already have moved in recent years toward certification programs.
For example, Canadian company J.D. Irving, which manages 1.5
million acres of private forest land in New Brunswick, has
certified 20 percent of its forests. The company is working to have
all of its woodlands evaluated by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. started an aggressive initiative in 1994.
Last week, it added another aspect to its environmental policy with
outside environmental audits by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The
accounting and consulting firm is verifying operations and
environmental issues in the company's wood and chip supply system.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is the first major U.S. home-improvement retailer to
back certification. Lowe's plans to follow. Europe's largest home
improvement retailer, B&AMP;Q, has nearly finished removing endangered
wood from its shelves.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ Before there was an Internet bubble, before
biotechnology left a bad taste in money managers' mouths, capital
was ventured and shares were sold in a group of companies that
aimed to leapfrog the government's multibillion-dollar effort to
map the human genome. By sequencing and patenting genes ahead of
the publicly financed laboratories, the investors thought, these
companies would control the next era of health care _ and make
their founders and shareholders rich.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as the international race to spell out the precise
sequence of the three billion letters in the human genetic code
sprints to the finish line, the markets are demanding that the gene
merchants deliver the goods. Investors are starting to demand not
just science, but a viable business model, too.
</P>
<P>
   To the victors will belong an asset of almost unfathomable
value: the source code of life itself. By sequencing the DNA in all
100,000 genes in the human body _ that is, by divining the order of
the four chemicals that make up the genes _ scientists hope to
treat diseases in much the same way that software engineers fix
faulty computer programs: by isolating flaws in the code.
</P>
<P>
   If the effort is successful, health care will shift from a
paradigm of detect and treat, typically with toxic drugs that
sometimes do no more than mask symptoms, to predict and prevent,
with therapies of exquisite specificity aimed at the causes of
disease. By identifying the genetic roots of illnesses like cancer
and heart disease, some experts say, the science of the genome, or
genomics, may make it possible for a child born today to live to
150 _ or, some say, much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is a series of preventable diseases,'' said Dr. William
A. Haseltine, chairman and chief executive of Human Genome Sciences
here, declaring the philosophy behind the industry he is helping to
invent.
</P>
<P>
   Other genomics leaders have less trouble with that assertion
than with Haseltine's contention that his company already has
sequences for 95 percent of the human genes and is amassing a
patent portfolio that will make it the gatekeeper for the entire
biopharmaceuticals industry.
</P>
<P>
   Assertions like that have always irritated Dr. Francis S.
Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. For some of the companies, he
said, ``financial viability appears to be tied to claims of
exclusivity,'' while the government's goal is to sequence all the
human genes and place them in the public domain for the common
good.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the whole concept of patenting the bits of biochemical
information known as genes offends many, from religious leaders to
scientists, including James Watson, a co-discoverer of DNA, who
resigned as the original head of the Human Genome Project over this
issue. While the Patent Office has established rules meant to
clarify what kind of genetic discoveries can be patented, the issue
is by no means resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The genomics companies have filed patents by the thousands, but
only a few hundred have been published, fewer still issued and none
of those yet defended in court. So any claims of strong patent
positions remain unproven.
</P>
<P>
   But genomics is all about big claims. Last year, Dr. J. Craig
Venter, a former N.I.H. researcher, shook up the field when he
started a new company, now called Celera Genomics Group, a
separately traded subsidiary of the PE Corp., which he said would
complete the sequencing of the human genome in 2001, about two
years ahead of the public labs.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's announcement was greeted with considerable skepticism,
but it prompted Collins to move up his goal for completion, too; he
now expects a rough draft of the human genome by next spring and a
complete genome a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration of the public and private efforts has already
led to a rough winnowing of the genomics field, with some companies
disappearing in mergers and others trading at such low share prices
that their ability to raise capital and remain independent is
doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of broad strategies have emerged, meanwhile, among the
best-capitalized companies.
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences and Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., of
Cambridge, Mass., intend to sell drugs, developed with capital
raised in a few high-value deals with pharmaceutical companies. Two
others, Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif., and
Celera, in Rockville, sell only data that others use to identify
potential drug targets.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Human Genome and Millennium have soared this year,
while Incyte, once the market leader, has fallen, primarily because
of the perceived threat from Celera, which has deep pockets and a
similar business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human genome is going to be sequenced, with absolute
certainty, within the next two years,'' said Dr. Eric Lander,
director of the federally financed Whitehead/MIT Center for Genomic
Research in Cambridge and a founding scientist at Millennium. ``The
game has moved on. Now it's: How do you add value to the genome?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Code as a Cure
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most obvious way to add value to the genome is to
turn genetic discoveries into drugs, but so far Human Genome
Sciences is the only company that has done so. The stainless-steel
fermentation vats at its 80,000-square-foot manufacturing plant
here in Rockville would be a common site at a traditional
biotechnology company, like Amgen or Genentech, but they are unique
among the genomics players.
</P>
<P>
   These vats produce the proteins that are Human Genome's first
two drugs. One, intended to protect blood-forming cells from the
toxic effects of chemotherapy, is being tested in women with breast
and ovarian cancer. The other is being tested as a wound-healing
agent. Both are in the second of three phases of trials typically
required of new drugs by the Food and Drug Administration; that
means that they are at least two or three years away from the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Human Genome's third drug candidate that provides a
glimpse of the real promise of genomics. Using a gene injected
directly into a diseased area, it prompts the body to grow new
blood vessels. The drug is being tested as an alternative to bypass
surgery for treating blocked arteries in the heart and limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are the only company to create genomics
assets and to use those assets to move drugs into the clinic,''
said Haseltine, who did pioneering work in sequencing the genome of
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, as a scientist at Harvard's
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But these three drugs, and three others that Human Genome hopes
to begin testing next year, are only the tip of a very large
iceberg. Haseltine said the company has discovered _ and, more
importantly, filed patents on _ a vast data base of genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company that wants to be in the business of using genes,
proteins or antibodies as drugs has a very high probability of
running afoul of our patents,'' Haseltine said. ``From a commercial
point of view, they are severely constrained _ and far more than
they realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drug industry executives dismiss this is as self-promotion,
though as Human Genome's patents begin to be published, it is clear
that the company is assembling an arsenal of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Human Genome is itself constrained by the terms of a deal
it struck in 1993 with SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., the British
pharmaceuticals giant. For $125 million, then the largest
biotechnology deal ever, SmithKline obtained exclusive rights to
use Human Genome's gene discoveries to produce so-called
small-molecule drugs, the kind that can be taken in pill form. The
agreement expires in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The deal left Human Genome free to develop drugs based on
proteins _ the easiest kind to take quickly to the clinic. But such
drugs are commercially problematic, because they must be injected,
and few patients want to take a shot if a pill is available. The
company can also develop gene therapies, like its heart drug. But
gene therapy has yet to produce an approved drug for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Haseltine said the SmithKline deal was worthwhile,
because it gave Human Genome the resources to grab a big lead in
genomics. And when it expires, he will be free to strike new
partnerships based on the same data base of genes. ``Two years from
now, we have a big opportunity to remonetize our asset and still
have plenty of intellectual property to ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Partners in the Marketplace
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the undisputed champion of deal making is
Millennium, which has raked in over $1 billion in financing from
partners like Roche Holding AG, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., Monsanto and Bayer
AG.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements are exclusive only for specific diseases (or,
in Monsanto's case, for use in agricultural products), so
Millennium remains free to pursue its own small-molecule drugs. It
has also created subsidiaries for biotechnology drugs and for
predictive medicine, like tests to identify genetic conditions
showing a predisposition to diseases or adverse drug reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's executives don't claim a lock on the intellectual
property of the human genome, but their deal-making shows the value
that drug makers see in the company's work.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, for example, Bayer agreed to pay Millennium up to
$460 million over five years for 225 of what the industry calls
validated genetic targets _ that is, genes plus the accompanying
biological data to show their relevance in areas like
cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, pain, liver fibrosis
and viral infections. Targets that Bayer doesn't choose for drug
development revert to Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a huge search before we went with Millennium,'' said
Wolfgang Hartwig, Bayer's executive vice president of
pharmaceutical research. He said Bayer was attracted to
Millennium's continual refreshing of its technology and to its
freedom from the encumbrances of exclusive deals.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium sprawls around Cambridge in leased space, most of it
near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In its early days,
the company made much of its connection to Lander and MIT's genome
center. But today, Lander's role is more clearly advisory. The
personalities who define the company are those of its chief
executive, Mark Levin, a soft-spoken former venture capitalist, and
his head deal maker and chief business officer, Steven H. Holtzman,
a Rhodes Scholar with a degree in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Levin tends not to make big claims, but he is building a big
company, drawing on experiences early in his career at Genentech,
the biotechnology pioneer, where he worked in process engineering
in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech put in place the largest molecular biology lab in
the world at the time,'' he said. ``We've gone out and put together
the largest critical mass in biotech today.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Roche is expected to seek permission to begin
trials of an anti-obesity drug developed from a genetic target
supplied by Millennium. Becton Dickinson &AMP; Co. in Franklin Lakes,
N.J., will soon offer a melanoma test using technology from
Millennium's predictive medicine unit.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the depth and breadth of its science and technology,
Millennium is conspicuously lacking a drug of its own in clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're developing genes and targets and leads,'' Levin said.
``By the end of 1999, going into 2000, you will see us make
additional acquisitions, and these acquisitions will take us into
the clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that while Millennium has the cash and high-value
shares to acquire a drug _ and many struggling biotech companies
have drugs for sale _ the best drug prospects attract multiple
bids, and there are many far larger companies out shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Knowledge Merchants
</P>
<P>
   If Millennium and Human Genome aim to be the next Genentech and
Amgen, Incyte and Celera have a different role model in mind:
Bloomberg L.P. Just as Bloomberg sells information to the
securities industry but isn't in the brokerage business, these
companies sell data bases of genetic information to drug companies
but never intend to produce drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte is based in Palo Alto, Calif., deep in Silicon Valley,
and it is no coincidence that the heart of its headquarters is a
vast, glass-enclosed room full of powerful computers. ``At the end
of the day, it's the information that matters,'' said Randy Scott,
the president and chief scientific officer. ``We are all about the
application of Moore's Law to biology,'' he said _ a reference to
the observation that computer processing power doubles every 18
months. Applying that exponential growth to genomics should produce
similar gains for drug discovery, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Incyte had something unique among genomics
companies: operating income from sales of its products. Instead of
signing huge deals to bankroll its own drug programs, Incyte sold
subscriptions to Lifeseq, its genomic data base. Some 25 companies
subscribed, including most of the leading pharmaceutical and
biotechnology concerns, and Incyte showed steady earnings growth
without big outlays on drug development.
</P>
<P>
   But the creation last year of Celera _ cash-rich and in no hurry
to show a profit _ put Incyte on the spot. While Incyte's data base
offered gene fragments that point the way to full-length genes,
Celera said it would provide whole genomes at a competitive price.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government's Human Genome Project, now on
an accelerated timetable, was placing thousands of genes in the
public domain. And companies like Pangea Systems of Oakland,
Calif., were supplying software tools to analyze this data, at a
fraction of the cost of a Lifeseq subscription.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Facing a classic squeeze, Incyte management moved rapidly to
improve its product, adding data from the government's work,
cutting the price and introducing new data bases. But the moves
cost money, and as the company began reporting losses, investors
fled, cutting the share price in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing this story _ that Lifeseq's dead, it's all
in the public domain _ and maybe we even started to believe it
ourselves,'' said Roy Whitfield, Incyte's chairman and chief
executive. ``But it's just not true.'' No customer has failed to
renew its subscription, he said, and he predicted that profits _
and investors _ would return in the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Celera is the spoiler in genomics, or intends to be. The company
plans to sequence the entire human genome and offer the data to
subscribers. Other genomes of interest to scientists _ like that of
drosophila, a fruit fly used in many experiments _ will be offered
in a similar fashion. Venter's critics say Celera's hurry-up human
genome will be full of gaps and errors, but the company has
attracted three blue-chip subscribers: Novartis A.G., Amgen and
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn.
</P>
<P>
   As a sibling of PE Biosystems Group, also part of the PE Corp.,
Celera received first access to PE Biosystems' latest automated
gene-sequencing machines. (The two companies were created this
spring in a reorganization of the old Perkin-Elmer Corp.; the
current Perkin ELmer is a different company that bought part of the
old Perkin Elmer and took its name.) Celera now has 300 of these
$300,000 devices, some arrayed in neat rows, some lining the
hallways still in their wooden shipping crates, some piled in
elevators. The largest public genome center, Lander's lab at MIT
has 120 such machines, and most genomics companies have just a
handful.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the powerful equipment with an army of robots and vast
amounts of computing power makes it practical and cost-effective to
sequence whole genomes, Dr. Venter said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that subscribers will pay Celera for partial genetic
information as it becomes available, just as they have paid Incyte
_ but with the kicker that the company will ultimately supply
complete genomes for many organisms. Companies can use this
information royalty-free, except where it involves a gene sequence
patented by Celera. Venter said he ultimately expects a mixture of
revenues _ from subscriptions, royalties on drug sales and even
individual researchers paying to use the Celera Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I'm going to be the Bill Gates of biology; I'm not
sure that's meant to be flattering,'' he said. Still, ``the upside
to this business is very, very large, and different from what
anybody else is doing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Eager Competitors
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street loves to anoint winners, and given the impact of
capital flow, these prophecies can become self-fulfilling. Despite
talk that Celera or Human Genome may achieve a Microsoft-like
dominance of biological information, many smaller companies are
also pursuing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The first real product of genomics was a diagnostic kit
developed by Myriad Genetics Inc. of Salt Lake City, drawing on its
discovery of two genes responsible for hereditary breast cancer.
Genome Therapeutics Inc. of Waltham, Mass., has built a
subscription business based on bacterial genomes. Genset S.A. of
Paris has signed up two partners for what is called
pharmacogenomics _ the enterprise of applying genetic data to
existing drugs to screen out people more likely to have side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more, and their continued proliferation suggests
that genomics remains a fertile field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current effort is rather like building the periodic
table,'' said Dr. Collins, head of the government's project,
comparing the work to the fundamental plow work of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge of genomics _ the real fun, the real payoff
_ is being able to take the periodic table and figure out how it
works,'' he said. ``All of that will be poorly understood and will
be grist for research for decades to come.''

REVERSING HIS RULING, OHIO JUDGE ALLOWS VOUCHERS, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A federal judge who, on the day before school started
this week, blocked a Cleveland program that uses taxpayer money for
vouchers to send thousands of children to private and parochial
schools, reversed himself Friday, allowing most of the children to
stay in the program, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. of U.S. District Court in Cleveland
said Friday that he would allow those students who had been in the
program last year to receive the tuition money for private school
for the first semester. But Oliver said that could change if he
decides before the semester ends that the program violates the
constitutional separation of church and state. After an outcry by
thousands of parents and some public officials about the initial
ruling, Oliver said he recognized that his decision had ``caused
disruption to the children previously enrolled in the program
beyond that normally associated with a student's transferring from
one school to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that all but 587 of the 4,000 children enrolled
in the program will receive the vouchers for the fall semester. The
vouchers pay up to $2,250 in tuition costs for elementary school
children in low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's original decision on Tuesday had been the most
significant court setback so far to proponents of school vouchers,
especially since it involved the first city in the country to use
vouchers for religious schools. The ruling generated discussion
around the country, as some cities and states have also adopted
voucher programs and many others are considering such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the vast majority of the 56 private schools in the
4-year-old program were religious schools, the judge had declared
that ``the Cleveland program has the primary effect of advancing
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   While that decision involved only an injunction to allow him to
consider a lawsuit challenging the program's constitutionality, the
judge also said there was ``no substantial possibility'' that he
would ultimately rule in favor of the program.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Oliver had said he felt that issuing an injunction
before the start of the school year would be less inconvenient than
potentially having to yank students out of school after classes had
started. But thousands of parents and some public officials did not
agree. Ohio's attorney general, Betty D. Montgomery, filed an
emergency appeal with the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
after Oliver's decision.
</P>
<P>
   After the second ruling Friday, Clint Bolick, the litigation
director for the Institute for Justice, which argued for the
voucher program, said: ``We're obviously very pleased. I think it's
safe to say the judge got the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolick said that just before the close of court Friday his
organization filed an appeal seeking to have the judge's reprieve
apply to all of the children in the program. But he said that,
regardless, private donors should be able to raise money for the
rest of the students to stay in private schools. Bolick's group has
also filed an appeal of Oliver's initial decision.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects the matter to be stable for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't see this as a reversal or as the judge
backing off,'' said Gregory King, a spokesman for the American
Federation of Teachers, which fought the vouchers. ``My reading of
the order is that the judge simply wants to insure that these
students have a smooth school year and can begin school without
being troubled by where they are going to be. This is just a
short-term decision. We're confident the judge will maintain his
initial indication that we're going to win on the constitutional
grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on both sides of the issue believe the Cleveland case
stands a good chance of winding up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

NEW RULES EXPAND ABILITY OF POLICE TO MONITOR TALK ON CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the objections of civil liberties groups and
privacy advocates, the federal government Friday announced new
technical standards for cellular phones that will broadly expand
the ability of law enforcement agents to monitor conversations and
locate criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local agents can already monitor cellular phone
calls after obtaining a court warrant. But under the rules
announced Friday by the Federal Communications Commission, they
will also be able to determine the general location of a cell phone
user by identifying which cellular antenna was used by the phone
company to transmit the beginning and end of any call under
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The rules will permit agents to identify all callers on a
conference call and monitor such conversations even after the
target of the inquiry is no longer part of the conversation. And
they will enable agents to determine whether suspects are making
use of such common cellular phone features as call forwarding and
call waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of intercepted communications approved by
federal and State courts over the last decade has nearly doubled,
reaching 1,329 last year, law enforcement officials say they have
had difficulty keeping up with the explosive popularity of cellular
phones. Senior officials at the FBI have spent years seeking new
authority beyond just monitoring the calls as mobile phones have
become inexpensive and ubiquitious.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, privacy advocates have warned that broadening
the ability of law enforcement to monitor more than simply the
content of such calls would be deeply intrusive. Law enforcement
officials have asserted that since the location of wired telephones
was already public information, there is no intrusion of privacy in
determining the location of wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone industry was also resistant to change and had
sought to delay some of the technical changes in their systems that
were announced Friday on the ground that they would be too
expensive to implement. Industry executives said Friday that they
would be unable to meet the regulators' timetable and thus would
seek permission to delay complying with the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling was a clear victory for the law enforcement
groups and a setback for the privacy organizations. The decision
follows years of fruitless negotiations between the phone
companies, the Justice Department, privacy groups and
telecommunications regulators that began in 1994, after Congress
approved major legislation called the Communications Assistance for
Law Enforcement Act.
</P>
<P>
   It required the cellular phone industry to design its systems to
comply with new standards that would make it easier for the FBI to
monitor calls. But the law left it to the FCC to determine the
precise contours of those standards, as well as the FBI's ability
to monitor more than just the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said that while they believed the new rules
went beyond what was authorized in the law, they would comply with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless industry now can build and implement these
capabilities, but we require a realistic deployment schedule, one
that the industry can plan for and meet,'' said Tom Wheeler,
president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
Some of the rules become effective next June 30, and others on
Sept. 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at the Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded
the rules, saying they would be a powerful new tool in combatting
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing technological changes in the nation's
telecommunications systems present increasing challenges to law
enforcement,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This ruling will
enable law enforcement to keep pace with these changes and ensure
we will be able to maintain our capability to conduct
court-authorized electronic surveillance.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, said the decision by the
FCC was ``an extremely important and positive public safety
ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the FBI's perspective, the FCC's announced ruling goes a
long way to balance public safety, privacy and the needs of
telecommunications carriers to remain competitive in today's
market,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the FCC said they had struck the appropriate
compromise between law enforcement interests against privacy
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have carefully balanced law enforcement's needs against the
rights of all Americans to privacy, and the cost to industry of
providing these tools to assist law enforcement,'' said William
Kennard, the FCC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But civil liberties and privacy groups said the decision would
yield a sweeping new intrusion into privacy rights and expressed
alarm that telecommunications policy-makers had largely ignored
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply disappointed that on all the issues that
mattered, the commission ruled against privacy and in favor of
expanded FBI surveillance,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel
for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties
group that studies technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel, the general counsel of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, said today's rules reminded him of the way
totalitarian countries relied on authoritarian figures to impose
their most important policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents an unprecedented expansion of law
enforcement,'' Sobel said. ``We have reached the point where law
enforcement is dictating our nation's telecommunications
standards.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sobel asserted that the 1994 law never envisioned tracking the
location of cellular phone users, and that senior administration
officials had even testified at the time and issued assurances that
they had no intention of seeking what he called ``such a massive
intrusion of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the new rules will only enable law enforcement agents to
locate a cell phone user within the radius of an antenna _ an area
that is anywhere from a few city blocks to a few miles _ new
technology that is being developed may ultimately permit greater
precision.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is in the midst of developing rules that would require
the use of technology more closely pinpointing cell phone users who
dial 911 for emergencies. Those rules are expected to be completed
later this year. And a number of phone companies are using
technologies based on global positioning satellites now used for
navigation systems in planes, cars and boats that enable
pinpointing a location to within yards.

regardless, private donors should be able to raise money for the
rest of the students to stay in private schools. Bolick's group has
also filed an appeal of Oliver's initial decision.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects the matter to be stable for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't see this as a reversal or as the judge
backing off,'' said Gregory King, a spokesman for the American
Federation of Teachers, which fought the vouchers. ``My reading of
the order is that the judge simply wants to insure that these
students have a smooth school year and can begin school without
being troubled by where they are going to be. This is just a
short-term decision. We're confident the judge will maintain his
initial indication that we're going to win on the constitutional
grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on both sides of the issue believe the Cleveland case
stands a good chance of winding up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A powerful Russian industrialist whose empire is
under investigation in the money laundering inquiry at the Bank of
New York said Friday that a large part of the billions of dollars
moved through the bank was controlled by Russian officials
protecting their fortunes by shipping their money abroad before
Russian markets collapsed last year.
</P>
<P>
   In in his first interview since the money laundering
investigation became public last week, the industrialist, Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, said by telephone from Moscow that many Russian
officials began selling government securities in 1998 because they
had inside knowledge about government deliberations in the months
leading to a decision to permit the devaluation of the ruble. That
move occurred in August 1998, and caused the Russian economy, and
the value of government debt, to spiral sharply downward.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sold securities before the devaluation would have
been able to get out of the market while the securities' value was
still relatively high, locking in profits on the high-flying bonds
just before they fell to earth. Khodorkovsky said he believed that
Russian officials did just that, shipping their profits abroad
through a front company and into the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, of course, has a vested interest in this theory.
He believes that Russian investigators, who he said have yet to
make contact with him, are poised to re-examine his business
dealings in light of the money laundering inquiry. By pointing his
finger at the investigators' current and former bosses,
Khodorkovsky seemed to be warning Russian leaders that they too may
be dragged into the wide-ranging investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, federal investigators believe that the amount of money
moved through the Bank of New York _ at least $4.2 billion and
possibly as much as $10 billion _ was so large that Russian
organized crime figures linked to the investigation could be
directly responsible for only a small part of it. Investigators say
it is very likely that the bulk of the money that flowed through
the bank is tied to corporate embezzlement and political graft in
Russia. And Russia's securities markets, marred by rampant insider
trading, have long been considered easy for public officials in
Russia to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York confirmed last week that it is cooperating
with an investigation of what federal authorities describe as the
biggest money laundering inquiry in history. The bank has not been
charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky, 35, is the chairman of Yukos, one of Russia's
largest oil companies, and was the chairman of Menatep, a now
insolvent Russian bank. Federal investigators are examining
Menatep's relationship with the Bank of New York because the two
banks did business together.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators' interest is heightened because Natasha
Kagalovsky, a Bank of New York executive suspended until the
investigation is complete, is married to Konstantin Kagalovsky, who
is the vice chairman of Yukos and was also vice chairman of
Menatep. The Kagalovskys have not been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kagalovskys ``wish to state unequivocally that they have
never been involved in money laundering in any way, shape or
form,'' the couple's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said in a statement.
``Nor do they have any knowledge of such activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin's statement was prompted, it said, by ``unfair press
coverage'' based on ``innuendo, rumors, selective and irresponsible
leaks from U.S. governmental sources and disingenuous
`guilt-by-association' assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky called a reporter directly Friday to offer his
theory on what was behind the money laundering scandal and to
defend his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menatep never in its history has done any money laundering,''
he said through an interpreter. ``Menatep has undergone
investigations by many commissions on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said the money laundering investigation at the
Bank of New York was significant. ``The investigation that is under
way in the U.S. appears to be of great importance,'' he said.
``Because if the investigation is carried out competently, we will
see that Russian criminals will be caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky said that Russian organized crime figures were
undoubtedly tied to the scandal, and that he believed, as has been
reported, that Semion Mogilevich, a reputed head of Russian
organized crime, is involved in the matter. Investigators say
Mogilevich used a company called Benex to launder funds through the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky declined to speculate on other organized crime
figures he believed to be involved in the scheme, saying he feared
for his safety, but he enthusiastically offered his view that
political insiders in Russia had actively shipped their own
ill-gotten gains through the Benex pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The chronology of events surrounding the money laundering
investigation adds some credibility to this view. In early 1998,
just as Russia's economy began to show serious signs of strain,
funds started moving through the Benex accounts at the Bank of New
York. Activity in the accounts is believed to have been
particularly heavy starting in the fall of 1998, shortly after the
Russian ruble was devalued, setting off a financial crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that such huge money over such a short period of
time could only be generated by that operation,'' Khodorkovsky
said, referring to his theory that Russian government officials
took advantage of inside knowledge about the country's financial
crisis and shipped bond gains abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. intelligence officials believe that many commercial
banks in Russia also began shipping money out of the country
shortly after the ruble was devalued, when a 90-day debt moratorium
imposed by the Russian government gave the banks an opportunity to
avoid paying debts by stashing their cash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Khodorkovsky was privy to an exclusive meeting in Russia's
presidential offices attended by a handful of powerful Russian
financiers the weekend before the ruble was devalued. The group
successfully pushed for the moratorium, although Khodorkovsky said
Friday that he had not taken advantage of his position as an
insider.
</P>
<P>
   News reports about the money laundering investigation at the
Bank of New York have offered a variety of other theories about
where the money came from in Russia. The International Monetary
Fund and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday that
neither agency had evidence to support one of those notions _ that
their aid to Russia had been misappropriated by mobsters. But the
IMF conceded Friday that it had badly misjudged how challenging it
was to lend and track billions of dollars in corruption-plagued
countries like Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether IMF loans to Russia were illegally diverted
was extensively investigated earlier this year with no evidence
found then that indicated misappropriation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who said this week that he would
hold hearings in mid-September examining the threat of money
laundering and, in particular, the Bank of New York case, said
Friday that further IMF loans to Russia should be halted until
steps are taken to ensure that the money is not diverted.

   GREENSPAN SAYS STOCKS INFLUENCE INFLATION TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the
booming stock market now played an increasingly significant role in
the Fed's discussions of inflation. But he stopped well short of
calling the market overvalued. ``We no longer have the luxury to
look primarily to the flow of goods and services,'' when making
decisions about interest rates, he said. The traditional view was
that the economy drove the market. Now the opposite is more and
more the case.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK AND BOND MARKETS DECLINE
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell as some investors interpreted the Federal
Reserve chairman's remarks as a warning that shares may be
overvalued. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.28 points, to
11,090.17. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 13.74
points, to 1,348.27, while the Nasdaq composite index slid 15.72
points, to 2,758.90. The Nasdaq stock market said that beginning
Oct. 1 it would make its trade reporting and quotation systems
available to organizations that intend to offer after-hours
trading.

   The FCC, over the objections of civil libertarians, announced
technical standards for cellular phones that will give law
enforcement agents expanded ability to monitor conversations and
find criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL INCOMES AND SPENDING UP
</P>
<P>
   Personal incomes grew two-tenths of a percent in July. It was
the seventh consecutive rise and enabled consumer spending to grow
four-tenths of a percent, pushing the economy toward its longest
expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
   MEDTRONIC TO BUY XOMED SURGICAL
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic, which is known for its cardiac-rhythm management
products and is seeking to become the dominant maker of medical

Products, the leader in ear, nose and throat surgical products.
</P>
<P>
   MERRILL LYNCH STRATEGIST IS LEAVING
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch said that its chief investment strategist, Charles
Clough, would leave the firm at year's end. During the recent bull
market, he has favored a conservative strategy that has not been
popular with many brokers. Nevertheless, the firm said it had
wanted him to stay but he was leaving to spend more time with his
family and help not-for-profit organizations.

<P>
   TRIAL ALLOWED FOR DIET-DRUG SUIT
</P>
<P>

BUSH BACKS SOME GUN-CONTROL MEASURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday he
supports efforts to raise the age for purchasing firearms, and he
repeated his support for background checks at gun shows and a ban
on some ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are being considered in the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks to reporters brought an immediate response from
Democrats, who have criticized Bush as soft on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush has spent his political career backing the
National Rifle Association and not the American people when it
comes to gun safety. You know the election cycle has begun when
Bush tries to hide his real record with tempered rhetoric,'' said
Democratic National Committee chair Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   A measure that would have allowed instant background check at
gun shows in Texas failed in the Legislature this session. Bush
signed into law a measure prohibiting Texas cities from suing gun
manufacturers, and he has held that mandatory child safety locks on
firearms is too impractical to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, said the challenge is to meld rights guaranteed
under the Second Amendment with ``reasonable methods of keeping
guns out of the hands of those who should not have them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are problems everywhere when people illegally
use guns,'' Bush said. ``So the first step, we must ask, is it
possible to have reasonable laws to keep the guns out of the hands
of people who shouldn't have them through background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising the age for gun ownership from 18 to 21, instant
background checks and bans on certain large ammunition clips are
reasonable measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as he wrapped up a three-day presidential
campaign swing through the South, plumping his already healthy
campaign coffers and stumping for support on issues such as
government support of faith-based service organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The $250,000 he raised at a $1,000-a-plate luncheon at a posh
Atlanta hotel came on the heels of a brief stop he made to a
homeless shelter in suburban Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   He said the homeless shelter and other programs run by
Ministries United for Services and Training exemplify his belief
that government should develop ways of encouraging churches,
synagogues, mosques, private business and individuals to help
provide social services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The MUST program has been providing temporary housing, substance
abuse counseling and meals for needy residents of a four-county
area for 28 years. Nearly 75 percent of its $1.1 million annual
budget comes from businesses and individual donations; the
remainder comes from government and private grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's important for government to welcome
organizations motivated by faith and love, (offering) compassionate
help for those who need help,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also has supported the idea of government
working with faith-based organizations to provide social services
to the poor so long as participants in such programs are not
required to participate in religious services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the focus of such programs ought to be on whether they
meet their goals and not how they go about achieving them. He has
proposed encouraging more programs like MUST through tax breaks and
other incentives that government could offer to encourage greater
private involvement in meeting the social needs of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ended his trip Friday with a fund-raiser at Plantation,
Ga., the sixth such event the Republican front-runner held this
week.

NORTHEAST SUGGESTS LESS-STRINGENT RULE FOR POLLUTION FROM OTHER
REGIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After years of battling over smokestack pollution
from the Midwest and the South, 11 states in the Northeastern
region , led by New York, have signaled for the first time a
willingness to retreat significantly from their demands that other
states reduce their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted in the wake of legal setbacks, a proposal by negotiators
for the 11 Northeastern states to settle the dispute would accept
emissions of nitrogen oxides, a key class of pollutants by
Midwestern and Southern industry, at a rate 67 percent higher than
the Northeast has demanded until now.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the 11
Northeastern states _ Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Maryland _ had been negotiating methods of meeting the
criteria of the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The less stringent standard, introduced by negotiators for the
Northeastern states Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, would
still mean a significant drop in nitrogen oxides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an option that all the states agreed to take back
and discuss,'' said New York Environmental Conservation
Commissioner John Cahill, who represents the state in the talks. He
described it as ``something that was worked on by all the states of
the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials of other states involved in the talks, along with
environmentalists who closely follow them, said it was the
administration of New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, that
had taken the lead in crafting the new stance. They said it was not
clear whether the other 10 Northeastern states involved in the
struggle would officially accept the proposal, but New York's
position carries great weight, and Cahill has acted as the region's
lead negotiator in the talks with 14 states in the Midwest and
South.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are furious at the apparent retreat. ``Anyone
concerned with clean air and health would have huge reason to be
outraged by this,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental
health for the American Lung Association of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   But Cahill suggested that a deal with the other regions may be
the best that the Northeastern states can attain, although he
insisted that the Northeast has not given up hope that its original
position might prevail. The EPA, which has supported the
Northeast's position, had been moving to impose the more stringent
standard on the other regions, but after two recent setbacks in
court, the EPA has pressed states on both sides to reach a
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists and state officials saw politics behind
the shift. ``A negotiated deal is a big group hug among all these
Republican governors,'' said a top environmental official with one
of the Northeastern states, who asked that his name and the name of
his state not be used. He noted that Pataki, who would like to be
considered for his party's vice presidential nomination, ``would
get a lot of the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that as Pataki tries to enhance his
stature within the national Republican Party, it cannot help him to
be involved with an intramural dispute with other Republican
governors, particularly when his pro-environment stance can be
portrayed as anti-business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that New York and the Northeastern
states still have an important weapon left in their arsenal: they
can sue under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to force
action by the EPA and the other states.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, it would be New York's state attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer, a Democrat _ not the governor _ who decides the state's
position in litigation, and Spitzer might be able to pursue a
lawsuit on the emission standards even if Pataki is unwilling.
Officials in Spitzer's office declined to comment Friday on the
Northeastern states' new proposal, saying that they were still
studying it.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said, ``No one is taking any option off the table,''
including litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, EPA officials fear that if they try to impose
a tougher standard on the Midwest and South, rather than striking a
deal, the process will drag past the 2000 presidential election,
when there might be a Republican administration that could drop the
matter entirely. Environmentalists say that those same EPA
officials do not want a pitched regional dispute to hinder Vice
President Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern states have long complained that their high levels
of nitrogen oxides are largely attributable to industry,
particularly electric power plants, in the Midwest and South, a
claim supported by the EPA and by several independent studies. The
nitrogen oxides travel east and northeast on the prevailing winds,
and contribute to ozone and to acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All the major urban areas of the Northeast, especially New York
City and its suburbs, fail to meet the Clean Air Act standards for
ozone pollution, which burns the eyes, stings the lungs and can,
over time, contribute to serious health problems like asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, 11 Northeastern states have filed
petitions with the EPA, asking it to force industries in states to
the west and south to meet, by 2003, a standard of 0.15 pounds of
nitrogen oxide emissions for every million British thermal units of
fuel consumption in summer, when ozone pollution is at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeastern states have all agreed to move to the 0.15
standard, regardless of what other states do. That has raised fears
in the power industry, which is moving to more freewheeling
competition among power producers, that Northeastern power plants,
forced to adopt expensive emission controls, could be put at a
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the Midwestern and Southern states have proposed
a standard of 0.25 pounds, 67 percent higher. Under the proposal
made this week, the Northeastern states would accept that position,
at least at first, with a 0.25 standard by 2003, and a later
reduction to 0.2, 33 percent higher than their original demand.
That marked the first time the Northeast states have signaled that
they would accept anything less stringent than 0.15, and officials
with some of those states said they were not sure their states
could actually agree to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, where state rules are among the strictest in
the nation, many power plants and factories already operate within
the 0.15 standard. New York's Department of Environmental
Conservation estimates that the statewide average is about 0.2.
</P>
<P>
   In some Midwestern states, the average is two to three times as
high. Even the 0.25 standard would require many power plants and
factories in the South and the Midwest to install costly pollution
control devices, and the stricter the standard, the more expensive
it would be to meet.
</P>
<P>
   If all the regions cut output to 0.15, New York estimates,
summertime nitrogen oxide levels in the New York metropolitan
region would drop by about 80 percent. At 0.25, the decline would
be more than 65 percent _ significant, but not enough to get the
metropolitan area into compliance with federal ozone standards.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said last year that it would impose the 0.15 standard,
but several Midwestern states and utilities challenged that
decision in court. In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled that the EPA had to establish the merits
of its nitrogen oxide standards before it forced states to submit
plans for reduction of the compounds. An earlier ruling by the
court said the EPA had not justified its standards on ozone and
soot.
</P>
<P>
   Given the court's decision, Cahill said, the Northeastern states
may not be able to rely on the EPA. ``The uncertainty of the court
ruling certainly is giving all parties reason to pause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wooley, counsel to the Clean Air Task Force and a
professor of environmental law at Pace University, said Cahill's
fear is understandable but wrong. Like other environmentalists,
Wooley argued that a negotiated settlement could be unenforceable _
a worry that Cahill acknowledged might be well-founded. Wooley
would prefer going to court to seek an 0.15 standard.

BANK OF NEW YORK DISMISSES ONE TARGET OF MONEY-LAUNDERING
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-LAUNDER, RUSSIA-LAUNDER-POLITICS)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York said Friday that it dismissed a
vice president who is involved in a federal money laundering
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank officer, Lucy Edwards, was fired for ``gross
misconduct,'' violating the bank's code of conduct, falsification
of bank records, and failure to cooperate with the investigation,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   A bank spokesman declined to provide any details. People with
direct knowledge of the investigation said this week that documents
found in Ms. Edwards' London home indicated that she used the Bank
of New York name for dealings unrelated to her job at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's action against Ms. Edwards, 41, who was in charge of
the Eastern European division in the bank's London office, suggests
that the bank found her to bear some responsibility for the alleged
money laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   But her dismissal leaves open the question of the bank's own
responsibility for how such a large-scale operation could have gone
on for more than a year without the knowledge of senior bank
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, who lived in Queens, New York before moving to
London a few years ago, had been placed on leave, with pay, on
August 19, a few hours after The New York Times called the bank
about the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Her supervisor, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, was also placed on
leave at the time, and the bank has taken no further actions
against her, officials close to the investigation said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband Konstantin ``wish to state
unequivocally that they have never been involved in money
laundering in any way, shape or form,'' said aa statement issued by
the couple's lawyer, Stanley Arkin. ``Nor do they have any
knowledge of such activity.'' Ms. Kagalovsky has declined comment
but Friday in Moscow a business newspaper published an extensive
interview with Mr. Kagalovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have seized documents which show that $4.2 billion
passed through the accounts at the bank, which were in the name of
a company controlled by Ms. Edwards' husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards vouched for Berlin when he opened the accounts, in
the name of a company called Benex, but the bank was not aware that
he was her husband, according to persons close to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards and Berlin have not been seen by their neighbors in
their West London neighborhood since the scandal broke a week ago,
and could not be located.
</P>
<P>
   When Berlin registered Benex Worldwide Ltd. in Britain last
year, he gave his address as Narrowsburg, N.Y. Public records show
that Berlin and Ms. Edwards own property there.
</P>
<P>
   Benex was a trading company, which was set up principally to
move funds from Russia to other places around the world, according
to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   American and British investigators have linked Berlin to Semion
Mogilevich, who American and British authorities say is one of the
major organized crime leaders in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that Mogilevich is a master at laundering his
money, which officials say comes from prostitution, drug running,
arms trafficking and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to find Mogilevich have been unsuccessful, even for
Western law enforcement agencies in recent weeks. In an interview
with a Hungarian newspaper in June, he denied that he was engaged
in any illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they do not believe that all of the billions
of dollars that passed through the Benex accounts at the Bank of
New York came from Mogilevich. They also believe that the accounts
were used to disguise money that Russian politicians and
businessmen wanted to get out of the country without disclosing the
money's source or destination.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards was born in Leningrad in 1958, as Ludmilla Pritzker,
according to a relative. When she was 19, she met an American
merchant seaman, and they moved to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, she and her husband separated, and she moved to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   She went to work for the bank in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She was well regarded by bank officials and competitors, for her
ability to bring in Russian business. An officer at another bank,
who often saw her in Russia, described her as ``professional'' and
``spunky.'' She was also, apparently, an expert on money
laundering. In June, she was a featured speaker at a conference in
Riga, Latvia. Her topic was ``money laundering _ latest
developments and regulations.''

<P>
   BC-OBIT-BANWELL-NYT (moved on Monday, Aug. 23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Tex Banwell, sent by the New York Times News
Service on Monday, Aug. 23, referred incompletely to the failed
Allied offensive in the Netherlands in September 1944. While
American forces probably contributed to the disaster by their
inability to reach their objectives on schedule, they were not the
sole cause of the failure. Also, it was not just Mr. Banwell and
several other paratroopers who were dropped near Arnhem; it was a
division of British paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
   The obituary also misspelled the name of the county in England
where Mr. Banwell's children live. It is Hertfordshire, not
Hartfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   BC-HONGKONG-SAILORS-NYT (moved on Wednesday, Aug. 25)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Aug.
25, about merchants who are feeling the effect of China's decision
to bar United States Navy ships from Hong Kong misspelled the given
name of the lead character in a 1960 movie about the port. She was
Suzie Wong, not Suzy.
</P>
<P>
   BC-OBIT-JOHNSON-NYT (moved on Friday, July 23)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Frank M. Johnson Jr. sent by the New York Times
News Service on Friday, July 23, misstated the sequence of events
in a face-off with Governor George C. Wallace in 1965. Judge
Johnson's order permitting a civil rights march came before
President Lyndon B. Johnson federalized the National Guard, not
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The article also referred incorrectly to Birmingham-Southern
College, which Judge Johnson attended before the University of
Alabama. It is private, not a state college.
</P>
<P>
   The obituary also misstated the source of J. Skelly Wright's
judicial appointment. A Democrat, he was a Truman appointee, not
one of several judges backed by Herbert Brownell, who was President
Eisenhower's Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   BC-HEALTHCARE-ECONSCENE-NYT (moved on Wednesday, Aug 18)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Aug 18,
about the grading of health care plans by the National Committee
for Quality Assurance included an erroneous report from the
committee about the kinds of inoculations received by patients in
the Kaiser Permanente plan in Denver and the Cigna plan in
Cleveland. The Kaiser plan provided a booster shot for measles,
mumps and rubella, three hepatitis B vaccinations and one chicken
pox vaccination to about 50 percent of its patients by age 13; the
figure for the Cigna plan was less than 1 percent. The figures did
not refer solely to shots for measles, mumps and rubella.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-MUSICALS (New York) _ A handful of recording executives
seem determined to preserve the sound of American musical theater _
even in its lean years, and without necessarily making a sizable
profit. In musical terms, they want the song to continue, and they
want the public to hear it. By Barry Singer.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-THEATER (London) _ Whatever else one thinks of that mix
of humidity, pelting rain, heat, chill and solar eclipse that has
been styling itself the English summer this year, one must admit it
has coincided with plenty of startling and disturbing theatrical
images. Here is an 80-year-old Jewish widow, her pliant, humorous
face icing over as she remembers the murder of her child during the
Holocaust. Here is the ultra-outrageous comedian Lenny Bruce,
babbling and dementedly muttering into his mike as drugs and
paranoia seep through his brain and onto his tongue. And here are
two Cleopatras, one of them played by a male actor, both wigless
and almost hairless as they prepare for death. By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THARP-BROWN-DANCE (Undated) _ Two wonderful surprises danced
their way across stages this summer. The choreographers of both
took what seemed like foolhardy risks. Yet, instead of plummeting
into catastrophe, both Twyla Tharp and Trisha Brown managed to soar
creatively. Ms. Brown, in fact, even levitated a dancer. Ms. Tharp
wrestled with Beethoven, and she and Beethoven both emerged with
honor. By Jack Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-CUBA (Undated) _ One of the best bands to emerge in Cuba
in the 1960s was a doo-wop group called Los Zafiros (the
Sapphires). Leoncio (Kike) Morua, Miguel (Miguelito) Cancio,
Ignacio Elejalde and Eduardo Elio (El Chino) Hernandez were
handsome, nattily dressed young singers from Cayo Hueso, a barrio
of Havana. Among its admirers were the Beatles, who stuck around
for another week in Paris in 1965 to hear the group at the Olympia
theater. Because of U.S.-Cuban hostilities, however, this splendid
confection of American and Latin pop _ call it nuevo doo-wop _ was
seldom heard outside of places like Poland and East Germany.
``Bossa Cubana,'' a compilation of the band's best work from the
1960s, provides a glimpse of an island obscured by political
sermonizing on both sides of the divide. By Adam Shatz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-COMPOSER-RODRIGO (Undated) _ Although centenary
celebrations are common in music, the subject is seldom alive to
participate. The Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo came closer than
most to celebrating his 100th birthday, when he died last month.
Rodrigo triumphed against remarkable odds. Afflicted with
diphtheria at 3, he lost his sight and nearly his life. He suffered
great penury abroad during the Spanish Civil War. Yet he went on to
produce a large body of music for a great variety of media,
garnering more prizes and honors than any other Spanish composer in
history _ even the title Marquis of the Gardens of Aranjuez _ and
achieving a worldwide popularity that far transcends the field of
classical music. By Pablo Zinger.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-MOZART (Undated) _ A few pinholes in an old musical score
_ and a Canadian musicologist's passion for the chaotic world of
18th-century opera _ have led to the discovery of what appears to
be a long lost recitative by Mozart. Dorothea Link, a specialist in
the operas of Mozart and his contemporaries, came across the
setting for strings and voice, 35 bars long, in the Austrian
National Library in Vienna a few months ago. The recitative
precedes the well-known aria ``Vado, ma dove?'' (K. 583), which
Mozart wrote for the singer Luisa Villeneuve. Although the
recitative is not in Mozart's hand, all the evidence points to his
authorship. By Tamara Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART/ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BILBAO-GUGGENHEIM-SCULPTURE (Bilbao) _ The most impressive
exhibition of contemporary sculpture in a decade, or maybe more, is
the show of Richard Serra's ``Torqued Ellipses'' here at the
Guggenheim. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-SERRA-GEHRY (Undated) _ Perhaps the sculptor
Richard Serra should not have been surprised when he recently spied
a woman who, thinking she was alone, danced through one of his
``Torqued Ellipses'' at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. His
rounded, listing, walk-in steel sculptures and the long arched
gallery of the architect Frank Gehry glide and curve together in a
pas de deux of balletic grace. Clearly she was inspired. The dance
between Serra's sculpture and Gehry's architecture is not simply
serendipitous. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE-BRASSERIE (New York) _ Last June, American
architecture took a giant step into the present with the
announcement that Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, two
architects who practice together in New York, had been awarded a
fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation. This is the first time
that the coveted award has been presented to architects. By Herbert
Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ADDICTION (Universal City, Calif.) _ ``The Pursuit of
Happiness: Smoking, Drinking and Drugging in the 20th Century,'' is
to have its premiere on the Showtime cable network on Sept. 13 as
part of ``In the 20th Century,'' a millennium-related series using
well-known directors to take on major subjects of their choosing.
It is a rare full-length examination of a topic that lends itself
easily to rousing slogans and pithy sound bites. By Andy Meisler.
</P>

   TRAVEL-PANAMA-CANAL (Undated) _ Panama's canal carries tourism

   BIZ-GENOMICS (Undated) _ It's time for the gene merchants to
deliver the goods. Before there was an Internet bubble, before
biotech left a bad taste in money managers' mouths, capital was
ventured and shares sold in a group of companies that aimed to
leapfrog the Human Genome Project. By sequencing, and patenting,
genes ahead of the publicly-funded genome centers, the companies
would control the next era of healthcare, and make their founders
and shareholders rich. But now, as the international quest to spell
out the precise sequence of the three billion letters in the human
genetic code speeds to the finish line, the race to commercialize
genomics has narrowed. By Lawrence Fisher.

<P>
   BIZ-CAR-PRICING (Undated) _ Friction between Merecedes and some
of its American dealers over pricing policy is turning nasty, with
the suing and countersuing between one Toms River, N.J., dealer and
Mercedes getting so acrimonious that the company used a court
maneuver to abruptly yank his franchise away. By Skip Kaltenheuser.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-ECON-COLUMN-WAGES (Undated) _ The 3,100 drivers at C.R.
England, Inc., a trucking company in Salt Lake City, got a big
raise this month, their first raise in nearly three years. They now
average about $35,000 a year. But it is not enough. Even their boss
says so. Most of the nation's 500,000 long-haul drivers are in the
same boat. Inflation has eaten at their pay, and the raises that
are just beginning to come through have not restored the buying
power that existed for these drivers in the late 1970s. The
re-engineering of the American economy started then and is still
having its effect today. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>

   INVEST-GENOMICS DNAA (Undated) _ Human Genomics stocks are on a

Fisher.

<P>
   INVEST-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ ``In the long run, we're all
dead,'' John Maynard Keynes once said. But many investors may want
to send a similar message to their value-oriented financial
advisers, who often admonish them to shun the high-priced stocks
that have led the market to new highs and, instead, to focus on
shares that are cheap on the basis of their fundamentals. By Mark
Hulbert.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-BRODY-PPM (Undated) _ Investing With Richard S. Brody,
who disproves the notion that consultants are better at giving
advice than doing the job. By Hillary Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-RENTAL-EQUIPMENT (Undated) _ It was just over a year ago
that investors were engaged in an industrial-sized obsession with
the stocks of equipment rental companies _ businesses that rent out
everything from bulldozers to 100-foot telescopic boom lifts to
generators and hand tools. Since then, however, these stocks have
turned earthbound. Yet there is much to recommend the sector. By
Sana Siwolop.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-STAR-TREATMENT (Undated) _ Three years ago, Marnie Lerner
and Cynde Cassel started Star Treatment, a company that created
whimsical, personalized gift baskets. Living in Los Angeles, it did
not take them long to find their niche: gifts for the stars. By
Barbara Whitaker.
</P>

   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ How to keep your techies from leaving
for other jobs. By Michelle Cottle.

   BIZ-IRAS-BENEFICIARY (Undated) _ Many Americans have large
portions of their assets in Individual Retirement Accounts _
especially people who have changed jobs or retired and rolled over
their pension plans. But if they should die before they can use
those savings, the money may not go to their chosen heirs. By Jan
Rosen.

   &UR; AUTOS &LR;

<P>
   ABOUTCARS-IMPALA (Undated) _ The Impala is back now, as a 2000
model intended to serve, once again, as Chevy's flagship. But this
is a different age for Chevrolet and its Impala, which cannot
pretend to be a prestige car now. By James G. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   CARSMART-OLD-IMPALAS (Undated) _ Mention ``Impala,'' and people
of a certain age get wistful. Add ``Super Sport'' and you're likely
to hear tales of youth misspent at the wheel, under the hood, in
the back seat. The memories are free, but parking a genuine old
Impala in the garage will cost you. By Paul Duchene.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STAND-ALONE GRAPHIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IN-MY-BRIEFCASE (Undated) _ Stand alone graphic: In My
Briefcase, with Ed Yardeni of Deutschebank. The chief economist and
global strategist for Deutsche Bank Securities, Edward Yardeni, is
a favorite Wall Street figure for technology skeptics these days.
After all, he has said that there is a 70 percent chance that Year
2000 computer problems will lead to a global recession. But as he
prepared for a recent two-day, four-city trip to address the bank's
West Coast clients, a look into his briefcase revealed that he is
the kind of consumer the computer industry loves. ``I always want
the latest and newest, and I want it compact,'' he said.
</P>

   &UR; STYLE ('L' Category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NUDITY-CHIC (Undated) _ Mark Hoppus, the singer and bassist of
Blink-182, says he has noted a marked increase in the amount of
female nudity in the audience at his concerts. He is not
complaining. Nudity is threatening to become mundane. By Frank
DeCaro.
</P>
<P>
   BEAUTY-JUNGLE (Undated) _ Most fashionable young editors at
places like Conde Nast and Hearst might be expected to wrinkle
their perfect noses at the thought of anyone _ much less themselves
_ hawking makeup on line. But how long can a girl sit back and
watch her college classmates, even the ones with no style at all,
make a killing on Internet IPO's? About as long as it takes mascara
to dry. This fall, more than a dozen well-financed Internet
start-ups will begin selling cosmetics directly to consumers on the
Web. Most of those sites will be shaped by former editors from the
top fashion and beauty magazines: places like Vogue, Elle and
Mirabella. By Nancy Hass.
</P>
<P>
   MOBSTER-CONSULTANT (New York) _ ``Here's where we shot `The Pope
of Greenwich Village,''' said Rocco Musacchia, a man whose stocky
build, dapper bearing and silk sports-jacket elicited gapes from
tourists at the sidewalk tables along Mulberry Street, in Little
Italy. ``Down the block, we shot `Mickey Blue Eyes,''' he
continued. ``And right over there we shot `Donnie Brasco.'''
Musacchia is a technical adviser for movie-location work. He was
talking about some of the films that he has worked on, and also
about certain New York City locations associated in both cinematic
legend and real life with the Mafia _ an organization he does not
concede exists. By Joe Sharkey.

<P>
   NY-SILICON-ALLEY (New York) _ Oh, to be young and wired in New
York _ and not just for the lavish parties. New York'sSilicon
Alley, the digital neighborhood that is home to some of the
Internet's leading design concerns and Web sites, has long been in
the shadow of its software and hardware producing rivals out West.
But in the last year, there have been more IPO's here than anywhere
else in the country, as well as big media buyouts and a wave of
investment and media coverage. By Anthony Lappe.

</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-LL-COOL (New York) _ Born James Todd Smith in Queens, LL
Cool J once boasted in song about having gone ``from Hollis to
Hollywood.'' On Tuesday night, he slipped unannounced into the
Loews 84th Street theater to watch his latest film, ``In Too
Deep,'' with what he called a ``real crowd,'' not the movie
industry insiders of Los Angeles. By Douglas Century.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ When they aren't complaining about the
weather, gardeners often like to whine about what awful things the
hybridizers have done to this or that venerable plant to make it
dwarfer or bushier or possessed of a color that does not exist
outside a child's crayon box. By Cass Peterson.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the through-the-looking-glass world of Russian
society, a high-flying businessman's emergence in a money
laundering investigation in the United States has not ruined his
career. It has made him a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russia's leading business newspaper printed a
sympathetic interview in which Konstantin Kagalovsky spoke tenderly
of his wife, an executive at the Bank of New York who has been
suspended in connection with the case, and discussed how the
allegations had complicated their life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia we are prepared for anything,'' Kagalovsky said.
``But for her the situation is very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows more about corruption than the average Russian.
Most citizens believe that their tax dollars are diverted into the
pockets of politicians. And an overwhleming percentage of Russians
believe that it is difficult if not impossible to run a business
without paying bribes.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal investigation of huge sums of money channeled
through the Bank of New York has produced more amusement than
outrage here.
</P>
<P>
   Russians resent their image in the West as gun-toting mafiosi.
And in a nation where newspaper articles are often little more than
paid political advertisements, the avalanche of Western news
reports in the last week about the scandal is seen by many as part
of an orchestrated intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is a Republican plot to punish Vice President Al
Gore for his close ties to Moscow. Others say the goal is to force
an end to Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dirty politics and dirty business,'' the newspaper
Izvestia said. ``We took billions of dollars out of our country.
But 150 million Russian people do not deserve to be used in
somebody's political game.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some of Russia's power brokers have played the game
as well. Noviye Izvestia, a newspaper controlled by Moscow tycoon
Boris A. Berezovsky, has sought to link the money laundering to
Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor and a possible presidential hopeful
who happens to be a bitter opponent of the financier.
</P>
<P>
   Moskovsky Komsomolets, a newspaper that supports the mayor, has
returned the favor by trying to link Berezovsky to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russia's prosecutor has promised to cooperate with
the United States and carefully review the allegations. ``We will
open a criminal case if crimes are uncovered that involve Russian
nationals or companies,'' said the acting prosecutor general,
Vladimir Ustinov.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky, for his part, denounced the allegations against him
as part of an ``an anti-Russia campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a political undercurrent to it,'' he said in his
interview with Kommersant, another Berezovsky-controlled newspaper.
``The papers indulge in cheap speculations about the new Russians,
how they live, what cars they drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kommersant interviewer listened sympathetically. But the
paper seemed to be more interested in examining the lifestyles of
the rich and famous than in trying to probe the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kagalovsky's account was uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky, once Russia's representative to the International
Monetary Fund, has been widely portrayed as a reformer who sold out
his ideals to make his fortune at Russia's Menatep bank. But Friday
Kagalovsky cast himself in the interview as a romantic, recalling
how he first met his wife, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, near the
monetary fund's headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking to my office and saw a friend of mine speaking
with a charming woman,'' he said. ``I walked up as if I wanted to
talk to this friend. Then he disappeared and we were left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, it seems, was fate.
</P>
<P>
   The couple married in New York in 1994. Soon after, Kagalovsky
returned to Moscow to take up a career as a banker at Menatep. Ms.
Kagalovsky stayed behind to pursue her own banking career at the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said Ms. Kagalovsky had played the lead role in
steering Russian funds to her bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her bank was the most aggressive in Russia,'' Kagalovsky
recalled. ``Natasha should be given credit for the fact that the
bank was one of the first on Russia's market.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Kagalovsky tell it, the list of her contacts included
the top financiers in Russia _ men like Mikhail Khodorkovsky of
Menatep and Vladimir Vinogradov of Inkombank. But he insisted that
she had no dealings with Semion Mogilevich, the Ukrainian-born
reputed crime boss who investigators believe may have helped funnel
money into the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Kagalovskys' lawyer, Stanley Arkin in New
York, said Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband ``wish to state
unequivocally that they have never been involved in money
laundering in any way, shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor do they have any knowledge of such activity,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky spoke of his lonely nights in Moscow as he pondered
how he, his wife and their young son might spent more time
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I have passed the age when it is good to live
in different countries than your wife,'' he said. ``Of course I
would like to live together with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky had planned to shift her work to London from New
York so that the family could be together more often. Then the
scandal broke in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky said he had discovered the first report on the
scandal as he was reading The New York Times on the Internet. A
considerate husband, he waited until his wife woke up in New York
before alerting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was followed by four more stories,'' he complained. ``Even
John Lennon did not get that much coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky said his wife still planned to move to London, even
if it meant that she had to find another job. She has been
suspended from her post as director of the Eastern European
division at the Bank of New York pending the outcome of the federal
investigation. He said she still was drawing her salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will come out all right in the end?'' the interviewer
from Kommersant suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Kagalovsky replied.

 Autodesk to Lay Off 10 Percent of Workforce
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein and Steve Ginsberg &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Autodesk Inc., the struggling maker of design software for
architects and engineers, said yesterday that it would lay off 10
percent of its workforce, or about 350 employees, after a
disastrous second-quarter in which net income all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk in San Rafael reported net income of $389,000 (1 cent a
share), down from $27.5 million (46 cents) in the same period last
year. Total revenue for the quarter was $202.9 million, compared
with $226.8 million for the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk chief executive Carol Bartz blamed the dismal results
on a failure to get products out the door in a timely manner. She
also said the company was caught off guard as customers shifted
their focus from packaged software to tools to help them beef up
their Web presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our software applications took a back seat as companies
focused their spending on building up their Web infrastructure,''
said Bartz.
</P>
<P>
   Bartz said the layoffs will cut across all divisions, including
salespeople, engineers and administrative workers.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs are a tough pill to swallow in a corporate culture
that nurtures its people to the point of allowing them to bring
their pets to work. Of the 350 getting pink slips, 147 work at the
company's headquarters in Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moon, president of Gistix, a Larkspur technology
consultant and think tank, said Autodesk has been hammered by
Visio, a major rival, and has been having problems adapting its
software to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, who has followed the company for a decade, said, ``
Autodesk has completely missed the Web. They didn't webify their
two biggest products _ Autocad and 3D Studio. They had no
e-commerce strategy for selling into their installed base.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon said Autodesk was also the victim of changing global trends
in the engineering business that have resulted in massive
consolidation that has shrunk the number of architecture and
engineering firms who are Autodesk's top clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the big engineering firms today outsource the design
work to companies offshore and many of them either use old versions
of Autodesk products or pirated versions,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk's layoffs follow a string of recent job cuts in the Bay
Area. Earlier this week, San Jose's Komag, which makes computer
disks, said it would eliminate 480 jobs and virtually shift all
manufacturing operations to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Raychem, an electronics component manufacturer in Menlo Park,
announced plans on Tuesday to trim 646 positions in the Bay Area.
And Quantum said last week that it would cut 600 positions in
Milpitas.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk announced its layoffs after the end of trading
yesterday. Its stock rose $2.69 yesterday to finish at $24.81.

<HEADLINE>
BUSH CALLS 2 GUN-CONTROL MEASURES `REASONABLE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (See also BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Winding up a campaign fund-raising trip in a region
stunned by recent bloodshed, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said in
Georgia Friday that he supported two gun-control measures that have
been proposed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would outlaw the imports of certain high-capacity
ammunition clips and raise the legal age to 21, from 18, for
handgun purchases. ``Those are reasonable measures,'' the governor
said in a brief question-and-answer session with journalists in
Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor, who is seeking the Republican nomination
for president, said Bush's stance on those measures does not
represent new thinking on gun control, which he generally opposes.
Rather, the aides said, Bush was simply articulating views on
specific issues that he had never been asked about before.
</P>
<P>
   As if to reinforce the impression that his views on
high-ammunition clips and age requirements do not signal a
wholesale shift in his philosophy, Bush said, ``I believe innocent
people, law-abiding citizens, ought to be allowed to own a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to
carry guns, and last spring he signed a law passed by the state
Legislature that bars cities in the state from suing the gun
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has been a heated issue in American society and
politics in recent months, following several bloody incidents
across the country. Three of them occurred in Georgia. On July 29,
a securities day-trader shot and killed nine people, then himself,
in Atlanta. On July 12, a gunman in Atlanta killed two women and
four children before taking his own life. And on May 20, a
15-year-old boy opened fire at his school in Conyers, Ga., wounding
six classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The measures Bush backed Friday enjoy considerable support among
Republicans as well as Democrats. In May, the Senate endorsed
several gun-control measures, including curbs on importing
high-capacity ammunition clips, although it took no action on the
age-ownership issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the House was unable to agree on gun control, in part
because conservative lawmakers found some of the measures too
restrictive and liberal lawmakers found some too lenient. The issue
is certain to be resurrected when Congress returns from recess in
September and Senate and House negotiators determine what they can
agree on.
</P>
<P>
   On an issue that divides Republicans and Democrats, requiring
all vendors at gun shows to conduct background checks of
prospective buyers, Bush has taken his party's position.
Republicans generally favor a rule that such checks be completed
within 24 hours; Democrats would allow three business days.
Federally licensed dealers at gun shows must now do background
checks, and they have three business days to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also sought Friday to differentiate his and Vice
President Al Gore's positions on government aid to religious-based
organizations that do social-service work.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has
said he opposes any proselytizing by such organizations. Bush said
that, while government should aid the programs rather than the
churches or synagogues that run them, ``we ought to understand the
power of the message'' of the institutions.

 Gun Sales in California Up 30 Percent Over Last Year
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By David Lazarus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dale Lete aimed carefully and squeezed off multiple shots from
his intimidating AR-15 assault rifle. Each made a crisp, clean hole
in the paper target.
</P>
<P>
   After practicing for an hour at the Jackson Arms shooting range
in South San Francisco, Lete, a behavioral therapist, packed his
gear and prepared to return to his job in Palo Alto working with
disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own children and I have a wife,'' he said. ``If push
ever came to shove, I'd want to defend them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lete is not alone. Numerous other Bay Area residents, from
white-collar professionals to newly prosperous homeowners and
techies from Silicon Valley, are quietly joining the ranks of gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of declining handgun sales and relatively flat
rifle sales, firearms purchases in California are currently running
30 percent ahead of last year at this time, according to the state
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, business is booming at shooting ranges and gun
shops. The Bullseye shooting range in San Rafael, for example,
reports that revenues to date are up 50 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the surge in gun-related activity is
legislative. Many gun enthusiasts are rushing to buy weapons
because a number of firearms-related measures take effect on
January 1, including a statewide ban on certain types of assault
weapons and a limit on handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is fear. With the accumulation of silicon-spawned
wealth in the region, concerns have grown among many residents that
they may have to defend themselves or their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are buying guns,'' said Ron Satterlee, a
former Marine Corps marksmanship instructor who now runs Jackson
Arms, the closest shooting range to downtown San Francisco. ``I'm
talking families _ husbands and wives. People don't feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason, some might say. From tourists being slain in
Yosemite and shots being fired in a Los Angeles community center to
a failed stock trader running amok in Atlanta, there has been no
shortage of horror in recent headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Yosemite thing, I sold more handguns to women than
ever before,'' Satterlee noted.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Nickell, who manages a pet-supply shop in Daly City,
bought her first firearm, a soon-to-be-banned assault rifle, a
couple of months ago, after being introduced to target shooting by
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's invigorating,'' she said. ``I have more confidence in
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be surprised,'' said Mark Baradat, manager of
Marin's Bullseye. ``There's a lot of people who own firearms in the
Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jackson Arms and Bullseye draw about 50 patrons on weekdays
and more than 100 on Saturdays and Sundays. Shooting classes are
usually full and frequently booked weeks in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is nearly as high at a dozen other shooting ranges
contacted in other parts of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, a looming dread that chaos will erupt at
midnight on New Year's Eve as global computer networks crash _ a
concern most experts believe to be highly exaggerated _ is reason
enough to go out and buy a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard that Y2K has been a real factor in gun sales this
year,'' said Mike Van Winkle, a spokesman for the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Total handgun sales in California fell to 181,421 last year from
195,338 a year before, according to department records. Rifle sales
increased slightly to 153,059 from 150,727.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, sales of virtually all types of firearms are
going through the roof. ``Some dealers tell us that they're up 20
or 30 percent, some say 50 percent,'' Van Winkle said.
</P>
<P>
   At Jackson Arms, Satterlee said he is expecting to do $1.5
million in business this year, up more than 50 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a factor of watching all the criminal activity on the
news and deciding you're not going to be a victim,'' explained Herb
Williams, a Petaluma resident and head of the California Rifle and
Pistol Association, the state affiliate of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down to it,'' he said, ``gun owners would rather
be judged by a jury of 12 peers than be carried by 12 pall
bearers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. ``Fear generates a lot of these sales,''
observed Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Educational Fund
to End Handgun Violence, in Washington, D.C. ``But a gun makes a
home much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies show that a gun in the home makes it three times more
likely to have a homicide and five times more likely to have a
suicide,'' he said. ``If you bring a gun into your home, you are
putting your family at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mark Kalina, a San Francisco computer game
designer and recent law school graduate, said he purchased a
.40-caliber handgun for the peace of mind it offered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that if I ever did need a gun, I'd be glad to have
it,'' he said. ``It's not about safety. It's about having the
ability to defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lete, who considers himself to be ``mellow and laid-back,''
an interest in firearms stems from having worked with a San Mateo
County gang intervention program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming more informed about gangs and the criminal element, I
saw that this was a growing and dangerous threat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Lete to purchase a .45-caliber revolver. At first,
his wife was upset at having a gun in a house with three children,
Lete said, but, ``She got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Practicing with his new weapon, Lete realized that he enjoyed
shooting. He relished the discipline and high level of
concentration required to hit the target. ``It's a modern martial
art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lete owns both the handgun and the AR-15, and tries to make
it to the shooting range at least once a month. ``It's turned into
a hobby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fairly expensive hobby. Annual membership at Jackson
Arms costs him $250 (nonmembers pay $10 an hour for a shooting
lane). A quality handgun can cost $600 or more, and a rifle will
typically run about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   On days when he does not bring his own  &LR; weapons with him to the
shooting range, Lete can rent a handgun for $8 to $15 an hour, or a
rifle for $10 to $15 an hour. Ammunition is extra.
</P>
<P>
   Gun rentals are especially popular with tourists, particularly
those from countries that do not allow gun ownership. ``I get
busloads of Japanese coming here,'' Jackson Arms' Satterlee said.
</P>
<P>
   Young tech-industry workers in Silicon Valley constitute a
growing presence at local shooting ranges. ``We have a lot of them
who come in and shoot on their lunch hours,'' said JoAnn Kritzer of
Target Masters in Milpitas.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tom Ebert, owner of Coyote Valley Sporting Clays in
Morgan Hill, said an increasing number of Silicon Valley denizens
are coming to his establishment to indulge in trap and skeet
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intrinsic thrill of intercepting an airborne target is
similar to the thrill of hitting a great golf shot,'' he said.
``It's also a social thing. The social aspect of it is equal to or
greater than the shooting aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Many high-tech types also head to National Shooting Club in
Santa Clara, billed on its Web site as ``the Bay Area's finest
indoor shooting facility.'' However, employees there have a blanket
response to all inquiries from reporters: ``We do not speak to the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Hamby, manager of the San Leandro Optimist Rifle and
Pistol Range, is not surprised that her colleagues across the bay
are so wary of media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you hear about gun owners in the press is either
middle of the road or negative,'' she said. ``There's never
anything positive. Nobody ever reports about incidents when a gun
saved someone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyd Cribbs, a San Francisco retiree, said he experienced just
such an incident. He said he was parked in a bad neighborhood one
night a few years ago waiting for his daughter to get off work. A
group of five men on the sidewalk took an interest in his new
Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men approached to take a closer look. Fearing the
worst, Cribbs flashed his handgun. ``You should have seen the
situation change,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it saved my life,'' he said. ``Against five of them,
I wouldn't have had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of Cribbs' five children now own guns as well. On family
outings, they frequently go to a shooting range.

Rite Aid Corp. may be unloading 250 of its slumping large-format

</P>
<P>
   Security analysts said Longs Drug Stores is among potential
buyers and has held discussions with the troubled Pennsylvania

</P>
<P>
   Neither Longs of Walnut Creek nor Rite Aid would confirm the

   Rite Aid said earlier this week that it is in transaction
discussions that would have a material effect on its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bosshard, an analyst with Midwest Research, said Longs
might be interested in snapping up to 50 Rite Aid units, leaving
other buyers to bid for other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Rite Aid's future has swirled this week, with
other chains mentioned as possible buyers. They include Safeway,
Eckerd Drug and JC Penney. Safeway didn't return phone calls
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid stock fell more than 6 percent yesterday, closing the
week at $20.06 and near its 52-week low of $17. Longs stock ended
the week at $30.88, down 13 cents for the week.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely Longs would swallow all the stores Rite Aide needs
to unload. Under President Steve Roath, Longs is expanding
conservatively, opening 19 stores this year and 25 next on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Longs' last acquisition was in 1998 when it picked up 20 Drug
Emporium stores in Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Longs has 110 stores but none in San Francisco,
where Rite Aid has 15. Longs does have stores in Daly City and
South San Francisco, but has most of its stores in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid is a household name on the East Coast but its ambitious
expansion efforts in the West has backfired. Fueled by the $2.4
billion acquisition of Thrifty/PayLess in 1996, Rite Aid now has
nearly 650 stores in California, but many of the stores have been
unproductive partially because they are four times larger than the
typical East Coast Rite Aid branches.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid CEO Martin Grass took the corporate reins from his
father several years ago and went on a costly acquisitions binge
that included PCS Health Systems Inc. in January. To pare debt, he
now needs to sell assets.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the Thrifty name was well established, but
Grass replaced it with Rite Aid and spent heavily to build brand
identity in a bid to take business away from Walgreen, an
entrenched powerhouse with 55 stores in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Walgreen spokesman Mike Polzin said his company's sales the past
two years have continued to grow despite Rite Aid's incursion. He
said Walgreen has no interest in acquiring Rite Aid's locations
here.

 Swamp Thing _ The pay isn't great but cleaning the alligator
pit  has its rewards 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By David Lazarus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ken Howell is a senior aquatic biologist at Steinhart Aquarium in
Golden Gate Park. He's also the guy who cleans the pennies out of
the alligator pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``An animal like this has the ability to hurt you very badly,''
Howell tells a visitor as the two stand in the middle of the
``swamp,'' which has been drained for its fortnightly cleaning. The
 &LR; Two alligators, not to mention eight large alligator snapping
turtles, watch with wary, unblinking eyes from a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with these,'' Howell continues, ``the first thing you
need to know is what they can do and what they can't do. Then you
need to know what they will do and what they won't do.''
</P>
<P>
   He leads his visitor around the side of the male, which is about
8 eight  &LR; feet long and weighs well over 200 pounds. ``Feel this,''
Howell says, stroking the creature's long, powerful tail.
</P>
<P>
   His visitor apprehensively obliges. It feels like an old
baseball mitt.
</P>
<P>
   Howell starts to explain the difference between an alligator's
coarse upper skin and the smoother skin on the belly. Suddenly he
glances around at the 61/2-foot female, which is starting to inch
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be sneaky,'' Howell says as he cautiously leads his
visitor away. His visitor, having read that an American alligator
Alligator  &LR; can outrun a horse over short distances, has no regrets
about climbing back over the railing.
</P>
<P>
   Howell, 43, has been at Steinhart for more than 10 years. Prior
to that, he spent about eight years at a zoo in Miami. Before that,
he did a stint at a place called Monkey Jungle in Florida. He is,
needless to say, an animal guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had animals around me all my life,'' he says as he picks
up a hose and begins spraying down the swamp. ``I've known since I
was a kid I'd be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not this exactly. One doesn't lay out a career path,
after all, to become the cleaner of an alligator pit, as well as
the keeper of assorted snakes, lizards, spiders and scorpions.
</P>
<P>
   But Howell brings both dedication and enthusiasm to his work,
plus the sense of confidence that comes with being good at
something most people wouldn't dream of doing.
</P>
<P>
   His only real beef is pulling down roughly $17 an hour in pay,
although he realizes that's what comes with working for a nonprofit
organization. And it's not like there are tons of other jobs out
there for a guy who knows his way around a king cobra.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me have very unmarketable skills,'' Howell
observes. ``I can't just step across the street to another
employer. Instead, I move 2,000 miles to the new opening. There are
many sacrifices that come with this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining. Watching Howell work, it's apparent
he's doing something he loves. Or close to it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps an eye on the alligators as he moves about the swamp.
The hose crosses the snout of the male, but he it  &LR; seems not to
notice, or care, as he it  &LR; lolls atop the island at the center of
the exhibit. The sneaky female remains on the concrete floor,
keeping Howell within view.
</P>
<P>
   The snapping turtles are a bigger problem. They keep getting in
the way, and Howell has to pick them up with his muscular arms _
the turtles weigh about 90 pounds each _ and move them aside.
``Luckily,'' he says, ``they're more aggressive in the water than
on land.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-gallon alligator swamp has been a constant feature at
the aquarium since the facility opened in 1923, making it one of
the oldest alligator exhibits in the United States. Much of the
rest of the facility has changed over the years, but the swamp
remains largely the same.
</P>
<P>
   One addition, however, is the placement of signs reading
``Please do not throw objects at these live animals. Coins will
injure and poison them.''
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't stop anyone. Every day, people gather around the
swamp and toss pennies, nickels and occasionally larger
denominations into the water and atop the alligators. If the
creatures open their toothy mouths, people will rush to land a coin
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big problems is that nickel and zinc are fairly
toxic to the animals,'' Howell says as he sprays hundreds of coins
toward the drain. ``If it gets in their mouth, they can die from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures it's the ``wishing-well syndrome'' _ people get near
a small body of water, and their first instinct is to toss in a
coin. That this particular body of water is occupied by
monstrous-looking creatures that have changed very little in 80
million years apparently is of little concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've picked up nails, tacks, condoms, foreign coins of all
kinds, wine glasses,'' Howell says, shaking his head. But he
doesn't want to say anything negative about the aquarium's paying
customers. He knows how his toast is buttered.
</P>
<P>
   The female alligator joins the male atop the island, and the two
maintain a stony glare as Howell sprays the coins into a neat pile.
``Here's where I break my back,'' he says, dropping the hose and
bringing a plastic bucket to the floor of the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   He hunches over the coins and begins scooping them by hand into
the bucket. Typically, the aquarium will take in about $10 a month
in this way, with the coins being disinfected and then shipped to
the accounting department for purchasing new lab equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the pickings look a bit more meager than usual.
``Seems like there's a lot of copper in there,'' Howell says.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, he's the Alan Greenspan of the alligator world.
Howell says he can get a good idea about the state of the economy
from what he dredges up from the bottom of the pit. The more dimes
and quarters found, the better the outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, it has been a good summer according to the
alligator index. Howell says the economy seems to be doing just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   He lifts the coins out of the swamp and proceeds to mix bleach
with water in a bucket. He spreads the mixture around the floor,
taking care not to get any in the alligators' or turtles' eyes.
With a long-handled brush, Howell then scrubs away at the green
algae on the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll last about two or three days, then start turning green
again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Howell has never been bitten. This is partly due to his
remaining alert whenever down in the pit, and partly to the fact
that the alligators and turtles are fed regularly and thus do not
view him as a meal when he comes calling.
</P>
<P>
   The alligators eat fish, rabbits and rats _ rats mostly, dead
ones, obtained from a rat wholesaler. They generally go through 10
rats per feeding. The rats are tossed into the water, and the
alligators and turtles swim around snatching them from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't happen when the public is around. Too gruesome,
apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Howell finally finishes his cleaning and clears his equipment
from the swamp. Climbing out himself, he turns a valve and water
begins cascading down the central waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   The male stays put atop the island, but the female quickly makes
her way to the base of the fall, allowing the warm water to stream
over her body. The turtles head down toward the drain, where the
water soon will be deep enough to allow them to submerge.
</P>
<P>
   Howell glances around, making sure everything is as it should
be. The aquarium will open for business in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied, Howell leads his visitor away from the swamp and
downstairs to a small basement office. He's keen to discuss an
upcoming exhibit on venomous critters.
</P>
<P>
   Howell decides that what his visitor really needs to see is a
type of tarantula as big as one's hand. ``It can kill a bird,''
Howell says, and his eyes light up as he shows off the huge, hairy
insect.
</P>
<P>
   An almost serene look crosses his face _ the look of a person
who has found his calling in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Howell says, smiling, ``it's very gratifying to
know that you can make a tarantula happy.''

 Battle Of the Bourses
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The free-for-all battle that has erupted in the stock options
industry opened a new front yesterday as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange said it will begin trading 15 options that have been the
exclusive turf of the Pacific Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco bourse immediately retaliated, announcing it
will start trading 24 issues that now are only available on the
CBOE, including options on shares of Kodak, Exxon and
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   CBOE, the largest U.S. options exchange, said it will offer
options in some of the most popular issues of third-ranked Pacific,
including options on the stocks of Microsoft, Compaq Computer, Sun
Microsystems and footware-maker Nike starting September 1. The
Chicago Exchange said it will also list 14 options that until now
have been the sole province of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the
No.4 options exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The gentlemen's agreement among the nation's four options
exchanges not to trade each other's listings started breaking down
10 days ago, when CBOE said it would begin trading options on Dell
Computer stock, which had been listed exclusively by Philadelphia.
That stared tit-for-tat poaching that also drew in the American
Stock Exchange, the No.2 options market.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the bare-knuckled competition is good news
for investors, who will benefit from competitive prices and lower
exchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   But it's ominous for the smaller exchanges, including Pacific,
which controls 18 percent of the options market, and Philadelphia,
which controls 11 percent. Without a monopoly market, they may not
be able to survive a price war with the CBOE.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got all-out warfare among the exchanges, and in the
long term there are going to be corpses all over the battlefield,''
said Junius Peake, a finance professor at the University of
Northern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Pacific is concerned, Peake said, ``Their ability to
compete is diminishing rapidly, and maybe a merger is in their best
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Pacific and CBOE agreed to merge last year. The
combination fell through when the Chicago Exchange pulled out
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific spokesman Dale Carlson said the fighting will exact an
economic toll on exchanges and brokers: ``The competition for order
flow is going to be fierce, and people are going to lose a lot of
money trying to capture market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The monopoly system followed by the options exchanges emerged in
the 1970s and 1980s. Antitrust watchdogs in the U.S. Justice
Department have considered taking action against the system, since
the lack of competition apparently fosters higher fees and trading
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now the system is breaking down as traditional exchanges, which
operate through hyperactive brokers shouting and gesturing across
old-fashioned trading floors, face the looming threat of
competition from electronic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The International Securities Exchange, the best-financed and
most organized computer-based competitor, plans to open next year,
trading up to 600 of the traditional exchanges' most popular stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it became a matter of are we going to wait for the ISE
or are we going to start making some moves proactively,'' said CBOE
spokeswoman Carol Kennedy.

 S.F. Ad Agency Gobbled Up by Pittsburgh Firm
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Zuckerman Fernandes &AMP; Partners, a San Francisco advertising agency
with about $50 million in annual billings, was acquired yesterday
by MARC USA, a Pittsburgh ad firm that is snapping up outposts
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman Fernandes, founded in 1994, is MARC's third
acquisition this year and its sixth in two years.
</P>
<P>
   MARC's expansion strategy is similar to that of larger agencies
that are cobbling together far-flung networks to serve big clients.
But MARC's growth is unusual in that it is being underwritten by a
windfall from a technology IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, MARC sold a subsidiary, Electronic Images, to
USWeb of Santa Clara for an undisclosed amount of USWeb stock and
cash. After USWeb went public, MARC decided to use the proceeds
from the sale of its USWeb stock to grow nationally _ and
eventually, internationally.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb shares now are trading at around $22, up from the December
1997 initial public offering price of $7.50 per share. MARC chief
executive Anthony Bucci declined to say how much of a profit the
firm reaped from its USWeb deal. According to Securities and
Exchange Commission filings, MARC no longer owns a significant
amount of USWeb stock.
</P>
<P>
   MARC's acquisitions are being funded by a mixture of USWeb stock
proceeds and cash from operations, Bucci said. Zuckerman Fernandes'
partners also received equity in MARC as part of yesterday's deal,
said Ira Zuckerman, an agency co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman Fernandes was hamstrung in its attempts to grow above
its current size, Zuckerman said. ``We were too big for the smaller
pieces of business and too small for the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which never managed to break into the city's top
tier, met with other potential buyers but opted for MARC because it
promised that the agency could continue operating independently,
according to Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to San Francisco, MARC's stable includes small ad
agencies in New York, Indianapolis, Chicago, Dallas and Miami. It
expects to announce similar purchases in Boston and Seattle later
this year, Bucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are finished, which we are very close to being, we
will be the only agency in the United States with full-service
offices in every major region of the country,'' Bucci said. ``We
can do national (advertising) programs ... with instantaneous
regional variations.''
</P>
<P>
   MARC is planning to add offices in Hong Kong, London and Canada
in the next two years, Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the agencies on the acquisition trail today are far
larger than MARC, which prior to buying Zuckerman had forecast 1999
billings at $430 million.
</P>
<P>
   For example, San Francisco's Hal Riney &AMP; Partners was acquired
last year by Publicis S.A. of Paris, creating Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney.
In February, Euro RSCG Worldwide, a New York conglomerate owned by
Havas Advertising of Paris, purchased San Francisco's Citron
Haligman Bedecarre.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman Fernandes' 40 staff members will remain in place,
including top management. Zuckerman was a co-founder of Hal Riney &AMP;
Partners, and Al Fernandes was a senior creative director at Grey
Advertising. The agency's third partner is general manager Jim
Magill, formerly of Hal Riney &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a San Francisco agency that had strong
management in place that wanted to stay and grow the business, as
well as great creative product, a great client list and great
people,'' Bucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman Fernandes' accounts include Union Bank of California,
Allied Domecq Wines and the California Olive Industry. MARC's
include Rite Aid, Cellular One, Peterbilt Trucks and the Internet
service provider Verio.

LAWRIE, FRANCO LEAD NEC INVITATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ As David Duval might be the first to notice, the
NEC Invitational here at the storied Firestone Country Club is not
an ``exhibition.'' Far from it, what with the NEC's $5 million
purse so huge and $1 million of that purse going to the champion.
</P>
<P>
   And as Duval might not be as quick to notice, some golfers at
this level might swing at that little dimpled white ball for more
than money. One of those golfers, for sure, is Paul Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie, the improbable, unknown and seemingly already-forgotten
British Open champion, Friday finished a morning round of 67 where
he one-putted his first three greens ``and then played lovely from
there on.'' Lawrie followed with a 68 in the afternoon and his
5-under 135 gave him a share of the NEC Invitational lead with
Paraguay's Carlos Franco, even more of an unknown than Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seems to be new this little while,'' said Lawrie,
who was virtually handed the British Open when Jean Van de Velde of
France took a gosh-awful triple bogey on the 72d hole. Since the
Open, ``I feel more at ease with myself . . . obviously, winning
the Open has given me that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a steam bath of a day where the Firestone course was so soggy
from two days of steady rain that creatures unseen in many a moon _
frogs _ were seen prancing across the rough of the fourth fairway,
the 41 golfers here put in a long day, 36 holes for four golfers
and 25, 30 or more holes for most of the field. ``You won't need to
be rocking this puppy to get to sleep,'' is how Payne Stewart
(70-67_137, two strokes behind) described this grueling day caused
when rain and lightning cut short the opening round on Thursday.
``This is one tired puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   The endless day and the heat seemed to noticeable affect
England's Colin Montgomerie, who shot a gaudy 69 in the morning,
but trudged, limped, and struggled home in 75 in the afternoon.
``Somebody said to me, `This is not the sort of course you should
be playing 35 holes a day,' '' said Montgomerie. ``And I said, `Not
when you're as tired as I am.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods (a 4-under 66) had led when play was completed in
the opening round shortly before noon. And when El Nino himself,
Spain's Sergio Garcia, blistered a hot round of 67, Woods and
Garcia found themselves for the first time in the same group for
the afternoon round, drawing a huge gallery for the sport's two
young sensations while television types moaned that golf's dream
pairing first had to occur on a Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the two wilted slightly as Woods fired a 1-over 71 in the
afternoon and the 19-year-old Spaniard came home in 70, leaving the
two at 3 under, two strokes behind Lawrie and Franco. Phil
Mickelson, Hal Sutton, and Nick Price are one stroke behind Lawrie
and Franco, fashioning nifty 4-under-par scores. Along with Woods
and Garcia, Stewart, Craig Parry, Davis Love, and Mark Calcavecchia
are tied at 3-under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make any putts,'' said Woods of his afternoon round.
``I missed eight putts that I thought I could make.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a big laugh Woods and Garcia had as they both
approached the fourth green, there was little interaction between
the two. Said Woods: ``I wasn't scoring well enough to chit-chat.
But (Garcia) is a pleasant gentleman to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different playing with Tiger as I had only played a
practice round with him,'' said Garcia. ``Neither one of us played
very well, but those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Lawrie and Franco, the two unknowns, atop the
leaderboard in this glittering field of the world's best. As Ryder
Cup teammate and fellow Scotsman Andrew Coltart said of Lawrie,
``Paul's gotten so much more confident since winning the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Open and knowing that ``you beat these guys over
four rounds and these guys are the best in the world,'' explained
Lawrie in his Scottish burr, ``has got to make you feel better
about yourself and your golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation in Larie is so vast that he can remember
feeling intimidated just by being paired with John Daly four years
ago. Daly, said Lawrie, ``had just won the (British) Open and he
was obviously a big name and hit it a long way. It was quite
difficult for me. I had a bad day and shot 78 or something playing
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The inner confidence now is clearly evident in Lawrie's game. As
much as taking the lead once again over the world's best _ showing
the Open was not a fluke _ Lawrie was almost as pleased that he did
so well playing in heat seldom found in the British Isles. ``The
last few holes I was obviously very tired,'' said the Scot, ``but
it's nice that I start playing well in the heat and playing pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, like Lawrie, is still relatively unknown despite twice
winning tourneys this year, the Greater Milwaukee Open and the
Compaq Classic of New Orleans. ``I say, `I come to America, I need
to play in America,' '' said the Paraguayan. ``I never say, `I win,
I win'; this is unbelievable this year, first time twice winner.
Now, I say, `incredible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Franco's words sometimes came through an interpreter, but his
golf is understood in any language. ``I think my confidence is
better,'' said the 34-year-old. ``My head is solid, very, very
confident. Every week, more better. But my head is big, big
cofidence now. I think it's big, big chance this week.''
</P>
<P>
   At a wonderful, wonderful location. As Hal Sutton put it,
``Firestone is one of the finest golf courses in the United States
. . . in the world, for that matter. And you put the finest golfers
in the world on one of the finest courses playing for a $5 million
purse, that's pretty exciting to me.''

 Fund-Raisers Fear eScrip's Scrooge Effect
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;

<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The fund-raising efforts of public schools in low-income
neighorhoods could be devastated by a new Internet-based charity
program that uses electronic scrip.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were expressed yesterday by representatives from
school districts in Hayward, Oakland and Castro Valley. They said
schools in poor areas wouldn't see any money from Safeway's new
eScrip program if parents refuse to pay the annual $10 to $20 to
enroll in it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they are worried that much of the money they now raise
from Safeway's traditional paper scrip program will dry up because
since  &LR; the grocery chain plans to go exclusively with eScrip.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway said it will convert to electronic scrip at the
beginning of this school year and expects to phase out the old
scrip by September 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see (fund raising) coming to an end at Hayward High
School because of eScrip,'' said Kris Fountain, who runs the
school's scrip program. ``That's a shame, because it means we will
no longer be able to buy things for the school we wouldn't
otherwise have.''
</P>
<P>
   EScrip is basically an online version of the traditional,
paper-based scrip programs that have been around for more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional scrip, schools and other nonprofits buy gift
certificates from merchants such as Safeway and the Gap at about a
5 percent discount and then resell the vouchers at face value to
parents, pocketing the difference.
</P>
<P>
   EScrip, pioneered by a San Mateo company called Electronic Scrip
Inc., promises to take the hassle out of the paper-based programs,
which require schools to raise the money to buy scrip certificates
and then mobilize volunteers to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   With the eScrip system, parents register their ATM, Safeway and
credit card numbers with Electronic Scrip Inc. Every time they use
the cards at a participating store, a portion of the sale is
automatically donated to the preselected organization of their
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the problem with eScrip is that parents in
low-income areas will balk at the entry price, which ranges from
$10 to $20, depending on the number of schools on their donation
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe schools in Silicon Valley won't care, but for poorer
schools, the 10 bucks will really hit hard,'' said Tammy Durston,
who is in charge of scrip promotion at Proctor Elementary School in
Castro Castor  &LR; Valley. ``I've talked to other parents and they'll
probably drop out, because they don't want to pony up the 10
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 of Proctor's 500 families participate in the paper
scrip program.
</P>
<P>
   Durston is also worried about Safeway's stated intention to
phase out participation in all paper-based scrip programs and
concentrate solely on eScrip. Of the $15,000 that Proctor raised in
scrip profits from a number of sources last year, nearly 50 percent
came from Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money we raised went toward a new science lab, a
playground and microscopes,'' said Durston. ``We're really upset,
because it looks like our fund-raising budget will now be cut in
half.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that even if parents did sign up for eScrip, the
school would not raise nearly the same amount of money because
Safeway will no longer contribute 5 percent of each purchase.
Instead, it will contribute 2 to 4 percent, depending on how much
individual families spend at its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new Internet scrip program, Safeway will pay
Electronic Scrip a small percentage of each transaction to cover
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway spokesman Debra Lambert acknowledged yesterday that the
new eScrip program would require be  &LR; an adjustment but said schools
would benefit in the end because they will collect a portion of
every purchase by their members at Safeway stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if a parent has $100 in scrip coupons, but purchases $150
worth or groceries, the school misses out on the additional $50.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said the company will contribute a total of $15 million
to schools this year under the new scrip program.

ICO GLOBAL IS 2ND SATELLITE VENTURE IN MONTH TO FILE FOR CHAPTER
11 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the second bankruptcy filing this month for a
satellite communications company, ICO Global Communications
(Holdings) Ltd. filed for protection from its creditors Friday,
after having failed to raise money from skittish investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapter 11 filing in Wilmington, Del., came two weeks after
the bankruptcy filing of Iridium LLC, which barely attracted any
customers for its service using satellites to provide mobile
telephone service anywhere in the world. Iridium's failure made
investors reluctant to pour more money into ICO, which plans a
similar service using its $4.7-billion system beginning in the
third quarter next year.
</P>
<P>
   ICO chief executive Richard Greco said Friday that the company
planned to continue with its business. ``Our Chapter 11 filing
should provide ICO with the extra time needed to reorganize,
recapitalize and complete our financing,'' he said in a statement
issued from the company's headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our actions will be successful and that ICO
will emerge as a very effective competitor in providing global
mobile satellite telephone services,'' said Greco.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said the
bankruptcy filing reflected a desire by ICO's investors to ``buy
some time'' to see how a third competitor, Globalstar
Telecommunications Ltd., fares.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar, which is backed by Loral Space &AMP; Communications,
plans to begin service in late September. ``They really want to see
Globalstar validated before they put more money into ICO,'' Musey
said.
</P>
<P>
   A failure by ICO could cause Hughes Electronics Corp., which is
building ICO's 12 satellites, to take a charge against earnings of
$500 million, according to regulatory filings by Hughes. Richard
Dore, a spokesman, said Friday that it was too early to tell how
the bankruptcy filing would affect Hughes, a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp. Hughes owns 2.6 percent of ICO as part of an agreement
to eventually buy 4 percent of the company's stock for $93.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Hughes, however, rose $1.1875 Friday, to $52.625,
apparently because investors think the company, which had been
participating in attempts to rescue ICO, will now not put any more
money into the company. Globalstar also rose $1.1875, to $28.875,
because the possible failure of ICO leaves it with one less
competitor. Shares of ICO, which brought $12 at the company's
initial public offering last summer, fell 62.5 cents Friday, to
$3.625, before trading was halted.
</P>
<P>
   ICO was created by Inmarsat, an international organization
recently turned into a corporation, which provides satellite
communications to ships. Many of the investors in ICO are
Inmarsat's members, telephone companies worldwide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   TRW is also a large investor, with 13.9 million shares, or 6.7
percent, according to an ICO prospectus. A TRW spokesman said it
was too soon for the company to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although ICO had already asked for a delay in paying more than
$40 million in interest due at the beginning of August, the
bankruptcy filing surprised creditors. ``They didn't telegraph this
at all,'' said Luc Despins, a lawyer in New York who represents an
informal committee of ICO bondholders. ``We don't know why the
company filed so soon and so suddenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despins, who works for Milbank Tweed Hadley &AMP; McCloy, said the
bondholders had not been threatening to push ICO into bankruptcy so
there was no need for ICO to seek protection as a pre-emptive move.
</P>
<P>
   ICO has already raised $3 billion of the $4.7 billion it
estimates it needs to begin service. But with Iridium's problems
clouding the market, ICO recently failed to raise $500 million from
a public rights offering despite extending the deadline twice. It
then announced a tentative agreement to secure $600 million from
strategic investors, which reportedly included Hughes, but that
plan also fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, industry executives said, ICO was trying to raise
a smaller amount, said to be $400 million. But that plan, which was
to be voted on at an investor meeting in Paris on Saturday, has
apparently fallen through as well.
</P>
<P>
   The ICO bankruptcy is the latest blow to the satellite industry,
which has also suffered from rocket and satellite failures,
national security controversies and tighter export controls. But
some segments of the market, particularly direct television
broadcasting to home by Hughes' DirecTV and Echostar
Communications, continues to do well. &QL;

FAMILY SEEKS ANSWERS IN MAN'S SLAYING BY POLICE DURING RAID ON
HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   COMPTON, Calif. _ Maria Derain stood before the gunshot-damaged
doors that were propped on the front of her parents' house Friday,
questioning why police fatally shot her 64-year-old father in his
bedroom while executing a search warrant earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they take my father away?'' Ms. Derain asked. ``We
want answers. We demand answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the family of Mario Paz said a federal
civil rights complaint will be filed in an effort to fully explore
why Paz was shot twice in the back as police from El Monte, a Los
Angeles suburb, swept through the family's house at about 11 p.m.
on Aug. 9., in search of drugs and drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A homicide was committed in this house,'' said Brian Dunn, a
lawyer with the firm of Cochran, Cherry, Givens, Smith &AMP; Ferrer.
``Armed gunmen gained entry by shooting shots through windows and
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, whose law firm's most famous partner is Johnnie Cochran,
who successfully represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial, said
Paz had no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for the El Monte Police
Department, said requests for comment were being handled by an
assistant chief who was not on duty Friday. However, the department
has justified using an elite SWAT team with about 20 members to
enter the house, pointing to items found in searches executed a few
days earlier at residences in the Los Angeles suburbs of Chino and
La Puente. In those searches, the authorities found approximately
400 pounds of marijuana, three high-powered assault rifles and more
than $75,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Although El Monte is about 25 miles northeast of Compton,
authorities there have said it is not unusual for them to go to
other jurisdictions as part of their investigations. The address of
the Paz home, a modest blue stucco in South-Central Los Angeles,
had been used by the person named in the search warrants, Marcos
Beltran Lizarraga.
</P>
<P>
   The family has said that Lizarraga lived in the neighborhood
during the 1980s and in the past had mail sent to their address.
But they maintain that they had no connections to him.
</P>
<P>
   To enter the home, police used shotguns to blow locks off the
doors and created a diversion in a back bedroom. The family said
they believed a robbery was taking place. Earlier in the day, Paz
had returned from Tijuana, Mexico, where he had taken $10,000, the
remainder of a personal injury lawsuit, out of a bank. The money
was in the house, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynn, a private investigator hired by the lawyers
representing the Paz family, said an extraordinary amount of
violence was used to enter the house, particularly in light of who
was there. ``Mario Paz was never suspected of any criminal
activity,'' Lynn said. ``Mario Paz was a hard-working
grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, who has worked as an investigator for the United Nations,
questioned why police did not make more of an effort to find out
who was in the house before using a violent means of entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have they adopted a policy of shoot first and ask
questions later?'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported that four
guns, a .22-caliber rifle and three pistols, were found in the
house. However, none of the guns were within Paz's reach at the
time of the shooting, people familiar with the setting in the
bedroom have said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Paz family declined to discuss what happened in
the bedroom prior to the shooting, which is being investigated by
the Sheriff's Department and the El Monte Police Department's
Internal Affairs Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he had not decided whether to name the Compton police
in his civil rights complaint. Compton police provided support to
the El Monte authorities.

COLLINS, GARNER WIN, GET TO DEFEND LIGHTWEIGHT DOUBLE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ont. _ They were zipping along in lane 4 Friday
morning, looking back at the field through wraparound shades,
cruising nice and easy down Martindale Pond to the finish, then off
the water and done for the day while most of their peers were still
lining up for coffee and muffins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never as easy as it looks,'' Christine Collins was
saying, after she and partner Sarah Garner had won their
lightweight double semifinal at the world rowing championships and
earned the right to defend their title Sunday. ``We were definitely
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   More than world titles are at stake here this week. So are
Olympic qualifying berths, and Collins has been to enough world
regattas (six and counting) to know that anything can happen in a
seven-minute boat race. ``So we just wanted to get out there and
execute our race plan,'' said the Worcester, Mass. lawyer. ``And
not think too much.''
</P>
<P>
   By making the final, Collins and Garner guaranteed the United
States a place in Sydney in the only lightweight event for women.
That was the thread that ran through the entire day, whether the
Americans were racing in a semi or a B final. Jamie Koven, the
former world sculling champ who'd missed the final on Thursday, was
back Friday trying to avoid finishing last in the consolation race.
It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the toughest races you'll ever see in a B
final,'' testified the Boston financial analyst, who ended up fifth
of six when Slovakia's Jan Ziska imploded near the finish, barely
made it across the line, and collapsed on the dock. ``But it was
important to get the Olympic spot. Whether or not I'm the single
sculler next year, it takes a lot of the pressure off.''
</P>
<P>
   Any country that doesn't earn a spot here has to go to a special
qualifying regatta next summer (the US is grouped with Europe). So
there is an iron imperative to qualify here and save time, money,
and angst.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of Sally Scovel and Lianne Nelson did it Friday by
breezing to victory in their B final. The women's quad managed by
finishing second to the Russians in its semi. And the men's
lightweight double of A,erocam Steve Tucker and Conal Groom, who
row out of the MIT boathouse in Cambridge, Mass., qualified by
charging up from fifth place at the quarter pole to finish second
behind the Italians in their semi. ``Making the A final is what I
consider a wonderful regatta,'' exulted Tucker, after he and Groom
picked off the Danes, Irish, and Russians at 40 strokes a minute.
``There are going to be some crews that'll go for the win and then
drop. I'd be very happy to get a bronze.''
</P>
<P>
   Some US crews had an easier ticket to Olympus than others. The
double of Ian McGowan and Nick Peterson needed only to not finish
last in their B final to make it. They placed third behind the
Ukrainians and Estonians. Others had much less margin _ and fell
short. Sculler Leslie Burns Rawley needed to be in the top three;
she was last. The double of Cindy Brooks and Norwood's Carol
Skricki needed top two; they never got out of fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yanks will have enough Olympic berths to qualify for
a group rate Down Under. They've already wrapped up seven
(including the men's eight) of a possible 14 and have a chance at
three more. If the medal-favored women's eight does anything but
finish last Sunday, it's in. Same for the men's quad, which was
fourth in Friday's semi.
</P>
<P>
   The men's lightweight four was hoping for a free pass after its
rudder was tangled up in weeds midway through Friday's semi and it
ended up sagging from contention to last place. ``The boat became
significantly heavier and unresponsive to steering,'' said stroke
Bill Carlucci, who pointed out the blockage to the referee after
the race. ``We just kept dropping off the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jury said the tangle wasn't severe enough to matter, so
the Yanks ended up in Saturday's B final, where they'll need to be
top four to qualify. Getting to Olympus is never as easy as it
looks. And there are free passes for nobody but the Lords of the
Rings.

USC WILL HAVE LOOK OF HOME IN HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ USC may be flying 5{ hours to its season opener in
Hawaii, but the Trojans will look right at home by wearing their
cardinal jerseys in Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   New Hawaii coach June Jones decided he would start his tenure by
donning white jerseys in the opener. It's one way for Hawaii to get
a fresh start, since the Rainbow Warriors have lost 18 straight
games.
</P>
<P>
   USC has not worn its cardinal jerseys in an opponent's stadium
since 1982, when it played UCLA in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket count: Hawaii already has sold more than 40,000 tickets
for next Saturday's game, and school officials are hopeful it will
reach a sellout figure of 50,000. Hawaii has not had a sellout
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking battle: One position not settled yet is kicker, where
junior David Bell and sophomore David Newbury have split practice
duties.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said a decision will be made by
Wednesday, and he is holding a practice at the Coliseum this
weekend to test the kickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we're practicing at the Coliseum is the
numerous opportunities for kicking under pressure,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has won the kickoff job, which he handled last season, but
the rest is ``too close to call,'' according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Camp over: USC officially broke camp at UC Irvine on Friday, and
not a moment too soon for the players, who were weary after 14 days
of confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely excited to get out of here,'' quarterback Carson
Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling aside, Palmer felt the camp was valuable in terms
of how much of the playbook was installed compared to last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did a great job,'' he said. ``I was surprised how
much we got in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was also pleased with the camp, and it appears the
Trojans will continue to come to Irvine every August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave here prepared for the season,'' Hackett said.
``Unlike last year, when it was spread out over three weeks, it was
more intense this year. Overall, with the people in Irvine, and the
change of atmosphere, I think it's a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen gets start: Defensive tackle Ryan Nielsen of Royal High
has been named a starter for the Hawaii game. Expected starter
Aaron Williams has been out for most of camp with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Ryan Nielsen had an excellent camp,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen also started last year's season opener against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   In a mild surprise, former tight end Lonnie Ford has beaten out
Kori Dickerson at defensive end, although both will play. Another
slightly unexpected listing has senior Pat Swanson ahead of
redshirt freshman Scott Huber for the second-string tight end
position.
</P>
<P>
   Third-string quarterback John Fox is also a co-No. 2 at middle
linebacker.

 &HT;    Hurricane makes for Southeast
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hurricane Dennis today continues creeping toward the
southeastern United States after whipping the Bahamas on Friday
night with 80-mph winds that bent trees and closed the airport on
Great Abaco Island.
</P>
<P>
   So far just a minimal Category 1 storm, Dennis could intensify
today and come as close as 75 miles to the Florida coast, anywhere
from Melbourne to Jacksonville. Residents from Florida through the
Carolinas should be on alert throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still hundreds of miles away from the Georgia coast Friday,
Dennis kicked up unusually large swells off Jekyll Island, St.
Simons Island and Cumberland Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really rough,'' said charter boat captain Mark Noble
as his 25-foot open boat bounced through the big waves toward a
shark fishing expedition in St. Andrews Sound and the Satilla
River.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, hurricane forecasters had plotted landfall near
the South Carolina-North Carolina border, perhaps on Sunday or
Monday, said Georgia Emergency Management Director Gary McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis moved toward Florida during the afternoon, more
westerly than predicted. Computers shifted the potential landfall
target south near Charleston. Still, encroaching further on Florida
is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still expect it to go up the coast, but it's too close to
call one way or the other,'' said Jerry Jarrell, Director of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch has been posted in Florida from Sebastian
Inlet, south of Melbourne, northward to Fernandina Beach near the
Georgia border.
</P>
<P>
   On a projection screen in the Georgia Emergency Management
Agency operation center Friday, the HURREVAC computer program
simulated Dennis trudging past various points on the Atlantic
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   The last path displayed suggested the storm would curve toward
the north _ slicing like a golf shot struck from the Bahamas and
aimed at Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Sunday, according to the computer model, the eye of
Dennis could be aimed just north of Charleston. The projection
showed strengthening to a Category 3 storm with top wind speed of
115 mph and a forward direction of 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   If that forecast holds, gale-force winds of 49 mph could be
buffeting Savannah by Sunday night, McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could bring power lines down. Older, heavier trees would
be knocked down,'' McConnell said. ``It will blow away lawn
furniture, but nothing of any substantial damage would happen. But
you'll see inconveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, coastal residents from Savannah to Brunswick should
monitor Dennis and be ready to move if the storm suddenly jogs west
toward Georgia. No evacuations have been ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have their evacuation plan in hand, know where
they're going and how they're going to get there,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials will confer with hurricane forecasters at 9
a.m. and have a better idea what advisories they'll issue today.
McConnell advised coastal residents to stock up on medicines and
plan how they'll take care of people with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Golden Isles Marina west of St. Simons, dockmaster
Charles ``Chick'' Candler IV said marina workers and boat owners
were getting the marina and about 80 boats_ ranging in size from 22
feet to 65 feet _ready in case the storm threatens. They were also
battening down the dry stack storage for 175 boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doubling and tripling and quadrupling dock lines, and
checking lines to make sure they're sound,'' said Candler. ``We're
putting rebar through the tops of all the pilings to keep the docks
from floating away in case we get the storm surge here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said anything vulnerable to wind is being removed or tied
down. ``We're making sure the dock boxes are locked down to make
sure the tops don't fly off like Frisbees and decapitate someone,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several boats had already left the marina to seek shelter in
harbors farther inland, Candler said.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Brevard County officials began evacuating people
with special medical concerns, such as those on oxygen. The next
group of people to be evacuated would be mobile home residents and
people in barrier island high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District has been lowering
water levels in canals to lessen the risk of flooding should heavy
rains occur.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges put 1,000 National Guard troops
on alert along with 500 state law enforcement officers. They
reported to armories Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   No evacuations have been ordered, even though Charleston remains
a top-projected target. The state's tourist areas are winding down
toward the close of their busy summer season. Today in North
Carolina, a 60-member team of National Guard troops will go on
active duty to operate generators in communities prone to lose
electricity, said Tom Hegele, spokesman for the North Carolina
Emergency Management Division. State troopers are on alert as well
if the barrier islands are evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advising people that if they want to go to the beach
for the weekend, drive safely and have a great time but keep an eye
on the weather,'' Hegele said. ``If it works out that the barrier
islands are evacuated, do it. Know how you are going to get off the
islands.''
</P>
<P>
   On North Carolina's Outer Banks, workers are completing the
foundation of the historic Cape Hatteras lighthouse, relocated
1,600 feet inland this summer from the threatening Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighthouse is 100 percent safe,'' construction site
foreman Richard Meekins said. ``We are taking the best possible
care of her.''
</P>
<P>
   On Topsail Island, N.C., a narrow spit damaged by hurricanes
Bertha (1996), Fran (1996) and Bonnie (1998), residents are keeping
track of Dennis. But ``if you look outside right now, you would not
see anything unusual,'' Chamber of Commerce chief Jeanne Nociti
said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The storm threat has not postponed Topsail Beach's king mackerel
fishing tournament, which ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Wrightsville Beach, N.C., residents lined up at
the police department Friday for ``town stickers.'' Those stickers,
affixed to their car windows, allow property owners to return to
their homes after storm evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather seems to be keeping people away,'' Wrightsville
Beach spokesman Michael Stokes said. ``They seem to be a little bit
more prudent, but it hurts the tourist business.''

FANS, CLUBHOUSE DIFFER ON VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Dan Duquette would not gloat. No matter how hard I
tried, I couldn't cajole a single ``I told you so'' out of him. Not
even a smug smile of self-satisfaction. He insisted on taking the
high road.
</P>
<P>
   I hate it when they do that.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke wouldn't show his hand, but he had to be feeling pretty
good about himself when the Angels hit Fenway. With 35 games to
play, Duquette's Red Sox were locked in a tie for the American
League's final playoff spot. The Angels were in last place, a
whopping 24 games behind Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mo Vaughn _ who did not come to Fenway Friday (he was
at the funeral of a close friend's mom) _ has been hurt all season
and is batting .263 with 21 homers and 74 RBIs. Compare that with
Troy O'Leary, who was at .281 with 25 bombs and 85 RBIs; or even
Brian Daubach, .321, 19, 69 in only 86 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels last winter bought Vaughn for $80 million and the
Duke was ripped for running Big Mo out of town. Then Duquette
signed Jose Offerman and talked about Jose replacing Mo's ``on-
base capability.'' We had a lot of fun with that one.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseguy scribes like me circled the dates on the calender. May
7. Aug. 27. Mo's triumphant returns. We tried to imagine the
red-faces in the executive boxes when Mo hit game-winning homers
for the Angels at Fenway. The Duke was going to feel like Bob Kraft
after yet another bloodbath at the hands of Tuna and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mo went 1 for 11 with six strikeouts as the Sox swept
the Angels in May and he didn't even show up at the park when
Anaheim staggered into the Old Yard. And then O'Leary _ the man who
would be Mo _ hit a game-winning, two-out, two-run double to win
yet another game against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Duke would not rub it in. Much as he must have
wanted to, he resisted the urge to harpoon Mo, the Angels, or
myself. Speaking in the most measured of tones, Dukespeak
overdrive, all he would say was, ``There's no need to (gloat) . . .
If you put all that money into one hitter, it really restricts what
you're able to do for the rest of your ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Mo has lost his hammer of popularity. We've seen ``Mo
Who?'' T-shirts and there are fans and columnists who think the Sox
are actually better off without their onetime leader.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find anyone in the Sox clubhouse who'd go that
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who says that is crazy,'' said Nomar Garciaparra, who
appears to finally be feeling the absence of Mo's protection in the
batting order. ``Are you kidding me? The guy's an incredible player
and an incredible person. When he left I said that we were losing
more than a player. People look too much at numbers. I can't speak
for everybody in the room, but I don't hear anybody saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, another Mo ally (Stanley still uses Vaughn's glove
at first base), said, ``We knew it was something we had to get over
with. We all made our plan for life without Mo. We knew we had to
pick up and we have. Look at Daubach and Troy and the things they
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mo's had a rough go, but I don't feel sorry for him. He
set out to make them a winner and I know once he's healthy he's
going to provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin has the keys to Mo's house in Easton. Whenever he
feels like it, Valentin takes a 40-minute drive, lets himself into
Chez Mo and take a little private batting practice in Mo's cages.
Valentin hit at Mo's place Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him briefly,'' said the Sox third baseman, a longtime
Vaughn friend and teammate. ``He seemed down. Obviously, he hasn't
had the kind of year he's capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Sox better off without Mo?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm biased,'' said Valentin. ``I know we are in a good
situation now, but we might be in a better situation if we had
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Terry Collins had no trouble defending his free
agent bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has played on one leg all year,'' said the manager.
``He's gone out and done the best he could and he hasn't
complained. He's taken responsibility. That's him. I take my hat
off to him.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been some nastiness in the Angel clubhouse. Vaughn was
included in the group of players who went to management to complain
about a contract extension for Collins. (Mo said he was merely
representing the views of other players.) Mo has also complained
about the direction of the front office (sound familiar, Dan?).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Collins said when asked if he thought Mo
went behind his back. ``You're telling me everybody in the Boston
clubhouse likes Jimy Williams? Our guys just decided to make sure
the newspaper guys knew about it. Our guys are pissed and I can't
blame them. But I like Mo Vaughn. All he does is show up and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not show up, but he had a good reason. Collins said
Vaughn would be his designated hitter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mo didn't have anything to say to Boston scribes when the Sox
were in Anaheim three weeks ago. He's told California writers that
he won't have much to say to the Boston bunch this weekend, either.
Some Sox fans no doubt thought Mo was hiding Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to know him better than that,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Some of them still believe the Sox would be better
off without Mo Vaughn. Not even Dan Duquette would go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Not for publication anyway.

WILL FOX TV STAGE LIVE CRASH OF JUMBO JET? STAY TUNED

   It seemed too bizarre to be true: a television network
collaborating with a federal agency to send a multimillion-dollar
747 jumbo jet hurtling out of the sky to crash on the desert floor,
for a live broadcast, hoping to attract the biggest rubber-necking
crowd ever.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, in an era when television has brought live police
chases and family members whacking each other with folding chairs
on talk shows, maybe it was not so unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also not true, Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswomen said _ even though Fox Broadcasting says it is
exploring the possibility of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   A report in next week's issue of TV Guide, which will be
available on Monday, said the idea was for the crash to be
televised live, probably in November, and quotes a Fox executive,
Michael Darnell, as saying the network is negotiating to perform
the crash in cooperation with the aviation agency.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the aviation agency's deputy assistant
administrator for public affairs, Drucie Andersen, not only have no
negotiations been held, but the agency has had no talks with Fox at
all, and does not perform crash tests of this kind.
</P>
<P>
   An aviation technology company that often helps movie studios
get agency permission for aerial stunts did have preliminary talks
with the regional FAA safety office in Los Angeles about the
feasibility of a 747 crash stunt, but no proposal has been
submitted, an FAA spokeswoman said. Nonetheless, TV Guide, which
until last year was owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox, Friday
stood by its account.
</P>
<P>
   The story grew bolder Friday, when The New York Post, also owned
by Murdoch, splashed it across the top of its television pages
(headline: ``Look out below!'') with a photo of a 747, printed
vertically. The article said Fox was ``reportedly close to a deal
with the Federal Aviation Administration'' to perform the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reporter called the FAA's New York public affairs
office on Thursday to verify the report, but he was told that the
TV Guide report was erroneous, Ms. Andersen said Friday, and that
the FAA was not negotiating with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took that denial with a grain of salt,'' Michael Shain, the
Post's television editor, said Friday, standing by the article.
``We assume we were talking to a government public affairs officer
who just wasn't in the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday they said they were unaware of it,'' he said of the
FAA spokeswomen, referring to the supposed negotiations. ``This
morning they said it hadn't happened. And this afternoon they said
someone with a connection to Fox has had discussions with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shain was referring to the aviation technology company.
According to Fox executives and another FAA spokeswoman, Diane
Spitaliere, the aviation company made inquiries on behalf of Brad
Lachman Productions, an independent production company that
produces some of Fox's notorious reality specials, which feature
police chases, animal attacks, car crashes and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Broadcasting issued a statement saying that ``communications
regarding feasibility were established'' with the FAA, but adding:
``Formal sanction by either the network or the FAA has yet to be
pursued, and a venture of this nature would not move forward
without such approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox executive vice president in charge of specials, Michael
Darnell, is quoted by TV Guide as saying: ``It's the kind of test
the FAA does periodically. Three trained pilots bail out before the
crash. Then the FAA can use data from it. You will see the crash
happen live, but we will have a few seconds' delay to give us an
out in case anybody dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Andersen of the FAA said the agency did not do such tests.
Once, 15 years ago, it crashed an unpiloted plane as a test of a
flame-retardant, she said, but has not done so since.
</P>
<P>
   Fox public relations executives said Darnell would not be
available to answer questions Friday. A TV Guide spokesman, Ari
Karpel, said J. Max Robins, the reporter, was on vacation and could
not be reached for comment.

FINAL MIR CREW RETURNS TO EARTH SAFELY, RUSSIA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Preoccupied with economic woes and political scandals,
Russians paid scant attention Friday as the Mir space station's
crew completed its final mission and ended an era for the nation's
once-formidable space program.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:17 p.m. EDT, Russian astronauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei
Avdeyev, and their French colleague Jean-Pierre Heignere, left the
13-year-old Mir space station for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With grief in our soul, we are abandoning a piece of Russia,''
said Afanasyev in televised comments moments before closing the
docking hatches that connected the Mir to the Soyuz-TM spacecraft
that would bring them home.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, the Soyuz undocked from Mir and began its
descent to Earth. The landing module touched down near the town of
Arkalyk in Kazakhstan just over three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Afanasyev and Haignere had been on Mir since February, and
Avdeyev has been in orbit for 389 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Control will soon switch off most of Mir's systems,
including the central computer that keeps the station's solar
panels facing the sun. Officials have said the station could have
served several more years.
</P>
<P>
   The event received scant attention in Moscow and was not the
lead story on any network's evening news. State television did not
cut away from a broadcast of the World Track and Field
Championships to show the undocking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a poignant day for Russia's space program, once
the pride of the nation, which in the late 1950s and early 1960s
boasted many firsts.
</P>
<P>
   Mir was launched on Feb. 20, 1986. The station's demise will
mark the end of the world's longest-serving space station, which
has orbited the earth over 77,000 times, hosted 135 astronauts, and
survived more than 1,600 breakdowns, including a near-fatal
collision with a supply ship in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mir is costing the cash-poor Russian government more money than
it can afford, about $250 million a year, prompting the decision to
abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are also under pressure from the US space agency
NASA, which has long urged it to bring Mir down and concentrate its
scarce resources on the new international space station, already
under construction. That station is already behind schedule because
of Moscow's failure to build key components.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian space officials have been reluctant to say goodbye
to this last major symbol of the Soviet space era, despite its age
and blemishes. And they also got prickly when Mir is criticized.
</P>
<P>
   When several Hollywood films, including the hit ``Armageddon''
portrayed Mir in a derisive light, it became an issue on the floor
of the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mir was our pride. It was our last success and the whole
world saw it,'' said Anna Danielevskaya, 26, a recent university
graduate who was 13 when Mir was launched.
</P>
<P>
   Mir was hailed as revolutionary when it went up in 1986, and has
far outlasted the three to five years it was expected to live. But
critics said it had also outlived its usefulness.

   CHICAGO _ A federal judge who, on the day before school started
this week, blocked a Cleveland program that uses taxpayer money for
vouchers to send thousands of children to private and parochial
schools, reversed himself Friday, allowing most of the children to
stay in the program, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. of U.S. District Court in Cleveland
said Friday that he would allow those students who had been in the
program last year to receive the tuition money for private school
for the first semester. But Oliver said that could change if he
decides before the semester ends that the program violates the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   After an outcry by thousands of parents and some public
officials about the initial ruling, Oliver said he recognized that
his decision had ``caused disruption to the children previously
enrolled in the program beyond that normally associated with a
student's transferring from one school to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that all but 587 of the 4,000 children enrolled
in the program will receive the vouchers for the fall semester. The
vouchers pay up to $2,250 in tuition costs for elementary school
children in low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's original decision on Tuesday had been the most
significant court setback so far to proponents of school vouchers,
especially since it involved the first city in the country to use
vouchers for religious schools. The ruling generated discussion
around the country, as some cities and states have also adopted
voucher programs and many others are considering such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the vast majority of the 56 private schools in the
4-year-old program were religious schools, the judge had declared
that ``the Cleveland program has the primary effect of advancing
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   While that decision involved only an injunction to allow him to
consider a lawsuit challenging the program's constitutionality, the
judge also said there was ``no substantial possibility'' that he
would ultimately rule in favor of the program.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Oliver had said he felt that issuing an injunction
before the start of the school year would be less inconvenient than
potentially having to yank students out of school after classes had
started. But thousands of parents and some public officials did not
agree. Ohio's attorney general, Betty D. Montgomery, filed an
emergency appeal with the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
after Oliver's decision.
</P>
<P>
   After the second ruling Friday, Clint Bolick, the litigation
director for the Institute for Justice, which argued for the
voucher program, said: ``We're obviously very pleased. I think it's
safe to say the judge got the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolick said that just before the close of court Friday his
organization filed an appeal seeking to have the judge's reprieve
apply to all of the children in the program. But he said that,
regardless, private donors should be able to raise money for the
rest of the students to stay in private schools. Bolick's group has
also filed an appeal of Oliver's initial decision.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expects the matter to be stable for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't see this as a reversal or as the judge
backing off,'' said Gregory King, a spokesman for the American
Federation of Teachers, which fought the vouchers. ``My reading of
the order is that the judge simply wants to insure that these
students have a smooth school year and can begin school without
being troubled by where they are going to be. This is just a
short-term decision. We're confident the judge will maintain his
initial indication that we're going to win on the constitutional
grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates on both sides of the issue believe the Cleveland case
stands a good chance of winding up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1995, the Cleveland program was challenged in court
almost immediately and three months ago, the Ohio Supreme Court
court ruled it was unconstitutional because it was created as an
amendment to the state budget rather than in a separate piece of
legislation. But the court also said the program did not violate
the separation of church and state, leaving the door open for
legislators to revive it. They did so last month, prompting
opponents to file the lawsuit now before Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland program has experienced financial, academic and
safety problems over the years. But a 1997 Harvard University study
also found that the program raised test scores of students and
seemed to ``create an educational environment that parents see as
safer, more focused on academics and giving more individual
attention to the child.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's ruling, the private schools had encouraged
parents not to immediately jump back to the public system, and most
parents had decided they would find some way to continue the
private enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, some parents seemed relieved, but wary of the long-term
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really means nothing,'' said Steve Suma, who has three
children in a Catholic school and a fourth on the waiting list.
Suma said he expected Oliver would ultimately rule against vouchers
and he hoped the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit would
overturn that decision. ``This ruling today just adds more
confusion to the whole thing.''

KRAYZELBURG NUMBED BY RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1989, Lenny Krayzelburg was 14 and adjusting to
life in L.A. after moving with his family from Russia. He had been
a competitive swimmer in Odessa, but a few months into his American
odyssey he was on the verge of quitting the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Krayzelburg sat his only son down and talked him into
sticking with it. It was one of many memories that gripped
Krayzelburg on Friday after he clinched his second world record in
four days.
</P>
<P>
   Racing at the venue that will host the Olympics next fall, the
Studio City resident became the first swimmer to break the 1:56
barrier in the 200-meter backstroke. His clocking of 1 minute,
55.87 in the finals of the event at the Pan Pacific Championships
in Sydney eclipsed by seven-tenths of a second the eight-year-old
mark of Spaniard Martin Zubero.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Krayzelburg had shaved .26 seconds off American Jeff
Rouse's seven-year-old world record in the 100 backstroke. The
graduate of Fairfax High is the first male swimmer in 11 years to
hold the 100- and 200-backstroke world records concurrently.
Russian Igor Poliansky owned both marks for five months in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of numb,'' Krayzelburg said Friday in a telephone
call from the Sydney International Aquatic Centre. ``I don't
realize yet I'm the fastest backstroker that ever lived. I'm just
kind of living this dream right now. It has been an awesome week.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, who turns 24 next month, had been circling the
global standard in the 200 backstroke for three years, since
breaking the American record in the event in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week he had lowered the domestic standard four
times, most recently at the senior nationals earlier this month in
Minneapolis when he was timed at 1:56.68.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Pan Pacific Championships, Krayzelburg owned six
of the top 10 times ever recorded in the event. So he felt like the
world record was a bit overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relieved is the word,'' Krayzelburg said, summing up his
post-race emotions. ``It's really big for me to finally get the
record. The 100 I was happy with, but this was the event I felt a
little pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think there will be a little less pressure on me in
the Olympics because I don't have to worry about the time. I
finally have the record so now I can just concentrate on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg was competing primarily against the clock Friday.
His closest competitor, Australian Ray Hass, finished four seconds
behind him. That's more time than separated the first and
seventh-place finishers in the event at each of the past three
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg's training partner at USC, 1996 Olympic gold
medalist Brad Bridgewater, was fifth at 2:00.20.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, a former NCAA champion at USC, is the first U.S.
backstroke specialist to hold world records in both distances since
Rick Carey in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The aquatics-mad Australians revere swimmers much the same way
Americans do NBA players. The sellout crowds at Sydney Aquatic
Centre would appear to have adopted Krayzelburg. The affable
athlete has received the loudest and warmest cheers of anybody
outside Aussie Ian Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, the teen freestyle sensation, is the only other male
swimmer to set more than one world record at this final
international pre-Olympic tuneup (on the women's side, South
African Penny Heyns has set world records in both breaststrokes).
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was going crazy on my last 50 in the 200. I could
definitely hear it and it really helped,'' said Krayzelburg, who
became a U.S. citizen in 1995, shortly after turning down an
invitation to compete in the 1996 Olympics for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Krayzelburg transferred to USC from Santa Monica
College after placing 10th in the 200-meter backstroke in his U.S.
senior nationals debut.
</P>
<P>
   If success has come relatively late to Krayzelburg, there's a
good reason. Throughout his high school years, he didn't devote
nearly as much time to training as most of his peers did. He
couldn't, on account of a 30-hour-a-week job he held down at the
City of West Hollywood Recreation Department that helped his family
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   His close brush with retirement as an age-grouper, his
subsequent development as a member of the Westside Jewish Community
Center swim team, his high school hardships, his breakout swims at
Santa Monica College, his emergence at USC: As he stood at the
pinnacle of his sport, Krayzelburg was flooded with memories of the
good times and the bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've been thinking about all that,'' he said.

THE UNIVERSITIES' BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 29, 1999)  
 (Resending for the Chicago Tribune)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed in
the United States _ on a par with the Northwest Ordinance, the
Sherman Antitrust Act and the statute that established the Federal
Reserve System _ was the Morrill Act of 1862. Justin Morrill was a
long-time legislator from Vermont, and the 1862 act that bears his
name provided for land-grant universities to be established by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Originally chartered to teach ``agriculture and mechanic arts,''
these new universities (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
was one of them) broke the monopoly of the old Eastern citadels of
privilege, and immediately began mapping into the commercial
interests of their communities. They spread far and wide the gospel
of competition among teaching and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   More private universities followed, many of them modeled on the
German system (including Johns Hopkins, Chicago and Stanford.) Then
came extension services, trade schools, research institutes,
community colleges, national laboratories, adult education centers,
and all the rest. The massively decentralized system has been
growing ever since the Morrill Act. No other nation possesses
anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   The past 20 years have seen a new burst of entrepreneurial
behavior in higher education, probably sufficient to rival any of
these past episodes. Some of it was triggered by passage of the
1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which directed universities to license
federally supported research where possible. Some of it stemmed
from the enthusiasm for deregulation; some from the possibilities
inherent in the telecommunications and computer revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for-profit universities have begun to compete for
students with traditional non-profit institutions. Advocates of
distance learning _ meaning methods which rely on software,
videotape and the Internet _ have campus-based instruction in their
sights. The market for post-baccalaureate education is becoming
especially intense. It is a complicated world and growing more so.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly good window for keeping tabs on these
developments is a young magazine called University Business,
written for the administrators who run the system and the people
with whom they routinely work: trustees, deans, vendors, education
lenders, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Named one of the 10 best new magazines of 1997 by Library
Journal, University Business combines lively curiosity with crisp
journalistic skepticism. It may be the most interesting business
magazine startup since Gilbert Kaplan founded Institutional
Investor 30 years ago to cover the fledging money management
industry.
</P>
<P>
   University Business is the brainchild of Jeffrey Kittay, now 55.
An Amherst College graduate and a 1975 New York University Ph.D,
Kittay taught French at Yale University for seven years, then put
his late father's affairs in order. (The elder Kittay, a penniless
immigrant from England at 15, owned a chain of a hundred discount
department stores and, for a time, the underwear maker BVD.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Kittay set out to publish a magazine that would
formulate an audience of upscale academics in the much same way
that Rolling Stone had assembled a readership of the record-buying
young.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of Lingua Franca (that being a fancy way of
saying ``common tongue'') was published in 1990, with an array of
hip, revelatory articles on academic life. They were closer in
spirit to Vanity Fair than to the staid Chronicle of Higher
Education. The magazine, slowly but unmistakably, became a success.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually Kittay's interests began to extend beyond the
professors and wannabes whose antics filled the pages of Lingua
Franca to the problems of the administrators whose task was to fill
those classrooms. The business problems facing universities were at
least as great as those facing anthropology and sociology, and they
were more immediate. With the universe of suppliers of education
exploding, those who ran universities large and small needed all
the help they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Kittay launched University Business. The first issue
featured a savvy narrative of the process by which George Johnson
transformed a backwater commuter school in Fairfax, Virginia, into
George Mason University in less than 20 years. ``GMU was intended
to be a third-rate institution by the state,'' Johnson said. ``I
had to figure out how to bust out of that.'' Bust out of it he did,
lobbying shamelessly, building extravagantly, and paying through
the nose to hire a small galaxy of star professors.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues examined the buoyant growth of schools such as
England's Open University, an enormous specialist in distance
education (it began life in the 1960s as ``The University of the
Air'') that has begun partnering with several US universities,
including Florida State university; the University of Phoenix, with
its 55,000 students in its 98 campuses in 31 states; and Maricopa
Community College District in Phoenix, which with 200,000 students
has become the second largest junior college in America, behind Los
Angeles Community College District.
</P>
<P>
   There is a continual emphasis on the hard, large, and small,
choices in the ``deal-stream'' facing university administrators.
Penn State University sold Pepsi the exclusive right to market soda
in campus facilities. The deal meant $14 million for the university
over 10 years _ but no Coke anywhere on the campus or its 24
satellites. Harvard University and several other brand names signed
exclusive rights to Pangea to market sweatshirts and whatnot in
Europe _ the better to protect trademark infrtingement in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The moral, Kittay tells administrators, is ``Know what you
own.'' At some point, he says, ``You will be asked a question that
can bring you much-needed funds _ and potentially change the way
you do business:
</P>
<P>
   ```Can I resell that course?' `Can we direct-market your
students on college letterhead?' `Can we sell you unused
bandwidth?' `Can we put your name on. . .?' `Would your faculty. .
.?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the proposals will be appalling. Some will open doors
to a very desirable future. Who gets to decide? What are the
limits?''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Manhattan, University Business is a controlled
circulation magazine. That means it is free to the persons holding
high positions whom the magazine is trying to reach, and costs $49
for ten issues a year to those who do not qualify. Advertising
revenues pay the bills. They are $1 million so far in 1999, up from
$333,000 in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, the paper of record has been the Chronicle of
Higher Education. That's likely to continue. But University
Business surely will thrive _ as will the universities themselves.

BUSH FUND-RAISING MACHINE PLOWS AHEAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add specific figures from each event in paragraph 6 and to
correct style on fund-raising.) 
 (ATTN: Ga., S.C., N.C.)   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the early front-runner
for the Republican presidential nomination, Friday wrapped up a
three-state, three-day campaign swing through the Southeast that
yielded what aides estimated was another $1.1 million in campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It was proof that the fund-raising juggernaut of the Bush
campaign rolled on, undiminished by any sense among his supporters
that Bush was so firmly in the lead, in terms of both national
surveys and his first-place finish in the recent Iowa straw poll,
that they could start breathing easy and closing their check books.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were looking ahead to the general election in
November 2000, and they were going for broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need coattails in North Carolina, so we need him to have a
landslide in North Carolina,'' said Randy D. Doub, a lawyer who was
one of many hosts of a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser at the Sheraton
Imperial Hotel in Durham, N.C., on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Doub was referring to congressional and state races in 2000 that
he wanted Republicans to win, and he seemed to be assuming already
that Bush would end up in the White House, his path to glory
smoothed by the treasury he was amassing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bush campaign, $100,000 was raised in
Charleston on Wednesday. On Thursday, $175,000 was raised in
Florence, S.C. and $350,000 in Durham, N.C. Bush was expected to
raise $500,000 Friday from a $1,000-a-plate luncheon here and a
dinner in Plantation, Ga., with the same price tag. The
federally-mandated limit for individual donations to a campaign is
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $37 million that Bush had reported raising by June
30 was by far the most that any presidential candidate had
accumulated at such an early point in the race. It also raised the
question of how quickly Bush could continue to rake in the cash,
given the number of contributors he had already tapped.
</P>
<P>
   This week's tally, from a series of five $1,000-a-head events,
provided the answer: There was plenty more where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in late August, and we've been out on the road for
2-1/2 months, and that spirit is still there,'' said Don Evans, the
Texas oilman who is heading Bush's national fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and other officials with the Bush campaign said they would
not specify how much additional money they had raised before the
end of the current quarter on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But in speeches this week, Bush said that more than 105,000
people had now donated to his campaign; at the end of the last
quarter, the figure was about 74,000. If the new donors gave at a
similar rate, Bush has easily added more than $10 million to his
treasury and may be over the $50 million mark at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are keeping up a remarkable pace,'' said Ari Fleisher, a
spokesman for Elizabeth Dole, who places a distant second behind
Bush in most national polls of Republicans. In a four-day swing
last week through Western states including California, Mrs. Dole
raised about $165,000, Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly Bush's best week. In California at the end of
June, Bush raised an estimated $5 million. But the terrain he
traversed this time around _ South Carolina, North Carolina and
Georgia _ is not as famously fertile with donors, and the Bush
campaign had held fund-raising events here already.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.1 million that aides said he had raised did not subtract
what it cost Bush and his aides to put on and attend the events,
but the Bush campaign is renowned for its fiscal prudence in such
endeavors. The fund-raiser in Durham, N.C., for example, consisted
of serve-yourself appetizers _ arrayed buffet-style under an ice
sculpture of an elephant _ rather than a sit-down dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Graham, a co-chairman of the event, said that he has been
amazed at the ease of raising money for Bush. To illustrate the
point, he opened his suit jacket to reveal an inner pocket bulging
with $1,000 checks.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a lawyer from Raleigh, N.C., said the humming economy
was one explanation for the phenomenon, but that another, perhaps
more potent reason was the hunger of people who did not like
President Clinton to banish all traces of him, including Vice
President Al Gore, the early front runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get someone else in there, and this guy looks
like a winner,'' Graham said, referring to Bush. Bush's swing
through the Southeast included just as many events that raised no
money at all, and the selection of places he stopped _ including a
school in Florence, S.C., and a mostly privately funded social
services center in Marietta, Ga. _ emphasized two of the principal
themes of his campaign: improving education and encouraging
religious organizations and charities to do more to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush presented those efforts as the bulwarks of compassionate
conservatism, a phrase that has become a lynchpin of his identity
and a mantra in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for all the contributions and support that have come his way,
Bush said he was grateful but not complacent. ``I also know that
I've got a lot of work to do,'' he said.

BANK OF NEW YORK DISMISSES ONE TARGET OF MONEY-LAUNDERING
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>

in 5th graf; ADDS 6th graf with bank cooperating but not
commenting.) (See also RUSSIA-LAUNDER, RUSSIA-LAUNDER-POLITICS)

 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York said Friday that it dismissed a
vice president who is involved in a federal money laundering
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank officer, Lucy Edwards, was fired for ``gross
misconduct,'' violating the bank's code of conduct, falsification
of bank records, and failure to cooperate with the investigation,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   A bank spokesman declined to provide any details. People with
direct knowledge of the investigation said this week that documents
found in Ms. Edwards' London home indicated that she used the Bank
of New York name for dealings unrelated to her job at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's action against Ms. Edwards, 41, who was in charge of
the Eastern European division in the bank's London office, suggests
that the bank found her to bear some responsibility for the alleged
money laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   But her dismissal leaves open the question of the bank's own
responsibility for how such a large-scale operation could have gone
on for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has said that it has been cooperating with American
authori- ties for several months, but it has declined public
discussion of its deal- ings in Russia. It continues to oper- ate
as usual. Since it acknowledged the investigation on Aug. 18, its
stock has dropped $2.37 a share, closing Friday at $35.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, who lived in Queens, New York before moving to
London a few years ago, had been placed on leave, with pay, on
August 19, a few hour3 after The New York Times called the bank
about the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Her supervisor, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, was also placed on
leave at the time, and the bank has taken no further actions
against her, officials close to the investigation said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband Konstantin ``wish to state
unequivocally that they have never been involved in money
laundering in any way, shape or form,'' said aa statement issued by
the couple's lawyer, Stanley Arkin. ``Nor do they have any
knowledge of such activity.'' Ms. Kagalovsky has declined comment
but Friday in Moscow a business newspaper published an extensive
interview with Mr. Kagalovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have seized documents which show that $4.2 billion
passed through the accounts at the bank, which were in the name of
a company controlled by Ms. Edwards' husband, Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards vouched for Berlin when he opened the accounts, in
the name of a company called Benex, but the bank was not aware that
he was her husband, according to persons close to the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards and Berlin have not been seen by their neighbors in
their West London neighborhood since the scandal broke a week ago,
and could not be located.
</P>
<P>
   When Berlin registered Benex Worldwide Ltd. in Britain last
year, he gave his address as Narrowsburg, N.Y. Public records show
that Berlin and Ms. Edwards own property there.
</P>
<P>
   Benex was a trading company, which was set up principally to
move funds from Russia to other places around the world, according
to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   American and British investigators have linked Berlin to Semion
Mogilevich, who American and British authorities say is one of the
major organized crime leaders in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that Mogilevich is a master at laundering his
money, which officials say comes from prostitution, drug running,
arms trafficking and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to find Mogilevich have been unsuccessful, even for
Western law enforcement agencies in recent weeks. In an interview
with a Hungarian newspaper in June, he denied that he was engaged
in any illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they do not believe that all of the billions
of dollars that passed through the Benex accounts at the Bank of
New York came from Mogilevich. They also believe that the accounts
were used to disguise money that Russian politicians and
businessmen wanted to get out of the country without disclosing the
money's source or destination.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards was born in Leningrad in 1958, as Ludmilla Pritzker,
according to a relative. When she was 19, she met an American
merchant seaman, and they moved to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, she and her husband separated, and she moved to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   She went to work for the bank in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She was well regarded by bank officials and competitors, for her
ability to bring in Russian business. An officer at another bank,
who often saw her in Russia, described her as ``professional'' and
``spunky.'' She was also, apparently, an expert on money
laundering. In June, she was a featured speaker at a conference in
Riga, Latvia. Her topic was ``money laundering _ latest
developments and regulations.''

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Carrying a potential to strengthen
significantly, Hurricane Dennis moved toward the Southeast coast
Friday as residents from Florida to North Carolina prepared and
simply waited.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the
east coast of Florida, from Sebastian Inlet northward to Fernandina
Beach, and warned residents from central Florida through North
Carolina to ``closely monitor the progress'' of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. Friday, the hurricane was 315 miles southeast of Cape
Canaveral, Fla., and 40 miles east-northeast of Harbour Island in
the Bahamas, The Associated Press reported. With winds of 80 mph,
the storm was moving west-northwest at 7 mph, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions Friday afternoon said the storm might travel along
the Florida coast and either turn inland or gather force and hit
land anywhere from Georgia to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, said, ``We think it does have the potential to intensify and
perhaps even become a major hurricane before landfall.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, the storm would have to stay over the water
and not touch the Florida coast as it heads north, Jarrell said,
adding, ``My best guess is that it probably won't come ashore until
it gets up around either Georgia or South Carolina, and South
Carolina is the most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not good news in this city, which was hit hard in
September 1989 by Hurricane Hugo, a Category 4 hurricane that
killed 504 people in the Caribbean and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Stich, chief of the Fire and Rescue Department on
Sullivan's Island, a barrier island near Charleston, said: ``During
Hugo, we were wiped out. Much of the island had to be rebuilt. We
learned a lot from that, and I think a lot of people here don't
want to go through anything like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina ordered 1,000 National Guard
troops and 500 state troopers to prepare for storm duty Friday. In
Georgia and North Carolina, emergency planners were also on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Georgia and the Carolinas said decisions about
possible evacuations would not be made until Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's pretty much a waiting game,'' said Pamela
Swanson, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hegele of the North Carolina Division of Emergency
Management said; ``When and if the storm decides to come in, we'll
be ready for it. We're concerned about the whole coast. The storm
can swing 100 miles either way on impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, in Daytona Beach, Fla., workers cleared the beach
of life guard towers and trash cans as surfers in brightly colored
shorts rode eight-foot waves. ``It's absolutely surfer heaven,''
said Joe Wooden, the beach chief for Volusia County.
</P>
<P>
   But here along the South Carolina coast, which has been
evacuated three times in the last few years since Hurricane Hugo _
for Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996 and Hurricane Bonnie last
year _ the mood was more serious.
</P>
<P>
   At Bert's Bar on Sullivan's Island here, Brooke Hawkins, a
29-year-old bartender, served patrons this afternoon as the weather
channel played in the background. Talk of neighbors who had already
begun boarding up their homes mixed with discussions of what
everyone planned to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hawkins remembered Hurricane Hugo well, and took the threats
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   She said she planned to leave on Saturday if it looked as if the
hurricane was coming this way. ``I live one block from the beach,
and the biggest danger for me is flooding,'' she said. ``I'm trying
to figure out where to put my furniture _ up on cinder blocks, or
my upstairs neighbor said I could put it up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tate, 42, a real estate agent on Sullivan's Island, moved
here after Hurricane Hugo and said she did not plan to board up her
house, but did plan to leave on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've boarded up the windows and moved all the furniture up
against the wall a few times before, and nothing, nothing,
nothing,'' Ms. Tate said. ``So I'm not going to do it this time. I
don't have the energy, and I have insurance. I can't do anything
about the hurricane coming, so I'm not going to worry about it.''

`THEY'RE STILL CHAMPIONS' TO PEOPLE OF TOMS RIVER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ala., Japan)   By MARIA NEWMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ When 12-year-old Mike Casale struck out
Friday, dashing the world championship hopes of his team, the Toms
River East Little League, Tony Cohen, the groundskeeper and the
only paid employee of the league, choked back a tear.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and a handful of others were at the team's complex here to
prepare for the players' homecoming on Sunday. They sat in stunned
silence in front of a television set as their team lost, 3-2, to
Phenix City, Ala., which will play Osaka, Japan, for the world
championship on Saturday. But the silence lasted for only a few
seconds before everyone started chanting what had been the mantra
of the town for the last few days:
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still champions,'' said Rosa Fisher, whose son, Scott,
was the pitcher in the Toms River team that won last year's Little
League World Series. ``It's only a game.''
</P>
<P>
   With the same grace that the boys on the team showed their
victors in Williamsport, Pa. _ they stood on the dugout steps and
applauded Phenix City after the loss _ the people of Toms River say
they will honor their Boys of Summer with a celebration even though
they will be coming home without the world championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough game, but they'll get a great welcome home,''
said Stan Benisz, a member of the Little League's board, which had
put up white tents on one of the fields at the league's complex on
Windsor Avenue for the celebration. As soon as the game was over,
league directors were calling each other to organize who would pick
up drinks and other supplies for the celebration. Workers from the
Toms River Regional School District erected barricades to direct
the crowds that are expected to descend on the sports complex when
the boys return from Williamsport on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Because last year's team won the World Championship, this town
had become accustomed to the news trucks driving up and down their
streets. Now, the national limelight will be turned off. This
year's team may not get invited to visit with Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman, as last year's team did, or to appear on the Rosie
O'Donnell Show. But that was not why the town was sad.
</P>
<P>
   The loss Friday was the end of another cycle in the rhythm of
this town, where parents plan their lives around their children's
activities. As in towns across the country, parents rearrange their
work schedules to drive their children to Little League games or to
act as coaches, and put in their time working behind the counter at
the Nibble Nook, the concession stand that sells the hot dogs and
the candy to raise money for the uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the rest of the country forgets that Toms River was
home to World Champions, parents here will be driving children to
games in car pools, everyone said, because winning was never what
it was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's about families,'' said Dave Johnson, who was the
president last year of the Toms River East Little League, which has
1,200 players. ``That's a good fundamental reason why we continue
to do well. It's not because of the coaches, although we have good
coaches, or the talent, even though we have great talent. It's
because of the parents and how everyone is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes for the businesses and the city officials, too, who
support the team. Even adults who once had kids on the team but
don't any longer still want to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ken Kondek, who lives in a blue house at the edge of the
Toms River East Little League sports complex, and is one of the
coaches this year, even though his children are in their late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Or businesses like the Shop Rite Grocery Store, where Kondek is
the produce manager, which has given him time off for the finals
and helps sponsor the team.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Feet First sporting shoes stores, which operates without
its owner, Mike Gaynor, who managed both this year's team and last
year's. Or the WaWa convenience stores that are donating drinks and
sub sandwiches for Sunday's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the community can share the success of these children,
it's just great,'' said Lucy Greene, president of the Toms River
Ocean County Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Fisher and her husband, Bob, attended every game in
Williamsport this year, like the parents of many of last year's
players. They drove back last night, after the rain washed out the
game in the second inning, only because their older son, Mike, was
leaving for college.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fisher, who is a fifth-grade teacher at North Dover
Elementary School here, can't even begin to count how many times
she has sat on bleachers watching her children compete. Her sons
Scott and Mike and daughter Meredith have played on a variety of
teams, from T-ball, when they were barely out of their toddler
years, to field hockey and high school basketball, never dreaming
that any of them would end up in a world championship. When Scott
pitched in the finals last year, she said, she felt it in her gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on the edge of your seat all the time,'' Mrs. Fisher
said. ``My husband kept telling me to just enjoy the game. So on
the outside I tried to smile and look happy, but on the inside, I
needed milk. I was getting an ulcer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Fisher, who owns a business that makes glass and
porcelain gifts, said that it is important to be there. ``You only
have so many years to watch your kids grow up,'' he said.

BIG DAY FOR GREENE, MILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Maurice Greene of the United States completed a
sweep of the men's 100 and 200 meters Friday on day 7 of the World
Track and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Greene won the men's 200 meters in 19.90 seconds to become the
first man to win the 100 and 200 in the same World Championships,
as a crowd of 42,339 looked on. Last Sunday, Greene, the world
record-holder in the 100 meters, won the short sprint in 9.80,
second-fastest of all-time and only a hundredth of a second off his
world record of 9.79 set in June.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 200 meters, however, it was Inger Miller, not
Marion Jones, who emerged victorious. Miller ran a world-leading
and lifetime-best 21.77 in the absence of Jones, who withdrew from
the meet after pulling up in the 200 semifinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, runner-up to Jones in the 100-meter final, eclipsed
Jones' world-leading mark of 21.81. Jones had not lost in the 200
in two years until her injury in the World Championships. Miller's
winning margin of 0.45 over runner-up Beverly McDonald of Jamaica
(22.22) was the largest in World Championship history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a one-woman show,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 meters, former USC standout Miller, 27, lowered her
personal best in three successive races, clocking 10.79 to knock
off .16 from her previous best of 10.95.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance on Friday was the first time Miller had dipped
below 22 seconds and knocked .33 off her lifetime best of 22.10 set
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal here was to win gold and I did that,'' said Miller.
``I had hoped to break 22 seconds, but it is incredible to run
21.77. It has just been unbelievable. PRs, PRs, PRs!''
</P>
<P>
   Both Miller and Greene will be seeking their third medals in the
400-meter relay finals Sunday. First-round and semifinal heats of
the sprint relay will be conducted today.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200, Greene, running in lane 3, ran a strong curve
and maintained his advantage over Brazilian Claudinei da Silva
(20.00). Nigerian Francis Obikwelu, who ran 19.84 in the
semifinals, was third in 20.11 after being called for a false
start.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing the finish, Greene, 25, knelt on the track and
gave a prayer of thanks rather than his customary flamboyant
celebration. As the national anthem played during the awards
ceremony, Greene fought back tears. Green felt relieved after the
stress of enduring four rounds of the 100 and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw Inger win, I just had to do it for the group,''
Greene said. ``Do it for Ato (Boldon), my coach and for everyone
else. I'm very tired and to come out here and perform in the 200
meters is just great.''
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs, 35, an Argyll Academy graduate (now Campbell
Hall) and the silver medalist in the 1997 World Championships, won
her semifinal of the women's 1,500 meters in 4:04.75 for the
fastest qualifying time for Sunday's finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100-meter hurdles, Gail Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic
champion from UCLA, moved a step closer to her third world title in
the barriers with a semifinal victory in 12.70.

 &HT;    Florida watching, waiting for unpredictable hurricane
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida braced itself for the first
hurricane of the season Friday as Hurricane Dennis disobeyed
forecasts and continued its plodding course toward the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 miles of coastline, from Sebastian Inlet to
Fernandina Beach, came under a hurricane watch as the storm, still
just a Category 1 with 80 mph winds but gaining strength, drifted
northwest at about 7 mph. Meteorologists had predicted Dennis would
change its course as it encountered a U-shaped weather trough over
the United States, blowing it well offshore. But Friday,
forecasters found themselves still waiting for the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they remained confident the stubborn storm would
eventually cooperate, turn north and glide up the coast without
making landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no certainty Dennis will turn north, but that's the
best information we have, that the storm will turn more parallel to
the coast and not get any closer than between 80 and 100 miles,''
National Weather Service senior forecaster Tony Cristaldi said.
``But tropical weather is a fickle creature.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis formed earlier this week along with Hurricane Cindy and
tropical depression Emily and has repeatedly defied meteorologists,
meandering forward only to stall. It has remained just beyond the
reach of a river of air powered by the weather trough that could
drive it more northward. Meteorologists now say the turn should
occur today, and if not today, then Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As it continues on a northwest track today, particularly as it
passes by the Bahama Islands, it will increasingly assert its
presence on Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn today, Palm Beach County residents should be able to
look east and see the upper clouds of the storm, said National
Weather Center meteorologist Jim Lushine. The storm will also be
stronger, probably a Category 2 with winds up to 110 mph. By this
afternoon, the storm should be east of Vero Beach. As it swells and
moves north, strong winds could graze the coast. Forecasters say
tropical storm-force winds will extend 145 miles out. Still, the
western edge of the storm _ our side _ is the weaker side. Rainfall
in the path of the storm could reach up to 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm turns, it should reach South Carolina by Monday,
blossoming into a Category 3 with winds between 111 and 130 mph,
said National Hurricane Center meteorologist Todd Kimberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is the gradual turn,'' he said. ``We think
in three days' time, there will be a major hurricane sitting off
the Carolinas waiting to impact that area.''
</P>
<P>
   As it trudges northward, deep ocean swells will pound the beach,
Cristaldi said. Buoys anchored about 120 miles off the Florida
coast measured 14-foot swells Friday. The surf zone from Palm Beach
County north should get 6-foot waves, with the waves increasing
farther north as the storm comes closer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So unless you're taking the Exxon Valdez out there, you don't
want to be in a boat offshore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, where the storm goes remains at the mercy of the trough.
Overnight Thursday, it shifted slightly west as a smaller system
materialized, Lushine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of different sizes of troughs. The big
trough is the U-shaped one. But superimposed on that is a bunch of
little wiggles and those little wiggles can make the big thing
fluctuate,'' Lushine said.
</P>
<P>
   Any drastic change in the storm's current course _ say making a
U-turn and heading back our way _ is unlikely because it would
require a major change in other weather systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been storms that have gotten north and turned
around and come back, but those are very different situations than
what we have with the trough,'' he said. ``That possibility is a
one-in-99,000 chance of happening.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of Friday, Dennis continued to tease the Bahamas,
passing within 40 miles of Eleuthera in the middle of the chain. It
was expected to come close, and maybe cross, the Abacos on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Florida Straits, surfers reveled in the growing
swells while state officials revved up their emergency operations
center and continued to heed the threat of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District, which began
lowering canals in Miami-Dade County over the weekend, kept
lowering canals in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, said
spokeswoman Ann Overton. The district will keep canals low until
the storm clears the district.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Community Affairs cranked its emergency
operations center up a notch, calling in staff ready to direct
evacuations should Dennis hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach erosion is always an issue when you have a storm coming
in,'' said Richard Walesky, director of the county's Department of
Environmental Resources Management. ``There's no (immediate)
preparation one can do. We prepare all year long by building wider
beaches. So you look where the narrowest, most unprotected beaches
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Dennis, Cindy and Emily continued to meander aimlessly.
Cindy, 545 miles southeast of Bermuda, packed 105 mph winds, but
was moving out to the open sea, Kimberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, Cindy is kind of tugging on Emily a little and
slurping it up from the north,'' he said.

 &HT;    Stewart on pole

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Tony Stewart snapped a five-race stranglehold
on the pole position by the Wallace brothers at Bristol Motor
Speedway on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart will start in the No. 1 spot for tonight's Goody's 500
after posting the fastest lap in qualifying at 124.589 mph. It was
Stewart's second pole of his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the race, this is one of the most critical
tracks, as far as track position is concerned,'' Stewart said.
``(The cars) run so fast here, and it seems like you get in lapped
traffic early here, so (the pole) will be a big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Rusty and Kenny Wallace had captured the pole at the
half-mile oval the previous five races, including the past three by
Rusty. Stewart broke the streak, but Rusty and Kenny still
qualified impressively, winning the second and third positions.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the top five consists of Jeff Gordon and Ward
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get the pole, but not
real bad,'' Rusty said. ``At least I'm on the front row. If I could
have kept the string of poles going, that would have been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said, ``This is a good track for us Wallaces. Tony just
ran a little bit quicker than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who is having the best rookie year for a Cup driver
since Davey Allison in 1987, is coming off his top career
performance, finishing third at Michigan Speedway last week. He has
yet to win a race but led for 55 laps during the spring race at
Bristol before crashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like (tonight's race) is the best chance of winning a
race this year,'' Stewart said. ``I felt like the spring race was
one that got away from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice coming back here, because we feel like we might
really have a shot at winning, if we're going to win one this year.
We're really happy to get (the car) on the front row this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett was the final driver to
qualify during the first round, earning the No. 25 spot. It will be
his worst start in the past six races.

NEBRASKA TRIBE IN BIG FIGHT OVER LITTLE CASINO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Kan., Ala., Neb., Wis., Vt., Calif.)  (bl)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern
Nebraska found itself Friday at the forefront of an increasingly
heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty
ends and state control begins.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its
reservation. Friday that little casino nearly led a U.S. District
Court judge in Omaha, Neb., to take an unprecedented step: the
jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Although the judge, William Cambridge, ultimately decided
against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive
victory. Cambridge suggested that federal prosecutors might want to
pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared
once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal
because it had lacked state approval ever since opening 3 1/2 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of such approval violates a federal law, the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which requires an Indian tribe to
strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its
reservation lies if it wants to open a casino. There are now about
145 such compacts between states and various tribes. But Nebraska,
opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate
one with the Santee Sioux, the tribe with a stake in the proceeding
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes
over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida
to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be
exempt from state regulation and taxation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Only Monday, the California Supreme Court overturned a ballot
measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on
Indian reservations. The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes'
ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with Las Vegas. The
tribes' position was supported by Gov. Gray Davis, but the court
ruled that it conflicted with the state constitution's ban on
casino-style games like blackjack and 21.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Florida, Kansas and Alabama, trying to block the
opening of Indian casinos within their borders, have sued the U.S.
Interior Department with the aim of overturning new rules that
allow the federal government to license tribal casinos in cases
where states are reluctant to negotiate compacts.
</P>
<P>
   And Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson refused to renew one-year
gambling agreements with that state's 11 tribes until they agreed
to pay $22 million in lieu of taxes, up from $350,000 under the old
one-year agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, when we didn't have any pie, nobody bothered with
us,'' said Sheila Morago, a spokeswoman for the National Indian
Gaming Association. ``Now that we have a small piece of the pie,
they want our filling. It's just a constant intrusion on the
treaties that were signed long ago, on the tribes' sovereign
rights. Every time you get a little farther, you take one step
forward and two steps back.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   David Rocchio, deputy legal counsel to Vermont Gov. Howard Dean,
who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the
National Governors' Association, said that ``the concern that
governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes.''
Rather, Rocchio said, ``the concern is with the carve-out from
state regulation, such as land use, police power and other
ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos _ and the
impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on
other lands in the state.'' Like gambling venues everywhere,
casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation of the Santee Sioux, the tribe involved in the
court showdown in Nebraska on Friday, lies on the Missouri River
just across the border with South Dakota, and is home to about
1,000 tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, the Santee Sioux opened the Ohiya Casino on
reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a
7-Eleven store. It has 71 video gambling and slot machines, and
attracts mostly elderly people from nearby farming communities. It
takes in just $900,000 or so a year and employs only 23 people, but
tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with
74 percent unemployment. Tribe chairman Arthur Denny said the
casino actually supports about four relatives of each employee and
has brought a decline in alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   But Nebraska, which does not allow casino gambling anywhere in
the state, has refused to negotiate a compact with the Santee
Sioux.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning, the U.S. attorney's office in Omaha
has tried to get the casino shut down. A federal appeals court
found the casino illegal in 1998, and the Supreme Court, without
comment, let that ruling stand.
</P>
<P>
   This February, Cambridge began fining the tribe $3,000 a day,
and in June he doubled the fine, to $6,000 a day. None of the debt,
now totaling $726,000, has been paid by the Santee Sioux, and the
purpose of the hearing Friday was for Cambridge to consider whether
to put the 11 members of the tribal council in jail for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he decided against doing so, saying that because the
tribe voted in a referendum this month to keep the casino open, the
leaders no longer had the authority to close it. He told the
federal prosecutors that to get the casino closed, they would have
to pursue the case as a criminal matter, not a civil one. Why that
would make any difference in a practical sense was not entirely
clear.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the judge was hardly sympathetic to the Santee
Sioux, saying the fines would continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was not certain where the case would proceed from here. U.S.
Attorney Thomas Monaghan said his office had several options, but
he would not elaborate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the hearing, tribal members who had made the 160-mile trip
to Omaha erupted in cheers and sang tribal songs, celebrating the
judge's decision not to jail the leaders. The tribe is hoping that
the new Interior Department rules will allow it to work out a
legitimate means of running the casino, but that process, even if
successful, could take years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to break anybody's laws,'' said Thelma
Thomas, the casino's manager. ``We're just trying to make life
better for our people.''

NORTHEAST SUGGESTS LESS-STRINGENT RULE FOR POLLUTION FROM OTHER
REGIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 6th graf to further emphasize that proposal is tentative;
10th graf to give governors' party breakdown)    (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After years of battling over smokestack pollution
from the Midwest and the South, 11 states in the Northeastern
region, led by New York, have signaled for the first time a
willingness to retreat significantly from their demands that other
states reduce their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted in the wake of legal setbacks, a proposal by negotiators
for the 11 Northeastern states to settle the dispute would accept
emissions of nitrogen oxides, a key class of pollutants by
Midwestern and Southern industry, at a rate 67 percent higher than
the Northeast has demanded until now.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the 11
Northeastern states _ Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Maryland _ had been negotiating methods of meeting the
criteria of the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The less stringent standard, introduced by negotiators for the
Northeastern states Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, would
still mean a significant drop in nitrogen oxides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an option that all the states agreed to take back
and discuss,'' said New York Environmental Conservation
Commissioner John Cahill, who represents the state in the talks. He
described it as ``something that was worked on by all the states of
the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials of other states involved in the talks, along with
environmentalists who closely follow them, said it was the
administration of New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, that
had taken the lead in crafting the new stance. While the
representatives of the 10 other Northeastern states knew the
proposal was to be floated as a trial balloon, it was not clear
whether their states would accept the standard in the long run. But
New York's position carries great weight, and Cahill has acted as
the region's lead negotiator in the talks with 14 states in the
Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are furious at the apparent retreat. ``Anyone
concerned with clean air and health would have huge reason to be
outraged by this,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental
health for the American Lung Association of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   But Cahill suggested that a deal with the other regions may be
the best that the Northeastern states can attain, although he
insisted that the Northeast has not given up hope that its original
position might prevail. The EPA, which has supported the
Northeast's position, had been moving to impose the more stringent
standard on the other regions, but after two recent setbacks in
court, the EPA has pressed states on both sides to reach a
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists and state officials saw politics behind
the shift. ``A negotiated deal is a big group hug among all these
Republican governors,'' said a top environmental official with one
of the Northeastern states, who asked that his name and the name of
his state not be used. He noted that Pataki, who would like to be
considered for his party's vice presidential nomination, ``would
get a lot of the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that as Pataki tries to enhance his
stature within the national Republican Party, it cannot help him to
be involved with an intramural dispute with other Republican
governors, particularly when his pro-environment stance can be
portrayed as anti-business. Among the Northeastern states, six
governors are Republicans, four are Democrats and one is an
independent. Among the Southern and Midwestern states, seven
governors are Republicans and seven are Democrats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that New York and the Northeastern
states still have an important weapon left in their arsenal: they
can sue under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to force
action by the EPA and the other states.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, it would be New York's state attorney general, Eliot
Spitzer, a Democrat _ not the governor _ who decides the state's
position in litigation, and Spitzer might be able to pursue a
lawsuit on the emission standards even if Pataki is unwilling.
Officials in Spitzer's office declined to comment Friday on the
Northeastern states' new proposal, saying that they were still
studying it.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said, ``No one is taking any option off the table,''
including litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, EPA officials fear that if they try to impose
a tougher standard on the Midwest and South, rather than striking a
deal, the process will drag past the 2000 presidential election,
when there might be a Republican administration that could drop the
matter entirely. Environmentalists say that those same EPA
officials do not want a pitched regional dispute to hinder Vice
President Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern states have long complained that their high levels
of nitrogen oxides are largely attributable to industry,
particularly electric power plants, in the Midwest and South, a
claim supported by the EPA and by several independent studies. The
nitrogen oxides travel east and northeast on the prevailing winds,
and contribute to ozone and to acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All the major urban areas of the Northeast, especially New York
City and its suburbs, fail to meet the Clean Air Act standards for
ozone pollution, which burns the eyes, stings the lungs and can,
over time, contribute to serious health problems like asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, 11 Northeastern states have filed
petitions with the EPA, asking it to force industries in states to
the west and south to meet, by 2003, a standard of 0.15 pounds of
nitrogen oxide emissions for every million British thermal units of
fuel consumption n summer, when ozone pollution is at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeastern states have all agreed to move to the 0.15
standard, regardless of what other states do. That has raised fears
in the power industry, which is moving to more freewheeling
competition among power producers, that Northeastern power plants,
forced to adopt expensive emission controls, could be put at a
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the Midwestern and Southern states have proposed
a standard of 0.25 pounds, 67 percent higher. Under the proposal
made this week, the Northeastern states would accept that position,
at least at first, with a 0.25 standard by 2003, and a later
reduction to 0.2, 33 percent higher than their original demand.
That marked the first time the Northeast states have signaled that
they would accept anything less stringent than 0.15, and officials
with some of those states said they were not sure their states
could actually agree to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, where state rules are among the strictest in
the nation, many power plants and factories already operate within
the 0.15 standard. New York's Department of Environmental
Conservation estimates that the statewide average is about 0.2.
</P>
<P>
   In some Midwestern states, the average is two to three times as
high. Even the 0.25 standard would require many power plants and
factories in the South and the Midwest to install costly pollution
control devices, and the stricter the standard, the more expensive
it would be to meet.
</P>
<P>
   If all the regions cut output to 0.15, New York estimates,
summertime nitrogen oxide levels in the New York metropolitan
region would drop by about 80 percent. At 0.25, the decline would
be more than 65 percent _ significant, but not enough to get the
metropolitan area into compliance with federal ozone standards.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said last year that it would impose the 0.15 standard,
but several Midwestern states and utilities challenged that
decision in court. In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled that the EPA had to establish the merits
of its nitrogen oxide standards before it forced states to submit
plans for reduction of the compounds. An earlier ruling by the
court said the EPA had not justified its standards on ozone and
soot.
</P>
<P>
   Given the court's decision, Cahill said, the Northeastern states
may not be able to rely on the EPA. ``The uncertainty of the court
ruling certainly is giving all parties reason to pause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wooley, counsel to the Clean Air Task Force and a
professor of environmental law at Pace University, said Cahill's
fear is understandable but wrong. Like other environmentalists,
Wooley argued that a negotiated settlement could be unenforceable _
a worry that Cahill acknowledged might be well-founded. Wooley
would prefer going to court to seek an 0.15 standard.

NEW YORK SCHOOLS CHIEF WEIGHS JOB IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The University of Washington is trying to recruit the
New York City schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, to head a new research
institute, and Crew acknowledged Friday that he was interested in
the job.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor also said he hoped to stay in New York till his
contract expires next June, but he refused to rule out the
possibility that he would leave sooner.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, Crew said, he has repeatedly discussed
job possibilities with the administration of the university and
several members of the university's board of regents, including
William Gates, the father of the co-founder of Microsoft. Richard
McCormick, the president of the university, confirmed Friday that
he was actively recruiting Crew and said that he and the chancellor
had agreed to meet again in Seattle in September.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Crew said that after four years
in New York, some marked by acrimonious tension with the mayor, he
was interested in a job in the Northwest for both professional and
personal reasons. But he said that, in spite of some
soul-searching, he had not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had always believed that his fifth year would be the
one in which he would consolidate gains and show real progress and
that he wanted to stay at least through the end of his contract.
But he said that he was concerned about what he called ``the very
slippery slope'' of the political landscape in New York City, and
that if it became impossible for him to carry out his agenda, he
could not make an absolute commitment to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to ask me to try to make a promise,''
Crew said. ``At any time one could be within an extraordinary arena
within which the best and only option would be to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, through a spokeswoman, declined to
comment Friday on Crew's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he were to leave now, Crew would be the longest-serving
chancellor in New York City since Frank Macchiarola, who served
four and a half years, from July 1978 to February 1983. Crew will
complete four years in October.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1970 and 1995, when Crew took over, the New York City
school system saw 11 chancellors come and go, most driven out by
the contentious politics of the job, despite much hand-wringing
over the destabilizing effects of such a revolving door. Indeed,
the notorious advice of one departing chancellor, Joseph Fernandez,
to his successor, Ramon Cortines, in 1993, was ``don't come.''
Cortines lasted two years before he left under pressure from
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of his contract, Crew must inform his board in
December whether he wants to exercise a two-year renewal clause in
June. The board must then decide in January whether it wants to
keep him, Crew said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His departure between now and June could throw a series of
policy initiatives into doubt. Next summer, his administration
plans to expand mandatory summer school to an estimated 300,000
children, a huge logistical challenge. In response to low scores on
new reading and math tests, Crew has embarked on a shake-up of the
city's worst schools, taking more than 40 under his direct control.
Dozens of principals' jobs and several top administrative jobs
remain to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said Friday that he is eager to see those initiatives bear
fruit, and that his relationship with Giuliani has improved in just
the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My commitment to this system is unequivocal,'' Crew said. ``I
have loved this place for a very long period of time out of my
life. I see this as a banner year for the school system, and I
think it will post some enormous gains.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, the university president, said that he and other top
administrators had been recruiting Crew to become the director of
the Institute for K-12 Leadership, a program to train
superintendents and principals, just approved by the university's
board.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has strong ties to the state of Washington. He was
superintendent of schools in Tacoma, about 30 miles south of
Seattle, before coming to New York, and still maintains a home
outside Tacoma. Two of his four children are attending the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Personal finances could also be a factor in Crew's decision. He
now makes $245,000, a salary beyond the reach of most university
jobs.

PHELPS DODGE OPENS HOSTILE BID FOR SMALLER RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Colo., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge Corp., one of the world's largest mining companies,
said Friday that it was embarking on a hostile takeover of two
smaller rivals, Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals, after they
rebuffed an initial offer last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the chief executives of the two companies, Phelps
Dodge chief executive Douglas Yearley said that some of their
statements rejecting his company's offer were ``no more than a
public relations gambit'' and said he saw ``no evidence in your
conduct to date that you have any willingness to pursue
transactions that are in the best interest of your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after rejecting Phelps Dodge's offer of $2.6 billion,
Asarco and Cyprus Amax, which are in the midst of a merger,
countered with a demand for $3.3 billion, an increase of more than
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While saying they were willing to discuss a takeover by Phelps
Dodge, the two companies also took steps to block the suitor,
including an effort to gain investor support for the original
two-way merger by promising to pay a $5-a-share bonus to
shareholders of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge filed documents Friday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to solicit support from shareholders of Asarco
and Cyprus Amax and sued executives of the two companies, saying
they had prohibited directors from learning the details of the
Phelps Dodge offer and approved ``excessive breakup fees'' in the
two-way merger deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yearley said in his letter that although his company preferred
to negotiate, it felt obligated to force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to this compelling three-way combination,''
he said. Referring skeptically to the two companies' statement that
they were willing to discuss a takeover, Yearley said that ``if
Asarco and Cyprus Amax are truly interested in a negotiated
transaction, we are ready to begin discussions immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge said Wednesday that the demand for $3.3 billion was
``totally unreasonable,'' and Yearley indicated Friday that his
company had no intention of raising its $2.6 billion bid. ``We
continue to believe our offer is fully priced and compelling,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco spokesman Jerry Cooper would not comment on the Phelps
Dodge move, and messages left at Cyprus Amax's headquarters got no
response.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Burnett, director of Merger Insight, a financial research
firm in New York, said Phelps Dodge was apparently willing to fight
for the two companies because ``there are very few copper producers
left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper prices are in a downtrend right now,'' he said, ``but
they obviously will recover, and Phelps Dodge wants to have a
bigger market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger efforts by the three companies are part of a wave of
consolidations in the basic-commodity industries.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way combination that Phelps Dodge is pursuing would
create the world's largest copper producer, surpassing Codelco,
Chile's state-owned mining company.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge, based in Phoenix, ranks as the fifth-largest
copper producer; Asarco, based in New York, is seventh, and Cyprus
Amax, based in Englewood, Colo., is ninth. Phelps Dodge had revenue
of $3.1 billion last year compared with $2.2 billion for Asarco and
$1.7 billion for Cyprus Amax. The three companies also produce
other minerals like zinc, silver, gold and molybdenum, which is
used to harden steel.
</P>
<P>
   The world copper market is being flooded with material from
Chile and Indonesia, where mining costs are lower and the mines are
newer. Many analysts say they expect the depressed copper prices to
remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. Copper has been
trading at 70 to 75 cents a pound lately, the lowest level in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   From a review of the SEC documents, Burnett said it appeared
that Phelps Dodge's strategy was to break up the merger of Asarco
and Cyprus Amax in hopes of buying the companies separately.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shareholders of the two companies are scheduled to vote on the
two-way merger Monday. Yearley said he regarded the vote as a
referendum on his proposal. With a favorable vote for the two-way
merger, he said, Phelps Dodge would ``withdraw our substantial
premium proposal and will not bid further.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said the findings of a federal antitrust review of the
Asarco-Cyprus Amax deal was expected early next week. And, he said,
many analysts believe federal authorities will request further
information from the two companies, which would give Phelps Dodge
more time to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the early stages here,'' Burnett said. ``We're only
in the third or fourth inning.''

CLEMENS CONFOUNDS GRIFFEY AS YANKEES WIN 8-0 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-YANKEES-MARINERS-NYT  (ko) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens' Hall of Fame credentials do not
particularly interest his kids. Sure, they are pleased for their
father when he pitches well _ ``Nice game, Dad'' _ but like most
young baseball fans they are intrigued with star power. Make sure
you don't let Ken Griffey Jr. get a hit against you, his children
have said to him.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens met the expectations of his kids Friday night, shutting
down Griffey, and Yankees manager Joe Torre and club officials had
to have been even more pleased with how Clemens shackled the
All-Star center fielder and his teammates. Demonstrating great
command of his fastball and throwing very hard, Clemens shut out
the Mariners for eight innings, allowing just four hits and
striking out nine, and the Yankees whipped Seattle, 8-0, before
51,985 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees easily piled up runs against Seattle's rookie
pitchers Gil Meche and Robert Ramsey, scoring four runs in the
fourth and ending any chance of the game being a fair fight.
Clemens, who has not allowed any runs in two of his last three
starts, was dominant, after combating his usual first-inning attack
of adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks or so, there has been a slow metamorphosis
in the Yankees' catching rotation. Joe Girardi had always been
responsible for catching David Cone and Andy Pettitte, while Jorge
Posada worked with Clemens, Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez. But
in Cone's last two games, Posada has been the catcher _ after Torre
had approached Cone about the possibility _ and last night, the
more experienced Girardi caught Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   A catcher's influence on the pitcher can be subtle,
imperceptible to everyone but the pitcher and catcher, but dramatic
in effect. Torre has used Girardi in the past when he wanted his
catcher to effect a particular change in a pitcher. Last year, when
the Yankees were looking for Hernandez to pitch inside more,
Girardi stepped in for a game, and once, at a time when the staff
wanted Irabu to work faster, Girardi was called upon.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has talked about how Clemens needs to pitch ahead in the
count more, to throw more strikes. Teaming with Girardi Friday
night, Clemens _ who can be a challenge to catch, because he
prefers his catchers to use a complicated set of signs to
camouflage the intent _ was better in that regard. It would stand
to reason that Girardi might catch Clemens again.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (12-6) had spurts of wildness. He threw 29 pitches in
the first inning, when the Mariners loaded the bases but could not
score. But Clemens' fastball was stunning; he threw 96 to 97 mph,
often jamming the Seattle hitters, and he had an effective slider
as well.
</P>
<P>
   He bested Griffey in battles that said a lot about how good
Clemens' fastball was, as well as the caliber of his control. In
each at-bat, Clemens attacked Griffey with high fastballs, inside
and above the hands, and as pure as Griffey's swing is, he could
not catch Clemens' fastball. He swung and missed twice and fouled
back two pitches in the first inning, before drawing a walk; two
innings later, Griffey fouled back a fastball and then popped up
the next fastball to third base.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey moved ahead in the count in the sixth inning, 3 balls
and 1 strike, and Clemens went after him with fastballs, at the
hands. Griffey fouled back one, and Clemens called Girardi to the
mound to discuss their options, and Clemens decided to tease
Griffey with another fastball, shoulder high. Griffey swung and
missed, the eighth of Clemens' nine strikeouts. &QL;

SOSA UNDERAPPRECIATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite numbers that would fatigue a Pentium computer chip,
there are still some people in baseball who have not come to terms
with Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   When they hear his name, they think of the former free-swinger
who seemed more likely to break a strike out record than a home run
record.
</P>
<P>
   When they look at his 1998 numbers, his stunning 66 home runs
and 158 runs batted in, they rationalize it as a totally random
occurrence, baseball's equivalent of a meteor shower.
</P>
<P>
   And when they line him up against Mark McGwire, they give him a
baseball Oscar as best supporting actor, even though he was the
N.L. MVP.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that while McGwire was always the man most likely
to join Babe Ruth and Roger Maris in baseball immortality, Sosa
didn't just arrive on the planet last June. He did not just walk
out of the ivy at Wrigley Field like some character in ``Field of
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his otherworldy season in 1998 and his 1999 sequel -- he
began last night's game against the Dodgers with 53 home runs and a
month left in the season -- Sammy Sosa was one of the best power
hitters in baseball, and if some people couldn't see that, they
just weren't looking at the right places.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, his breakthrough year, Sosa became the first 30-30 man
-- 33 homers, 36 steals -- in Cubs history. He had 93 RBI to go
with that, as well as a 6-for-6 game that was part of a streak of
nine consecutive hits, also a Cubs record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he had 25 home runs when baseball took a walk. In 1995,
he finished second in the N.L. in home runs (36) and rr RBI (119)
and posted his second 30-30 season. In and around Waverly Avenue,
he was already etched in Cub lore, having hit the 10,000th home run
in team history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, in what may be the most overlooked statistic of the
'90s, he had 40 home runs and 100 RBI as of August 20, which is
when his season was ended a fastball fractured his hand. He was
already doing his little hop-step after home runs by then, too. It
just hadn't become part of the baseball culture yet.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1997 season, Sosa already had 1,000 career
hits. And in a few days, he'll become only the fourth Cub with 300
career home runs (he has 297), supporting a list that includes
Ernie Banks, Billy Williams and Ron Santo.
</P>
<P>
   So the real surprise isn't Sosa. The surprise is that we're all
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a very hard sport,'' said Sosa before Friday's
game, in which he was serenaded by the fans a half-dozen times.
``You have to be prepared mentally every day and make adjustments.
That's something you learn over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of people thought I would come back and
have this kind of year. But it is easier now, because I have done
it. I feel it is my job (to produce).''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa used the word ``job'' at least a 15 times during a
15-minute interview session. But few people use that word with the
kind of affection and dedication as Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   He loves his work and is proud of it. He doesn't get tired of
playing 162 games a season, doesn't get tired of being the subject
of fan interest home and away, doesn't get tired of the endless,
repetive questions, which have all been asked and answered hundreds
of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired? I'm only three years old, so I don't get tired,'' he
said with a grin. He's actually just 30. ``This is my job. I don't
see why anyone in the world would get tired paying baseball. And I
like that people come out to the park to see me play, to see the
Cubs play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing different this season is that we're not in the
pennant race. We haven't played as well as we did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Last year's Cubs beat the Giants in a one-game playoff
and made their first trip to the postseason since 1984. This year,
Sosa has as many home runs as the Cubs do wins (53). Former Dirtbag
Steve Trachsel won the playoff game last year; Friday, he suffered
his 16th loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer winning (than setting personal goals),'' he
said. ``That's the only thing that could satisfy me more. You're
always happier when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has no predictions for this year's home run race, or where
and how it will stack up to last year. There are those in baseball
who believe last year's sensation is being devalued with Sosa and
McGwire on a similar pace.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans aren't necessarily in agreement. Fans in St. Louis
would like to see the Cardinals win more games, but they're still
fanatics over McGwire's bombs. Likewise, Cub fans are still wild
about Sammy. Fans at Dodger Stadium Friday certainly didn't come to
see him ground out to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens now? I don't know,'' Sosa said with a shrug.
``Tomorrow is tomorrow. All you can do is come ready to play and
play hard. I always try to play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He always has, too, even if no one noticed.

SMOTHERING ALL COUNTERPLAY, KHALIFMAN RETAKES THE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT BYRNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aleksandr Khalifman of Russia got right back into the lead on
Thursday night by smoothly defeating Vladimir Akopian of Armenia in
the fourth game of their International Chess Federation Match at
Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. The score is now Khalifman 2 1/2,
Akopian 1 1/2. One more victory or two draws will give Khalifman
the title.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifman's performance in this game was very much in the style
of the famed Jose Raoul Capablanca. By deftly creating pawn
weaknesses and denying his opponent any real opportunity to put up
a fight, he confronted Akopian with equally disagreeable choices:
whether to remain in a precarious middle game, for example, or to
defend an unpleasant endgame. The Armenian chose the endgame, but
it failed to produce a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The Classical Variation of the King's Indian Defense, which
arises after 5 Be2, creates a broad pawn center and straightforward
development. When Black gives up his foothold in the center with
7...ed 8 Nd4, he plans to counterattack with 8...Re8 9 f3 c6
followed by 10...d5.
</P>
<P>
   It had been standard for White to break the pin of the e4 pawn
by playing 10 Qd2, but in Game 11 of the 1990 World Championship,
after 10...d5 11 ed cd 12 c5 Nc6 13 O-O, Garry Kasparov surprised
Anatoly Karpov with an ingenious and deep sacrifice of rook for
bishop: 13...Re3! 14 Qe3 Qf8, which gave Black dangerous attacking
chances. Khalifman avoided that with the prudent 10 Bf2.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 ed cd, Black has achieved partial success in reducing
the white center, yet after 12 O-O, it would be premature to go
further with 12...dc because 13 Bc4 lets White have a telling lead
in mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   After 12...Nc6, however, Khalifman both prevented the
dissolution of the isolated d5 pawn and created a queenside pawn
majority with 13 c5.
</P>
<P>
   After 16...Be6 17 Ne6 fe, Akopian had connected his formerly
isolated d5 pawn to a protector at e6. But the price came high: The
e6 pawn became vulnerable and Khalifman had acquired the bishop
pair.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian escaped from an inferior middle game with 22...Qa5 23
Qa5 Na5, but after 24 b4, Khalifman enjoyed positional superiority
in the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than slowly suffocate, Akopian fought for terrain with
26...g5, but after 27 fg hg 28 g4, the g5 pawn had become
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   After 30...Rf8, it was too early for 31 Bg5 because of
retaliation with 31 ...Bh2! 32 Kh2 Rf2.
</P>
<P>
   After 35 Rbe1, Khalifman was ready to carry out the plan of 36
Re5, 37 h4 and h5 with ever-increasing pressure. Once again Akopian
chose active counterplay with 35...d4, but this required him to
sacrifice a pawn to 36 Re4 d3 37 Bd1 d2 38 Rff4.
</P>
<P>
   After 42...Nd5, Akopian's idea could be seen: He hoped to keep
Khalifman busy with tactical threats by his knight in conjunction
with the far advanced d2 pawn.
</P>
<P>
   After repeating moves to gain time on his clock, Khalifman broke
open the position with 51 c6! bc 52 Rc6. Now he could use his rook
on both wings while keeping the black king back. And his connected
passed pawns on the kingside could now play a starring role.
</P>
<P>
   After 56 Rc7, it was hopeless to try 56...Kd8 57 Rc2 Nd3 58 Kf6
Rf4 59 Kg7 Rf2 60 h6 Nf4 61 Rc6 Kd7 62 Rf6 Ne6 63 Re6 Ke6 64 h7.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian stubbornly played right on down to 61 Ke4, which
threatens 62 Rd8mate or 62 Ke3, before giving up.
