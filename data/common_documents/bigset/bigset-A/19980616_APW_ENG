	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Rescuers have found the body of a second
victim drowned when a boat carrying American tourists sank off the
coast of the Galapagos Islands last week, authorities said Monday.
	   The search for two more passengers continued, said Lt. Jacinto
Trivino, the captain of the port of Puerto Ayora, one of the
Galapagos Islands.
	   The body of Donna Robert, 75, was found Sunday after it washed
up on a beach on Isabela island, part of island chain 110
kilometers (70 miles) from where the boat sank Wednesday night,
said Trivino.
	   Rescuers had earlier found the body of Diane Sayre, 70, and are
looking for Lyon Zeiler, 75, and Richard Sayre, 80, he said.
	   U.S. Embassy officials said they would not confirm the victims'
names or home towns until their families have been notified.
	   One of the 11 passengers who was rescued from the shipwreck
suffered serious injury, Trivino said. Eight crewmen also survived.
	   The chartered boat, called the ``Moby Dick,'' sank after sea
conditions changed suddenly and two large waves swamped the boat
near the island of Santa Fe, part of the Galapagos archipelago, the
country's major tourist attraction.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Residents of a small
Indian village jailed their mayor and two of his top aides,
demanding that he explain why he hasn't completed any of the public
works projects scheduled for the municipality.
	   About 1,000 residents of San Miguel Mitontic, 35 miles (60 kms)
west of San Cristobal de las Casas, locked up Mayor Sebastian
Rodriguez Jimenez and his aides on Sunday night, angry that no
public projects have been completed since he took office last year.
	   They released Rodriguez Jimenez to a delegation of state
legislators Monday, but only after informally voting him out of
office and naming one of his assistants _ who had also been held _
as his successor.
	   The legislators said the villagers had no authority to fire the
mayor, who had to be escorted from the village for his own safety.
	   But the villagers cited traditional Indian government practices
_ a cause championed by leftist Zapatista rebels _ in justifying
their decision to unseat Rodriguez Jimenez.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's Pacaya volcano has spewed ash
and lava as high as 1,200 meters (4,000 feet) into the air over the
weekend, but officials said Monday that a small cloud of gas
remaining in the crater posed no danger.
	   Winds carried the debris southward over three towns Sunday, but
the eruption was not serious enough to prompt evacuations, said
Eddy Sanchez, director of the local Seismological Station.
	   A yellow alert signaling caution was in effect for the region
Monday and emergency crews were on hand to help residents if
necessary.
	   Pacaya, 20 kilometers (15 miles) south of Guatemala City and
2,560 meters (8,420 feet) above sea level, erupted violently on May
20, spewing tons of sand and ash which blanketed nearby cities and
the capital.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Quito's conservative mayor, Jamil Mahuad,
leads banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa by more than 30 points in the
runup to the second round of Ecuador's presidential elections,
according to a poll released Monday.
	   Mahuad was the choice for president of 60 percent of those
polled, compared to Noboa, who had 29 percent support, according to
a poll by the private company Market. The vote will be held on July
12.
	   Mahuad topped five other candidates in the first round of voting
on May 31, receiving 35 percent of the votes. Noboa received 26
percent. Since no candidate won an outright majority, a runoff vote
was called.
	   The candidacy of Noboa, a populist who has promised to create
jobs for the poor and give ``a kick in the pants'' to the country's
political elite, has generated fears of more political chaos in
Ecuador.
	   Noboa is the scion of Ecuador's richest family, and has the
backing of the Roldosista party of disgraced former President
Abdala Bucaram.
	   Bucaram, known as ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One'' for his
eccentric behavior, was removed from office by Congress in February
1997 for ``mental incapacity'' amid street protests and charges of
corruption.
	   Market polled 1,200 people in Ecuador's four largest provinces
last week with a margin for error of plus or minus three percent.

Nigeria's new military leader reaches out to opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 1 graf at end with with journalists group welcoming
release and calling for release of other imprisoned journalists. &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader has sent a
clear signal to the opposition and foreign critics that he wishes
to distance himself from his predecessor by releasing nine of the
country's most prominent political prisoners.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's order Monday for the immediate
release of the prisoners came exactly a week after Gen. Sani Abacha
died of a heart attack.
	   Abacha's treatment of dissidents during his
five-year-dictatorship left the oil-rich west African country an
international pariah and Abubakar's decision signaled that he was
reaching out to Nigeria's opposition and foreign critics.
	   The prisoners were being held in far-flung jails across this
sprawling, poverty-stricken country and it was not immediately
clear exactly when they would return home.
	   The prisoners ordered freed include such well-known figures as
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, 62, Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979
and Beko Ransome-Kuti, a pro-democracy activist jailed since 1995.
	   But Nigeria's best-known political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, the
billionaire businessman who apparently won 1993's annulled
presidential elections, was not on the list.
	   Abubakar ``has ordered the immediate release of some detainees
and prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation
and reconstruction,'' David Atta, Abubakar's press secretary, said
in a statement. He added that other prisoners ``would be given
consideration from time.''
	   In releasing the prisoners, the new military leader urged those
granted amnesty to ``cooperate'' with the government to create
``the country of our dreams.''
	   Abubakar also appealed to the international community to
appreciate the regime's efforts ``at solving our problems and show
greater understanding and sensitivity to our internal affairs.''
	   In Washington, the White House applauded the prisoners' release.
	   ``We hope this important step will lead to further releases and
will help all Nigerians come together to work to support a credible
and open transition to civilian democratic government,'' national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
	   Abacha's treatment of Nigeria's dissidents, particularly the
1995 execution of author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa,
isolated his country. While still able to sell its oil, Nigeria's
leaders were not even able to get visas to many Western countries.
	   Gani Fawehinmi, an attorney and one of Nigeria's most vocal
critics of military rule praised the announcement as a ``joyous
step towards reconciliation.''
	   Moves made by Abubakar's nascent regime have been closely
scrutinized by Nigeria's opposition as well as other nations.
	   He recently angered the opposition by making only a vague pledge
to follow through on Abacha's highly flawed political transition
program, which is to culminate in an Oct. 1 transition to civilian
rule. His regime also quickly moved to quash pro-democracy protests
during last week's anniversary of the annulled elections Abiola is
believed to have won.
	   But he also reportedly met with one of Abiola's wives, and those
arrested during the protests were quickly released, a significant
change from the days of Abacha, when prisoners could disappear for
years at a time.
	   The prisoners to be freed were:
	   _ Obasanjo, who had been sentenced to 15 years for treason.
Obasanjo voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an election
and became a formidable Abacha critic. He was released on
compassionate grounds and will initially be confined to his farm.
	   _ Ransome-Kuti, who had been sentenced to 15 years for being an
``accessory after the fact to treason.'' A doctor and a brother of
the late Afrobeat music star Fela, Ransome-Kuti was ordered freed
for health reasons.
	   _ Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi, leaders of Nigeria's Oil
Workers Union. They have been detained since an oil workers' strike
in 1994. No charges were filed against them.
	   _ Ibrahim Dasuki, the deposed sultan of the town of Sokoto and
an Islamic leader. He has been held without charge since 1996.
	   _ Bola Ige, a former state governor imprisoned without charges
after anti-Abacha riots May 1 in the city of Kaduna.
	   _ Chris Ayanwu, editor in chief of Quest, an independent
magazine critical of Abacha's regime. She has been held since 1995.
	   _ Olabintan Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of the Abacha regime
held without charge since last year.
	   _ Uwen Udo, a pro-democracy politician detained without charge
since 1997.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists applauded
the release of Awanwu, the editor. The watchdog group said 16 other
journalists were still being held and called for their release as
well.

Japan halts investment, freezes funds to Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan said Tuesday it will halt investment to
Serbia to help efforts to persuade the Yugoslav and Serb
governments to end their crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists
in the province of Kosovo.
	   Tokyo will also freeze funds held in Japan by the governments to
bolster those efforts, said Kanezo Muraoka, Japan's chief
government spokesman.
	   ``The government of Japan firmly calls on both the Yugoslav and
Serbian governments and the Kosovo Albanians to reject violence and
acts of terrorism, and seriously resume their dialogue,'' Muraoka
said in a statement.
	   The United States and other Western countries have been cutting
off investment to Serbia in order to pressure leaders there to
reach a political settlement to the ethnic strife in Kosovo.
	   Serb forces have been attacking villages in Kosovo as they try
to quash an uprising by ethnic Albanians seeking independence from
Serbia.
	   Muraoka said Japan will maintain its restrictions against
issuing visas to Yugoslav and Serbian government officials
responsible for violence against ethnic Albanians.
	   Japan will also maintain its ban on export credit to Yugoslavia
and Serbia, Muraoka said.

Minister: Corruption threatens ruling party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Corruption and nepotism will be
hot topics as the annual general assembly of the ruling party opens
Thursday, a senior party leader said.
	   ``Corruption is a cancer which can ruin the party,'' said
Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi.
	   It could ``erode the support of the people to the government and
the party,'' Abdullah, a vice president of the United Malays
National Organization, said in an interview with the national
Bernama news agency Tuesday.
	   The call to focus on corruption, and specifically charges of
nepotism and cronyism, has come from some of the younger leaders of
the party in the aftermath of riots in Indonesia that led to the
ouster of President Suharto.
	   The head of the powerful UMNO Youth wing, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi,
said evidence of corruption and power abuse would be brought before
the general assembly. But Zahid has denied leading an assault on
the UMNO leadership.
	   In recent weeks, a former party vice president and chief
minister of Selangor state, Muhhamad Taib, was hit with corruption
charges for failing to declare colossal assets that included swanky
real estate overseas. Two of his former aides were subsequently
charged with misusing their office to influence a real estate deal.
	   The party has not listed corruption as an issue to be discussed
during the UMNO general assembly, which runs through Sunday.
Mahathir is scheduled to address the assembly on Friday in a
nationally televised speech which is expected to focus on the
economy.
	   Badawi said only two resolutions would be tabled for debate at
the general assembly. One would focus on the economy, the other on
religion.
	   But the party leader in charge of vetting resolutions for debate
agreed that nepotism was a problem.
	   ``Not as serious as (in) some other countries in East Asia. But
this process of reform should be conducted within the party,
because the prime minister has advocated that UMNO be a party to
reform the Malay culture,'' said Education Minister Najib Tun Abdul
Razak, also party vice president.
	   Najib and Abdullah both said the potentially debilitating
economic crisis would occupy center stage.
	   ``We hope the debate on the economic problems will go beyond
rhetoric ... in the sense of raising constructive ideas that would
enable the party to chart its response and approach,'' said Najib.
	   The UMNO is the dominant party in a 13-party coalition that
overwhelmingly represent the three ethnic groups in Malaysia: the
Malays, Chinese and Indians. This leaves the opposition with little
influence on the national scene.
	   But opposition is said to be building against Mahathir from
within his own party over leadership issues and his handling of the
economy. Political observers are anxious to see if a showdown
surfaces at the annual gathering.

Survey: business confidence at lowest level since 1991
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Business confidence in Australia has
slumped to its lowest level in seven years because of the Asian
financial crisis, according to survey of industrial trends released
Tuesday.
	   Australian manufacturers also expect demand to slow and costs to
rise due to a recent fall in the value of the Australian dollar,
the joint Westpac Banking Corp.-Australian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry survey found.
	   The survey said 40 percent of 208 manufacturers surveyed
reported a fall in exports in the second quarter, and 32 percent
expect this would continue in the next quarter.
	   Some 47 percent of respondents said they are operating at below
normal capacity, while almost half anticipate capital spending over
the next 12 months will be less than spending in the previous year.
	   Expectations for new orders and output for the next three months
have weakened, and more manufacturers surveyed expect production
will decline rather than rise.
	   The impact of economic weakness in East Asia was ``strongly
evident'' in export levels in the second quarter, a statement
attached to the survey said.
	   ``The impact of Asia is clearly having a significant impact on
those covered by the survey,'' said Mark Paterson, the chamber's
chief executive.

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Prime Minister James Mitchell's
party won parliamentary elections by just one seat Monday, losing
its near-absolute power to voters disillusioned by a troubled
banana industry and 45 percent unemployment.
	   If it were not for the system of proportional representation
inherited from British colonizers, Mitchell would have lost to the
United Labor Party, which won 27,506 votes to the governing New
Democratic Party's 23,219.
	   Instead, Mitchell's party won eight seats in Parliament to the
opposition's seven according to provisional results, announced late
Monday, which have to be ratified by a court.
	   The 76,400 registered voters were divided over whether to oust
Mitchell, who has governed the Eastern Caribbean chain of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines for 14 years, or initiate a change.
	   Vincent Beache's Unity Labor Party had seen its best
opportunities in years to wrest back the power they enjoyed after
the islands first became independent in 1979.
	   ``I thank almighty God for victory, again,'' said Mitchell,
whose party had held 12 of the 15 Parliament seats.
	   Though voters clearly were sending a signal to Mitchell, his
party will have no problem pursuing its agenda in the Parliament,
where a simple majority is needed to pass or amend legislation.
	   In Caribbean fashion, parties roared for both losers and victors
Monday night.
	   Both parties had promised to boost tourism and help the banana
industry weather a 1997 World Trade Organization order to eliminate
preferential treatment from the European Union for Caribbean banana
producers.
	   Bananas and tourism are key industries in the islands, which
have a population of 107,000.
	   Mitchell's former and current attorney generals lost the
elections. The former, Parnel R. Campbell, was defeated in the key
seat of central Kingstown, a former Mitchell party stronghold in
the capital, by political newcomer Ken Boyea, a businessman.
Attorney General Carl Joseph, who resigned to contest the
elections, also lost.

Police arrest two men in attempted kidnapping of ex-president's son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police arrested two men Tuesday on
charges of trying to kidnap a son of former President Kim Young-sam
to recover campaign donations they claim to have made to the
ex-leader.
	   Oh Sun-yul, 54, was arrested near his home in the western port
city of Inchon after an electric stun gun registered under his name
was found in a car used in the failed kidnap attempt.
	   Police said Oh and four accomplices tried to kidnap Kim
Hyun-chul to recover 300 million won (dlrs 215,000) Oh claims to
have contributed to the former president's election campaign in
1992.
	   Oh was quoted by police as saying he felt betrayed by the
ex-president and his son because he didn't get a patronage job
despite his contribution.
	   Police also arrested an alleged accomplice, a former policeman
who was fired for receiving bribe money in connection with a theft
case. Three other accomplices are still being sought.
	   Kim Hyun-chul, 38, was seized by five men and forced into a car
Monday as he left his home. He scuffled with his assailants as the
car slowed before a curve, broke open the vehicle's back door and
fled. He suffered minor bruises.
	   Hyun-chul, serving a three-year sentence for bribery and tax
evasion, was released on bail in November pending an appeal to the
Supreme Court.
	   He was found guilty of receiving dlrs 2.1 million in illegal
political funds from businessmen in 1994-95 while his father was in
office. His father left office in February at the end of a
five-year term.

Philippine president-elect to sell government stake in PAL

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada said
Tuesday he plans to sell the government's stake in strike-ravaged
Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier.
	   The financially troubled airline announced Monday it will lay
off 5,000 workers _ nearly 40 percent of its current 13,000-member
work force _ in an effort to survive after a crippling pilots'
strike.
	   The 12-day strike by more than 600 pilots has cost the company
more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million), PAL said.
	   The Philippine government totally owned PAL, Asia's first
airline, until selling part of it in 1992. Its stake has been
diluted further since then because it did not acquire new shares
when the airline's capitalization was increased.
	   Estrada said Tuesday that the government's stake is now about 28
percent.
	   ``I plan to totally privatize it,'' Estrada said in a television
interview.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, said one reason for selling
the airline is that government representatives on PAL's board have
abused perks from the airline, including fat allowances and free
plane rides for them and their families.
	   In announcing the layoffs Monday, PAL said it is in danger of
being unable to pay back its debts because the pilots' strike
``irreparably damaged the company's cash flow'' and scared off
potential investors, including Northwest Airlines.
	   The strike ``has effectively robbed PAL of all options other
than to immediately downsize in order to forestall further losses
and certain closure,'' it said.
	   Separately, the Department of Labor informed PAL and the pilots'
union Monday that the airline can require its pilots to retire
early, the chief complaint in the pilots' strike.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano said PAL management followed
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement in ordering the
early retirement last December of Capt. Albino Collantes, 45, a
senior pilot.
	   The 625-member pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest
the management policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached
20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   The policy put 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said
Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the union.
	   Last week, the airline announced it will not allow the striking
pilots to return to work and will sharply scale back its
operations, concentrating on domestic routes.
	   It now has only 25 management pilots _ senior pilots who train
other pilots.
	   The airline had previously announced plans to slash costs,
reduce flights and cut staff to survive its long-term financial
problems, aggravated by Asia's currency crisis, but did not say how
many workers it planned to lay off.
	   The company says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ three times more than the
previous year.

South Korea's richest man herds 500 cattle into hungry North Korea

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ South Korea's richest man drove 500
cattle across the world's most heavily guarded border into North
Korea Tuesday in a goodwill gesture to promote peace on the divided
peninsula.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 82, founder of the giant Hyundai group, walked
into the North at this tiny village inside the 4 kilometer-
(2.5-mile) -wide demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   A North Korean woman in a flowing, traditional gown presented a
bouquet of flowers to Chung as several dozen northern soldiers and
civilians looked on.
	   Chung's crossing came a few minutes after a convoy of 50 Hyundai
trucks loaded with 250 cows and 250 bulls drove past the border
into the northern sector of Panmunjom.
	   ``I'm delighted to go back to my hometown through Panmunjom, the
same passage I took when I left for Seoul ... while I was young,''
Chung said in a statement.
	   Chung hoped that his visit would lay ``the cornerstone of
reconciliation and peace'' between the two rival Korean states.
	   South Korean officials hailed Chung's cattle drive as opening
``a sluice gate of unification'' on the peninsula.
	   ``We hope that an era of peace and mutual cooperation will come
as early as possible, allowing millions of separated family members
in the two sides to go and come through Panmunjom,'' chief
presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said in Seoul.
	   The cattle drive comes as South Korea's new government of
President Kim Dae-jung is trying to induce the North's Stalinist
government toward peace. Under its ``sunshine policy,'' the Kim
government already has lifted virtually all restrictions on
non-governmental exchanges.
	   It was a nostalgic trip for Chung, a native of what is now North
Korea. Sixty-five years ago at the age of 17, Chung sold one of his
family's cows, stole the money and fled to the south with the
thought of studying to become a lawyer.
	   Instead, he went into business and built Hyundai, South Korea's
largest conglomerate with more than 50 subsidiaries producing
everything from cars and computer chips to ships and steel.
	   ``I always feel sorry for my father for that,'' Chung said in a
recently published autobiography, recalling the day he fled his
home. ``My heart is always filled with longing for my father.''
	   In the statement issued at Panmunjom, Chung said that in South
Korea, he ``has lived my whole life with sincerity and diligence,
which I consider the trademark of a cow.''
	   ``I am now returning back to my hometown to pay back the debt
owed to my father,'' he said.
	   The cattle are part of a 12 billion won (dlrs 8.5 million) gift
Chung has offered in exchange for an eight-day visit to North
Korea. He already has shipped 10,000 tons of corn and is committed
to provide an additional 500 cattle and 40,000 tons of corn.
	   Hyundai officials said the second batch of 500 cattle will be
shipped in early July.
	   Twelve years after Chung left home, the Koreas were divided in
1945 into the communist North and the capitalist South. They fought
a devastating, three-year war that ended in 1953 without a peace
treaty. Their sealed border is guarded by nearly 2 million troops
from both sides.
	   Domestic television networks interrupted their regular
programming to broadcast live the passage of the convoy of Hyundai
trucks through Seoul and along Highway One leading to the border.
People along the streets clapped and shouted encouragement as the
convoy moved past.
	   Each truck flew the Red Cross and Hyundai flags and carried huge
placards advertising the cattle as donations from Chung.
	   It was Chung's second visit to North Korea since he fled in
1933. When he visited in 1989, his father had already died years
earlier. During that trip, he agreed to several joint-venture
projects with the North, including a tourist resort.
	   Chung was the first South Korean civilian to cross the border
into North Korea unaccompanied by government officials. North Korea
usually insists that visitors enter via Beijing or Tokyo, almost
never from South Korea.
	   Even former President Carter had to enter North Korea via
Beijing when he traveled to the Stalinist state to meet with its
late president, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
	   Chung was accompanied by nine family members. Six other members
of his entourage, mostly Hyundai executives, flew to North Korea
via Beijing Monday and will join the Chung family later.
	   Hyundai Motors Co., a Hyundai subsidiary, said Chung would
discuss with North Korean officials the possible relocation of some
of its subcompact car assembly lines to the North.

Singaporean's pet koi eaten by Thai workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ When David Lau looked at the koi pond in his
workshop compound, he saw pets.
	   When a couple of Thai workers looked at the pond, they saw
dinner.
	   Lau, a 44-year-old engineering firm director, found two of his
5,000 Singapore dollar (dlrs 2,875) koi missing when he went to
work on Sunday. Although another 25 or so koi were thrashing around
in the pond, Lau knew there was something amiss.
	   ``I felt like I have just lost my children,'' he told The
Straits Times in an interview published Tuesday. ``I started
rearing the koi three to five years ago and have developed a lot of
feelings for them.''
	   He said he followed a trail of fish scales across the road and
found one of his koi in a freezer at the back of a house where Thai
and other foreign workers were staying. He called the police, but
by the time they arrived, the fish was gone.
	   After a search, it was found under the bed of one of the Thai
workers, who fingered an accomplice.
	   Rathchata Mangkorn, 24, and Samart Setraksa, 22, appeared in
court Monday and acknowledged they had already cooked and eaten the
other koi. They said they looked like common fish from back home.
Each was sentenced to three months in jail.

Fiji to get second international airline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A new air service between Fiji, Singapore and
London announced Tuesday will meet governmental requirements to be
designated the Pacific Island nation's second international
airline.
	   Singapore-based company Fiji Airways Corp. Ltd. said it will
operate a thrice-weekly service from November using a B747-300
Combi and a A310-200 Airbus leased from Singapore Airlines.
	   The Fiji government has said previously that Fiji Airways would
receive official designation as the nation's second international
carrier if it met conditions relating to capital.
	   Air Pacific, 51 percent controlled by the Fiji government, is
the other airline, operating services to the United Sates, Japan,
Australia and New Zealand.
	   The new airline is majority owned by Fiji accountant Neil
Underhill, who will become the airline's chairman, spokesman Santie
Pillai said.
	   The remaining shares are held by an undisclosed foreign investor
who will supply the U.S. dlrs 5 million (Fiji dollars 10 million)
startup capital required by the Fiji government.
	   Fiji Airways will apply to the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji
for an air operators certificate and is waiting for air service
agreements with Singapore and Britain to be ratified, Pillai said.
	   The airline expects to deliver between 30,000 and 50,000
tourists to Fiji in its first year of business.
	   The government earlier this month said the airline would receive
official designation if the capital requirement was met and if the
airline provided a bond for foreign passengers.

Red Wings hope to deep-six Capitals with defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The big names are Steve Yzerman and Sergei
Fedorov. Much has been written about the Detroit Red Wings'
offensive stars and especially the depth at the center position.
	   But what about the defense? Right now, the Red Wings believe
that is probably their true strength _ and the reason they are
within one game of winning their second straight Stanley Cup.
	   That could happen Tuesday night, when the Red Wings play the
Washington Capitals in Game 4 holding a 3-0 lead in the best-of-7
series.
	   ``Every team thought they could wear down our defense, that we
were a lot of old men,'' Bob Rouse said. ``That hasn't happened
yet.''
	   The ``elder statesman'' of the Red Wings' defensive corps is
Viacheslav Fetisov, the 40-year who starred for the Russian Red
Army Team in the 1980s. Larry Murphy, an 18-year NHL veteran, is
37. Rouse, a 14-year veteran, will be 34 on Thursday. But none of
them is showing any wear as the Red Wings tear through the
playoffs.
	   The rest of the six-deep defensive group includes Nicklas
Lidstrom, a possible choice for the Conn Smythe Trophy as the
playoff MVP, Jamie Macoun and rookie Anders Eriksson.
	   In their 2-1 victory over the Capitals in Game 3 on Saturday
night, the Red Wings held Washington to one shot in the first
period and just 18 overall.
	   ``You have to give them credit,'' Washington center Adam Oates
said. ``They play very solidly defensively. We try to get the puck
in deep, but they have a lot of people at the blue line.''
	   Except for an anomaly in Game 2, when the Red Wings won a
shootout 5-4 in overtime, they held the Capitals to two goals and
35 shots total in the other two games.
	   During the regular season, only six teams in the 26-team NHL
allowed fewer goals than the 196 given up by the Red Wings, a
defensive hallmark of coach Scotty Bowman's teams. Their strong
defensive play was all the more remarkable, considering that the
Red Wings lost Vladimir Konstantinov in an auto accident last
spring.
	   ``Vlady was irreplaceable,'' Rouse said. ``There was no player
in the league who could step in and did what he did. As a group, we
all stepped up and tried to make up for his absence. Everybody had
to increase his role.''
	   Fetisov and Lidstrom have been offensive threats as well.
Fetisov has three assists in the first three games and Lidstrom has
a goal and an assist.
	   ``Nicklas has been quite fantastic,'' said Yzerman, naming him
and goaltender Chris Osgood as his personal Conn Smythe candidates.
	   Washington's Peter Bondra has been among those victimized by the
stout Detroit defense. A 52-goal scorer during the season, he has
but one in three games against the Red Wings.
	   ``I've got to give them credit, they've played well,'' Bondra
said Monday at a Capitals' practice.
	   Capitals coach Ron Wilson also is impressed with the Red Wings'
defense.
	   ``You've got to understand that our best players are being
checked tightly by a whole team,'' he said. ``There are no
weaknesses in the Detroit lineup when it comes to playing defensive
hockey.''

Aid workers say storm may have killed thousands; official toll at
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KANDLA, India (AP) _ There were no salt workers left Tuesday in
the western Indian port of Kandla, which produces tons of the
tabletop staple. Hundreds of laborers were killed by a cyclone,
many others fled to nearby villages, and thousands remain missing a
week after the storm struck.
	   ``The numbers are mind-boggling,'' said Oxfam worker Rajni
Khanna. ``At least 10,000 and up to 14,000 (people) have
disappeared without a trace.''
	   The number of missing and feared dead as estimated by Oxfam and
other relief agencies was much higher than the 300 listed in a
report compiled by soldiers and government officials after meetings
with local residents. But the government acknowledges an uncounted
number of unregistered migrant workers also disappeared in the
storm. An accurate death toll may never be known.
	   The official toll was 1,052 in Gujarat, the hardest-hit state
where Kandla, 530 kilometers (330 miles) northwest of Bombay, is
located. Another nine people were reported killed in the
neighboring state of Rajastan, and 12 were reported dead across the
border in Pakistan.
	   Oxfam based its estimate of the missing on reports from local
aid agencies whose workers visited about 100 area villages.
	   Mirai Chatterjee, secretary general of the Self-Employed Women's
Association, a respected Gujarati development group, sent workers
to another 150 villages to count survivors, and in many cases found
only one person living in a family of 10 or more. Like Oxfam,
Chatterjee estimated at least 10,000 people had been swept far out
to sea or remained buried in the debris.
	   Salt worker Bhupat Dhinga, interviewed in his village of Bachao,
45 kilometers (30 miles) from Kandla, said he lost eight relatives,
including a young son. He searched for three days in hospitals and
cremation grounds were mass pyres were lit, but found none of their
bodies.
	   The smell of death hung over Kandla port, where an unknown
number of bodies were believed buried under several beached barges.
The cyclone produced an 18-foot (5.5-meter) tidal wave that crashed
ships into shore, twisted jetties and wiped out salt worker's mud
huts and the mounds of salt they had collected.
	   Though many fishermen and port workers also had not been traced,
the bulk of the missing were believed to be salt workers. In life,
few had ever attached much importance to the men, women and
children who collected sea water in shallow pools and, once the
water had evaporated, scraped the salt into mounds.
	   Whole families worked for salt contractors, but generally only a
few adults were on the official payroll, earning about 15 rupees
(about 37 U.S. cents) each a day.
	   Foreman Parmar Singh said 450 workers were employed by Kandla's
Kutch Salt Co., and of those 300 died. Workers said that
unofficially 1,200 salt workers labored for Kutch, living and
working on the company's thousands of acres (hectares) of pans.
	   Singh said he looked up last Tuesday morning, the day the
cyclone hit, to see workers running to his office compound from the
salt pans a kilometer (half mile) away.
	   ``The wind was so strong they kept falling down,'' he said.
``They never made it.''

Japan's service companies lagging, manufacturers falling behind
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese companies, particularly those in the
service industry, are not keeping pace with rapid changes in the
world economy, according to a government report on trade released
Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also warned
that the world's increasingly close trade and investment ties mean
that Asia's recent economic problems could easily spread around the
globe.
	   The ministry's annual ``white paper'' said trade was becoming
more global thanks to advances in communications technology and
electronic commerce and noted that overall world trade has tripled
since 1980.
	   It warned, though, that the nation's manufacturers _ including
makers of computers and electronics products _ have begun to fall
behind competitors in Europe and the United States due to Japan's
economic slump and falling productivity levels.
	   Last week, the government announced that economic output fell
for the second consecutive quarter during the first three months of
this year, throwing Japan into its deepest recession since World
War II.
	   But in its report, the ministry said that problems in Japan's
service sector went beyond the slow economy.
	   Japan's service companies lagged even further because excessive
regulations here have made the sector less efficient than those in
Europe and America, the ministry said in the 331-page report.
	   The paper said that among developed nations Japan had the
biggest deficit in services trade, although it enjoys a huge
surplus in the trade of goods.
	   Another reason for the weak service sector was a low level of
investment in information technologies, the report said. Japanese
and U.S. companies invested about the same amount on computer and
communications systems 10 years ago but U.S. firms now invested
about twice as much, it said.
	   The trade ministry recommended further deregulation of
industries such as telecommunications, financial services, and
transportation. It also said Japan should encourage companies to
expand their research and development capabilities as a way to
improve productivity.
	   ``The United States has already deregulated a wide range of
service industries, including finance and telecommunications,
increasing their productivity and competitiveness, but in Japan
such deregulation is just beginning and it is necessary to go
further.''
	   The ministry stressed that Japan should try to be a leader in
forming trade rules in the World Trade Organization. It said that
international trade rules would be vital in shaping Japan's
economic development and it was therefore important for the country
to have a role in shaping them.
	   Regarding the Asian economic crisis, the ministry said Japan
should work with the international community to restore stability
to the region's currencies and ensure that capital continues to
flow to the ailing economies.
	   The ministry said the crisis in Asia could hurt world economies
by leading to an increase in trade protectionism.

Philippine trade deficit narrows sharply in first four months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' trade deficit
narrowed sharply in the first four months of 1998, vividly showing
the damping effect of the region's financial crisis on the
country's economy.
	   The trade deficit narrowed to dlrs 1.39 billion in the four
months from dlrs 3.75 billion in the same period a year earlier,
the government announced Tuesday.
	   For the month of April alone, the trade deficit shrank to dlrs
173 million from dlrs 860 million a year earlier.
	   Countries normally welcome a lower trade deficit, but analysts
attribute much of the recent decline to an economic slowdown caused
by the region's currency crisis.
	   ``A contraction in imports is a sign of an unhealthy economy,''
said Ricky Lozari, an analyst at Angping and Associates Securities
Inc.
	   The country's trade deficit has been narrowing since October
1997 on a year-to-year basis due mainly to a slowdown in imports
caused by the weak peso.
	   The peso has fallen nearly 37 percent against the dollar since
last July, when the currency crisis began.
	   The import decline, which began in January, is the first since
the government started tracking trade data some 58 years ago.
	   For the first four months of this year, exports rose 19.9
percent to dlrs 9.10 billion while imports fell 7.5 percent to dlrs
10.49 billion.
	   Before the currency crisis, imports were increasing because of
purchases of capital goods such as factory equipment that help
sustain economic growth and exports in the future, analysts say.
	   Many Philippine imports also consist of components which are
processed and then re-exported, so an import decline can portend
slowing exports in the future.
	   In fact, export growth slowed in April, dropping to 10 percent
on an annual basis from 24 percent in March.
	   Previously, the Philippines had been able to avoid the export
growth slowdown that has plagued much of Asia since the currency
crisis.
	   Electronics and components continued to dominate Philippine
trade in April, accounting for 53 percent of total exports and 23.5
percent of total imports, the government said.
	   Once again, the United States was the Philippines' largest
source of imports and its greatest export market, followed by
Japan.

	   INVERCARGILL, New Zealand (AP) _ England lost its third
consecutive match on its southern hemisphere rugby union tour when
beaten by the New Zealand Academy 50-32 at Homestead Stadium on
Tuesday.
	   The young and enterprising Academy side scored seven tries to
four in winning 50-32 following England's 76-0 test loss to
Australia and 18-10 defeat by the New Zealand A team.
	   The tourists were behind 28-17 at halftime then shot back within
reach of a victory after their forwards drove hard and halfback
Scott Benton scored twice.
	   Fullback Tim Stimpson lifted over a conversion and then a
penalty, cutting the Academy's lead to 38-32.
	   But the Academy moved the ball with speed and caught the tired
English with a try each by center Pita Alatini and winger Bruce
Reihana within three minutes for the 18-point victory.
	   Reihana, halfback Byron Kelleher and Isitolo Maka scored two
tries each for the Academy.
	   England's next match is the first test against New Zealand in
Dunedin on Saturday.
	   Scores:
	   NEW ZEALAND ACADEMY 50 (Isitolo Maka 2, Byron Kelleher 2, Bruce
Reihana 2, Pita Alatini tries; Blair Feeney 3 conversions, David
Holwell penalty, 2 conversions, Reihana conversion) def. ENGLAND 32
(Scott Benton 2, George Chuter, Dominic Chapman tries; Tim Stimpson
2 penalties, 3 conversions). (djp)

Philippine budget deficit far exceeds target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government posted a
budget deficit of 15.4 billion pesos (dlrs 375 million) in the
first five months of 1998, far exceeding its target of 75 million
pesos (dlrs 1.8 million) for the period.
	   Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez said Tuesday the
government's revenue collection was affected by the regional
financial crisis, which caused a slowdown in economic output. He
noted that income taxes paid by major corporations have declined
since January, an effect of their weaker earnings.
	   The five-month budget deficit is a sharp turnaround from the 4.9
billion peso (dlrs 120 million) surplus posted by the government in
the same period last year.
	   Enriquez said revenues collected in the five-month period
reached 187.4 billion pesos (dlrs 4.57 billion), short of the
government's target by 19.4 billion pesos (dlrs 473 million).
	   Proceeds from privatization of government-held assets also fell
sharply to 117 million pesos (dlrs 2.8 million) from 2.7 billion
pesos (dlrs 65.8 million) in the year-earlier period.
	   Revenues from the Bureau of Customs also declined.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Celebration of England's victorious start to the
World Cup was overshadowed on Britain's front pages Tuesday as the
media attacked the hooligans, with one newspaper calling for
England to withdraw from the tournament to spare France the
violence and England further shame.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned the
violence, which began on Saturday night but has gradually escalated
to rioting before and during Monday's England-Tunisia game in
Marseille.
	   More than 50 people were injured, including an Englishman whose
neck artery was cut by a bottle. Police detained nearly 80
Englishman, Tunisians and Frenchmen, and two of the Englishmen were
sentenced to three months in prison.
	   The Guardian on Tuesday quoted the commander of Britain's police
operations at the World Cup as saying authorities expect more
trouble as the soccer tournament progresses and that known
hooligans are either already in France or on their way to
orchestrate more violence.
	   The Times reported that city authorities in Marseille, where
England beat Tunisia 2-0 on Monday, were demanding compensation
from the British government for the damage caused by English
hooligans and that the city's deputy mayor has called for England
to be expelled from the tournament.
	   Such a suggestion was backed by The Independent newspaper, which
said in an editorial: ``The only way to stop the thugs _ and the
only appropriate way of saying sorry to the people of Marseille _
is for the team to pack its bags and catch the first flight home.''
	   The newspaper also argued that the violence lends weight to
Britain's campaign to host the World Cup in 2006.
	   ``At least that way we will only destroy our own cities,'' it
said. ``Although other countries have their hooligan element, we
kid ourselves if we deny that ours is far, far worse.''
	   Several tabloids wrote about the ``savage who started it'' _ the
Englishman believed to have thrown the first bottle in Monday's
Marseille riot _ branding him a ``pot-bellied bully'' and ``the pig
of Marseille.''

Singapore's Lee: Asian leaders didn't understand information age
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis would have been much
milder if Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian leaders understood how
quickly markets act on their words, Singapore's most prominent
politician told Newsweek magazine.
	   ``Had the leaders been part of the information age, the end
result wouldn't have been half as bad,'' Singaporean Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew was quoted as saying in an exclusive
interview with the magazine published in this week's issue.
	   He then gave examples of how Southeast Asians leaders' actions
and words caused negative reactions from investors and traders.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was ``enraged by the
devastation of his stock market and currency,'' Lee said, according
to the published interview. Mahathir ``vented his anger at currency
speculators, especially (American financier) George Soros and the
Jews. That caused a further downturn for all currencies and stock
markets in the region.''
	   The magazine quoted Lee as saying that then-Indonesian President
Suharto ``allowed his son to reopen a bank and his daughter to
reinstate a power station that had been canceled as unnecessary.
	   ``The market said, `Look, the president is not serious about his
reforms.' So the rupiah spiraled down and affected everyone else,''
Lee said in the interview.
	   He also mentioned that the former Thai prime minister, Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, had agreed with the International Monetary Fund to
close some 50 finance companies and banks.
	   ``He didn't close them,'' Lee said. ``The market lost
confidence, and the Thai baht went through the floor and affected
all currencies in the region.''
	   ``... Had they understood and taken seriously the reactions of
fund managers, the damage would be less than half of what it is,''
Lee said.
	   Lee, who is credited with building up this city-state of 3.1
million people into an economic powerhouse during his years as
prime minister, remains one of Asia's leading politicians.

Dollar falls in volatile trading, stocks slip in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon currency
and bond prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday in volatile trading as nervous investors fretted about
possible central bank intervention. Tokyo stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 146.14 yen at mid-afternoon, down 0.30 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and just below its late New York rate of
146.15 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 104.79
points, or 0.71 percent, to close at 14,720.38. On Monday, the
Nikkei lost 197.16 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   During the morning, the U.S. currency plunged as low as 142.40
yen after Japanese officials sounded warnings about the dollar's
recent gains.
	   The dollar regained most the lost ground in afternoon trading
amid persistent pessimism about Japan's economic outlook.
	   On Monday, those same concerns sent the U.S. dollar above 146
yen for the first time in eight years.
	   Early Tuesday, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka
made a rare comment on the exchange rate, saying that he is worried
about the yen's sharp decline.
	   ``I have strong concerns about the excessive weakness of the
yen,'' Muraoka said. ``It is necessary to coordinate with other
nations to take proper steps on it.''
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji Omi, echoed
those concerns Tuesday, saying too much weakness in the yen could
have a negative impact worldwide.
	   Omi hinted at government action to bolster the yen. But he
didn't comment on when and what that action may be.
	   A weak yen helps Japanese exporters, but those gains come at the
expense of the rest of Asia. As the yen weakens, Japanese exports
become cheaper in key markets like the United States, grabbing
market share from Asian competitors.
	   Traders said sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange remained down
amid investor concern that the weak yen may throw Asia back into
economic crisis.
	   With Japan's economy in the worst recession since World War Two,
the outlook for earnings and corporate profitability is also grim.
	   Pessimism about the world's second-largest economy drove the Dow
Jones industrial average on Monday to its biggest point loss since
early January _ 207 points, or more than 2 percent.
	   In Tokyo Tuesday, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed on the first section fell 10.74 points, or 0.92
percent, to 1,156.47. The TOPIX closed down 10.04 points, or 0.85
percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.205 percent from Monday's finish of 1.185 percent,
driving its price down to 111.97 yen from 112.12 yen.

Most Asian stock markets remain gloomy, but the yen rebounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell again Tuesday, as
a sharp drop on Wall Street sparked fears that East Asia's
financial crisis was turning into a global problem.
	   But a few Asian markets recovered somewhat by midday on bargain
hunting and a firmer Japanese yen, which rose sharply against the
U.S. dollar in early trading Tuesday. By midday, the dollar bought
143.82 yen, down 2.84 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below
its late New York rate of 146.15 yen overnight.
	   In New Zealand, the key NZSE-40 capital index dropped 1.42
percent to finish at its lowest level since March 20, 1995, dragged
down by a weakening local currency and a significant increase in
domestic wholesale interest rates.
	   In Australia, the key All Ordinaries Index of share prices was
down 1.2 percent at 2,536.6 at midday, as the Australian dollar
touched a 12-year low against the U.S. dollar in early trading.
	   The key Philippine Stock Exchange index dropped 41.72 points, or
2.4 percent, to 1705.14 points, adding to Monday's 82.16-point
fall. Kuala Lumpur's benchmark Composite Index also plunged 2.6
percent to 440.51 points in early trading.
	   In Jakarta, the key JSX Composite Index was down 3.963 points,
or 0.9 percent, at 402.538 points in early trading.
	   Share prices on the Seoul stock market were narrowing their
losses at midday on the Japanese yen's rise, closing the morning
session 0.8 percent lower at 285.42.
	   Singapore shares also opened lower on regional weaknesses and
fears the soaring interest rates could lead banks to raise their
prime lending rates. The Straits Times Industrials Index plunged
1.9 percent to 1,033.20 Tuesday morning.
	   However, buoyed by the firmer yen, Japan's share prices narrowed
earlier losses at midday, with the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average closing the morning session down 63.68 points, or 0.43
percent, at 14,761.49 points. On Monday, the Nikkei lost 1.31
percent.
	   The dollar fell amid profit-taking by U.S. funds and optimism
that Japan is finally ready to take action to stem the yen's slide.
Southeast Asian currencies also were buoyed in early trading by the
strengthening yen.
	   The previous day, growing concerns about the state of the
Japanese economy sent the U.S. dollar above 146 yen in Tokyo for
the first time in eight years.
	   Worries that the yen's fall would trigger a global financial
crisis sent U.S. and European stocks lower Monday and led to calls
for Japan and the United States to take action to prop up Japan's
currency.
	   ``In order to regain any stability, we must urge ... the leading
economies, particularly Japan and the U.S. to come forward to
stabilize the situation. (The yen's fall) is not doing anybody any
good at all,'' Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told
reporters Tuesday.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 percent Monday _ the
second biggest drop in point terms this year _ to close at
8,627.93, the lowest level in three months. Bourses across Europe
also fell between 0.9 percent to 1.1 percent.
	   On Tuesday, the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji
Omi, said he believes the Japanese government will take action to
bolster the yen. ``An excessively weak yen is undesirable for both
the Japanese and world economy,'' Omi said.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka also made a rare
comment on the exchange rate, saying: ``It is necessary to
coordinate with other nations to take proper steps on it.''
	   The strengthening yen and profit-taking on the U.S. dollar also
boosted Southeast Asian currencies in early trading.
	   Against Malaysia's ringgit, the dollar dipped to 4.0575 ringgit,
from 4.0750 late the previous day.
	   The U.S. currency was down against the Thai baht, falling to
43.5750 baht, from 43.7850. The U.S. dollar was at 14,650 rupiah
against the Indonesian currency, below 14,725 late Monday.
	   In other stock markets, Taiwan shares ended higher as a stable
local currency buoyed sentiment and encouraged bargain-hunters onto
the bourse, with the Weighted Price Index closing 1.7 percent
higher to 7,404.27.
	   Key stock indices in Hong Kong and Bangkok also regained some
lost ground on technical rebounds after both plunged 5.7 percent
Monday. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 105.80 points, or 1.4
percent, to finish the morning session at 7568.30 points as
interbank rates eased. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index
was up 0.25 point higher at 263.64 in early trading.

Report: Protesting farmers plant crops on golf course in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Protesting farmers dug up and planted
crops on a golf course they claimed had been wrongly taken away
from them in a land deal, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The farmers entered the Cimacan golf course, about 70 kilometers
(45 miles) southeast of Jakarta, Saturday, the newspaper Kompas
said.
	   As well as planting banana trees and other crops, they carved
slogans into the manicured greens such as ``this is people's land''
and ``reform.''
	   Local police chief Lt. Col. Panjang Yuswanto said the farmers
claimed that they weren't paid enough when the land was taken from
them and the course was built nine years ago.

Monks break police barrier, ask Britain to ban Tamil group

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Protesters led by about 400 Buddhist
monks marched Tuesday to the British High Commission in Colombo to
demand that Britain ban Sri Lanka's main Tamil rebel group.
	   The monks, supported by about 2,500 demonstrators from the
National Council Against Terrorism, were at first stopped about 200
yards (meters) from the embassy. But with only a few police
officers on hand, they were able to reach the embassy gate and hand
a diplomat a memorandum with their demand.
	   The protesters want Britain to ban the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, which is leading a 15-year-old war for an independent
Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern regions of the Indian
Ocean republic. The LTTE maintains an information office in London.
	   Britain has said that the LTTE is not violating local laws and
therefore there is no justification in banning the group.
Washington listed the LTTE as a terrorist organization last year,
banning it from operating or raising funds in the United States.
	   The LTTE says that Tamils, who are 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
18.5 million people, are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese. Over 52,000 people have died in the separatist violence.
	   In February, the LTTE was blamed for bombing Sri Lankan
Buddhism's holiest shrine in the town of Kandy, killing 18 people.
In March, the LTTE was blamed for a bombing attack near a railroad
station in Colombo that left 41 people dead.

Thailand offers spicy curry to Nigerian soccer team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will fire up the Nigerian
soccer team with a meal of fiery Thai curry ahead of the African
nation's World Cup clash will Bulgaria this week.
	   The Thai Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that the meal would
mark a gesture of friendship for a country that is a chief buyer of
Thai rice. Thailand is the world's number-one rice exporter.
	   The Thai Embassy in France, where the World Cup is being played,
will prepare complimentary rice curry for the Nigerians sometime
this week before their match Friday with Bulgaria.
	   Nigeria buys 500,000 tons of Thai rice annually and was the
Southeast Asian country's biggest customer before Indonesia passed
it with an order of 1 million tons.
	   Nigeria, the current Olympic champions, beat Spain 3-2 in its
opening match last week. Thailand does not have a team in the
month-long soccer tournament.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada said
Tuesday he plans to sell the government's stake in strike-ravaged
Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier.
	   The financially troubled airline announced Monday it will lay
off 5,000 workers _ nearly 40 percent of its current 13,000-member
work force _ in an effort to survive after a crippling pilots'
strike.
	   The 12-day strike by more than 600 pilots has cost the company
more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million), PAL said.
	   The airline was already in serious financial difficulties as a
result of an ambitious refleeting program launched shortly before
Asia's currency crisis reduced passenger numbers and inflated
operating and loan repayment costs.
	   A PAL official said Tuesday it has decided to dispose of all but
14 of its 54 planes and suspend all orders of new planes as part of
a retrenchment program.
	   The airline met Monday with banks that together have a loan
exposure of dlrs 1.5 billion to PAL and warned them of possible
delays in repayments, Senior Vice President Avelino Zapata said.
	   ``We are asking them not to panic and pull out the assets of
Philippine Airlines,'' he said.
	   The company did not ask formally for a restructuring of its
debt, he said.
	   He said the 14 remaining planes would be appropriate for about
50 pilots. The airline now has only 25 senior management pilots
after firing the 600 striking pilots for ignoring a government
return-to-work order.
	   In announcing the layoffs Monday, PAL said it is in danger of
being unable to repay its debts because the pilots' strike
``irreparably damaged the company's cash flow'' and scared off
potential investors, including Northwest Airlines.
	   The strike ``has effectively robbed PAL of all options other
than to immediately downsize in order to forestall further losses
and certain closure,'' it said.
	   The Philippine government totally owned PAL, Asia's first
airline, until selling part of it in 1992. Its stake has since been
diluted further because it did not acquire new shares when the
airline's capitalization was increased.
	   Estrada said Tuesday that the government's stake is now about 28
percent.
	   ``I plan to totally privatize it,'' Estrada said in a television
interview.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, said one reason for selling
the airline is that government representatives on PAL's board have
abused perks from the airline, including fat allowances and free
plane rides for them and their families.
	   The pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest a new
management policy of ordering pilots to retire who have reached 20
years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   The policy put 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, said
Capt. Sotico Lloren, president of the union.
	   The airline had previously announced plans to slash costs,
reduce flights and cut staff to survive its long-term financial
problems, but had not said how many workers it planned to lay off.
	   The company says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ three times more than the
previous year.

Yeltsin, Milosevic meet over Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met Tuesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, hoping to find common ground, but was
expected to hear a slightly softened version of NATO's demand that
he ease up on Kosovo.
	   Though critical of NATO's exercises in Kosovo's neighborhood,
the Russian president was expected to join western leaders in
calling on Milosevic to end his violent campaign against the
province's ethnic Albanians.
	   Yeltsin and Milosevic began meeting late Tuesday morning.
Milosevic was scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov later in the day.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo.
	   Late Monday, Yeltsin spoke with U.S. President Bill Clinton for
40 minutes by telephone. The two agreed on the need for an end to
the violence in Kosovo, but Yeltsin continued to disagree with U.S.
support for military action should diplomacy fail.
	   Yeltsin is ``much more anxious to see a diplomatic solution,''
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in Washington. ``But I
think it's very clear, and the Russian government knows, that we
intend to proceed with that type of resolution if necessary.''
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Under the headline ``Last Chance,'' the Novye Izvestiya
newspaper wrote Tuesday that Milosevic ``has cheated the Kremlin
peacemakers so many times that others in their place would long ago
have repudiated such a `Slavic brother.'''
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.
	   ``Russia itself would like to believe in the paramount
importance of the meeting in the Kremlin,'' Novye Izvestiya wrote,
``as it wants to believe that someone somewhere still really
depends on Russia.''

Turkey releases Maltese ship with missile parts for Egypt

<TEXT>
	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ A Maltese-flagged cargo ship set sail
Tuesday morning, 32 hours after Turkey stopped it on suspicion of
carrying Russian missile parts for Cyprus.
	   Turkish authorities uncovered seven mobile missile launching
pads aboard the Natasha-1 but allowed it to continue its course
after Cairo confirmed that the military equipment was for Egypt.
The ship, which came from Ukraine, had declared its cargo as
tractors and cars for Egypt.
	   Turkey increased surveillance in its waters after reports last
week that radar and control panels for five S-300 missile systems
had reached Cyprus by sea.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey sent in troops in 1974
after an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only
Turkey recognizes the Turkish Cypriot state.
	   Turkey has vowed to take military action if the missiles are
installed by the Greek Cypriots, claiming they are a threat to
Turkish Cypriots in the north and Turkey itself. Cyprus claims the
missiles are merely defensive.
	   Turkish authorities stopped another ship carrying missile parts
for Egypt last year.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ For American lawyer Jennifer
Harbury, her six-year effort to learn about the fate of her
guerrilla husband has as much to do with Guatemala's future as with
its past.
	   Harbury is asking the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in
the Costa Rican capital to help determine what happened to her
husband, Efrain Bamaca, who she believes was tortured to death by
the Guatemalan army in 1992.
	   The trial opens Tuesday.
	   ``I want to know the truth about what happened to him, to
recover his remains, and I'm hoping that the next generation of
Guatemalans won't suffer from this system of official impunity,
like that which led to the death of Archbishop Gerardi,'' she said
in an interview.
	   Guatemalan Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera was bludgeoned to death
April 26, two days after issuing a report accusing the army of
committing most of the killings in Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
The civil war ended under peace accords signed in 1996.
	   Bamaca, a guerrilla commander, disappeared after a skirmish with
the army. Military officials first said he died in combat and had
been buried, but Harbury discovered that the body in the grave was
not her husband's. The army then denied any knowledge of having
captured him and has admitted to no wrongdoing
	   With the help of then-U.S. Rep. Robert Torricelli, Harbury
obtained Central Intelligence Agency documents in 1995 indicating
that Bamaca had been captured March 12, 1992, kept prisoner for
most of the year, then executed under orders of Guatemalan Col.
Julio Roberto Alpirez, a paid CIA informant.
	   The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, a division of the
Organization of American States, determined that Bamaca had been
kidnapped, jailed, tortured and killed by the army.
	   It referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights, which is expected to hear testimony for four days. If the
court rules in her favor, Harbury could press Guatemala to find her
husband's body, identify the people responsible for the killing and
pay her compensation.
	   With the proof she has from U.S. government records, she said,
``I am totally confident of accomplishing what I'm looking for.''
	   In addition to the case before the Human Rights court, Harbury
is suing the U.S. government and the CIA in federal court in
Washington, accusing them of collaborating in Bamaca's death and
claiming they committed fraud against her and several members of
Congress.
	   She said she will pursue the case until she obtains all the
information in the hands of U.S. security agencies.

Russia Launches Six Communication Satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Strategic Missile Forces launched six
communication satellites from the country's northwestern cosmodrome
on Tuesday.
	   The Kosmos satellites were put into orbit by a Tsiklon-3
booster, which blasted off from the Plesetsk launch pad at 2:58
a.m. (2258 Monday), the Interfax news agency reported, quoting
Russia's Strategic Missile Forces.
	   The satellites will perform ``in the interests of the Defense
Ministry,'' Interfax said, without elaboration.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.
	   Russia also uses the better-positioned Baikonur cosmodrome,
leased from Kazakhstan, for international satellite launches and
manned space flights. Baikonur is closer to the Equator, allowing
launches of satellites to higher orbits using less powerful
boosters.
	   Deprived of the ample funding and prestige it enjoyed during the
Soviet era, Russia's ailing space agency has pinned its hopes for
survival on commercial satellite launches and other international
satellite programs.

Bank of Japan says exports have peaked, corporate investment down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with central bank views on stimulus plan, situation of
small- mid-size companies, grafs 13-14 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ability to export its way out of economic
difficulty has peaked as slumping Asian economies purchase fewer
Japanese goods, the central bank said Tuesday.
	   Strong overseas sales have long been the sole factor supporting
Japan's otherwise moribund economy _ and Asia is Japan's largest
export market.
	   But as the region adjusts its consumption habits to tougher
economic times, Japan's export push is running out of steam, the
Bank of Japan said in its monthly review of the country's economy.
	   Although exports to the United States and Europe continue to
rise, ``recovery in net exports is likely to be modest in the near
term,'' the bank said.
	   The bleak assessment came just days after the government
announced that Japan has slipped into recession for the third time
this decade and suffered its worst annual economic contraction
since the end of World War II.
	   The central bank report contained other bad news for Japan's
struggling economy:
	   _Corporate investment has continued to fall as capital goods
shipments and orders for machinery and construction slump.
	   _Domestic consumption shows no signs of recovering.
	   _Employment and incomes are deteriorating.
	   _Prices continue to weaken.
	   Downward pressure on prices could turn out to be particularly
worrisome for Japan as many analysts predict the country's economic
woes and Asia's financial crisis will send it into a deflationary
spiral.
	   In such a situation, falling prices would cut into corporate
profits, which would put pressure on companies to cut jobs and
wages. That would further dampen already weak consumer confidence,
which has been the main factor behind Japan's stubborn economic
slump.
	   The bank warned that the government's recently announced 16.65
trillion yen (dlrs 116 billion) economic package will help boost
consumption only if the income and employment situation brighten.
	   The central bank also said small- and medium-size companies were
still being squeezed by the reluctance of private banks to lend
money to any but the most solid of Japanese corporations.
	   Profligate lending during Japan's speculative ``bubble'' of the
late 1980s has burdened Japan's banks with heaps of bad loans and
they are struggling to get their books back in order.
	   Meanwhile, for the first time in weeks, a slew of senior
government officials made strong comments aimed at stopping the
dramatic slide of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka made a rare foray into
financial market issues Tuesday, saying that he is concerned about
the yen's sharp decline.
	   ``I have strong concerns about the excessive weakness of the
yen,'' Muraoka said. ``It is necessary to coordinate with other
nations to take proper steps on it.''
	   The head of the Economic Planning Agency, Koji Omi, added: ``An
excessively weak yen is undesirable for both the Japanese and world
economy.''
	   Omi said he believes the government will take action to bolster
the yen. But he didn't comment on when, or what that action might
be.

Philippine stocks, peso fall further on regional currency concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell for the sixth
straight session Tuesday, weighed down by concerns over weaker
regional currencies led by the falling Japanese yen, traders said.
	   The weak yen also dragged the Philippine peso lower. The dollar
averaged 41.729 pesos at midday compared to 41.566 pesos Monday.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 20.31 points,
or 1.2 percent, closing at 1,726.55, after plunging 82.16 points,
or 4.5 percent, on Monday.
	   Noel Reyes, research head at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.,
said the weak yen is likely to pull the Philippine and regional
stock markets lower for at least a few weeks.
	   ``We won't see an end to this sell-down until the yen's fall
comes to a halt,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the central bank wasn't active in the spot
market, consistent with its market-determined foreign exchange
policy, traders said.
	   Central bank Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said the monetary
authority will continue to allow market forces to determine the
peso's value.
	   Selling dollars will be the central bank's ``last recourse'' in
helping keep the peso stable against the dollar, he said.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar was slightly lower against the yen Tuesday
in volatile trading as nervous investors fretted about possible
Japanese central bank intervention.

Temple-building can help ease economic crisis, one monk says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ New construction at Buddhist temples
might help ease Thailand's economic crisis by funneling money from
the rich to the poor, an abbot said Tuesday.
	   Pra Pipatpariyattisunthorn was reacting to an unusual government
order halting new buildings at Buddhist temples nationwide so their
congregations would be less burdened by donations that are
routinely offered by millions.
	   ``Laborers, who are poor, will have work, money to live on,''
said the abbot of Bangkok's Hua Lampong Temple. ``We are not
worsening the people's suffering.''
	   While agreeing with the order in general, he said the country's
rich would continue to donate funds to temples, which could be
``recirculated'' to impoverished laborers.
	   Another monk, Pra Sumetheedhammaphan, said Monday's order was
well-intentioned and would make people feel the Buddhist clergy was
also helping to solve the economic crisis.
	   The acting abbot of Khemaphirataram Temple noted that some
temples had their own revenue and did not have to rely on public
donations.
	   The government rarely interferes with the Buddhist hierarchy _
known as the Sangkha _ although its religious affairs department is
supposed to oversee its workings. About 90 percent of Thailand's 60
million people are Buddhists.
	   The department's director-general, Samanchit Piromruen, said
Monday the ban would also deal with the problem of monks erecting
buildings to receive promotions.
	   Under Sangkha rules, monks can be elevated to a certain rank by
making 1.5 million baht (dlrs 34,000) worth of construction or
renovations of temple buildings, said a report about Samanchit's
order broadcast by ITV television. Money for such work would
normally come from donations.
	   If building projects were necessary, they should conform to a
standard plan issued by the ministry and cost no more than 700,000
baht (dlrs 15,000), Samanchit told a meeting of senior monks.
	   Last month, the government urged the country's supreme Buddhist
council to crack down on monks and temples that refuse to perform
funeral rituals for the poor.
	   The action came after a fruit vendor in Bangkok complained
through the news media that Ladprao Temple had refused to perform
funeral rites for her father because she could not pay the fee.
	   The temple's abbot could not be reached for comments on the
construction ban. His followers said he had stopped giving
interviews.
	   Most temples survive on donations from the public, but during
Thailand's economic boom from 1985 to 1995, many became rich as
donations expanded. Unlike government or most businesses, they do
not have to account for their finances.
	   Many Thais believe that fat donations will bring them greater
material rewards in this life and higher status when they are
reincarnated.

U.N. appeals for dlrs 18 million to help Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Kosovo, Japan-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations appealed Tuesday for a total of
dlrs 18 million to help tens of thousands of people driven from
their homes by fighting in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Six U.N. agencies sent the urgent appeal to donors for the
funding, which is also needed ``to prepare for possible new waves
of refugees,'' according to a statement from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``While we hope for a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis,
we must be ready for an even larger number of refugees,'' said
UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata, whose agency is seeking dlrs 12.9 million
in the appeal.
	   The U.N. Children's Fund and its food and health agencies were
also involved.
	   The funding is also intended to support local communities which
are hosting the refugees.
	   At least 13,000 people have crossed the mountainous border into
Albania and another 9,000 have fled to the neighboring Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, UNHCR says.
	   An estimated 45,000 are displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   Last week, the international Red Cross launched an appeal for
3.2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.2 million) in aid for the refugees
in northern Albania.

Chiapas governor defends police raid in which 10 died
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) _ The governor of Chiapas state
defended a joint police-army raid on pro-rebel villages in which 10
people died, saying it averted an even deadlier clash and was not
aimed at Zapatista rebels _ with whom the government has a
cease-fire.
	   Hundreds of state police with automatic rifles and federal
troops with grenade launchers raided two tiny, pro-Zapatista
villages and a rural town Wednesday to arrest 15 people wanted on
charges ranging from murder to setting up an illegal, pro-Zapatista
municipal government.
	   ``A conflagation with more deaths between the communities was
prevented there,'' Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen said in an
interview late Monday night.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and Amnesty
International expressed alarm over the operation, the third such
raid in recent months.
	   Critics claimed that the resulting clash with resisting
villagers effectively broke a cease-fire which had been in place
since January 1994, two weeks after the Zapatista National
Liberation Army rebelled.
	   At least eight villagers died in last week's clash, and Albores
Guillen said a second wounded police officer died Saturday night.
	   He said the government was trying to reestablish ``the rule of
law'' and that the massive security force was due to ``high
danger'' in a region where ambushes and killings are common.
	   ``The last straw'' prompting the operation was the recent
shooting of five farmers from another village. One of them died.
	   ``They declared that ... if the government did not act, 300
people would take justice into their own hands,'' Albores Guillen
said.
	   The governor said testimony from some of the 29 people still in
custody proved that Zapatistas fired first and ``ambushed'' the
government convoy.
	   Villagers claimed that six of the men had been seen alive in
police custody. But the governor said a second autopsy of those
killed confirmed that they had not been executed after arrest.
	   A commission from Mexico's Congress urged a halt to such raids
during this week's efforts to re-establish peace talks between the
government and rebels, which have been stalled for two years.
	   Frustrated with the Chiapas stalemate, the government's primary
strategy has been to surround rebels with thousands of troops and
block access to pro-rebel communities.
	   The governor insisted that the massive security force used in
last week's clash had nothing to do with the rebel presence in the
villages.
	   ``We did not even know they were Zapatistas,'' he said.
	   More than 145 people were killed in fighting before a truce was
called. While there had been no direct clashes since, before June
10, hundreds of people have died in small scale clashes between
supporters of the two sides.

South Korean tycoon drives cattle into North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By REID G. MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ A frail, elderly tycoon drove 500 cattle
into hungry North Korea on Tuesday, crossing the world's most
heavily guarded border on a mission to promote peace, pay back a
debt to his dead father _ and maybe do a little business on the
side.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 82, founder of the giant Hyundai conglomerate and
South Korea's richest man, shuffled into the North through Peace
House, the long, squat building straddling the border where the
truce was signed that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   As he emerged from the northern end of the building supported by
family members, Chung was greeted by North Korean officials and
bouquet-bearing women in long, flowing traditional gowns. ``You are
really, really welcome,'' one of the officials said.
	   Minutes earlier, a convoy of 50 white Hyundai trucks bearing the
Red Cross symbol and loaded with 500 prime cows and bulls lumbered
across the border, the first civilian vehicles to make the crossing
since 1945, when the Koreas were divided into the communist North
and capitalist South.
	   ``I am delighted to go back to my hometown through Panmunjom,
the same passage I took when I left for Seoul ... while I was
young,'' Chung said in a statement he read to reporters.
	   Chung hoped his visit would ``lay the cornerstone of
reconciliation and peace'' between the rival Korean states.
	   South Korean officials hailed Chung's cattle drive as opening
``a sluice gate of unification'' on the divided peninsula.
	   ``We hope that an era of peace and mutual cooperation will come
as early as possible, allowing millions of separated family members
in the two sides to go and come through Panmunjom,'' chief
presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said in Seoul.
	   Chung's visit, dubbed ``Operation Rawhide,'' comes as the new
government of President Kim Dae-jung is trying to open up its
reclusive northern neighbor to the outside world. Seoul already has
lifted virtually all restrictions on non-governmental exchanges.
	   Hyundai officials said the cattle were more suited for farm work
than for slaughter. North Korea is suffering from a famine brought
on by inefficient, socialist farming methods and three years of
alternating drought and floods that destroyed large areas of
farmland.
	   It was Chung's second nostalgic return to his native North.
Sixty-five years ago at the age of 17, he sold one of his family's
cows, stole the money and fled to the south. He didn't return until
1989 during a brief thaw in North-South relations.
	   ``I am now returning back to my hometown to pay back the debt
owed to my father,'' Chung said in his statement.
	   But although Chung has about 100 mostly distant relatives still
living in his hometown of Tongchun on North Korea's east coast, his
eight-day visit isn't entirely sentimental.
	   Hyundai officials said he planned to look into joint-venture
investments made during his first trip north, explore the
possibility of moving some of Hyundai Motor Co.'s assembly lines to
North Korea to take advantage of cheap labor, and discuss
establishment of a tourist resort.
	   The cattle are part of a 12 billion won (dlrs 8.5 million) gift
Chung offered in exchange for the visit. He already has shipped
10,000 tons of corn and will provide an additional 500 cattle and
40,000 tons of corn.
	   When Chung arrived in Seoul in 1933, he planned to study law.
Instead he went into business and built Hyundai, South Korea's
largest conglomerate, with more than 50 subsidiaries producing
everything from cars and computer chips to ships and steel.
	   Not since the Korean War has a civilian crossed the border into
North Korea unaccompanied by government officials. Even former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter had to enter North Korea via Beijing when he
traveled to the Stalinist state to meet with its late president,
Kim Il Sung, in 1994.

U.N. appeals for dlrs 18 million to help Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Rebel Territory, Russia-Kosovo, Japan-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations appealed Tuesday for dlrs 18
million to help tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven from
their homes by fighting in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Six U.N. agencies sent the urgent appeal to donors for the
funding, which is also needed ``to prepare for possible new waves
of refugees,'' according to a statement from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``While we hope for a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo crisis,
we must be ready for an even larger number of refugees,'' said
UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata, whose agency is seeking dlrs 12.9 million
in the appeal.
	   The U.N. Children's Fund and its food and health agencies were
also asking for funding.
	   The funding is also intended to support local communities
hosting the refugees, who are fleeing Serbia's crackdown against
ethnic Albanian insurgents demanding independence for Kosovo.
	   At least 13,000 people have crossed the mountainous border into
Albania and another 9,000 have fled to the neighboring Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, UNHCR says.
	   An estimated 45,000 are displaced within Kosovo itself.
	   Last week, the international Red Cross launched an appeal for
3.2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.2 million) in aid for the refugees
in northern Albania.

Philippine groups oppose plan to bury Marcos in Heroes' Cemetery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A coalition of 28 groups on Tuesday
criticized a decision by President-elect Joseph Estrada to bury
former dictator Ferdinand Marcos at a Manila military cemetery.
	   Estrada ``is showing a streak of arrogance that we did not see
when he was campaigning,'' said former Sen. Rene Saguisag, who
defended many human rights victims under Marcos. ``He believes he
is a tough guy but what he is showing is that he is insensitive.''
	   Estrada, a former action movie star who ran on a pro-poor
platform, takes office June 30.
	   Saguisag represents one of 28 groups in the Rattle the Rusty
Conscience movement protesting the burial plan. The movement
consists mostly of human rights activists and political enemies of
Marcos.
	   The coalition said it is not opposed to a proper burial for
Marcos anywhere except at the Heroes' Cemetery.
	   ``That site is highly symbolic and is reserved for those whom
the Filipino nation wishes to honor for all time,'' it said in a
statement. ``How can we inter at the Heroes' Cemetery one whose
dictatorship perpetuated itself through torture, murder, thievery,
rape, pillage and terrorism?''
	   About 20 people, including priests and nuns, prayed at a bridge
leading to the presidential palace Tuesday in the second day of a
planned week of daily protests against the burial.
	   After seeing the first protest Monday, Estrada said he was not
impressed.
	   ``Why waste my time (talking with the protesters),'' Estrada
said. ``If they like to sleep in the streets, let them sleep there.
I'll give them mineral water.''
	   Last week, Marcos' widow, Imelda, agreed to bury Marcos at the
military cemetery without state honors.
	   She had initially wanted full state honors for her husband
because he had served in the military and also as president.
	   Marcos was ousted by a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and fled
to Hawaii, where he died three years later. His body was returned
to the Philippines in September 1993 and has been kept in an
air-conditioned glass crypt in his hometown of Batac.
	   Current President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon
Aquino, refused to allow Marcos to be buried at the Heroes'
Cemetery, fearing possible clashes between Marcos loyalists and
opponents.

Study: Heart tissue may recover when device used
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID KOENIG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ The long-held belief that damaged heart tissue can
never recover may be wrong.
	   When patients awaiting heart transplants were placed on a
mechanical pump to keep them alive, their dying heart cells showed
new signs of vigor, including greater ability to contract, a Temple
University study found.
	   The findings suggest that use of the pump might someday enable
some heart patients to postpone a transplant and perhaps even avoid
one altogether.
	   ``This is the first report of improved function in heart cells
under any therapy,'' said Dr. Kenneth B. Margulies, a professor of
medicine at Temple.
	   Heart failure, in which the heart pumps less blood than needed
by the body, is caused by various diseases, such as high blood
pressure, or may follow a heart attack that kills some of the heart
muscle.
	   The result is difficult breathing and fluid retention. Heart
failure is often progressive, with worsening symptoms and gradual
deterioration of the heart's ability to function.
	   The study of 22 patients who underwent heart transplants was
published Tuesday in Circulation, a journal of the American Heart
Association.
	   Margulies said the heart tissue probably rebounded because the
pump, called a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, gave the
heart a rest.
	   He said that once tissue dies during a heart attack, there is
nothing the mechnical pump can do for those cells, but the
remaining heart cells may strengthen when the device is used.
	   ``This is a very small number of patients, but still it's an
important preliminary observation,'' said Dr. Charles Francis, a
cardiologist and chief of medicine at New York's Harlem Hospital.
	   Normally, the LVAD is used a bridge to keep people's hearts
functioning until a donor organ becomes available for transplant.
	   ``This research suggests that being on the LVAD might itself
allow the heart to recover enough to even delay the need for
transplantation,'' Francis said.
	   Margulies said it's too soon to say whether the ventricular pump
will allow hearts to heal enough to avoid transplants altogether.
	   Harry Corvese, a 35-year-old Plano, Texas, man, believes he is
living proof of the researchers' findings.
	   Corvese, stricken in 1993 with a disease that damaged his heart
tissue, was fitted at Temple with a LVAD because doctors didn't
think he would live long enough to receive a transplant.
	   ``They took a chest X-ray. My heart was about the size of a
beach ball,'' Corvese said. ``I couldn't walk across the room
without running out of breath.''
	   He spent five weeks with a battery-powered heart pump implanted
in his chest and felt good enough to exercise.
	   ``When my (donated) heart came, I was healthy enough for the
transplant,'' Corvese said.
	   Corvese, whose public service ads for organ donation eventually
led to a full-time job with the Dallas-based American Heart
Association, said the biggest benefit of the Temple research could
be in reducing the number of people waiting for transplants.
	   ``We have people dying every day because there is such a
shortage of donor organs,'' he said.

World Cup: Fans clash as England beats Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sporadic trouble in Marseille overnight &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The scoreline read England 2, Tunisia 0. Outside
the stadium it was Injured 15, Arrested 27.
	   What happened inside the Velodrome in Marseille gave England's
coach, players and peaceful followers plenty to be pleased about.
	   What happened outside was nothing to do with soccer but
everything to do with a World Cup.
	   The English, armed with their reputations as soccer louts, were
in town to meet Tunisia in a Group G game Monday and that meant
frequent clashes with northern Africans from the rough areas of
Marseille, with rows of French police battling to get in between.
	   On a day Germany downed the United States 2-0 in Paris and
Romania edged Colombia 1-0, England was making headlines for the
wrong reasons.
	   After Sunday night's clashes, it was tense all day Monday in the
Old Port entertainment district as English fans bought alcohol in
supermarkets and some bars despite a post-match ban. Bars were
ordered to close hours earlier than normal and not sell alcohol.
	   Riot police lobbed tear gas on a beach to break up clashes
between English and Tunisian supporters watching the afternoon
match on a huge TV screen set up for people who lacked tickets to
the game.
	   As fans arrived at the game, English and Tunisians began
taunting each other, fighting broke again and police moved in to
arrest the ringleaders. Police managed to restore order by evening.
	   But there were scattered fights until dawn Tuesday between
Marseille police and suburban toughs, who attacked some English
fans lingering in the streets. Police protectively escorted
hundreds of the fans to Saint-Charles train station.
	   In two days of clashes, more than 50 people were injured,
including an Englishman whose neck artery was cut by a bottle and
another who was stabbed in the back. Police detained nearly 80
Englishman, Tunisians and Frenchmen.
	   Three of the Englishmen were sentenced to three months in
prison. Five English and three French suspects face trial July 17,
five days after the World Cup ends.
	   Meanwhile, the southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for
England's next match, with Romania on Monday.

Portugal to send police reinforcements to Macau to fight gang

crime &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Portugal will send police officers to Macau to help
tackle spiraling crime in the Portuguese enclave, where gangs are
fighting over the lucrative gambling industry, Macau's police chief
said Tuesday.
	   Speaking to reporters before leaving for an official visit to
Beijing, Judiciary Police Director Antonio Marques Baptista said
more than 10 Portuguese police officers will arrive in Macau soon.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, has been hit
by a wave of gang-related crime in recent months. Triads, or
Chinese gangs, reportedly are fighting over profits from the
gambling industry, which have been dwindling as Asia's economic
downturn takes a heavy toll on the enclave's tourism.
	   On Tuesday, the Macau Tourism and Amusement Co., which holds the
enclave's monopoly on running casinos, reported a 20 percent fall
in net profit last year to 3.71 billion patacas (U.S. dlrs 464
million).
	   Three Macau government officials, including a gambling
inspector, have been slain since March, and a series of arson
attacks followed the arrest of a reputed gang boss last month.
	   Baptista also narrowly escaped death last month when a bomb
planted under his car exploded.
	   Beijing and Lisbon have been blaming each other for not doing
enough to stem violence in the territory, which will return to
Chinese rule on Dec. 20, 1999, after more than 400 years of
Portuguese rule.
	   On Tuesday, Baptista said the Macau police delegation will meet
with Interpol and public security officials in Beijing during a
six-day visit to the Chinese capital.
	   The delegation will also ``exchange views and opinions on
fighting organized crimes and drug trafficking'' with police
officials in Guangzhou, a city in southern Guangdong province,
bordering Macau.
	   Macau police believe the triads have about 10,000 members in
Macau, although their leaders live in mainland China or Hong Kong.
	   The eight-square-mile (20.8-square-kilometer) territory of about
450,000 people has some 3,300 police officers.

Policeman, kidnapper killed in restive Caucasus republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A police officer who was taken hostage in the
Caucasus republic of North Ossetia was killed along with his
kidnapper when law enforcement officials tried to free him, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   The kidnapper took the policeman and another Interior Ministry
officer hostage near the village of Veseloye at midday on Monday.
	   An operation to free them was launched soon after, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported, citing the local Interior Ministry. The other
hostage escaped unharmed.
	   It was unclear who killed the kidnapper and the policeman.
	   The Caucasus region, which includes the breakaway region of
Chechnya, has been swept in recent months by a wave of kidnappings
and other crimes. Most of the abductions are for ransom, but some
also appear to be in retribution for previous hostage-takings.

Turkish military chiefs meet premier to discuss radical Islam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's military top brass called an
emergency meeting Tuesday with Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz,
apparently to pressure him into stepping up the fight against
Islamic fundamentalists.
	   The military, which has staged three coups since the 1960s, has
asserted itself as the guarantor of the modern Turkish state in
this predominantly Muslim but secular country. Last year the
military forced Turkey's first Islamic-led government to resign.
	   Yilmaz chaired the high military council meeting, where some 20
military personnel suspected of taking part in pro-Islamic
activities are expected to be dismissed, private NTV television
reported Tuesday.
	   The military has sacked over 300 officers accused of being
affiliated with Islamic groups over the past two years. The
council's decision is final and the courts have no jurisdiction
over it.
	   The generals think the government has made little progress in
the battle to curb Islamic fundamentalists, who want to turn Turkey
into a religious state.
	   Cabinet members have, for example, delayed the passage of the
so-called military-backed ``fundamentalism'' law -- which would
tighten control over Islamic attire and education and provide
heavier punishments for civil servants involved in pro-Islamic
activities.

Ariane 5 launch slated for October; Eutelsat switched to Ariane 4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The European Space Agency has announced a
mid-October launch for its new Ariane 5 rocket, whose past troubles
and delays have forced officials to switch a Eutelsat satellite to
the older Ariane 4.
	   The Ariane 503 will instead carry a mockup of Eutelsat's W2
satellite and an Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator already delivered
to the launch site on the South American territory of French
Guiana, ESA said in a statement Monday.
	   It would be the first commercial launching of the new, larger
rocket ESA hopes will maintain the European consortium's global
lead in the commercial launch market.
	   In February, Arianespace admitted that the second launch of the
rocket last Oct. 30 experienced problems, after the first Ariane 5
launch from Guiana Space Center crashed in June 1996.
	   Officials reported at the time that the second rocket had a
``higher-than-expected roll'' after separating from its booster,
and that additional tests would be needed.
	   On Monday, ESA said that ``taking into account the time to
develop, test and integrate the mockup'' of the W2, ``the Ariane
launch is now scheduled for mid-October.''
	   As a result of the delay, a W2 communications satellite that was
to ride on the Ariane 503 will be placed on an Ariane 4 rocket, ESA
said. No launch date was given.
	   ESA had set a June launch for the 109th Ariane commercial
mission, but the plans were put off for a later undisclosed date
due to delays in satellite delivery, a spokeswoman said.

Bangladesh's prime minister visits India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Prime Minister of Bangladesh flew
into New Delhi on Tuesday for what India says are purely talks
between neighbors, though Sheikh Hasina's aides say she will try to
make peace between India and Pakistan.
	   A senior Bangladeshi foreign ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity Monday, said that Hasina was concerned about
rising tension in the region after India and Pakistan tested
nuclear weapons last month. Although Hasina did not present herself
as a mediator, she is to visit Pakistan next week.
	   In New Delhi, a Foreign Office spokesman said Hasina's visit was
``taking place purely in the context of India-Bangladesh
relations,'' United News of India reported.
	   India has rejected outside mediation in its disputes with
Pakistan, with which it has fought three wars in the last 50 years.
Their main dispute is the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, a border
region divided between them that both countries claim in its
entirety.
	   Hasina, on a one-day trip, was the first head of state to visit
India since its nuclear tests.
	   The Bangladesh-India agenda is topped by a dispute over sharing
of the Ganges River water.
	   For years, Bangladesh has protested what it calls inadequate
supply of water from the Ganges River each summer. India says it
needs the water to keep the Calcutta port navigable for ships.
	   India could also raise the issue of Bangladeshi refugees living
in India. Vajpayee's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which came
to power in February-March elections, had campaigned to send back
the refugees, many of whom never returned after they fled their
country during its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.
	   Both nations also have planned to cooperate in combating
separatist violence in their nations. Rebels from both countries
have often fled to the other across the dense forests or rice paddy
fields at the border.
	   Indian rebel leader Anup Chetia is currently awaiting trial in
Bangladesh on charges of entering the country illegally. The trial
puts on hold India's request that Chetia be extradited to face
murder and kidnapping charges.

Tensions among Israeli leaders over talks with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister has said it is high
time for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to conclude an agreement
with the Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal, Israeli
media reported Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with the minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai, and said Tuesday he would not be rushed into a decision.
``We don't a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told Israel
army radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal would be
the second of three to which Israel has committed itself.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Informal U.S. deadlines for an
Israeli decision have passed without the Clinton administration
taking any action against Israel.
	   Mordechai, who is considered one of the moderates in the
Netanyahu government, told a closed forum, according to Israel
radio, that ``we have no choice but to carry out the second
redeployment and the time has come to take the decision.''
	   ``It is possible to wait another few days, maybe a week, with
this decision, but it is wrong to wait until the end of the summer
session of parliament,'' the Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted
Mordechai as saying.
	   ``Time is running out. Palestinian frustration (over the lack of
progress) can endanger Israel's security,'' Yediot quoted Mordechai
as saying.
	   Mordechai is a member of the inner circle of Cabinet ministers
supervising the contacts with the United States and the
Palestinians. His nemesis in the so-called kitchen Cabinet is
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon who says Israel must not hand
the Palestinians more than 9 percent of the West Bank in a second
pullback.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday denied reports that he agreed in principle
to a 13 percent withdrawal. ``We have not yet achieved such an
agreement,'' he said.

Gurkhas reject British government's offer for pension hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Former Gurkha soldiers on Tuesday
rejected as too little a hike in pension announced by the British
government last week.
	   The British Government had announced hikes ranging from 23 to 51
percent in pension being received by 26,375 retired Gurkha soldiers
who have served and fought wars for the British government.
	   Gurkhas are campaigning for pensions equal to those of their
British counterparts. Even with a 40 percent increase, a retired
Gurkha rifleman would receive dlrs 42 a month, while a retired
British rifleman would get about dlrs 750 a month.
	   ``This is discrimination against us. We will be adopting a more
aggressive campaign now,'' said Padam Gurung, chairman of the
Gurkha Ex-Serviceman's Organization.
	   GESO is organizing a Gurkha march from the Nepalese foreign
ministry to the British Embassy on July 16. They plan to hold a
sit-in at the embassy.
	   At present there are at least 3,000 British Gurkhas still in
active duty. Gurkha soldiers have served in the British Army for
nearly 200 years.

The sky's the limit for U.S. dollar's gains against yen, analysts

say
 &UR; Eds: This stands for story slugged Japan-Weakening Yen on Asia
Digest &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After soaring to its highest levels against the yen
in nearly eight years, for a moment there Tuesday the dollar was
actually falling.
	   But just for a moment.
	   The yen's weakness against the dollar may play havoc with the
region's economies, but the once-mighty yen has yet to find bottom.
And for the dollar, analysts say, the sky is still the limit.
	   ``I think the (dollar's long-term) direction is still north,''
said Tatsuya Ishii, senior sales manager and head of customer
foreign exchange at Banque Nationale de Paris in Tokyo.
	   The greenback's upward march is raising a loud cry of alarm from
world leaders.
	   Since June 1, the U.S. currency has risen 6 percent to a peak
early Tuesday of 146.75 yen. Traders say it could easily pierce the
150-yen level in coming days _ and keep going.
	   The reason for the dollar's strength: Investors are voting with
their feet and shifting their funds out of a Japanese economy mired
in its worst recession in half a century. The miserable returns and
lack of transparency in Japan's stock and bond markets also don't
inspire confidence.
	   Worse, no relief seems to be in sight.
	   The same old faces are still in charge of Japanese politics, and
they have shown themselves unwilling to make the painful structural
changes that foreign and Japanese investors alike are demanding.
	   ``The market has no confidence in Japan's economic policies,''
said investor Shigemi Nonaka, a managing director at Sakura Asset
Management Co.
	   Japan has come under increasing criticism amid concerns the
dollar's gains against the yen could spell disaster for struggling
economies elsewhere in Asia.
	   While a stronger dollar helps Japanese exporters by making their
products cheaper, most of those gains come at the expense of
products from other Asian countries.
	   The rest of Asia desperately needs the hard currency revenues
that exports bring.
	   A Chinese government economist called Japan ``irresponsible''
for not taking more aggressive steps to prop up its currency.
European finance ministers meeting in Wales issued a joint
communique Monday calling on Tokyo to reform its financial system.
	   Even Japan's own Ministry of International Trade and Industry
warned in a report Tuesday that volatility in the currency markets
could throw Asia back into turmoil and threaten the global trading
order.
	   ``A free international trade system cannot be maintained without
a stable monetary system,'' the report said.
	   All the attention by world economic officials halted the
dollar's advance on Tuesday as investors grew nervous about
possible central bank intervention on behalf of the yen. The dollar
slipped to 145.14 yen in late Tokyo trading.
	   But the yen's respite is unlikely to last, say traders.
	   ``It was just an adjustment,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign
exchange manager at the Tokyo branch of Commerzbank, who sees the
dollar quickly bouncing back to at least 148 yen.
	   There's a growing perception in Tokyo that Japan's economic
system _ which propelled Japan to become the world's No. 2 economy
_ has outgrown its usefulness.
	   The financial system, originally designed to funnel scarce
capital to strategic industries, doesn't know how to invest money
profitably in a mature economy.
	   Since most money flowed through banks, financial markets were
never allowed to develop sufficiently. And a seemingly never-ending
series of scandals involving insider trading and stock manipulation
hasn't improved the Tokyo Stock Exchange's popular image as a
rigged casino.
	   Investors still complain about inadequate disclosure by
companies and lax oversight by regulators.
	   And with Japan in the midst of its worst recession in half a
century, the outlook isn't good for corporate profits. Nor will the
Bank of Japan be able to raise short-term interest rates from
historic lows of half a percent.
	   The response of Japan's leaders?
	   We ``are concerned about (foreign exchange) movements which
represent pessimism not warranted by facts,'' Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto told Japan's Parliament Tuesday.

Australian adoptee finds birth mother in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese teen-ager sold as an infant
and adopted into an Australian family was reunited with her birth
mother Tuesday after DNA testing established their relationship.
	   Kartya Wunderle of Melbourne said she felt ``more at ease'' to
meet face to face with her birth mother and older sister, whose
identities were not revealed to the press at their request.
	   Wunderle and her Taiwan family hugged and cried during a
one-hour meeting at a police bureau, where they needed an
interpreter to converse.
	   Smiling later at a news conference, the 17-year-old said,
``Hopefully I can build a relationship with my biological mother.''
	   Wunderle said she found she also had four younger half siblings
in Taiwan.
	   Nola Wunderle, Kartya's adoptive mother, who accompanied her to
Taiwan, said discovery of her daughter's birth mother had been an
``overwhelming emotional experience'' ending an eight-year search.
	   ``We knew straight away by looking at them that they are
Kartya's family,'' she said.
	   Wunderle's quest has attracted massive publicity since her
arrival in Taipei 10 days ago, prompting sober reminiscences on the
former poverty of this newly affluent island of 21 million people.
Altogether, four women came forward for DNA tests to discover
whether the teen-ager was the baby they claimed to have given up
years ago, police said.
	   Wunderle's natural father never married her mother, and, mired
in poverty, sold her to an adoption broker for about 30,000 Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 882), police said. The man died soon afterward,
and Wunderle was adopted by her Australian family in 1981, they
said.
	   The adoption was arranged by a syndicate headed by a Taiwanese
woman, who was convicted in 1981 for selling 64 babies to
prospective parents overseas for up to U.S. dlrs 5,000 each, police
said.

Major powers expect Yeltsin to deliver tough message to Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's major industrialized nations expect
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to press Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic ``very firmly'' to end his crackdown on ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Tuesday.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov assured fellow
ministers at a meeting in London last Friday that Yeltsin would
deliver a tough message to Milosevic at their meeting in Moscow on
Tuesday, the British minister told BBC Radio 4.
	   ``In the course of today's meeting in Moscow we very much hope
President Milosevic will be able to respond to the demands we've
made, will be able to say what progress he intends to take, and to
accept that he has to be committed to carrying them out in full,''
Cook said.
	   At Friday's meeting, eight major powers demanded that Milosevic
call an immediate cease-fire, allow effective international
monitoring, facilitate the return of over 50,000 refugees who have
been made homeless, and ``make rapid progress'' in talks with
Albanian leaders to resolve the crisis which has left more than 300
people dead since March.
	   ``I'm pleased to say the Russian foreign minister supported all
four of those demands, signed up for them, and did give us an
assurance that President Yeltsin would press Mr. Milosevic very
firmly on those four demands,'' Cook said.
	   Six of the eight major powers belong to the so-called Contact
Group which has an international mandate to monitor events in the
Balkans - the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and
Italy.
	   While the major powers are hoping for a diplomatic solution in
Kosovo, Cook said NATO air exercises over Macedonia and Albania on
Monday ``demonstrated that we have the military capacity to
intervene if we have to.''
	   Russia has traditional ties to the Serbs in Yugoslavia because
of their common Slavic background. Although Moscow supports the
major powers in demanding an end to Yugoslav military action in
Kosovo, it has opposed military action. Russia also refused to go
along with a ban on commercial flights by Yugoslav airlines adopted
at Friday's meeting and approved on Monday by all 15 nations in the
European Union.
	   Britain has been pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing the use of force in Kosovo before any NATO air strikes
or peacekeeping missions are launched.
	   ``There is absolutely no doubt there is a great majority in the
Security Council for such a resolution,'' Cook said.
	   But he refused to say whether Britain would be prepared to go
ahead with military action if Russia vetoed a resolution. The
United States says a resolution would be welcome, but maintains
that existing U.N. resolutions on former Yugoslavia provide
sufficient authorization for any military action that might be
necessary.

Finland's joblessness rate at 14.6 percent in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's unemployment rate rose
slightly to 14.6 percent in May, up from 14.3 percent the previous
month, the government statistics agency said Tuesday.
	   However, the joblessness rate was down from May 1997 when 15.4
percent of the work force was out of a job, Statistics Finland
said.
	   The latest figure means that 385,000 people were out of work in
a population of 5.1 million, making the Finnish rate one of the
highest in the 15-nation European Union.
	   The unemployment rate of young people, aged 15 to 24, increased
to 42.6 percent in May from 32.5 percent in April, mainly because
schools ended and youth sought work, the agency said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Forcing children into battle uniform. Systematic
rape. Atrocities committed in the course of civil war.
	   These were some of the crimes that emerged as potential targets
when nations gathered Monday in Rome to open a U.N. conference
establishing an international criminal court.
	   A number of speakers, including representatives of Canada and
the European Union, called for the crimes to be included in the
statute.
	   ``It will help give new meaning and global reach to protecting
the vulnerable and innocent,'' Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd
Axworthy, told the delegates.
	   Defendants in the court will be individuals, unlike at the
existing International Court of Justice at The Hague, where nations
lodge complaints against nations.
	   Backers of the court, including human rights activists, believe
such a tribunal would act as a deterrent for crimes like rape and
murder during conflicts.
	   The United States, France, Russia and China favor significant
U.N. Security Council control over the court and its prosecutor.
	   Since those countries are permanent members of the council, such
control would give them effective veto power over prosecutions.
	   In the middle are a group of 46 countries headed by Canada,
including Australia, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and Britain _
also a Security Council member.
	   The group of 46 nations favors a compromise that would give the
Security Council power to suspend, with a unanimous vote, a
prosecution.
	   Much of the first day's darts were aimed at the United States,
which finds itself split from strong allies like Britain and
Canada. The United States also strongly opposes listing the use of
nuclear weapons as a war crime, as some have suggested.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the court could go
forward without the United States signing off on the issue of
Security Council control.
	   ``No one country, I hope, will want to be responsible for the
failure of this conference,'' Annan told reporters.
	   William Pace, head of a coalition of activist and human rights
groups pushing for the most independent and strongest court
possible, saw the issue as ``whether the majority of nations will
galvanize the political will to resist those nations not ready''
for a strong, independent court.
	   The Clinton administration says it wants a world criminal court
but is under pressure from the Pentagon and Congress to protect
American soldiers abroad.
	   Axworthy told reporters he was ``dismayed'' by the Pentagon's
position.
	   The idea of an international criminal court dates to the
Nuremberg war crimes tribunals of World War II. The idea was
revived a few years ago after a new round of horrors in the
mid-1990s, including widely publicized mass killings and systematic
rapes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.

Neighbors must respect Australia's `vigorous democracy,' says
</HEADLINE>
Howard &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's reputation as an open and
racially tolerant society won't be damaged by the electoral success
of Pauline Hanson's anti-Asian One Nation party, Prime Minister
John Howard said Tuesday.
	   In what he said was a message to the rest of the world, Howard
told an international conference of business and political leaders
that Australia was a strongly democratic country respectful of race
and with one of the most ethnically diverse communities in the
world.
	   ``Australia is recognized as an open, democratic country which
has a very robust parliamentary system,'' Howard said.
	   The government has launched a top-level response to Hanson after
her One Nation party attracted about 23 percent of the vote in a
weekend election in Queensland state. Recent opinion polls also
show her support growing into double figures on a national basis.
	   The election result has re-ignited Australia's race debate, with
the government playing down suggestions that many Australians
support Hanson's anti-Asian immigration, anti-Aboriginal welfare
and trade protectionist views.
	   Despite warnings to the contrary, voiced in newspaper editorials
in Singapore and Bangkok this week, Howard said Australia's
neighbors recognize that it ``has a great record of tolerance.''
	   He defended his ``softly, softly'' treatment of Hanson's rise,
saying that to ``sit on'' divergent expressions of view ``will only
end up promoting greater support'' for them.
	   ``What has to happen in relation to those events ... is to
identify the damaging consequences to Australians within Australia
of following the policies of inward-looking protectionist attitudes
toward trade,'' he said.
	   He said Australia's neighbors had to respect Australia's
political system of ``vigorous democracy.''
	   ``As prime minister, when I go to other countries, I don't give
them lectures on how to run their societies and their political
systems,'' Howard said. ``Equally, other countries don't do that to
Australia.''
	   Howard is on the horns of a dilemma as he considers when to call
an election due by March 1999.
	   He is trying to stem a flow of support away from his
conservative coalition toward One Nation while pursuing trade
liberalization and tax polices that Hanson opposes, rebutting her
race views and minimizing the negative impact of her success among
Australia's trading partners.
	   As vote counting continued Tuesday in the Queensland state
election, a clear outcome is still too close to call.
	   The Labor opposition said it is confident it has won 43 of the
45 seats it needs to have a majority in Parliament and to form
government in its own right. It has also embarked on a campaign to
woo the support of two non-One Nation independent legislators.
	   The conservative coalition parties have indicated they are
willing to form a minority government with the help of One Nation
candidates.

	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Marcelo Salas' recovery is bad news
for Austria and great news for Chile.
	   The Chilean striker, hero of the opening draw with Italy, walked
off the practice field Sunday complaining of a strained groin. This
gave the Austrians hope that he might be unable to play when they
meet in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday in their second match of the
World Cup.
	   But Salas was pronounced fit Monday after undergoing massages
and other treatment. Now the Austrians have good reason to be
worried.
	   Both teams are coming into Wednesday match from draws _ but with
a difference.
	   Austria barely managed to level the score against low-ranked
Cameroon, with striker Anton Polster getting the equalizer in the
last minute of last Thursday's match in Toulouse. The same day,
Chile managed a 2-2 draw against Italy, ranked tops in their group,
and Salas got both goals in Bordeaux.
	   If Salas does play Wednesday, the Austrians, who are older and
slower than the South Americans, will have their work cut out for
them. They must neutralize Salas and fellow attacker Ivan Zamorano,
while trying to get on the scoreboard themselves.
	   The outcome of the match could prove more critical to Austria
than to Chile in their efforts to advance to the second round.
	   If Chile loses, it still has a good chance to beat Cameroon in
their final match of the first round. For Austria, a loss to Chile
will increase the pressure because its last opponent in the first
stage is favored Italy.
	   ``We have to win against Chile,'' said midfielder Heimo
Pfeiffenberger as the team prepared to leave their training camp in
the Bordeaux region for St. Etienne. ``We can play a good game
against Italy, but our chances of winning against them are less
than against the Chileans.''
	   Neither Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska nor his Chilean
counterpart Nelson Acosta would disclose strategy before the game.
	   Acosta said the Austrians ``play a typical European soccer, very
strong, and have several experienced players. What we have to do is
what we know best: concentration in the defense, fast movements by
the sides, good coordination from midfield to the attack.''
	   Prohaska said a video review of the Chile-Italy game showed the
South Americans ``very good in fore-checking.''
	   ``If you give the Chileans time to draw up in formation, then it
becomes extremely difficult to penetrate them,'' he said, adding
that one key to victory was to force the Chileans to play the
Austrian game.
	   Likely lineups:
	   Chile; Nelson Tapia, Ronald Fuentes, Javier Margas, Pedro Reyes,
Moises Villarroel, Francisco Rojas, Nelson Parraguez, Clarence
Acuna, Fabian Estay, Ivan Zamorano, Marcelo Salas.
	   Austria; Michael Konsel, Peter Schoettel, Anton Pfeffer,
Wolfgang Feiersinger, Heimo Pfeifenberger, Mario Haas, Harald
Cerny, Arnold Wetl, Roman Maehlich, Dietmar Kuehbauer, Anton
Polster.

China renews appeals to Japan to stabilize yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed deep concern Tuesday about the
pressure imposed on Asian economies by the weakening Japanese yen,
but said it would not devalue its own currency in response.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said quick action to halt
the yen's slump was needed to help Asian economies recover from the
region's nearly yearlong financial upheaval.
	   But while urging Japan and other countries that he did not name
to stabilize the yen, Zhu indicated that China has no plans to
devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   ``The international balance of payments in China is in good
shape and the (yuan) will remain stable,'' he said at a
twice-weekly briefing for reporters.
	   China's decision not to devalue its currency has been widely
praised for keeping battered Asian economies from sinking further.
China has used its decision not to devalue, despite pressures on
its economy, to project itself as a responsible partner in the
global market.
	   ``In stabilizing the financial crisis, China has made tremendous
contributions. China has taken risks and paid prices,'' Zhu said.
	   China's central bank governor, Dai Xianglong, also has
criticized Japan for not stabilizing the yen, and the bank's
newspaper, the Financial News, on Monday blamed both the United
States and Japan for allowing ``the yen to depreciate without
making any efforts'' to stabilize it.
	   Zhu stopped short of openly blaming Tokyo or Washington but said
China hoped Japan and ``relevant countries'' will ``strengthen
cooperation to prevent an escalation of the situation.''
	   Japan is a major Chinese trading partner and investor. The
weaker yen is likely to make it tougher for China to attract
Japanese investment and export to Japan, thereby putting pressure
on the yuan.
	   ``Given the impact of the Japanese economy and the Japanese yen
in East Asia and on the world economy, we are very concerned about
the continuous low of the Japanese yen,'' Zhu said.
	   The slide ``will not be conducive to the return of stability to
financial markets in East Asia,'' he added. He urged Japan and
other countries to ``show their courage and wisdom ... to prevent
further devaluation of the Japanese yen so as to create the
necessary conditions for the recovery of the regional economy.''
	   Zhu said the yen will likely be discussed at a meeting next week
in Malaysia of trade ministers from the 18 nations and regions in
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

China downplays anti-Asian party's success in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Tuesday brushed off the electoral
success in Australia of the One Nation party, saying its anti-Asian
views would not become popular.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao stopped short of
criticizing the party's strong showing in a weekend election in
Queensland state, saying the outcome was an internal affair of
Australia. The party attracted about 23 percent of the vote.
	   But Zhu said people of Chinese origin and other Asian immigrants
have for years made ``positive contributions'' toward Australia's
economic and social development.
	   Ethnic equality was a trend of the times, and ``the One Nation
party's anti-Asia national racism policy will not only be unpopular
but also run against the historical trend,'' Zhu said at a regular
briefing for reporters.

Reports: IMF sending special mission to Russia next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian news agencies reported Tuesday that the
International Monetary Fund would send negotiators to Russia next
week to discuss additional aid to shore up the country's crumbling
financial markets, but the Moscow IMF office said that it had no
such information.
	   The news reports reflected the continuing hopes among some
officials and market participants that the IMF will come through
with an emergency bailout package for Russia, even though the fund
and Russian government officials have said repeatedly that the
country is capable of overcoming the crisis on its own.
	   The ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies said Tuesday that
officials in the government feel that additional aid is necessary
to rescue Russian financial markets from collapse.
	   The market collapse late last month prompted fears of a
devaluation of the national currency, the ruble, which would lead
to a sharp rise in prices. Russian officials worry that inflation,
combined with the government's continuing inability to pay state
workers their wages on time, could lead to mass protests.
	   Russian markets tumbled for the seventh straight day Monday, and
were weakening again Tuesday. Top government officials have warned
that the country faces a ``heated autumn'' unless it can resolve
its financial crisis.
	   Stock prices plunged 7.3 percent on Monday, with the Russian
Trading System Index closing at 165.11, down from 178.13 Thursday
ahead of a long holiday weekend.
	   In a more worrying sign, yields on the one-year benchmark
government Treasury bill were at 71 percent, up from 63 percent on
Thursday.

Tensions among Israeli leaders over talks with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister has said it is high
time for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to conclude an agreement
with the Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal, Israeli
media reported Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with the minister, Yitzhak
Mordechai, and said Tuesday he would not be rushed into a decision.
``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told
Israel army radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal would be
the second of three to which Israel has committed itself.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Informal U.S. deadlines for an
Israeli decision have passed without the Clinton administration
taking any action against Israel.
	   Mordechai, who is considered one of the moderates in the
Netanyahu government, told a closed forum, according to Israel
radio, that ``we have no choice but to carry out the second
redeployment and the time has come to take the decision.''
	   ``It is possible to wait another few days, maybe a week, with
this decision, but it is wrong to wait until the end of the summer
session of parliament,'' the Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted
Mordechai as saying.
	   ``Time is running out. Palestinian frustration (over the lack of
progress) can endanger Israel's security,'' Yediot quoted Mordechai
as saying.
	   Mordechai is a member of the inner circle of Cabinet ministers
supervising the contacts with the United States and the
Palestinians. His nemesis in the so-called kitchen Cabinet is
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon who says Israel must not hand
the Palestinians more than 9 percent of the West Bank in a second
pullback.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday denied reports that he agreed in principle
to a 13 percent withdrawal. ``We have not yet achieved such an
agreement,'' he said.

New Zealand, Australian markets lower after Wall Street drop
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closings, edits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Shares in New Zealand and
Australia fell Tuesday, weighed down by the sharp fall in U.S.,
European and Asian stock markets, brokers said.
	   In New Zealand, the NZSE-40 capital index finished 28.61 points
lower at 1,970.1 after recovering some ground lost during
midsession trading.
	   In Australia, the benchmark all ordinaries index ended 42.6
points lower at 2,524.9, up from an intraday low of 2,511.2, with
local sentiment remaining fragile.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at
8,627.93 Monday, down 207.01 points from 8,834.94 Friday and at a
three-month low. Prices were driven down by investor pessimism over
the outlook for Japanese recovery efforts.
	   ``It's a pretty gloomy market at this stage,'' broker Jon
Hancock said after early trading.
	   Turnover on both markets was boosted Monday by the debut of
insurance and funds manager AMP Ltd. on the New Zealand and
Australian stock exchanges.
	   In Australia, AMP shares closed 2.50 Australian dollars (about
U.S. dlrs 1.47) lower at 20.50 Australian dlrs (about U.S. dlrs
12).
	   ANZ Securities (NZ) Ltd. broker Mark Coxon said earlier trading
in AMP stock had dried up along with the broader market falls.
	   Both the Australian and New Zealand currencies fell to lows
Tuesday morning, but recovered later.
	   After falling to a new 12-year low of 58.1 U.S. cents, the
Australian dollar was trading at 58.8 U.S. cents shortly after 0700
GMT (5 p.m. local time).
	   The New Zealand dollar bounced back above 49 U.S. cents after
earlier sliding to an 11 1/2-year low of 48.82 U.S. cents. It
closed local trading at 49.58 U.S. cents.

Dollar falls in volatile trading, stocks tumble in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency;
ADDS trader comment in 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen in volatile
trading Tuesday as investors grew increasingly jittery that world
central bankers may finally intervene to halt the Japanese
currency's slide. Tokyo stock prices declined.
	   The dollar bought 145.14 yen in late Tokyo trading, down 1.30
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
146.15 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 104.79
points, or 0.71 percent, closing at 14,720.38. On Monday, the
Nikkei had lost 197.16 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   Nervousness about central bank intervention caused the dollar to
swing as low as 142.40 yen and as high as 146.75 yen.
	   Traders cautioned that with the U.S. currency near eight-year
highs and poised to rise further, world economic officials may be
forced into concerted action.
	   ``We need to be extremely careful about joint intervention,''
said Ryohei Muramatsu, foreign exchange manager at the Tokyo branch
of Commerzbank.
	   World finance officials have grown more outspoken in their
concern about the dollar.
	   On Monday, finance ministers of the European Union, meeting in
Cardiff, Wales, urged Tokyo to take new measures to strengthen and
reform Japan's economy.
	   Former Premier Li Peng, a senior leader in China's ruling
Communist Party, also urged Japan Monday to stabilize its economy,
insisting that the weak yen was putting increased pressure on
Asia's already battered economies.
	   A weak yen helps Japanese exporters, but those gains come at the
expense of the rest of Asia. As the yen weakens, Japanese exports
become cheaper in key markets like the United States, grabbing
market share from Asian competitors.
	   Japanese officials also hinted at joint efforts to prop up the
yen.
	   Early Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka made a
rare comment on the exchange rate, saying that he is worried about
the yen's sharp decline.
	   ``I have strong concerns about the excessive weakness of the
yen,'' Muraoka said. ``It is necessary to coordinate with other
nations to take proper steps on it.''
	   And the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji Omi,
echoed those concerns Tuesday, saying an overly weak yen could have
a negative impact worldwide.
	   Concern that the weakening yen could throw Asia back into
economic turmoil hurt prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   The glum outlook for Japan's economy also continued to weigh on
share prices. Just Friday, Japan confirmed that its economy is in
its worst recession since World War II.
	   Pessimism about the world's second-largest economy drove the Dow
Jones industrial average on Monday to its biggest point loss since
early January _ 207 points, or more than 2 percent.
	   In Tokyo Tuesday, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed on the first section fell 10.74 points, or 0.92
percent, to 1,156.47. It had slipped 10.04 points, or 0.85 percent,
the previous day.
	   Trade volume was above average, with 425 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from 313 million Monday. Declines
outnumbered gains 2-to-1.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.210 percent from Monday's finish of 1.185
percent, driving its price down to 111.93 yen from 112.12 yen.

Israel refuses to extradite suspected German terrorist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel has rejected Germany's request to
extradite a German citizen arrested on suspicion of plotting a
suicide bombing in Israel, an Israeli official said Tuesday.
	   Stephan Smyrek, 26, was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at
Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport. He is accused of plotting with the
Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah to carry out the
bombing in Israel.
	   Israeli authorities say Smyrek confessed to his role in the
plot, which was never carried out.
	   A representative of the Israeli State Attorney's office, Devora
Chen, told the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday that Israeli
authorities ``have decided not to extradite the accused.''
	   She said Israel wants to try him here, and that according to the
European convention on extradition, there is no obligation to
extradite an accused person who has already been indicted in the
country where he was arrested, Israel radio said.
	   Defense counsel Dan Assan accused Israel of holding Smyrek as a
bargaining chip for a future prisoner exchange with Hezbollah.
	   ``The question arises whether the young German citizen Stephan
Smyrek ... will languish in a high-security prison as a bargaining
card for the rest of his life,'' Assan told the court.
	   Assan supported the German extradition request, arguing that his
client cannot get a fair trial in Israel and had been mistreated in
prison.
	   Smyrek appeared healthy and in good spirits Tuesday as he
appeared in court wearing a sweatshirt and blue jeans. He listened
attentively as the proceedings were translated from Hebrew into
German.
	   On a previous court appearance he looked unwell and coughed
constantly. He was said to be suffering from asthma and bronchitis.
German prosecutors have said they are seeking to try Smyrek because
they feel they have a stronger case than the Israelis, because
Smyrek planned the attack in Germany, and not because of Assan's
claims.
	   The charges against Smyrek carry a maximum penalty of two life
sentences plus five years.
	   Assan was to have presented his case against the indictment, but
was granted a two-week postponement to give him time to seek a plea
bargain. The next court session was set for June 30.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Forcing children into battle uniform. Systematic
rape. Atrocities committed in the course of civil war.
	   On Tuesday, Algeria's delegation added international terrorism
and drug trafficking to the list of crimes emerging as potential
targets of an international criminal court. Delegates from more
than 150 nations are gathering here at a U.N. conference to
establish the tribunal.
	   Terrorism is a key issue for Algeria, where a six-year-old
Muslim extremist insurgency began when the military-backed
government canceled January 1992 elections. The conflict, involving
numerous attacks on civilians, has left more than 75,000 people
dead. Police across Europe in recent weeks have arrested dozens of
suspects they say are linked to Algerian terrorism in recent weeks.
	   A number of speakers, including representatives of Canada and
the European Union, called for crimes involving children and women
to be included in the statute.
	   ``It will help give new meaning and global reach to protecting
the vulnerable and innocent,'' Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd
Axworthy, told the delegates during the gathering's opening Monday.
	   Defendants in the court will be individuals, unlike at the
existing International Court of Justice at The Hague, where nations
lodge complaints against nations.

 &UR; CUBA: Cubans began sending in applications for U.S. visa lottery &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Hundreds of Cubans crowded post offices in the
nation's capital on Monday, the first day to mail in applications
for a lottery for U.S. visas.
	   Several dozen people also gathered outside the U.S. Interests
Section in Havana hoping to turn in their applications in person.
But police officers who blocked off residential streets around the
mission reminded them that applications had to be sent through the
mail.
	   The Cuban government explained the application rules earlier
this month in the Communist daily Granma in an attempt to prevent
crowding at post offices and around the U.S. mission.
	   However, Cubans waiting outside the U.S. mission said they
feared that their applications would either be lost in the mail or
seized by government officials. Cuban government officials in the
past have rejected such fears as unfounded.
 &UR; HAITI: U.S. repatriates another 100 Haitian boat people
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A U.S. Coast Guard cutter returned
103 Haitian boat people Monday, the latest in a steady stream of
refugees, this time found on an overcrowded sailboat in the
Bahamas.
	   The Haitians were jammed into a 30-foot (10-meter) boat when the
cutter sighted them Friday near Great Inagua. It is just 60 miles
(100 kilometers) from Port-de-Paix, the northern port from which
they set out Thursday and a popular departure point for boat
people.
	   A 1981 U.S.-Haiti treaty permitting the United States to
repatriate Haitians found in international waters expired in 1996,
but the repatriations have continued, as have the attempts to flee
from the poorest country in the Western hemisphere.
	   ``Before our leaders get around to solving our problems, me and
my six children will have had time to die,'' said Lavictoire
Compere, a 31-year old widow who was among the refugees.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Attorney general promises tougher money laundering law
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bankers and lawmakers in Barbados are haggling
over money-laundering legislation that would require large deposits
to be reported to the government, the island's attorney-general
said.
	   The proposed legislation originally required banks to report all
deposits over dlrs 7,500, but bankers complained it would be too
much trouble, said Attorney-General David Simmons.
	   ``My own recommendation is going to be dlrs 15,000, and I don't
know what Cabinet will say,'' he said.
	   Simmons was interviewed during the a U.N. Special Assembly on
drugs last week.
	   He said the money-laundering bill should be ready for a vote in
Parliament in August.

Yeltsin, Milosevic meet over Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met Tuesday
with President Boris Yeltsin, hoping to find common ground, but was
expected to hear a slightly softened version of NATO's demand that
he ease up on Kosovo.
	   Though critical of NATO's exercises Monday in Kosovo's
neighborhood, the Russian president was expected to join western
leaders in calling on Milosevic to end his violent campaign against
the province's ethnic Albanians.
	   Yeltsin welcomed Milosevic to his Kremlin office late Tuesday
morning, and thanked him for accepting the invitation to meet.
	   ``It's good that our desire to meet was mutual,'' Yeltsin was
quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
	   After their one-on-one meeting, the two leaders were joined by
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the director of the foreign
intelligence service.
	   ``President Boris Yeltsin once again spoke against any options
involving force and for the search of exclusively peaceful ways of
settling the crisis,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Under the headline ``Last Chance,'' the Novye Izvestiya
newspaper wrote Tuesday that Milosevic ``has cheated the Kremlin
peacemakers so many times that others in their place would long ago
have repudiated such a `Slavic brother.'''
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin told
reporters at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. ``Unilateral,
provocative steps that could push the sides to escalate the
conflict should be avoided. A stable, long-lasting settlement can
only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.
	   ``Russia itself would like to believe in the paramount
importance of the meeting in the Kremlin,'' Novye Izvestiya wrote,
``as it wants to believe that someone somewhere still really
depends on Russia.''

	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A new air service between Fiji, Singapore and
London announced Tuesday will meet governmental requirements to be
designated the Pacific Island nation's second international
airline.
	   Singapore-based Fiji Airways Corp. said it will start in
November operating a thrice-weekly service from November using a
Boeing 747-300 Combi and an A-310-200 Airbus leased from Singapore
Airlines.
	   The Fiji government has said that Fiji Airways would receive
official designation as the nation's second international carrier
if it met capital requirements.
	   The other airline, Air Pacific, which is 51 percent controlled
by the Fiji government, flies to the United Sates, Japan, Australia
and New Zealand.
	   The new airline is majority owned by Fiji accountant Neil
Underhill, who will become the airline's chairman, spokesman Santie
Pillai said.
	   The remaining stake is held by an undisclosed foreign investor
who will supply the U.S. dlrs 5 million (10 million Fiji dollars)
startup capital required by the Fiji government.
	   Fiji Airways will apply to the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji
for an air operators certificate and is waiting for air service
agreements with Singapore and Britain to be ratified, Pillai said.
	   The airline expects to deliver between 30,000 and 50,000
tourists to Fiji in its first year of business.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government posted a
budget deficit of 15.4 billion pesos (dlrs 375 million) in the
first five months of 1998, far exceeding its target of 75 million
pesos (dlrs 1.8 million) for the period.
	   Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez said Tuesday the
government's revenue collection was affected by the regional
financial crisis, which caused a slowdown in economic output. He
noted that income taxes paid by major corporations have declined
since January, an effect of their weaker earnings.
	   The five-month budget deficit is a sharp turnaround from the 4.9
billion peso (dlrs 120 million) surplus posted by the government in
the same period last year.
	   Enriquez said revenues collected in the five-month period
reached 187.4 billion pesos (dlrs 4.57 billion), short of the
government's target by 19.4 billion pesos (dlrs 473 million).
	   Proceeds from privatization of government-held assets also fell
sharply to 117 million pesos (dlrs 2.8 million) from 2.7 billion
pesos (dlrs 65.8 million) in the year-earlier period.
	   Revenues from the Bureau of Customs also declined.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service announced its rating
actions on Japan's trust banks Tuesday.
	   It confirmed the credit ratings and bank financial strength
ratings of Chuo Trust and Banking Co. while placing under review
the ratings of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. for possible
downgrade.
	   ``The rating actions reflect Moody's concerns over the trust
banking sector's long-term franchise, which has been considerably
affected by mounting restructuring pressure on the nation's
financial system,'' the rating agency said.
	   The rating agency also noted that the rating outlooks of Toyo
Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. were
changed to negative from stable.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates
will visit South Korea this week to meet with local business
leaders and President Kim Dae-jung, to explore business
opportunities and discuss the importance of information technology
in the nation.
	   Gates will be in Seoul Wednesday and Thursday before departing
for Taiwan on his Asian tour, according to a press release. Gates'
Seoul visit follows his trip to Japan.
	   He may seek more business deals such as the dlrs 20 million
minority stake purchase in Hangul and Computer Co. Monday, but a
spokesman for Microsoft refused to comment on whether the chairman
has specific business opportunities in mind.
	   Hangul and Computer, a Korean word-processing software
developer, sold a reported 19 percent stake to Microsoft.
	   Gates is to meet with the South Korean president Thursday, when
the two will discuss issues on information technology.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Germany's Bayerischen Motoren Werke AG is
negotiating with Chinese company Jingcheng Motorcycle Co. of
Nanjing to form a motorcycle joint venture, BMW announced Tuesday.
	   The joint venture will aim to produce motorcycles for China's
police departments, said Dong Xianquan, BMW's chief representative
to Beijing.
	   Dong refused to disclose other details, including BMW's planned
stake in the joint venture or its production capacity. He said BMW
will start with technological cooperation to study market demand
before making investment.
	   Last year, Shanghai's police department bought 350 motorcycles
and Beijing's police department also bought about the same number,
Dong said.
	   The project is BMW's ``first solid step'' toward forming more
joint ventures in China, Dong added.
	   Currently, BMW only imports its cars to China. Dong said the
company still hopes to eventually manufacture cars locally and has
conducted feasibility studies over the past four years for
joint-venture partnerships.

Hong Kong share prices close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally
higher Tuesday, but sharp early gains were eroded by continued
worries over the weakness of the Japanese yen.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 63.95 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,526.45. On Monday, the
index had slumped 452.94 points, or 5.7 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 7.57 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
970 million), up from Monday's 6.24 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 800 million).
	   Brokers said there was selective bargain-hunting in the morning
following Monday's sharp falls in share prices.
	   They said prices eased in the afternoon as the Japanese currency
began slipping toward 145 yen against the U.S. dollar from a
morning high of around 143 yen.
	   ``It all has to do with the currency. The (Hong Kong stock)
market is tracking the currency very closely,'' said Lino Delgado,
associate director at Amsteel Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
	   Brokers said investors were also cautious following sharp falls
overnight on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average
tumbled 207.01 points to 8,627.93.
	   Among gainers, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.65 Hong Kong dollars to
31.40, China Light rose 1.15 dollars to 31.00, Cheung Kong rose 40
cents to 31.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 35 cents to 28.75.
	   Going against the trend were Hang Seng Bank, which fell 1.90
dollars to 41.90, and HSBC Holdings, which fell 50 cents to 169.50.

Bosnian Serb parliament deposes hardline speaker and deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Supporters of a
pro-Western course in the Serb half of Bosnia early Tuesday deposed
the hardline speaker of parliament, in a move expected to make the
Serb republic more open for non-Serbs.
	   The parliament acted on a letter from the top international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who in late May asked the
parliament to fulfill a promise made in January to choose one of
the 18 Muslim or Croat deputies as speaker for the 83-member
parliament.
	   Deputies living in the half of Bosnia that is a Muslim-Croat
Federation won seats in last November's parliamentary elections on
votes from the hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs driven out of
what is now the Serb Republic during the 1992-5 war.
	   The move to elect a Muslim or Croat as speaker was continuously
blocked by hardline legislators loyal to wartime Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted by the international war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   A Karadzic loyalist, parliament speaker Dragan Kalinic, and his
deputy Nikola Poplasen from the ultranationalist Radical Party were
deposed by a vote of 43-35 in the early hours Tuesday.
	   Kalinic denounced his foes as showing ``their true colors of
servility to outside masters.''
	   The differences between Karadzic's camp and supporters of
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who last year turned
against Karadzic and supported the West's course in Bosnia, are now
``huge and irrevocable,'' Kalinic added.
	   Parliament was to convene again Tuesday, but it was not clear if
a speaker and new deputy speaker would be chosen at the current
session.

Israel refuses to extradite suspected German terrorist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel has rejected Germany's request to
extradite a German citizen arrested on suspicion of plotting a
suicide bombing in Israel, an Israeli official said Tuesday.
	   Stephan Smyrek, 26, was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at
Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport. He is accused of plotting with the
Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah to carry out the
bombing in Israel.
	   Israeli authorities say Smyrek confessed to his role in the
abortive plot.
	   A representative of the Israeli State Attorney's office, Devora
Chen, told the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday that Israeli
authorities ``have decided not to extradite the accused.''
	   She said Israel wants to try him here, and that according to the
European convention on extradition, there is no obligation to
extradite an accused person who has already been indicted in the
country where he was arrested, Israel radio said.
	   Defense counsel Dan Assan accused Israel of holding Smyrek as a
bargaining chip for a future prisoner exchange with Hezbollah.
	   ``The question arises whether the young German citizen Stephan
Smyrek ... will languish in a high-security prison as a bargaining
card for the rest of his life,'' Assan told the court.
	   Assan supported the German extradition request, arguing that his
client cannot get a fair trial in Israel and had been mistreated in
prison.
	   Smyrek appeared healthy and in good spirits Tuesday as he
appeared in court wearing a sweatshirt and blue jeans. He listened
attentively as the proceedings were translated from Hebrew into
German.
	   On a previous court appearance he looked unwell and coughed
constantly. He was said to be suffering from asthma and bronchitis.
German prosecutors have said they are seeking to try Smyrek because
they feel they have a stronger case than the Israelis, because
Smyrek planned the attack in Germany _ not because of Assan's
claims.
	   The charges against Smyrek carry a maximum penalty of two life
sentences plus five years.
	   Assan was to have presented his case against the indictment, but
was granted a two-week postponement to give him time to seek a plea
bargain. The next court session was set for June 30.

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders were set Tuesday to
add their voices to the growing international campaign to secure
the release of East Timor independence leader Xanana Gusmao and
other political prisoners in Indonesia.
	   A draft statement under consideration by the 15 EU leaders urged
Indonesia ``to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms (and)
release all political prisoners, including those from East Timor.''
	   The draft, obtained by The Associated Press, was expected to be
adopted later Tuesday at the end of the EU's two-day summit.
	   The statement welcomed new Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's
pledge to hold elections next year and implement further economic
and political reforms. It said the EU would continue to support
Indonesia in international financial institutions ``provided a
credible economic reform policy is followed.''
	   On the margin of the summit Monday night, Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres urged South African President Nelson
Mandela to press ahead with efforts to secure Gusmao's release.
	   ``President Mandela will resume his conversations with the
Indonesian authorities,'' Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
said after Guterres' meeting with the South Africa leader, who was
invited to the summit as a guest of honor.
	   Habibie, who took over as president in May, signaled in an
interview last week that he was considering freeing Gusmao, who was
captured in 1992 and is serving a 20-year sentence.
	   Habibie's predecessor, Suharto, ordered the invasion of East
Timor in 1975 as Portugal was preparing to grant independence to
the territory. Portugal is lobbying to secure self-determination
for East Timor, which the United Nations refuses to recognize as
part of Indonesia.

North Korea admits overseas missile sales for first time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ In an open challenge to U.S. efforts
to curb global missile proliferation, North Korea declared Tuesday
that it will continue developing, testing and selling missiles.
	   The declaration, carried by the North's official Korean Central
News Agency, marked the first time that the hard-line communist
country has admitted selling missiles abroad.
	   For years, U.S. officials have said they have evidence that
North Korea was selling Scud missiles to Iran and Syria. But the
Clinton administration's efforts to persuade North Korea to curb or
stop such sales have made no progress.
	   ``We will continue developing, testing and deploying missiles,''
KCNA said in a commentary. ``Our missile export is aimed at
obtaining foreign money we need at present.''
	   North Korea defended its missile development and export program
by accusing Washington of maintaining economic embargoes that it
said were stifling it.
	   In 1996, the United States began talks with North Korea aimed at
persuading it to freeze its missile program and join an
international agreement designed to restrict missile proliferation.
	   But the talks soon stalled. The latest round of negotiations was
abruptly canceled last August in New York, and no new discussions
are scheduled.
	   ``By declaring for the first time that it is actually exporting
missiles, North Korea is upping the ante in its talks with
Washington,'' said Kim Koo-sup, a senior researcher at Seoul's
government-funded Korea Institute for Defense Analysis.
	   North Korea, gripped by severe food shortages and diplomatic
isolation, sees a way out in striking major diplomatic deals with
the United States.
	   It agreed in 1994 to freeze its suspected nuclear weapons
program in return for fuel, replacement nuclear power plants and
other economic and diplomatic benefits.
	   It now wants to sign a peace treaty with the United States,
excluding rival South Korea. But Washington has dismissed the North
Korean demand, insisting that a peace treaty must be signed between
the two Koreas.
	   North Korea said it could discuss missile non-proliferation with
the United States if Washington signs a peace treaty with it and
compensates it for an expected loss of income from missile sales.
	   Washington is still technically at war with North Korea after
leading U.N. forces on the South's side during the 1950-53 Korean
War, which ended without a peace treaty.
	   North Korea's missile program is based on Scud technology
provided by the former Soviet Union or Egypt, according to American
officials.
	   In 1993, North Korea tested a Scud-based Rodong-1 missile, which
has a range of 1,000 kilometers (625 miles), enough to reach Japan.
	   Kim and other South Korean military experts said North Korea is
believed to have begun mass-producing and deploying Rodong-1
missiles, capable of carrying chemical and atomic warheads.
	   North Korea also is believed to be developing new ``Taepodong''
missiles with ranges long enough to reach the western United
States, U.S. intelligence officials said.
	   North Korea agreed last year to join four-party peace talks with
South Korea, the United States and China but the negotiations have
stalled over questions of format and agenda.

Bosnian Serb parliament deposes hard-line speaker and deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Supporters of a
pro-Western course in the Serb half of Bosnia deposed the hard-line
speaker of parliament Tuesday, in a move expected to make the Serb
republic more open to non-Serbs.
	   A Karadzic loyalist, parliament speaker Dragan Kalinic, and his
deputy Nikola Poplasen from the ultranationalist Radical Party were
deposed by a vote of 43-35 in the early hours Tuesday.
	   Kalinic denounced his foes as showing ``their true colors of
servility to outside masters.''
	   The parliament acted on a letter from the top international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who in late May asked the
parliament to fulfill a promise made in January to choose one of
the 18 Muslim or Croat deputies as speaker for the 83-member
parliament.
	   Deputies living in the half of Bosnia that is a Muslim-Croat
Federation won seats in last November's parliamentary elections on
votes from the hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs driven out of
what is now the Serb Republic during the 1992-1995 war.
	   The move to elect a Muslim or Croat as speaker was continuously
blocked by hard-line legislators loyal to wartime Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted by the international war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   The differences between Karadzic's camp and supporters of
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who last year turned
against Karadzic and supported the West's course in Bosnia, are now
``huge and irrevocable,'' Kalinic added.
	   Parliament was to convene again Tuesday, but it was not clear if
a speaker and new deputy speaker would be chosen at the current
session.

World Bank urges international package to stabilize yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ It will be up to the Group of Seven
leading industrialized nations to stabilize the tumbling Japanese
yen, a critical factor for any economic recovery in Asia, a senior
World Bank official said Tuesday.
	   Jean-Michel Severino, the bank's vice president for East Asia
and the Pacific, said the G-7 had a lot of experience in
formulating currency stabilization plans.
	   ``I think it's in this group (G-7) that the key solutions are
lying,'' Severino said at a conference of Asian business and
economic leaders.
	   But the Japanese government must also present a ``consistent and
coherent'' approach to solving its own problems if any
international stabilization plan is to work, he said.
	   Speaking at the Australia Summit, Severino said now was a
critical time for the management of the Asian economic crisis, with
the outcome delicately balanced.
	   ``We have one crisis behind us and we have entered a period of
deep and probably long-lasting depression (in East Asia),'' he
said.
	   ``Growth rates for the region in 1998 will be in the range of
minus 2 to minus 15 percent and the prospects for 1999 are gloomy
as well.''
	   He said the crisis had cost the five countries most affected _
Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea _ an
amount equivalent to around 80 percent of their gross domestic
product through the withdrawal of credits and capital outflows.
	   Additionally, the collapse of regional stock exchanges and
massive drops in exchange rates had had an enormous impact on
individual wealth.
	   Perhaps the most disturbing aspect was that depression was
occurring in virtually all of the region at the same time.
	   ``The depression is being exported from one country to the other
and everybody is going down at the same time,'' he said.
	   ``Regional trade, which makes up 50 percent of the total exports
of the region, has halved since last year.
	   ``Finding a way to bring the whole region up at the same time is
probably the most critical question we have to ask ourselves,'' he
added.
	   Also at the summit, Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai
Panitchpakdi, warned of dire worldwide consequences if the Japanese
currency could not be stabilized.
	   ``If the yen dropped with no bottom, a second Asian crisis would
take place,'' Supachai told reporters. ``That in turn could lead to
a world recession.
	   ``The whole world should pay more attention to the Japanese
problem.''

Quiet returns to Indonesian provincial towns after street unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police and soldiers patrolled several
provincial towns Tuesday after mobs went on a rampage, throwing
stones at dozens of shops and houses.
	   Fearful store owners kept their shops closed in the towns of
Cianjur, Tegal and Tuban in central Java Island. Last month, as
many as 1,190 people were killed in riots over price increases in
the capital, Jakarta.
	   Indonesia is enduring an economic crisis that has left millions
of people out of work and raised a swell of popular discontent that
led to the ouster of President Suharto after 32 years in power. The
economic turmoil shows no sign of abating.
	   In Cianjur, 100 kilometers (70 miles) southeast of Jakarta,
thousands of people demanding the resignation of the mayor and
other officials suspected of corruption demonstrated Monday at the
city hall. Some protesters, many of them unemployed, attacked
shops, and police moved in to restore order.
	   In Tegal, east of Jakarta, the streets were back to normal after
riots Monday and last week. Police said most shops were closed and
authorities were on alert.
	   Stores were also shut in Tuban, farther east from Tegal, after
protesters turned violent a day earlier, hurling rocks at shops
owned by ethnic Chinese. The relative wealth of the Chinese
minority makes them targets when social unrest spills into violence
in Indonesia.
	   Police arrested nine people in unrest Monday in Malang, 700
kilometers (440 miles) east of Jakarta, the newspaper Jawa Pos
reported.
	   In the riot, people looted 10 shops before setting some of them
on fire. Some cars were reportedly burned.

Tensions among Israeli leaders over talks with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu saying permanent settlement might not
be reached &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted
Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a decision on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, despite pressure from the United States.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with his defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, for pushing him to reach a decision soon.
	   ``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told
Israel Army Radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   Netanyahu suggested that a deal on a withdrawal, once reached,
might be the last agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians
for a long time, although a final Israel-Palestinian peace
settlement is supposed to be negotiated by next May.
	   ``We don't know if a permanent settlement will be achieved,''
Netanyhau said on Israel's Army Radio. ``Perhaps it will, and we
are striving for it.
	   But Netanyahu said that if the Palestinians insist on the right
of return for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 refugees,
and on the division of Jerusalem, ``There will be no agreement.''
	   ``Therefore it is possible that we will have to live for some
time, perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that
agreement.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal would be
the second of three to which Israel has committed itself.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Informal U.S. deadlines for an
Israeli decision have passed without the Clinton administration
taking any action against Israel.
	   Mordechai, who is considered one of the moderates in the
Netanyahu government, told a closed forum on Monday that ``We have
no choice but to carry out the second redeployment and the time has
come to take the decision,'' according to Israel Radio.
	   ``It is possible to wait another few days, maybe a week, with
this decision, but it is wrong to wait until the end of the summer
session of parliament,'' the Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted
Mordechai as saying.
	   ``Time is running out. Palestinian frustration can endanger
Israel's security,'' Yediot quoted Mordechai as saying.
	   Mordechai is a member of the inner circle of Cabinet ministers
supervising the contacts with the United States and the
Palestinians. His nemesis in the so-called kitchen Cabinet is
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon, who says Israel must not
hand the Palestinians more than 9 percent of the West Bank in a
second pullback.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday denied reports that he agreed in principle
to a 13 percent withdrawal. ``We have not yet achieved such an
agreement,'' he said.

EU leaders warns Indian, Pakistan on nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-EU Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders hinted Tuesday that
they could impose sanctions on India and Pakistan unless the two
countries back away from their nuclear rivalry.
	   ``The European Union will consider further measures should India
and Pakistan fail to make progress'' toward defusing the tension
caused by their tit-for-tat nuclear test blasts, said a draft
statement from the two-day EU summit. The draft was expected to be
adopted at summit's close Tuesday.
	   ``India and Pakistan should take early steps to reduce tension
and stability in South Asia by resuming their political dialogue
with each other and with China,'' the draft said.
	   It called on both nations to sign up to international
non-proliferation regimes and to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   Unlike the United States, Japan and Canada, most European
nations have not used economic sanctions to back their condemnation
of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests.

	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Under the headline ``Last Chance,'' the Novye Izvestiya
newspaper wrote Tuesday that Milosevic ``has cheated the Kremlin
peacemakers so many times that others in their place would long ago
have repudiated such a `Slavic brother.'''
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin told
reporters at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. ``Unilateral,
provocative steps that could push the sides to escalate the
conflict should be avoided. A stable, long-lasting settlement can
only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.
	   ``Russia itself would like to believe in the paramount
importance of the meeting in the Kremlin,'' Novye Izvestiya wrote,
``as it wants to believe that someone somewhere still really
depends on Russia.''

Gold mine in Niger caves in, killing 30 miners

<TEXT>
	   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) _ A landslide at a gold-mine in western Niger
killed at least 30 people on Monday, prompting the country's
president to suspend mining operations.
	   The cave-in occurred when heavy rains caused a wall to collapse
in a newly-built mine employing some 500 people near Toradi, 60
kilometers west of the capital of Niamey, government officials told
public radio.
	   Only one body was recovered and miners did not expect to
retrieve the other corpses.
	   President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara ordered the mine closed until
the end of the country's rainy season in August or September

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Tuesday it opposed international
military intervention in the Serb province of Kosovo and called for
talks to resolve the issue.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Yugoslavian
sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and that
the international community should refrain from interfering in a
country's internal affairs.
	   Any international action should help promote stability in the
region, Zhu said.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Indian cricket team arrived in the
Sri Lankan capital Tuesday amid tight security to take part in the
3-nation Independence Cup that features the hosts and New Zealand.
	   ``We are surely going to give a good fight,'' Azharuddin told
reporters after the team arrived from the southern Indian city of
Madras, where it had been camping for the past week.
	   Police threw a security net around the team at the airport and
in the hotel in downtown Colombo. Sri Lanka is fighting an often
violent separatist war by militants among the island nation's
minority Tamils. The main Tamil separatist group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, accuses India of not supporting its war of
independence. India is home to 56 million Tamils who share
linguistic, cultural and family ties with the Tamils of Sri Lanka.
The LTTE was found guilty of killing former Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
	   The Indians will begin their campaign with a day-and-night match
against Sri Lanka on Friday in Colombo. The finals will take place
on July 7.

New chief operating office for Italy's Telecom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italia SpA, the world's fifth
largest phone company, on Tuesday named Massimo Sarmi to replace
the chief operating officer who resigned last week in a power
struggle with the chairman.
	   The nomination occurred during a last-minute board meeting ahead
of a shareholders meeting.
	   Sarmi currently is in charge of DECT, Telecom's cordless city
phone project, and previously headed acquisitions.
	   Telecom Italia said in a statement that its board of directors
backed Rossignolo and the company's strategic committee, which has
been under fire for recent decisions to start or end various
projects, including the much-criticized corless project, which
failed to win popularity with consumers enamored with cellular
phones.
	   Sarmi succeeds Vito Gamberale, who stepped aside to concentrate
on Telecom's highly profitable mobile phone division.
	   Chairman Gian Mario Rossignolo had appointed Gamberale to the
chief operating post in February, but relations hit a low in May
when the Telecom chairman criticized his subordinate in a newspaper
interview.
	   Rossignolo told the board meeting that Gamberale resigned
``perhaps in an inopportune moment,'' but the company ``has the
means and men to face'' the situation.
	   Rossignolo was named chairman on Jan. 12 and one month later
forced out chief executive and longtime Telecom executive Tomaso
Tommasi di Vignano.

Major deals signed to boost high-tech corridor

<TEXT>
	   CYBERJAYA, Malaysia (AP) _ A half-dozen major deals were signed
Tuesday to help bring Malaysia's high-tech, multimedia metropolis
closer to coming on line.
	   Nestled in a jungle of palm oil plantations outside the capital,
Kuala Lumpur, the 4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) city envisages
offices of high-tech companies, homes, a hotel, shopping and
recreational centers.
	   Cyberjaya, a pet project of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, is
part of the Multimedia Super Corridor bound by a fiber-optics
network, providing high-speed computer links between Cyberjaya,
Kuala Lumpur, a new international airport and a federal capital
under construction.
	   Telekom Malaysia signed a 133.8 million ringgit (dlrs 33.5
million) deal with Cyberview, the private developer overseeing
Cyberjaya, to buy 80 hectares (200 acres) of land where it will
build the Multimedia University. The first phase of the high-tech
college is slated for completion in September.
	   Mahathir, who witnessed the signing of five agreements at the
Cyberview Lodge, is determined to keep the MSC alive despite the
regional economic slump.
	   Cyberview Chief Executive Officer Abdul Karim Abu Bakar said the
agreements reflected ``the continuing commitment in ensuring
progress of Cyberjaya, dispelling any notion that it is being
adversely affected by the current economic slowdown.''
	   The agreements included a 1 billion ringgit (dlrs 250 million)
deal between Cyberview and Telekom Malaysia, the country's largest
telecommunications company, formerly owned by by the government, to
build the telecommunications system.
	   Another agreement was between Cyberview and Permodalan Nasional
Ltd., the largest state-run investment fund, for property
management. A joint-venture agreement to build a massive cooling
system was also signed between Seseni Energy Services and the
country's largest power company, Tenaga SPL, also formerly owned by
the government.
	   There are 219 companies that have applied to work within the
MSC, said Rodhiah Ismail, a spokeswoman for the Multimedia
Development Corp. She said 142 had been approved for operations, of
which 42 percent are Malaysian-owned, 35 are foreign and the
remainder joint ventures.

World Cup: Italy seeks qualifying points against African Lions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Deja vu. Sixteen years later, it's
Italy versus Cameroon again in a first-round World Cup match.
	   And just as in 1982, the ``Azzurri'' again need to earn decisive
qualifying points against the Indomitable Lions of Africa to
advance to the second round. The teams drew 1-1 in that first World
Cup meeting.
	   Fielding some of the most expensive stars from the world's
strongest league, Italy starts as the favored team in the Group B
night game at Mosson stadium.
	   However, the Italians struggled against Chile in their opener
and the growing strength of African soccer has made everybody
cautious about the outcome.
	   Spain's 3-2 upset loss to Nigeria in Group D was seen by some
soccer analysts as the first of a streak of stunning results by
African teams at France 98.
	   Cameroon is an ``extremely dangerous opponent, athletically very
strong and including talented players with an experience in
European Leagues,'' Italy coach Cesare Maldini said.
	   Italy will play for victory to pocket three points, which may be
indispensable for moving into the second round. Italy's final
opponent of the first round is Austria.
	   All four Group B teams are tied with one point apiece following
their first-match draws _ Italy-Chile 2-2 and Austria-Cameroon 1-1.
	   Cameroon, its internal squabbles and tactical problems
apparently solved by new French coach Claude Le Roy, is looking
forward to a repeat of its 1990 World Cup success in Italy when it
became the first African nation to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Cameroon's star forward Samuel Ipoua said he and his teammates
had overcome disappointment for allowing Austria's last-minute
equalizer and were looking forward to an outstanding performance
against the Italians.
	   ``I believe Italian players are a bit stressed following a tough
Serie A season. We are physically superior and can play good
soccer. We only lack some international experience,'' said the
25-year-old striker, who has played in Italy with Torino.
	   Fueling fresh controversy about the penalty which allowed
Italy's late equalizer against Chile, Le Roy said that ``referees
traditionally side with powerful teams such as Italy and we must
beware of the referee Wednesday.''
	   Maldini has been tormented for days about whether to start a
more offensive team against Cameroon, utilizing both Roberto Baggio
and Alessandro Del Piero.
	   The Baggio-Del Piero saga, with Italian premier Romano Prodi
joining the nationwide call for the use of both strikers against
Cameroon, was unresolved on the eve of the match.
	   Maldini suggested he might pair Baggio with striker Christian
Vieri, and leave Del Piero in reserve to enter during the match to
reinforce the attack. However last-minute, second thoughts were not
ruled out _ including the Baggio-Del Piero combination at the
kickoff.
	   Baggio, 31, brought to France as a substitute of Del Piero,
scored Italy's equalizer against Chile in the absence of his
younger teammate who was recovering from a thigh strain. Del Piero
is now ready to play his first game in nearly one month.
	   In Spain, in the 1982 World Cup, Italy barely qualified for the
second round on a better goals average following its 1-1 draw with
Cameroon.
	   In an impressive crescendo, Italy then upset Argentina and
Brazil on its way to a 3-1 victory against West Germany in the
final.
	   Maldini, an assistant to Enzo Bearzot in Spain, said he wasn't
thinking about the 1982 triumph, which earned Italy its third World
Cup.
	   ``I'm thinking of the present, and we have won nothing so far,''
Maldini said.

EU wants to be more people-friendly, but stuck in reform drive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of 2nd day of summit, draft statement
comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders plan to end their
two-day summit Tuesday with a pledge to ``bring the EU closer to
the people'' and a concession that a key part of their reform drive
_ overhauling the union's finances _ is stalled.
	   Leaders of the 15 nations want to make the EU more relevant to
Europeans, who will soon have a single currency but are said to
feel detached from the people who run the body.
	   The idea is especially close to the hearts of French President
Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl _ .new converts to
the notion, well-established in Britain, that the EU bureaucracy is
a faceless force that issues edicts but has little contact with the
370 million Europeans it oversees.
	   But financial reform is even closer to Kohl's heart and, on that
score, the summit ends on a negative note.
	   In a draft declaration, to be issued later Tuesday, the leaders
said the 15 EU governments disagree on how to put the union on a
new financial keel despite almost a year of negotiations on the
issue. Without naming countries, it said some want to correct
``budgetary imbalances but (others) have opposed that.''
	   The statement refers above all to Germany, which pays more into
the EU than it gets back.
	   Kohl, heading into Sept. 27 general elections, wants that ``net
payment'' of 10.9 billion European currency units (dlrs 11.9
billion) reduced by a third. And other ``net'' payers _ the
Netherlands, Austria and Sweden _ also want to pay less by changing
the complicated way membership fees are calculated.
	   ``We have reached the upper limit,'' Kohl said in a German radio
interview Monday. ``We will not spend more. We are not talking
about our popularity here (but) our money.''
	   The money squabble is part of a larger debate on how to revamp
the EU finances and institutions before the union takes in Cyprus
and 10 East European newcomers in the years ahead.
	   That requires reallocating funds, with northern EU nations keen
on austerity and southern members fearing that special development
aid will be diverted from them to poorer newcomers from East
Europe.
	   To make the EU more meaningful to the European-in-the-street,
the leaders said they will meet again at a special summit in
October in Vienna, after Austria has taken over the EU presidency
from Britain. Officials said the aim here is to discuss how the
union can become more people-friendly, and also not take the place
of national, regional and local governments.
	   ``There is a need to bring the EU closer to the people and to
focus it on the issues that matter most to the European citizens,''
the draft statement said.
	   Kohl and Chirac have complained that the EU's executive
commission issues too many directives. Some, they say, are better
left to other organizations, such as a recent edict on animal
welfare conditions in zoos.
	   The leaders were expected to conclude their meeting Tuesday by
committing to low deficits and job creation. The job programs
include tax breaks for employers, state-subsidized training
programs and changing welfare regulations to make taking low-paid
jobs more attractive than welfare.
	   Their summit was ending with a farewell lunch for South African
President Nelson Mandela, who is leaving office next year.

British press attack soccer hooligans in Marseille violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Marseille deputy mayor, new material
from papers &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Celebration of England's victorious start to the
World Cup was overshadowed on Britain's front pages Tuesday by
headlines accusing soccer hooligans of ruining a perfect day and
bringing shame to their country.
	   England should be kicked out of the World Cup because of its
violent fans, said Renaud Muselier, the deputy mayor of Marseille
which was the site of Monday's England-Tunisia match and the scene
of sporadic fighting for three days.
	   ``The supporters behaved in the streets like louts. Today true
football lovers wish they had been beaten on the pitch,'' he said.
``The image and the dignity of this Cup, symbol of a fraternal
competition, demands that the English team be disqualified or
excluded.''
	   Muselier, who is also a member of the French parliament, said
the city will demand compensation from the British government for
damage by the fans.
	   The Independent, one of Britain's most respected papers, also
urged the England team to pack its bags and catch the first flight
home to stop the thugs and return the World Cup to being ``a
festival of football.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned the
violence, which began on Saturday night and gradually escalated to
rioting before and during Monday's game which England won 2-0.
	   More than 50 people were injured, including an Englishman whose
neck artery was cut by a bottle. Police detained nearly 80
Englishman, Tunisians and Frenchmen, and two of the Englishmen were
sentenced to three months in prison.
	   The commander of Britain's police operations at the World Cup,
Tim Hollis, was quoted in several papers as saying authorities
expect more trouble as the tournament progresses.
	   He told the Guardian that known hooligans are either already in
France or on their way to orchestrate more violence, but noted that
``significant numbers'' of those arrested were unknown to British
police.
	   While the police have made ``great strides'' in cracking down on
organized groups of hooligans, The Independent noted that
individual thugs are more difficult ``to contain and predict.''
	   ``The sad truth is that we have tried almost everything to stop
hooliganism and have failed,'' the paper said. ``Although other
countries have their hooligan element, we kid ourselves if we deny
that ours is far, far worse.''
	   Many papers said the fan violence could doom England's hopes of
hosting the World Cup in 2006. But the Independent argued that if
England stages the tournament ``we will only destroy our own
cities.''
	   Several tabloids wrote about the ``savage who started it'' _ the
Englishman believed to have thrown the first bottle in Monday's
Marseille riot _ branding him a ``pot-bellied bully'' and ``the pig
of Marseille.''
	   The Sun, which devoted at least 8 pages to the troubles, also
published a double page spread of photos of unnamed hooligans in
action in Marseilles, appealing to readers to name and shame them
by calling a hotline.
	   ``We hang our heads in shame at the disgusting behavior of the
moronic hordes,'' it said in an editorial.
	   Several newspapers tackled the question of who today's soccer
hooligan is. Is he simply a ``psychopath from the slums'' or is
there a new breed of white-collar suburbanite thug next door?
	   ``What turns a father of three, a serving soldier and an
antiques dealer into thugs who shame our nation?'' asked The
Express in a front-page headline, referring to three Englishmen who
were arrested.
	   Pundits pondered whether it is the drink, a perverted patriotism
or Neo-Nazism and extreme right-wing politics.
	   A columnist for The Telegraph argued it is a ``dumbed down''
culture where soccer oafishness is praised, while an Express writer
opted for the explanation that the hooligans were abused by their
parents when they were children.

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ France cracked down with jail sentences
and expulsions Tuesday against World Cup soccer fans from England
who clashed with police and young Tunisian delinquents from rough
northern suburbs.
	   The official backlash came after running battles with police
left the city's Old Port an eerie no-man's land, with smashed

Yeltsin: Milosevic agrees to negotiate over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; UPDATES with more Yeltsin comments. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
Tuesday to negotiate peace with Kosovo separatists, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin told a Russian news agency.
	   ``The first round of negotiations has been conducted and we have
agreed in principle,'' Yeltsin said, according to Interfax.
``Milosevic agreed to sit down at the negotiating table with Kosovo
Albanians.''
	   The two leaders met Tuesday morning at the Kremlin.
	   ``It's necessary that the whole world see what we agreed to, so
that there should be no steps back,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying.
	   He told Interfax that the negotiations were ``not simple,'' and
that both delegations were working up agreements resulting from his
talks with Milosevic.
	   After their one-on-one meeting, Yeltsin and Milosevic were
joined by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the director of
the foreign intelligence service.
	   ``President Boris Yeltsin once again spoke against any options
involving force and in favor of the search of exclusively peaceful
ways of settling the crisis,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Under the headline ``Last Chance,'' the Novye Izvestiya
newspaper wrote Tuesday that Milosevic ``has cheated the Kremlin
peacemakers so many times that others in their place would long ago
have repudiated such a `Slavic brother.'''
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin told
reporters at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. ``Unilateral,
provocative steps that could push the sides to escalate the
conflict should be avoided. A stable, long-lasting settlement can
only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.
	   ``Russia itself would like to believe in the paramount
importance of the meeting in the Kremlin,'' Novye Izvestiya wrote
before the meeting with Milosevic, ``as it wants to believe that
someone somewhere still really depends on Russia.''

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ France cracked down with jail sentences
and expulsions Tuesday against World Cup soccer fans from England
who clashed with police and young Tunisian delinquents from rough
northern suburbs.

Israel refuses to extradite suspected German terrorist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 11-15 with more on charges against Smyrek,
ADDS hometown in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel has rejected Germany's request to
extradite a German citizen arrested on suspicion of plotting a
suicide bombing in Israel, an Israeli official said Tuesday.
	   Stephan Smyrek, 26, was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at
Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport. He is accused of plotting with the
Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah to carry out the
bombing in Israel.
	   Israeli authorities say Smyrek, who is from Braunschweig,
Germany, confessed to his role in the plot, which was never carried
out.
	   A representative of the Israeli State Attorney's office, Devora
Chen, told the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday that Israeli
authorities ``have decided not to extradite the accused.''
	   She said Israel wants to try him here, and that according to the
European convention on extradition, there is no obligation to
extradite an accused person who has already been indicted in the
country where he was arrested, Israel radio said.
	   Defense counsel Dan Assan accused Israel of holding Smyrek as a
bargaining chip for a future prisoner exchange with Hezbollah.
	   ``The question arises whether the young German citizen Stephan
Smyrek ... will languish in a high-security prison as a bargaining
card for the rest of his life,'' Assan told the court.
	   Assan supported the German extradition request, arguing that his
client cannot get a fair trial in Israel and had been mistreated in
prison.
	   Smyrek appeared healthy and in good spirits Tuesday as he
appeared in court wearing a sweatshirt and blue jeans. He listened
attentively as the proceedings were translated from Hebrew into
German.
	   On a previous court appearance he looked unwell and coughed
constantly. He was said to be suffering from asthma and bronchitis.
German prosecutors have said they are seeking to try Smyrek because
they feel they have a stronger case than the Israelis, because
Smyrek planned the attack in Germany, and not because of Assan's
claims.
	   According to prosecutors, Smyrek converted to Islam in 1994 and
two years later got in touch with two men who put him in contact
with the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon.
	   Last August, Smyrek allegedly traveled to Lebanon to train in
the use of light arms, explosives and other weapons. Three months
later, Smyrek came to Israel via Amsterdam, equipped with a video
camera, a map of Israel and dlrs 4,000 from Hezbollah, according to
the charge sheet against him.
	   No details have been made public about the bombing Smyrek was
allegedly plotting.
	   He is charged with conspiring to carry out an attack in Israel,
harming state security and belonging to a terror organization.
	   The charges carry a maximum penalty of two life sentences plus
five years.
	   Assan was to have presented his case against the indictment, but
was granted a two-week postponement to give him time to seek a plea
bargain. The next court session was set for June 30.

Militants' spokesman sets conditions in first interview
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For the first time, Kosovo's
militant Albanian separatists have stated their conditions for a
dialogue with the Serbian authorities, saying a ceasefire depends
on withdrawal of all security forces and foreign mediation.
	   Appearing in full uniform emblazoned with the insignia of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, newly appointed KLA spokesman Jakup
Krasniqi told Albanian television that dialogue would need thorough
preparation.
	   His interview was broadcast late Monday night, and received by
satellite in Kosovo itself, where the ethnic Albanian daily Bujku
printed it in full Tuesday.
	   The KLA last Friday designated Krasniqi, a 47-year-old school
teacher from the militant Drenica region of Kosovo, as its speaker.
	   The shadowy Liberation Army, which first emerged in 1996, has
grown massively in support and apparently in fire- and manpower
since March, when Serbian police launched a crackdown on militants
in the Drenica region.
	   More than 300 people have since been killed in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1, and seek independence for
the province _ dear to Serbs as the birthplace of their culture and
Orthodox Church.
	   On Tuesday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped
Kosovo of its broad autonomy in 1989 and has ruled it repressively
since, reportedly agreed in talks with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to negotiate with the Kosovo Albanians.
	   It was not clear if that would include talking with the KLA, or
people closer to Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian political
leader who has always advocated a peaceful path to independence,
but who is losing support among his people to the militants.
	   Krasniqi stated what he said were three conditions for dialogue
with the Serbian authorities: urgent withdrawal of ``all enemy
forces from Kosovo territory'' before dialogue could begin;
mediation of ``one influential international factor, and ``thorough
preparations.''
	   Krasniqi did not specify who would represent the ethnic Albanian
side _ someone from the militants or a political figure _ but he
said that ``political pluralism among Albanians in Kosovo is now a
luxury.''
	   ``We need one political and military power fighting for freedom
and unification (with Albania) _ the KLA is fully prepared to fight
until final victory,'' Krasniqi said in an apparent attempt to ease
Rugova out of the process.
	   Krasniqi, a native of village of Negrovce in the Drenica region
just northwest of provincial capital Pristina, appeared in military
uniform emblazoned with the red-and-black insignia of the UCK, the
Albanian language acronym for the KLA.
	   He called on all his ``countrymen, all freedom fighters and
military experts to heed the calling of the homeland.''
	   ``In a short time period, we have created a huge free territory
in Koovo and we shall not stop,'' Krasniqi said, adding the KLA was
``a natural product of a situation in which the oppressed Albanian
people found themselves in'' in Kosovo.
	   It claims to control 40 percent of the rugged province.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted
Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a decision on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, despite pressure to accept a U.S. proposal.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with his defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, for pushing him to reach a decision soon.
	   ``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told
Israel Army Radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   Netanyahu suggested that a deal on a withdrawal, once reached,
might be the last agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians
for a long time, although a final Israel-Palestinian peace
settlement is supposed to be negotiated by next May.
	   ``We don't know if a permanent settlement will be achieved,''
Netanyhau said on Israel's Army Radio. ``Perhaps it will, and we
are striving for it.
	   But Netanyahu said that if the Palestinians insist on the right
of return for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars and
on the division of Jerusalem, ``There will be no agreement.''

UNHCR evacuates offices in eastern Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it has had to
move staff from two of its offices in Eastern Angola amid
``resurgent insecurity.''
	   Three of the agency's workers and other aid staff in the town of
Luau on Sunday crossed into Dilolo, in Congo, UNHCR spokesman Kris
Janowski said. Staff in another district, Cazombo, relocated on
Monday to Zambia.
	   Fighting at a town near Luau and tension in the surrounding area
has prompted a group of Rwandans who were being screened by UNHCR
to leave Luau, Janowski said.
	   Angola's former rebel movement earlier this month expressed
dismay at a United Nations report accusing it of keeping a hidden
army and warned that the claim could plunge the country back into
civil war.
	   The United States has said it is concerned about reports of
attacks by government police against UNITA supporters and called
for them to cease.
	   The U.N. Security Council has given UNITA until June 23 to
fulfill conditions of a peace plan and avoid sweeping sanctions
that would cut into the group's lucrative diamond trade.
	   Sanctions will take effect June 25 if UNITA fails to demobilize
its remaining forces, hand over its central highland strongholds,
allow U.N. monitors to verify compliance and cease attacks on U.N.
and government personnel by June 23.
	   The sanctions are designed to save the peace process in the West
African nation torn by civil war after independence from Portugal
in 1975.
	   A 1991 peace pact collapsed when UNITA rejected its defeat in
the following year's elections and returned to the bush.

Marseille deputy mayor calls for England to be kicked out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: version moved on news circuit as Britain-Soccer Hooligans &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England should be kicked out of the World Cup, the
deputy mayor of Marseille said Tuesday following three days of
violence in the French port city by English hooligans.
	   ``The supporters behaved in the streets like louts,'' Renaud
Muselier said in an interview with BBC Radio 4. ``Today true
football lovers wish they had been beaten on the pitch. The image
and the dignity of this Cup, symbol of a fraternal competition,
demands that the English team be disqualified or excluded.''
	   Muselier, who is also a member of the French parliament, said
the city will demanded compensation from the British government for
damage by the fans. On Monday, British Home Secretary Jack Straw
apologized to France and said the government would consider paying
damages to the French.
	   The Independent, one of Britain's most respected papers, also
urged the England team to pack its bags and catch the first flight
home to stop the thugs and return the World Cup to being ``a
festival of football.''
	   Celebration of England's victorious start to the World Cup was
overshadowed on Britain's front pages Tuesday by headlines accusing
soccer hooligans of ruining a perfect day and bringing shame to
their country.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned the
violence, which began on Saturday night and gradually escalated to
rioting before and during Monday's game which England won 2-0.
	   More than 50 people were injured, including an Englishman whose
neck artery was cut by a bottle. Police detained nearly 80
Englishman, Tunisians and Frenchmen, and two of the Englishmen were
sentenced to three months in prison.
	   The commander of Britain's police operations at the World Cup,
Tim Hollis, was quoted in several papers as saying authorities
expect more trouble as the tournament progresses.
	   He told the Guardian that known hooligans are either already in
France or on their way to orchestrate more violence, but noted that
``significant numbers'' of those arrested were unknown to British
police.
	   While the police have made ``great strides'' in cracking down on
organized groups of hooligans, The Independent noted that
individual thugs are more difficult ``to contain and predict.''
	   ``The sad truth is that we have tried almost everything to stop
hooliganism and have failed,'' the paper said. ``Although other
countries have their hooligan element, we kid ourselves if we deny
that ours is far, far worse.''
	   Many papers said the fan violence could doom England's hopes of
hosting the World Cup in 2006. But the Independent argued that if
England stages the tournament ``we will only destroy our own
cities.''
	   Several tabloids wrote about the ``savage who started it'' _ the
Englishman believed to have thrown the first bottle in Monday's
Marseille riot _ branding him a ``pot-bellied bully'' and ``the pig
of Marseille.''
	   The Sun, which devoted at least 8 pages to the troubles, also
published a double page spread of photos of unnamed hooligans in
action in Marseilles, appealing to readers to name and shame them
by calling a hotline.
	   ``We hang our heads in shame at the disgusting behavior of the
moronic hordes,'' it said in an editorial.
	   Several newspapers tackled the question of who today's soccer
hooligan is. Is he simply a ``psychopath from the slums'' or is
there a new breed of white-collar suburbanite thug next door?
	   ``What turns a father of three, a serving soldier and an
antiques dealer into thugs who shame our nation?'' asked The
Express in a front-page headline, referring to three Englishmen who
were arrested.
	   Pundits pondered whether it is the drink, a perverted patriotism
or Neo-Nazism and extreme right-wing politics.
	   A columnist for The Telegraph argued it is a ``dumbed down''
culture where soccer oafishness is praised, while an Express writer
opted for the explanation that the hooligans were abused by their
parents when they were children.

Cohen expects diplomacy to succeed in solving Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Tuesday he expected the crisis in Kosovo could be solved by
peaceful means, but warned that the West could be forced to
consider other options.
	   Cohen, who was in Warsaw for two days of talks with Polish
leaders, said the demonstration of NATO's power in an air exercise
over Albania and Macedonia on Monday provided a ``pause'' to allow
``diplomacy to work its will.''
	   ``We are hoping that diplomacy will be successful and that we
don't need any further air demonstrations or any further
consideration of military options,'' Cohen told reporters.
	   He said much will depend now on the reaction of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and his talks with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin. Milosevic was meeting Yeltsin in Moscow Tuesday.
	   However, Cohen warned that U.S. forces, including three
amphibious assault carriers in the Adriatic Sea, ``will remain in
the region and will be prepared to follow through if any military
action should ever be called for and agreed to.''
	   But he said it will be a long way ``before we consider any
further type of action in this regard.''
	   Cohen stressed that such a decision would require `` a good deal
more deliberations'' within NATO, which still remains undecided
about the legal foundation for a military option, and it will have
to be approved by the members of the alliance.
	   ``Nonetheless there is a sense of urgency and I believe that the
political pressures will continue to be brought to bear to bring
about a peaceful solution,'' to stop the atrocities in Kosovo,
Cohen added.
	   More than 300 people have died in recent months and dozens
missing since Milosevic stepped up his offensive against ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Cohen began his Polish visit Monday after talks in Denmark and
Brussels, where the Western military alliance decided on the air
exercises.
	   During his talks with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and Defense
Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz on Monday, Cohen praised Poland's work
on reforming its military structures and budget, in its drive to
become a full member of NATO next year.
	   Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic is to join
NATO next year.
	   During a meeting Tuesday with President Aleksander Kwasniewski,
the Polish leader expressed approval for the NATO decisions and
support for the search of political solutions to the Kosovo crisis.

Israel refuses to extradite suspected German terrorist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more on charges against Smyrek, ADDS hometown. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel has rejected Germany's request to
extradite a German citizen arrested on suspicion of plotting a
suicide bombing in Israel, an Israeli official said Tuesday.
	   Stephan Smyrek, 26, was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at
Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport. He is accused of plotting with the
Iranian-backed Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah to carry out the
bombing in Israel.
	   Israeli authorities say Smyrek, who is from Braunschweig,
Germany, confessed to his role in the abortive plot.
	   A representative of the Israeli State Attorney's office, Devora
Chen, told the Tel Aviv District Court on Tuesday that Israeli
authorities ``have decided not to extradite the accused.''
	   She said Israel wants to try him here, and that according to the
European convention on extradition, there is no obligation to
extradite an accused person who has already been indicted in the
country where he was arrested, Israel radio said.
	   According to prosecutors, Smyrek converted to Islam in 1994 and
two years later got in touch with two men who put him in contact
with the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon.
	   Last August, Smyrek allegedly traveled to Lebanon to train in
the use of light arms, explosives and other weapons. Three months
later, Smyrek came to Israel via Amsterdam, equipped with a video
camera, a map of Israel and dlrs 4,000 from Hezbollah, according to
the charge sheet against him.
	   No details have been made public about the bombing Smyrek was
allegedly plotting.
	   He is charged with conspiring to carry out an attack in Israel,
harming state security and belonging to a terror organization.
	   The charges carry a maximum penalty of two life sentences plus
five years.
	   Defense counsel Dan Assan accused Israel of holding Smyrek as a
bargaining chip for a future prisoner exchange with Hezbollah.
	   ``The question arises whether the young German citizen Stephan
Smyrek ... will languish in a high-security prison as a bargaining
card for the rest of his life,'' Assan told the court.
	   Assan supported the German extradition request, arguing that his
client cannot get a fair trial in Israel and had been mistreated in
prison.
	   Smyrek appeared healthy and in good spirits Tuesday as he
appeared in court wearing a sweatshirt and blue jeans. He listened
attentively as the proceedings were translated from Hebrew into
German.
	   On a previous court appearance he looked unwell and coughed
constantly. He was said to be suffering from asthma and bronchitis.
German prosecutors have said they are seeking to try Smyrek because
they feel they have a stronger case than the Israelis, because
Smyrek planned the attack in Germany, and not because of Assan's
claims.
	   Assan was to have presented his case against the indictment, but
was granted a two-week postponement to give him time to seek a plea
bargain. The next court session was set for June 30.

Fashion house Prada increases state in Gucci
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian fashion house Prada said Tuesday
that it has increased its stake in luxury leathergoods producer
Gucci Group NV to 9.5 percent in what appeared to be a possible
takeover strategy.
	   Prada now is Gucci's largest shareholder.
	   In interviews following Prada's acquisition earlier this month
of a 5 percent stake, chief executive officer Patrizio Bertelli was
been unclear about what the group's intentions are for Gucci.
	   But the latest move was likely to feed speculation that Prada is
interested in taking over the group, which is quoted on the New
York and Amsterdam stock exchanges.
	   Last week, Gucci bought back 1.1 percent of its equity in a
defense aimed at thwarting a hostile takeover.
	   A few days ago, Gucci reported that its net income in the first
quarter of 1998 fell to dlrs 43.1 million from dlrs 48 million in
the same period last year.
	   It said revenues fell to dlrs 250.7 million from dlrs 254.3
million.
	   In an recent interview, Gucci chief executive officer Domenico
De Sole suggested that Prada doesn't have the money for a takeover.

Tensions among Israeli leaders over talks with Palestinians

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu saying permanent settlement might not
be reached &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted
Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a decision on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, despite pressure to accept a U.S. proposal.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with his defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, for pushing him to reach a decision soon.
	   ``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told
Israel Army Radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal would be
the second of three to which Israel has committed itself.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Informal U.S. deadlines for an
Israeli decision have passed without the Clinton administration
taking any action against Israel.
	   Netanyahu suggested that a deal on a withdrawal, once reached,
might be the last agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians
for a long time, although a final Israel-Palestinian peace
settlement is supposed to be negotiated by next May.
	   ``We don't know if a permanent settlement will be achieved,''
Netanyhau said on Israel's Army Radio. ``Perhaps it will, and we
are striving for it.''
	   But Netanyahu said that if the Palestinians insist on the right
of return for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars, and
on the division of Jerusalem, ``There will be no agreement.''
	   ``Therefore it is possible that we will have to live for some
time, perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that
agreement.''
	   Mordechai, who is considered one of the moderates in the
Netanyahu government, told a closed forum on Monday that ``We have
no choice but to carry out the second redeployment and the time has
come to take the decision,'' according to Israel Radio.
	   ``It is possible to wait another few days, maybe a week, with
this decision, but it is wrong to wait until the end of the summer
session of parliament,'' the Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted
Mordechai as saying.
	   ``Time is running out. Palestinian frustration can endanger
Israel's security,'' Yediot quoted Mordechai as saying.
	   Mordechai is a member of the inner circle of Cabinet ministers
supervising the contacts with the United States and the
Palestinians. His nemesis in the so-called kitchen Cabinet is
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon, who says Israel must not
hand the Palestinians more than 9 percent of the West Bank in a
second pullback.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday denied reports that he agreed in principle
to a 13 percent withdrawal. ``We have not yet achieved such an
agreement,'' he said.

Philippine Airlines to seek suspension of debt payments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with airline officials saying PAL will
suspend debt payments to prevent closure; airline employees stage
noisy picket to protest layoffs &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines officials said
Tuesday they will seek a suspension of debt payments because of
crippling financial difficulties worsened by a pilots' strike.
	   A PAL official said the airline will soon file a request with
Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend payments on
a total of dlrs 2 billion dollars in loans owed to 1,000 banks and
aircraft lessors.
	   ``We're one step away from bankruptcy,'' said the senior airline
official, who asked not to be named.
	   The airline announced Monday it will lay off 5,000 workers _
nearly 40 percent of its 13,000-member work force _ in an effort to
survive.
	   The 12-day strike by more than 600 pilots has cost the company
more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in lost revenue, PAL
said.
	   The airline was already in serious financial shape before the
strike because of an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program
launched shortly before Asia's currency crisis, which reduced
passenger numbers and inflated operating and loan repayment costs.
	   About 20 aircraft have been delivered under the program, which
involved buying 36 new jets from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie.
	   A PAL official said Tuesday it now has decided to dispose of all
but 14 of its 54 planes and suspend all new plane orders.
	   The airline met Monday with banks that together have a loan
exposure of about dlrs 1.5 billion to PAL and warned them of
possible delays in repayments, Senior Vice President Avelino
Zapanta said.
	   ``We are asking them not to panic,'' he said.
	   Zapanta said the 14 remaining planes would be appropriate for
about 50 pilots. The airline now has only 25 senior management
pilots after firing the 600 striking pilots for ignoring a
government return-to-work order.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada said Tuesday he plans to sell the
government's stake in the airline.
	   ``I plan to totally privatize it,'' Estrada said in a television
interview.
	   Estrada, who takes office June 30, said one reason for selling
the airline is that government representatives on PAL's board have
abused perks from the airline, including fat allowances and free
plane rides for them and their families.
	   He said the government's stake is now about 28 percent.
	   The Philippine government fully owned PAL, Asia's first airline,
until 1992.
	   In announcing the layoffs Monday, PAL said the pilots' strike
``irreparably damaged the company's cash flow'' and scared off
potential investors, including Northwest Airlines.
	   The strike ``has effectively robbed PAL of all options other
than to immediately downsize in order to forestall further losses
and certain closure,'' it said.
	   The striking pilots, joined by members of two other PAL unions,
staged a noisy one-hour picket Tuesday in front of PAL's offices to
protest the layoffs.
	   The pilots' union went on strike June 5 to protest a new
management policy of ordering the retirement of certain pilots who
have reached 20 years of service or flown 20,000 hours, regardless
of age.
	   The policy put 225 pilots in danger of forced retirement, the
union says.
	   The company says it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 202 million) in
the fiscal year that ended March 31 _ three times more than in the
previous year.

Human rights commission to investigate case of Russian captain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The treatment of a Russian sea captain who was
convicted of smuggling drugs to Norway will be taken up by the
European Human Rights Commission, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Captain Valery Petrenko claims he was illegally jailed for 11
months by a court in Bergen, Norway, before it found him guilty of
smuggling more than 40,000 narcotic pills from Lithuania.
	   Petrenko was given an 18-month sentence in February but the
court released him immediately because he had already served
two-thirds of it.
	   The European Human Rights Commission, located in Strasbourg,
France, wrote that it would make ``every effort to consider the
case as soon as possible,'' the Interfax news agency said, citing
Petrenko's lawyer Igor Zenkin.
	   Petrenko pleaded not guilty in the case and claimed that the
real purpose of his arrest was an attempt by the Norwegian secret
services to learn military secrets from him _ a charge strongly
denied by Norwegian officials.
	   If the human rights commission agrees with Petrenko, the
Norwegian court's decision would have no legal force, Zenkin told
Interfax.

Philippine stocks, peso fall further on regional currency concerns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell for the sixth
straight session Tuesday, weighed down by worries over weaker
regional currencies led by the Japanese yen, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 20.31 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 1,726.55 after plunging 82.16 points, or 4.5
percent, on Monday.
	   Noel Reyes, research head at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc.,
said the weak yen is likely to pull the Philippine and regional
stock markets lower for at least a few weeks.
	   ``We won't see an end to this sell-down until the yen's fall
comes to a halt,'' he said.
	   Traders worry that the weak yen may trigger a further economic
contraction in the region and force China to devalue its currency.
	   In currency trading, the peso, tracking the yen's afternoon
rebound against the dollar, pulled up from its lows for the day but
still closed weaker against the U.S. currency.
	   The dollar averaged 41.772 pesos, up 20.6 centavos from Monday's
41.566 pesos. It hit a high of 42.260 pesos in early trading and
last changed hands at 41.900 pesos.
	   A dealer said the peso market closely tracked the dollar-yen
rate, with traders either long or short on the dollar depending on
the yen's position.
	   Overnight developments in the yen will dictate the peso's
direction when trading resumes Wednesday, he said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Philippine Central Bank pledged not to
interfere with the peso-dollar rate, but to allow the market to
determine its direction.
	   Selling dollars will be the central bank's ``last recourse'' in
helping keep the peso stable against the dollar, Central Bank
Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said.

Australian union wants end to player drain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Rugby Union hopes to
institute a national club competition next year in an effort to
reduce player losses to wealthy foreign clubs.
	   The ARU fears its clubs may be faced with similar threats to
those currently rocking New Zealand as foreign scouts raid the
National Provincial Competition (NPC).
	   New Zealand center Tabai Matson is about to sign with a French
club, prop Kevin Nepia has had four offers from Europe and flanker
Angus Gardiner is considering an offer from English side
Harlequins.
	   Fringe All Black halfback Aaron Flynn is investigating prospects
in Japan or South Africa after his New Zealand Rugby Football Union
contract expires.
	   ARU chief executive John O'Neill said Tuesday the New Zealand
situation was a grave concern for Australia, particularly with
players not under contract and on the fringes of the Super 12 elite
competition.
	   O'Neill said a national club competition was the obvious way to
help prevent players from being lured to the big money in the
northern hemisphere.
	   But he said the problem must be addressed now, not next year.
	   ``If we're moving down that path we are making a big mistake by
letting the players go now . . . you mightn't get them back,''
O'Neill said.
	   ``Hopefully in the next year we will have a similar structure to
New Zealand and South Africa. It shows that we've got to get our
act together and get the equivalent of a Currie Cup or an NPC.''
	   ``We've had a good hearing and are waiting to hear from the
states. I'm still fairly optimistic we'll have something in place
by 1999.'' (djp)

World Cup: Key Croatian player injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Mario Stanic, a key player who scored
Croatia's first goal in its 3-1 opening win over Jamaica, remained
on the injured list Tuesday after taking a hit on his right shin
during Sunday's game.
	   Stanic missed Tuesday's team practice because of swelling around
the injury, but coach Miroslav Blazevic said he expects the AC
Parma midfielder to recover in time for Saturday's Group H match
against Japan.
	   Stanic also required two stitches to his lip after colliding
with a Jamaican's elbow while jumping for the ball during the game.
	   The powerful 26-year-old, a former Belgian league top scorer,
was among Croatia's best in the nation's World Cup debut. A
versatile player equally at home up front or in defense, he has
replaced injured star striker Alen Boksic in the lineup.

Voter registration for elections reaches 92 percent: panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The committee overseeing the
Cambodian elections July 26 announced Tuesday that 92 percent of
the country's 5.6 million eligible voters had registered.
	   The monthlong registration process closed Monday except for
about 10 stations in remote rural areas, which will be shut down
Thursday. Official campaigning is to begin June 25.
	   ``The number of registrations is sufficient for holding
elections,'' said Samraing Kim San, an adviser to the head of the
National Election Commission.
	   The opposition has accused Cambodian strongman Hun Sen of
stacking the commission with his supporters and of using coercion,
especially in rural areas, to ensure people vote for his party.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back international aid
and legitimacy lost when he toppled his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup last July.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy said Monday that the commission
could be inflating the registration figures by allowing pro-Hun Sen
voters to sign up several times while frightening likely opponents
into not registering.
	   Sam Rainsy said he would lead a protest in Phnom Penh on Sunday
demanding extra measures to ensure free and fair polls.

Turkish premier signs early election deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and an
opposition leader have formalized a deal they reached earlier this
month to hold early elections in April.
	   Deniz Baykal, the leader of the Republican People's Party, a
social democrat party, told his deputies Tuesday that he and Yilmaz
signed an agreement laying out the deal, which calls for Yilmaz to
resign in December.
	   A caretaker government would then lead the country to elections.
	   Baykal did not say when the agreement had been signed, but
Turkish newspapers said it was signed Monday.
	   Baykal had been pushing for early elections in return for his
party's continued support to Yilmaz's minority government,
especially on issues of tax reform and a bill aimed at curbing
radical Islam.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year in a coalition of his
center-right Motherland Party, the Democratic Left Party and the
Democratic Turkey Party after the military forced the previous,
Islamic-led government out of power.
	   Earlier this month a tentative election date of April 18 was
announced.

Militants' spokesman sets conditions for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For the first time, Kosovo's
militant Albanian separatists have stated their conditions for a
dialogue with the Serbian authorities, saying a cease-fire depends
on foreign mediation and the withdrawal of all security forces.
	   Appearing in full uniform of the Kosovo Liberation Army, newly
appointed rebel spokesman Jakup Krasniqi told Albanian television
that dialogue would need thorough preparation.
	   His interview was broadcast late Monday night, and received by
satellite in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian daily Bujku printed
it in full Tuesday.
	   The KLA last Friday designated Krasniqi, a 47-year-old school
teacher from the militant Drenica region of Kosovo, as its speaker.
	   The shadowy Liberation Army, which first emerged in 1996, has
dramatically increased in numbers and firepower since March, when
Serbian police launched a crackdown on militants in the Drenica
region.
	   More than 300 people have since been killed in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population and seek
independence for the province _ dear to Serbs as the birthplace of
their culture and Orthodox Church.
	   On Tuesday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who stripped
Kosovo of its broad autonomy in 1989 and has ruled it with an iron
hand since, reportedly agreed in talks with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to negotiate with the Kosovo Albanians.
	   It was not clear if that would include talking with the KLA, or
people closer to Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic Albanian political
leader who has always advocated a peaceful path to independence,
but who is losing support to the militants.
	   Krasniqi stated what he said were three conditions for dialogue
with the Serbian authorities: urgent withdrawal of ``all enemy
forces from Kosovo territory'' before dialogue could begin;
mediation by ``one influential international factor,'' and
``thorough preparations.''
	   Krasniqi did not specify who would represent the ethnic Albanian
side _ someone from the militants or a political figure _ but he
said that ``political pluralism among Albanians in Kosovo is now a
luxury.''
	   ``We need one political and military power fighting for freedom
and unification (with Albania) _ the KLA is fully prepared to fight
until final victory,'' Krasniqi said, apparently trying to ease
Rugova out of the process.
	   Krasniqi, a native of village of Negrovce in the Drenica region
just northwest of provincial capital Pristina, appeared in military
uniform emblazoned with the red-and-black insignia of the UCK, the
Albanian language acronym for the KLA.
	   He called on all his ``countrymen, all freedom fighters and
military experts to heed the calling of the homeland.''
	   ``In a short time period, we have created a huge free territory
in Koovo and we shall not stop,'' Krasniqi said, adding the KLA was
``a natural product of a situation in which the oppressed Albanian
people found themselves in'' in Kosovo.
	   It claims to control 40 percent of the rugged province.

Deutsche Bank probed on suspicion of helping customers evade taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Tax investigators are searching
offices of Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, for evidence that
employees helped customers evade taxes by hiding holdings in
foreign banks.
	   Some 300 investigators converged on branches in Frankfurt,
Duesseldorf, Kassel and Freiburg on Monday to begin a review of
documents that could take weeks, Frankfurt prosecutors said
Tuesday.
	   Prosecutors also have investigated other major German banks over
the past two years to crack down on similar evasion that tax
officials have estimated is worth up to 20 billion marks (dlrs 11
billion) a year.
	   Deutsche Bank employees are suspected of helping clients hide
assets in banks in Luxembourg and Switzerland to avoid a
withholding tax on interest income that began in Germany in 1992,
said Job Tilmann, a spokesman for Frankfurt prosecutors.
	   Transferring money abroad is illegal when the interest income
isn't declared.
	   Prosecutors also will pursue any customers who records show
avoided taxes, Tilmann said.
	   Deutsche Bank spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf said there had been no
institutional policy to help customers evade taxes, and that the
bank was cooperating with the investigation to the extent required
under law.
	   Rahmsdorf noted that customers, not banks, are obligated to
declare interest income.
	   Customers convicted of avoiding taxes face up to 5 years in
prison. There are no sentencing guidelines for employees convicted
of helping avoid taxes, Tilmann said, adding that their sentences
would be lighter than for customers.
	   Prosecutors already have uncovered hundreds of cases of tax
avoidance by customers of Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, Tilmann
said. Dresdner officials also have been investigated for evading
taxes themselves, prompting three top bank executives to resign
last year.

Survey: Palestinian support for peace process slips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians' support for the peace process
slipped during the past three months, while backing for the Islamic
militant group Hamas increased slightly, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
	   The poll results come amid continued deadlock over the scope of
an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank. Hamas opposes the
peace process; Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority supports it.
	   A strong majority of Palestinians still back peace efforts,
though support fell from 67 percent to 62 percent between March and
June, the survey suggested. During the same period, those
describing themselves as opposed to the Oslo peace accords rose
from 29 percent to 33 percent.
	   Support for the Islamic militant group Hamas increased from 9
percent to 12 percent, according to the survey.
	   The door-to-door poll was conducted June 3-6 by an independent
think tank in the West Bank town of Nablus, and had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points.

UNHCR evacuates offices in eastern Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it had to
move staff from two of its offices in Eastern Angola amid
``resurgent insecurity.''
	   Three of the agency's workers and other aid staff in the town of
Luau on Sunday crossed into Dilolo, Congo, said agency spokesman
Kris Janowski. Staff in another district, Cazombo, relocated Monday
to Zambia.
	   Fighting at a town near Luau and tension in the surrounding area
has prompted a group of Rwandans who were being screened by UNHCR
to leave Luau, Janowski said.
	   Angola's former rebel movement, UNITA, earlier this month
expressed dismay at a U.N. report that accused it of keeping a
hidden army and warned that the claim could plunge the country back
into civil war.
	   The United States expressed concern about reports that
government police had attacked UNITA supporters and urged them to
cease.
	   The U.N. Security Council has given UNITA until June 23 to
fulfill conditions of a peace plan and avoid sweeping sanctions
that would cut into the group's lucrative diamond trade.
	   Sanctions will take effect June 25 if UNITA fails to demobilize
its remaining forces, hand over its central highland strongholds,
let U.N. monitors verify compliance and cease attacks on U.N. and
government personnel by June 23.
	   The sanctions are designed to save the peace process in the West
African nation torn by civil war after independence from Portugal
in 1975.
	   A 1991 peace pact collapsed when UNITA rejected its defeat in
the following year's elections and returned to fighting.

unlikely to ratify the long-delayed START II nuclear arms treaty if
NATO launches a military strike against Serbian-led troops in
Kosovo, a top lawmaker said Tuesday.
	   First Deputy Speaker Vladimir Ryzhkov said that the Duma, the
lower house of parliament, will consider a resolution supporting
President Boris Yeltsin's position on Kosovo.
	   Yeltsin, who met Tuesday with Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic, has condemned Milosevic's crackdown on dissent in the
Albanian province but also firmly opposed NATO military action
there.
	   Yeltsin has long tried to persuade the Duma to ratify START II,
which would roughly halve the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the
United States. Duma leaders have been saying they would probably
vote on the treaty this fall, but Ryzhkov said that vote would
likely be scrapped if NATO launches a military strike in Kosovo.
	   NATO leaders ``should realize that, given the domestic situation
in Russia, their steps, uncoordinated with us, would complicate
relations in all spheres,'' Ryzhkov said.

Turkish court sentences Italian activist for Kurdish propaganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ A state security court Tuesday
convicted an Italian activist of making Kurdish separatist
propaganda but immediately commuted a one-year prison sentence into
a dlrs 23,000 fine, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Dino Frisullo was charged with inciting hatred based on ethnic
differences after his arrest on March 21 in this southeastern city
during pro-Kurdish celebrations.
	   Prosecutors, who had demanded a five-year-term, said Frisullo
carried a picture of a Kurdish rebel woman along with a brochure
depicting a Kurdistan map.
	   Separatist Kurdish rebels have been battling troops in Turkey's
southeast since 1984.
	   Frisullo's arrest created a diplomatic rift with Italy, which
submitted a formal protest.
	   ``I don't accept the charges and I demand my acquittal,''
Frisullo told the court through an interpreter.
	   Frisullo went on a hunger strike to protest his jailing. He was
released on April 28 and left the country but returned to Turkey on
Monday.
	   Foreigners who have been released by Turkish authorities pending
trial rarely return.

Security Council approves continued NATO, UN role in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With tension mounting in Kosovo, the
Security Council has approved a one-year extension for the
34,000-member NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the separate
U.N. civilian mission there.
	   The 15 members agreed unanimously Monday to keep two parallel
missions in Bosnia until June 21, 1999. Their current mandates
expire at the end of the month.
	   ``Regardless of all the progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
preconditions for durable and sustainable peace have not yet been
firmly put into place,'' German Ambassador Antonius Eitel told the
council.
	   ``It is our historic responsibility before the people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain fully focused on the goal of lasting
peace in that country which has suffered so much.''
	   The world's sluggish response to the outbreak of war in Bosnia
in 1992 is often cited by U.S. President Bill Clinton and other
world leaders in appealing for a robust international action to
stop violence in Kosovo.
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina had been part of Yugoslavia until the Balkan
country began to fall apart in June 1991 after Slovenia and Croatia
declared independence. Bosnia followed eight months later.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which along with Montenegro
forms what is left of the Yugoslav federation.
	   In approving the Bosnia resolution, several speakers expressed
concern about the continued problem of the return of refugees to
homes they fled before the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the Bosnian
war.
	   ``This process is slow complex and often dangerous,'' America's
deputy U.N. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said. ``But the goals of
minorities can be achieved.''
	   He said elections set for September ``provide an opportunity for
the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise their democratic
right to vote in support of Bosnia's future and to reject the
poitics of the past.''
	   Last month, NATO agreed to maintain its troops in Bosnia for
another year. Security Council approval provides a legal basis for
the operation under international law. The United Nations handed
over peacekeeping responsibilities to the alliance after the Dayton
agreement.
	   The United Nations still maintains a mission in Bosnia to
oversee the civilian components of the pact, including the return
of refugees and the building of institutions governing the Bosnian
Serb portion of the country and parts administered by the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   The U.N. mission includes about 2,000 civilian police who train
and monitor officers from the Serb, Muslim and Croat communities.

Most Asian stock markets fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell for a second day
Tuesday, spooked by an overnight plunge on Wall Street and the
continued weakness of the Japanese currency.
	   Malaysian share prices tumbled 3.6 percent because of the gloom
that seems to be settling over regional markets because of the
sliding yen.
	   The dollar was at 145.14 yen in late Tokyo trading, down 1.30
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
146.15 yen overnight. But it still was about 5 yen higher than a
week ago.
	   On Monday, finance ministers of the European Union, meeting in
Cardiff, Wales, urged Tokyo to take new measures to strengthen and
reform Japan's economy.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell
16.40 points to 435.84.
	   South Korean shares also closed sharply lower, with the main
index falling to a new 11-year low. The Korea Composite Stock Price
Index slumped 8.21 points, or 2.8 percent, to 280.00, its lowest
close since 276.61 on Jan. 12, 1987.
	   Thai share prices dropped 2.3 percent as investors dumped stocks
across the board on worries over the health of the Thai economy.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 5.95 points to 257.44.
	   Meanwhile, the Thai currency rose against the dollar. At the
close of domestic trading, it was at 43.20 baht to the dollar,
compared to 43.80 on Monday.
	   Shares in Australia and New Zealand also fell, pushed down by
the sharp falls in U.S., European and Asian stock markets, brokers
said.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at
8,627.93 Monday, down 207.01 points from 8,834.94 Friday and at a
three-month low. Prices were driven down by investor pessimism over
the outlook for Japanese recovery efforts.
	   In Sydney, the All Ordinaries Index slumped 42.6 points, or 1.7
percent, closing at 2,524.9.
	   In New Zealand, the NZSE-40 Capital Index closed down 28.50
points, or 1.4 percent, at 1,970.21 after recovering some ground
lost during midsession trading.
	   In currency trading, the Australian dollar was quoted at 58.8
U.S. cents after falling to a new 12-year low of 58.1 U.S. cents.
	   The New Zealand dollar bounced back above 49 U.S. cents after
earlier sliding to an 11 1/2-year low of 48.82 U.S. cents. It
closed local trading at 49.58 U.S. cents.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average dropped 104.79 points, or 0.71 percent, closing at
14,720.38. On Monday, the Nikkei had lost 197.16 points, or 1.31
percent.
	   The weakening Indonesian rupiah and bearishness on regional
stock markets pushed the Jakarta Stock Exchange's key index below
the important psychological level of 400 points.
	   The JSX composite Index fell 6.989 points, or 1.7 percent,
closing at 399.512.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at 15,100 rupiah compared with
its close Monday at 14,550.
	   Singapore shares closed mostly lower. The benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index lost 3.88 points, or 0.3 percent, closing
at a 9 1/2-year low of 1,048.96.
	   Philippine stocks fell for the sixth straight session. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index sank 20.31 points, or 1.2
percent, to 1,726.55.
	   Taiwan shares closed higher as a stable local currency buoyed
sentiment and encouraged bargain-hunting. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index rose 120.44 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,404.27.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally higher, but sharp
early gains were eroded by continued worries over the weakness of
the Japanese yen. The Hang Seng Index rose 63.95 points, or 0.9
percent, to 7,526.45.

Militants' spokesman sets conditions in first interview
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs reporting body of police reservist found
Tuesday morning; ADDS background on Albanians crossing over from
Rugova party to KLA, Krasniqi himself former Rugova party man;
Krasniqi calling on Washington and West to contribute to peace and
freedom in the Balkans. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For the first time, Kosovo's
militant Albanian separatists have stated their conditions for a
dialogue with the Serbian authorities, saying a ceasefire depends
on withdrawal of all security forces and foreign mediation.
	   Appearing in full uniform emblazoned with the insignia of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, newly appointed KLA spokesman Jakup
Krasniqi told Albanian television that dialogue would need thorough
preparation.
	   His interview was broadcast late Monday night, and received by
satellite in Kosovo itself, where the ethnic Albanian daily Bujku
printed it in full Tuesday.
	   The appearance seemed timed to coincide with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's trip to Moscow, where he reportedly agreed in
talks with Russia's Boris Yeltsin Tuesday to negotiate with
unspecified Kosovo Albanians.
	   The KLA last Friday designated Krasniqi, a 47-year-old school
teacher from the militant Drenica region of Kosovo, as its
spokesman.
	   The shadowy Liberation Army, which first emerged in 1996, has
grown massively in support and apparently in fire- and manpower
since March, when Serbian police launched a crackdown on militants
in the Drenica region.
	   More than 300 people have since been killed in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1, and seek independence for
the province _ dear to Serbs as the birthplace of their culture and
Orthodox Church.
	   The Serb Media Center, close to Kosovo's authorities, reported
the body of a Serbian police reservist was found early Tuesday in
his home in a village 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, that has been under militant attack.
	   It was not clear Tuesday if either the KLA or Milosevic would
agree to meet each other.
	   On American urging, Milosevic already has met Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian political leader who has always advocated a
peaceful path to independence, but who is losing support among his
people to the militants.
	   There have been several unofficial reports of Albanians once
loyal to Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, or other
political groups, crossing wholesale over to the KLA.
	   Krasniqi himself formerly was the Rugova party representative in
the village of Glogovac.
	   Krasniqi stated what he said were three conditions for dialogue
with the Serbian authorities: urgent withdrawal of ``all enemy
forces from Kosovo territory'' before dialogue could begin;
mediation of ``one influential international factor,'' and
``thorough preparations.''
	   Krasniqi did not identify the desired ''international factor,''
but he did call on the United States and the West to contribute to
what he called peace and freedom in the Balkans.
	   Krasniqi did not specify who would represent the ethnic Albanian
side _ someone from the militants or a political figure _ but he
said that ``political pluralism among Albanians in Kosovo is now a
luxury.''
	   ``We need one political and military power fighting for freedom
and unification (with Albania) _ the KLA is fully prepared to fight
until final victory,'' Krasniqi said in an apparent attempt to ease
Rugova out of the process.
	   Krasniqi, a native of village of Negrovce in the Drenica region
just northwest of provincial capital Pristina, appeared in military
uniform emblazoned with the red-and-black insignia of the UCK, the
Albanian language acronym for the KLA.
	   He called on all his ``countrymen, all freedom fighters and
military experts to heed the calling of the homeland.''
	   ``In a short time period, we have created a huge free territory
in Koovo and we shall not stop,'' Krasniqi said, adding the KLA was
``a natural product of a situation in which the oppressed Albanian
people found themselves in'' in Kosovo.
	   It claims to control 40 percent of the rugged province.

Two charged in bomb blast cases in Indian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Two people allegedly trained in using
explosives in neighboring Pakistan were charged Tuesday with
setting off two fatal blasts in India's capital last year, a local
news agency reported.
	   In addition to the two cases in which they faced explosives
charges, the police documents submitted to magistrate's court also
said Mohammad Amir Khan and Mohammad Shakeel were suspected in 18
other blasts in several places last year in New Delhi, Press Trust
of India news agency reported, citing court documents.
	   The bombs killed or injured dozens of people and damaged shops,
vehicles and houses. The two men, arrested in February, face life
prison terms.
	   The document said the two were trained in Pakistan and carried
out the blasts for a Pakistan-based organization.
	   Neighbors India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars in
the past 50 years, routinely accuse each other of fomenting unrest
across the border. Earlier this month, Pakistan accused India of
being behind a string of bomb blasts that killed 29 people and
injured scores. India denied the charges.
	   Under Indian law, police file charges weeks or months after
arrests. A judge later decides if there is a case, then formally
charges the accused before beginning the trial, which can last
several years.

Aviation agreement signed between Malaysia, New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia and New Zealand on
Tuesday signed an ``open skies'' agreement to allow their airlines
to operate in each country without restrictions.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his New Zealand
counterpart, Winston Peters, witnessed the signing of the
agreement.
	   Peters arrived Monday for a four-day visit. He also met with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad for an hour.
	   Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik told the national
news agency Bernama that the agreement would facilitate the future
development of trade, investment and tourism between the two
countries.
	   ``The `open skies' will also afford various opportunities for
the designated airlines of Malaysia and New Zealand to develop and
enhance their air services and also to effect cooperative
agreements and smart partnership,'' Ling said.
	   Malaysia is New Zealand's 10th largest export market.
	   New Zealand exports about 1 billion ringgit (dlrs 250 million)
worth of goods to Malaysia while its imports from Malaysia amount
to 800 million ringgit (dlrs 200 million).
	   Aviation ties between the two countries began in 1989.
	   New Zealand Transport Minister Maurice Williamson said efficient
international air transport links were vital to his country's
economy.
	   ``The new air service agreement is consistent with this
objective and a signal of our commitment to liberalizing trade and
investment,'' he said in a statement.

Survey: Palestinian support for peace process slips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians' support for the peace process
slipped during the past three months, while backing for the Islamic
militant group Hamas increased slightly, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
	   The poll results come amid continued deadlock over the scope of
an Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank. Hamas opposes the
peace process; Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority supports it.
	   A strong majority of Palestinians still back peace efforts,
though support fell from 67 percent to 62 percent between March and
June, the survey suggested. During the same period, those
describing themselves as opposed to the Oslo peace accords rose
from 29 percent to 33 percent.
	   Support for the Islamic militant group Hamas increased from 9
percent to 12 percent, according to the survey.
	   The door-to-door poll was conducted June 3-6 by an independent
think tank in the West Bank town of Nablus, and had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points.

China accepts U.S. Army invitation to observe exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a signal of growing Chinese-U.S. military
cooperation, China said Tuesday it will send observers to two U.S.
military exercises for the first time.
	   The announcement came a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to visit China for a summit that both sides hope will highlight
their increased cooperation on strategic and international issues.
	   Military ties, which were frozen after the Chinese army
violently crushed the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, are
becoming an important part of the warming relationship between the
two countries.
	   The Chinese People's Liberation Army plans to send observers to
naval exercises in the east Pacific and air force exercises in
Alaska, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. Both exercises, part
of a series the U.S. military periodically conducts jointly with
other Pacific Rim nations, are scheduled for the summer, it said.
	   American officials have said the U.S. invitation was part of
efforts to improve communication between the Chinese and U.S.
militaries, rather than part of preparations for Clinton's late
June visit, the first by a U.S. president since the Tiananmen
killings.
	   Xinhua cited the observer mission as proof of ``substantial
progress'' in U.S.-China military ties following an increase in
high-level military contacts and visits in recent years.
	   At the last summit in Washington in October, Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin agreed to procedures to avoid accidents or
conflicts between the U.S. and Chinese navies.
	   The two sides' first annual meeting on the agreement's
implementation will be held in Beijing next month, Xinhua said.
	   But despite the warming military ties, U.S. Ambassador to China
James Sasser indicated in comments released Monday that a ban on
sales of military equipment to China imposed after the Tiananmen
crackdown would remain in place for now.
	   ``I don't think our relationship has reached the point where the
United States and China will be selling each other military
capability, military hardware or exchanging technology which could
be used directly in the production or construction of weaponry,''
he said in an interview with European reporters.

Serb arrested trying to smuggle thousands of CDs

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Customs officials at the
Bulgarian-Yugoslav border arrested a Yugoslav national trying to
smuggle 6,525 compact discs, an official reported Tuesday.
	   Slavica Mihic, the detainee, told police that a Bulgarian paid
him 200 German marks (dlrs 111) to smuggle the discs from Bulgaria
into Yugoslavia.
	   The seizure was made at the Kalotina border crossing, 50
kilometers (31 miles) northwest of Sofia, customs spokesman Ivan
Kutevski said.
	   Kutevski added that police were checking the origin of the
discs, suspected of being pirated copies.
	   Western officials have recently praised Bulgaria's government
for imposing stringent controls on compact disc makers and traders
in an effort to crack down on copyright piracy, which prior
governments had tolerated.
	   In Yugoslavia, pirate disk vendors have complained that the
supply from Bulgaria is drying up, but claimed Serbs are now trying
to produce pirate copies themselves.

Report: Suspects confess to killing journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two former aides to a regional leader, who were
arrested on suspicion of killing an opposition journalist, have
confessed to the murder, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Larisa Yudina, the editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today
newspaper, was found dead on June 8 in the Kalmykian capital Elista
with multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   Yudina's newspaper had long criticized the leadership of Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, the leader of the southern region of Kalmykia. It
recently accused him of extorting money from local businessmen
under the guise of ``voluntary'' donations.
	   President Boris Yeltsin demanded on Monday that Yudina's killing
be investigated ``to the utmost level,'' adding that local
officials investigating the case ``cannot be fully trusted.''
	   Vladimir Kolesnikov, Russia's first deputy interior minister,
flew to Kalmykia on Tuesday to head the investigation.
	   Police have arrested Sergei Vaskin, a former aide to Kalmyk
President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, and Tyurbya Boskhomdzhiyev,
Ilyumzhinov's envoy to a nearby region. Both men have admitted to
killing Yudina, the Interfax news agency reported, citing a federal
prosecutor.
	   The business daily Kommersant said that Boskhomdzhiyev had lured
Yudina to a meeting by promising to turn over compromising
materials on Ilyumzhinov. Investigators believe that Vaskin then
killed her, the newspaper said.
	   Boskhomdzhiyev said that Ilyumzhinov's lieutenants had long
urged Yudina to stop criticizing the Kalmyk leader and ordered the
killing after she refused, Kommersant quoted investigators as
saying.
	   Liberal Russian media have assailed Ilyumzhinov, a millionaire
businessman turned Kalmyk president, for running the impoverished
region like a medieval baron, flaunting his fleet of luxury
imported cars and other wealth while ignoring the republic's social
woes and crushing dissent.
	   Ilyumzhinov, who also serves as the president of the World Chess
Federation, said Sunday that he will seek the Russian presidency in
2000.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of Russian parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, said on Tuesday that Ilyumzhinov's ambitions
had apparently been fed by the unlimited power he has enjoyed in
the region.
	   ``Kalmykia has such a regime that its president has decided he
can cope with Russia,'' Seleznyov said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.

Militants' spokesman sets conditions in first interview

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For the first time, Kosovo's
militant Albanian separatists have stated their conditions for a
dialogue with the Serbian authorities, saying a cease-fire depends
on withdrawal of all security forces and foreign mediation.
	   Appearing in the full uniform of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
newly appointed spokesman Jakup Krasniqi told Albanian television
that dialogue would need thorough preparation.
	   His interview was broadcast late Monday night, and received by
satellite in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian daily Bujku printed
it Tuesday.
	   The appearance seemed timed to coincide with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's trip to Moscow, where he reportedly agreed in
talks with Russia's Boris Yeltsin Tuesday to negotiate with
unspecified Kosovo Albanians.
	   The shadowy Liberation Army, which first emerged in 1996, has
gained support as it increased its numbers and firepower since
March, when Serbian police launched a crackdown on militants in the
Drenica region.
	   More than 300 people have since been killed in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population and seek
independence for the province _ dear to Serbs as the birthplace of
their culture and Orthodox Church.
	   The Serb Media Center, close to Kosovo's authorities, reported
the body of a Serbian police reservist was found early Tuesday in
his home in a village 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, that has been under militant attack.
	   It was not clear Tuesday if either the KLA or Milosevic would
agree to meet each other.
	   On American urging, Milosevic already has met Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian political leader who has always advocated a
peaceful path to independence, but who is losing support among his
people to the militants.
	   There have been several unofficial reports of Albanians once
loyal to Rugova's party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, or other
political groups, crossing over to the KLA.
	   Krasniqi, a 47-year-old school teacher from Drenica, formerly
was the Rugova party representative in the village of Glogovac.
	   Krasniqi, who was appointed Friday, stated what he said were
three conditions for dialogue with the Serbian authorities: urgent
withdrawal of ``all enemy forces from Kosovo territory'' before
dialogue could begin; mediation by ``one influential international
factor,'' and ``thorough preparations.''
	   Krasniqi did not identify the desired ``international factor,''
but he did ask the United States and the West to contribute to what
he called peace and freedom in the Balkans.
	   Krasniqi did not specify who would represent the ethnic Albanian
side _ someone from the militants or a political figure _ but he
said that ``political pluralism among Albanians in Kosovo is now a
luxury.''
	   ``We need one political and military power fighting for freedom
and unification (with Albania) _ the KLA is fully prepared to fight
until final victory,'' Krasniqi said in an apparent attempt to ease
Rugova out of the process.
	   Krasniqi appeared in military uniform emblazoned with the
red-and-black insignia of the UCK, the Albanian language acronym
for the KLA.
	   He called on all his ``countrymen, all freedom fighters and
military experts to heed the calling of the homeland.''
	   ``In a short time period, we have created a huge free territory
in Kosovo and we shall not stop,'' Krasniqi said, adding the KLA
was ``a natural product of a situation in which the oppressed
Albanian people found themselves in'' in Kosovo.
	   It claims to control 40 percent of the rugged province.

Thai Airways to phase out foreign pilots by 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Airways International plans to
phase out its last 11 foreign pilots by the year 2000, the national
airline announced Tuesday.
	   When their contracts end, it will mark the first time since the
airline was founded 38 years ago that all its pilots will be Thai,
said a news release.
	   Using all Thai pilots will save the airline millions of dollars
in annual expenses, it said. The airline is struggling to increase
efficiency to deal with the effects of the region's economic
crisis.
	   Asia's economic boom of the late 1980s put several thousand
foreign pilots, especially Americans and Australians, on the
payrolls of the region's airlines, then expanding rapidly.
	   At the height of the boom, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific employed
only 100 local people out of 1,300 pilots. More than half the
pilots for Singapore Airlines, regarded as one of Asia's most
successful, were foreigners.
	   Foreign pilots were often hired at a premium and normally
received allowances and other benefits not given to local fliers.
	   Until about five years ago, Thai Airways employed several dozen
foreigners as pilots, the airline said. It currently has 836 pilots
on its roster.
	   The airline will be able to make its pilot staff all Thai
because it is reducing the types of aircraft in its fleet from nine
to six, making training less complicated.
	   An advertisement for pilots this year drew 700 applicants for 20
openings, the news release quoted Capt. Chamlong Poompuang, deputy
vice president for operations, as saying.
	   ``We normally need about 40 to 45 new pilots per year to support
business growth, replace retiring pilots and to replace the
expatriates,'' he said.
	   About half the airline's pilots are drawn from the air force,
saving money in training costs, he said. It can cost up to 1.4
million baht (dlrs 31,800) per pilot per year to train civilians to
fly, he said.
	   Chamlong also said the airline hopes to save about 1 percent of
its total fuel bill, or about 120 million baht (dlrs 2.7 million)
this fiscal year.
	   Pilots have been instructed not to take on more fuel than
necessary and to fill up at airports where it is cheaper.
	   They have also been asked to work with air traffic controllers
to seek the most direct flight paths and optimum flying altitudes.

British inflation creeps higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation rose to a 6-year high of 4.2
percent in May, meaning the Labor government has missed its target
for consumer price increases in 11 of the past 12 months, officials
said Tuesday.
	   The higher prices, blamed largely on increases in fresh food,
stirred concerns that interest rates may have to go up again.
	   Inflation had stood at 4 percent in April, well above the
government's elusive target of 2.5 percent. The current rate is the
highest since May 1992, when Britain had a 4.3 percent inflation
rate.
	   The Bank of England has been inching interest rates higher over
the past year to try to bring inflation down to 2.5 percent, but
thus far the monetary tightening has not worked.
	   The central bank has imposed six rate increases of a
quarter-point each _ the most recent on June 4 _ since the Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair took office in May 1997.
	   The opposition Conservative Party characterized the latest
figures as Labor's failure to keep the economy under control.
	   ``Business now has to worry about further interest rate rises as
the Bank of England tries to control the mess the government has
made,'' said lawmaker John Redwood, who speaks for the
Conservatives on trade issues.

Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell for a second day
Tuesday, spooked by an overnight plunge on Wall Street and the
continued weakness of the Japanese currency. Malaysian share prices
tumbled 3.6 percent because of the gloom that seems to be settling
over regional markets because of the sliding yen. The dollar was at
145.14 yen in late Tokyo trading, down 1.30 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and below its late New York rate of 146.15 yen overnight. The
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell 16.40
points to 435.84. South Korean shares also closed sharply lower,
with the main index falling to a new 11-year low. The Korea
Composite Stock Price Index slumped 8.21 points, or 2.8 percent, to
280.00, its lowest close since 276.61 on Jan. 12, 1987.(ASIAN

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italia SpA, the world's fifth
largest phone company, on Tuesday named Massimo Sarmi to replace
the chief operating officer who resigned last week in a power
struggle with the chairman. The nomination occurred during a
last-minute board meeting ahead of a shareholders meeting. Sarmi
currently is in charge of DECT, Telecom's cordless city phone
project, and previously headed acquisitions. Telecom Italia said in
a statement that its board of directors backed Rossignolo and the
company's strategic committee, which has been under fire for recent
decisions to start or end various projects, including the
much-criticized corless project, which failed to win popularity
with consumers enamored with cellular phones.(ITALY-TELECOM)
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ It will be up to the Group of Seven
leading industrialized nations to stabilize the tumbling Japanese
yen, a critical factor for any economic recovery in Asia, a senior
World Bank official said Tuesday. Jean-Michel Severino, the bank's
vice president for East Asia and the Pacific, said the G-7 had a
lot of experience in formulating currency stabilization plans. But
the Japanese government must also present a ``consistent and
coherent'' approach to solving its own problems if any
international stabilization plan is to work, he said. Speaking at
the Australia Summit, Severino said now was a critical time for the
management of the Asian economic crisis, with the outcome
delicately balanced. (AUSTRALIA-WORLD BANK-ASIA)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada said
Tuesday he plans to sell the government's stake in strike-ravaged
Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier. The financially
troubled airline announced Monday it will lay off 5,000 workers _
nearly 40 percent of its current 13,000-member work force _ in an
effort to survive after a crippling pilots' strike. The 12-day
strike by more than 600 pilots has cost the company more than 2
billion pesos (dlrs 50 million), PAL said. The airline was already
in serious financial difficulties as a result of an ambitious
refleeting program launched shortly before Asia's currency crisis
reduced passenger numbers and inflated operating and loan repayment
costs. A PAL official said Tuesday it has decided to dispose of all
but 14 of its 54 planes and suspend all orders of new planes as
part of a retrenchment program. (PHILIPPINES-PAL STRIKE)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed deep concern Tuesday about the
pressure imposed on Asian economies by the weakening Japanese yen,
but said it would not devalue its own currency in response. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said quick action to halt the yen's
slump was needed to help Asian economies recover from the region's
nearly yearlong financial upheaval. But while urging Japan and
other countries that he did not name to stabilize the yen, Zhu
indicated that China has no plans to devalue its currency, the
yuan. China's decision not to devalue its currency has been widely
praised for keeping battered Asian economies from sinking further.
China has used its decision not to devalue, despite pressures on
its economy, to project itself as a responsible partner in the
global market. (CHINA-JAPAN-YEN)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
Tuesday to negotiate peace with Kosovo separatists, Boris Yeltsin
was quoted as saying by a Russian news agency. ``Milosevic agreed
to sit down at the negotiating table with Kosovo Albanians,''
Interfax quoted the Russian president as saying after a meeting
with the Yugoslav leader at the Kremlin. ``It's necessary that the
whole world see what we agreed to, so that there should be no steps
back,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying. He told Interfax that the
negotiations were ``not simple,'' and said that both delegations
were working up the agreements resulting from the first round of
talks with Milosevic. Russia is in an odd position in the crisis,
given its uneasy relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed
NATO's eastward expansion last year, and is openly worried about
seeing NATO forces close to its western frontier. (RUSSIA-KOSOVO)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For the first time, Kosovo's
militant Albanian separatists have stated their conditions for a
dialogue with the Serbian authorities, saying a cease-fire depends
on foreign mediation and the withdrawal of all security forces.

Serbian police launched a crackdown on militants in the Drenica
region. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders plan to end their
two-day summit Tuesday with a pledge to ``bring the EU closer to
the people'' and a concession that a key part of their reform drive
_ overhauling the union's finances _ is stalled. Leaders of the 15
nations want to make the EU more relevant to Europeans, who will
soon have a single currency but are said to feel detached from the
people who run the body. The idea is especially close to the hearts
of French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl _ .new converts to the notion, well-established in Britain,
that the EU bureaucracy is a faceless force that issues edicts but
has little contact with the 370 million Europeans it oversees. But
financial reform is even closer to Kohl's heart and, on that score,
the summit ends on a negative note. (EU-SUMMIT)
	   ROME (AP) _ Forcing children into battle uniform. Systematic
rape. Atrocities committed in the course of civil war. On Tuesday,
Algeria's delegation added international terrorism and drug
trafficking to the list of crimes emerging as potential targets of
an international criminal court. Delegates from more than 150
nations are gathering here at a U.N. conference to establish the
tribunal. Terrorism is a key issue for Algeria, where a
six-year-old Muslim extremist insurgency began when the
military-backed government canceled January 1992 elections. The
conflict, involving numerous attacks on civilians, has left more
than 75,000 people dead. Police across Europe in recent weeks have
arrested dozens of suspects they say are linked to Algerian
terrorism in recent weeks. (UN-INTERNATIONAL COURT)
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ France cracked down with jail sentences

who clashed with police and young Tunisian delinquents from rough
northern suburbs. The official backlash came after running battles
with police left the city's Old Port an eerie no-man's land, with
smashed windows and broken bottles in the streets. Violence flared
for a second day Monday after England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in a
first-round World Cup match. More than 50 people were injured in
the violence, including an Englishman whose neck artery was cut by
a bottle and another who was stabbed in the back. Police detained

Malaysia to Japan: Stop `foot-dragging' on economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia said Tuesday the weak
Japanese yen was harming the region and urged Tokyo to stop
``foot-dragging'' and tackle its economic problems.
	   The sliding Japanese currency has further dented investor
confidence in the rest of Asia. Malaysia's ringgit is one of many
regional currencies hit by sharp decline.
	   ``We shudder to think where we will be if the yen continues to
slide,'' Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a speech. ``The
social impact will be severe.''
	   Economic and political problems in Indonesia recently led to
massive social unrest and the ouster of longtime President Suharto.
	   Rumblings of political discontent in Malaysia, spurred by the
economic crisis, have heightened worries of contagion from
Indonesia's social upheaval.
	   Anwar and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad have looked
to Japan, the region's economic titan, to help strengthen the Asian
economies hard hit by the financial crisis. Anwar said Japan would
have to work quickly to put its economy in order.
	   ``The weakness of the yen and Tokyo's slowness in putting its
economy in order, particularly its foot-dragging instead of
strengthening its fragile banking system and opening its markets,
are making the regional situation gloomy indeed,'' Anwar told a
delegation from New Zealand.
	   Japan conceded Friday that it was now in a full-blown recession,
with its economy shrinking 1.3 percent during the first quarter of
1998, following a 0.4 percent drop the previous quarter.
	   Anwar called on the United States and other leading
industrialized nations to help Japan out, saying the country could
not handle all its problems on its own. He cited the speedy aid the
United States afforded Mexico during the 1995 peso crisis.
	   ``We've seen a strong and quick response by the U.S. government
in the Mexican crisis, of the fast turnaround in the economy. We in
the region certainly need a similar commitment,'' Anwar said.
	   He also hinted that agencies such as the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank should speed up their monetary aid to Thailand,
South Korea and Indonesia.

Turkish newsman says goodbye before starting prison term

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Colleagues showered a Turkish
correspondent for a French daily with hugs, kisses and flowers as
he headed off to start serving a seven-month prison term after
being convicted of making Kurdish propaganda.
	   About 100 journalists gathered in front of Turkey's Journalists
Association here to cheer for Ragip Duran and shout, ``Free press
cannot be silenced!''
	   Duran waved as he headed to prison in Tekirdag, a city 130
kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Istanbul. He choose the prison
because it has a library.
	   Duran, correspondent for Liberation, was convicted in December
1995 for an article, in the now defunct pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur
Gundem, which said that Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan had
acquired the ``identity of a philosopher and moralist, besides his
military and political ones.''
	   An appeals court in October upheld the conviction.
	   ``I am not sorry for being sentenced because of my writings and
thoughts,'' Duran told the crowd.
	   Turkish laws prohibit journalists from covering certain issues
in ways unfavorable to the government and pledges by authorities to
amend the laws to expand freedom of expression have not been kept.
	   Reports which criticize the military's heavy-handed treatment of
the Kurds in the southeast have been interpreted as terrorist
propaganda.
	   ``I hope to continue working from prison. Of course, I won't be
able to do any reporting, but I would like to write news
analyses,'' Duran told The Associated Press on Monday.
	   Duran, 44, who in the past worked for the BBC and Agence
France-Presse, is also a lecturer at Istanbul's Galatasaray
University.
	   There are 29 journalists in prison in Turkey, according to the
New York based Committee to Protect Journalists.

EU says goodbye to Mandela _ amid plaudits and trade prods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-EU Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Receiving plaudits and sharing nostalgia,
South African President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday was honored by
the Welsh capital and, with a gentle prod about trade barriers,
said goodbye to European Union leaders.
	   In brilliant sunshine at Cardiff Castle, a choir sang the South
African anthem ``Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika,'' or ``God Bless Africa,''
and Wales' ``Land of Our Fathers,'' before Mandela received the
freedom, or key, of the city.
	   Mandela, who was invited by EU leaders for a farewell lunch
since he plans to step down next year, thanked the Welsh choirs,
the rugby players and the schools that boycotted South Africa under
apartheid.
	   ``The knowledge that local authorities all over Wales were
banning apartheid products from canteens and schools, and that the
universities, the Welsh Rugby Union and the choirs had cut their
links, was a great inspiration to us in our struggle,'' he said.
	   Earlier, with a little Welsh girl in national dress seated on
his knee, the 79-year-old Mandela, in jail for nearly 30 years
under apartheid, was praised by leaders of a city where many pride
themselves on organizing local boycotts of the former South African
policy.
	   Britain and other EU countries refused to apply tough economic
embargoes to South Africa under white-minority rule.
	   Since South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, Britain's
anti-apartheid movement has changed itself into an organization
seeking to help, by such measures as awarding scholarships and
pressing for investment.
	   ``Democracy has brought new and even greater challenges,''
Mandela said. ``I will be able to tell my people that in the people
of Wales we have friends indeed, ready to join hands with us in
building a better life for all.''
	   Earlier, Mandela met separately with the Greek, Belgian and
Portuguese prime ministers, and made it clear he had also come to
remind them of unfinished trade business.
	   A 19th round of negotiations on an EU-South Africa free trade
agreement ended last week in Brussels with hopes of a breakthrough,
but no final deal.
	   Mandela, in an interview with APTV, recalled that the
International Monetary Fund has said the big industrialized
countries have a duty to help poorer nations, particularly with
speedier lowering of tariffs.
	   ``It seems to me one of the most powerful points ... the fact
that we have the backing of such an organization,'' he said.
	   The EU agreed to negotiate separately after South Africa
objected to being treated as one of 70 African, Caribbean and
Pacific nations with which the union has special trade links.
	   South Africa's exports include wine, which competes with surplus
produced by EU countries such as France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

Three die as car smashes into train

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Three people died and two were
severely injured after their car smashed into a passenger train in
southwest Romania, a police officer said Tuesday.
	   The battered Dacia car was driving through an ``improperly
marked'' railway crossing late Monday.
	   Three women in the car died on the spot.
	   Two male survivors were hospitalized, one in a coma and another
with broken bones, medical assistant Anghel Sicosoreci said by
telephone.
	   A child suffered minor injuries after being ejected from the car
by the power of the impact.
	   The accident occurred near the city of Targu Jiu, 250 kilometers
(156 miles) west of Bucharest, police officer Aurelian Sutu said by
telephone.
	   ``We are going to post a police officer at this intersection in
future,'' said Sutu. No details were available on past accidents at
the crossing.

<TEXT>
	   CYBERJAYA, Malaysia (AP) _ A half-dozen major deals were signed
Tuesday to help bring Malaysia's high-tech, multimedia metropolis
closer to coming on line.
	   Nestled in a jungle of palm oil plantations outside the capital,
Kuala Lumpur, the 4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) city envisages
offices of high-tech companies, homes, a hotel, shopping and
recreational centers.
	   Cyberjaya, a pet project of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, is
part of the Multimedia Super Corridor bound by a fiber-optics
network, providing high-speed computer links between Cyberjaya,
Kuala Lumpur, a new international airport and a federal capital
under construction.
	   Telekom Malaysia signed a 133.8 million ringgit (dlrs 33.5
million) deal with Cyberview, the private developer overseeing
Cyberjaya, to buy 80 hectares (200 acres) of land where it will
build the Multimedia University. The first phase of the high-tech
college is slated for completion in September.
	   Mahathir, who witnessed the signing of five agreements at the
Cyberview Lodge, is determined to keep the MSC alive despite the
regional economic slump.
	   ``The economy has slowed down the project a bit,'' he told
reporters. ``But we will overcome.''
	   Cyberview Chief Executive Officer Abdul Karim Abu Bakar said the
agreements reflected ``the continuing commitment in ensuring
progress of Cyberjaya, dispelling any notion that it is being
adversely affected by the current economic slowdown.''
	   The agreements included a 1 billion ringgit (dlrs 250 million)
deal between Cyberview and Telekom Malaysia, the country's largest
telecommunications company, formerly owned by by the government, to
build the telecommunications system.
	   Another agreement was between Cyberview and Permodalan Nasional
Ltd., the largest state-run investment fund, for property
management. A joint-venture agreement to build a massive cooling
system was also signed between Seseni Energy Services and the
country's largest power company, Tenaga SPL, also formerly owned by
the government.
	   There are 219 companies that have applied to work within the
MSC, said Rodhiah Ismail, a spokeswoman for the Multimedia
Development Corp. She said 142 had been approved for operations, of
which 42 percent are Malaysian-owned, 35 are foreign and the
remainder joint ventures.

Lutherans approve declaration to lift Catholic condemnations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Lutheran World Federation said Tuesday its
ruling council has unanimously approved a declaration lifting the
condemnations Lutherans and the Roman Catholic Church heaped on one
another during the 16th century.
	   The ``Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification'' is
designed to end 400 years of strife stemming from the battles that
split Western Christianity.
	   The 1997 declaration, agreeing that all persons depend on the
grace of God _ and not human merit _ for their salvation, was drawn
up by an international group of Catholic and Lutheran theologians.
	   It was sent to the federation's 124 member churches and the
Vatican for approval.
	   In rejecting Reformation stereotypes that Catholics believe they
can earn their salvation, the declaration said 16th-century
condemnations of Catholic teachings in Lutheran confessions no
longer apply.
	   The LWF council ``acted after a `significant majority' of
churches approved the Joint Declaration,'' a statement from the
Geneva-based federation said.
	   ``The Catholic church has not yet taken final action,'' it
added. But ``when approved, details for a joint signing of the
Declaration would be worked out.''
	   The council's resolution called on Lutherans to explore the
``pastoral consequences of the agreements'' jointly with Roman
Catholic churches.
	   Last year, the United States' largest Lutheran church, the 5.2
million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, endorsed the
declaration.
	   The ELCA is one of the federation's two largest churches. The
other, the Church of Sweden, has also endorsed the declaration.

Iraq calls deal with U.N. inspectors a breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's agreement with U.N. weapons monitors
for ending disarmament activities in two months is a
``breakthrough'' that will lead to lifting of sanctions, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   He said the deal met a longstanding Iraqi demand that the arms
inspectors write down specifically what they wanted Iraq to do ``to
close the files (and) prepare the ground for the lifting of the
economic embargo.''
	   ``It is in essence a breakthrough,'' Aziz told reporters in
Iraq's first comment on the deal he reached with chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, on Sunday.
	   The comments, mirroring similar statements by Butler on Monday,
are the best sign yet that Iraq could soon be free from the
sanctions, which have devastated the country's once prosperous
economy by banning free sale of oil.
	   For the last seven years, the inspectors have been searching for
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and verifying Iraqi claims that
it destroyed its arsenal under cease-fire terms of the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Iraq often complained that the inspectors don't say what they
are looking for and conduct surprise raids and checks on suspected
weapons sites. On their part, the inspectors feared that making a
definite list would prevent them from conducting wider searches.
	   All that changed under Sunday's pact, which sets a 2-month
timetable for the United Nations inspectors to end their work. Aziz
said the agreement ``is specific in its nature, very precise.''
	   He made the comments while opening an Egyptian trade fair, the
latest in a string of such exhibitions organized by several
countries with an eye to the future when sanctions are lifted.
	   That will happen only when the inspectors, who work for the
United Nations Special Commission, certify that Iraq is free of all
long-range missiles and chemical and biological weapons. UNSCOM has
given Iraq a virtual clean bill of health on its nuclear weapons
program.
	   Aziz said ``very few issues'' remain unresolved in the missile
and chemical areas. ``They have to be addressed in coming weeks to
wrap up the whole work,'' he said.
	   On the germ warfare file, Aziz said the two sides ``agreed on a
new practical approach within the context of disarmament and we
hope we put it in the right course and finish it very soon.''

Senior legal official beaten unconscious

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A senior legal official was hospitalized
with concussion after an unknown male beat him near his home in
Sofia, state radio reported Tuesday.
	   Rumen Andreev, 47, deputy chief of the National Investigation
Service, told state radio he was knocked unconscious after trying
to stop his attacker from beating a woman in the street. The attack
occurred late Saturday in a residential district near central
Sofia, but police did not report it till Tuesday.
	   Andreev, who was off duty, did not use the service pistol he
carries with him, and the assailant fled after hitting him several
times.
	   It was not clear that the attack was in any way connected with
his office.
	   Reports of street and organized crime have increased in Bulgaria
reflecting the economic downturn, moral decay and poor law
enforcement nine years after the collapse of communism.
	   A top crime writer for Bulgaria's largest daily newspaper
suffered bad injuries a month ago after being splashed with acid at
a bus stop in Sofia. Police are still looking for her assailant.

Hong Kong official urges Japan, U.S. to stabilize yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang on
Tuesday urged Japan and the United States to help stabilize the
sliding Japanese currency.
	   The yen's recent slide has rocked financial markets throughout
Asia and the effects are rippling to the U.S. and European markets.
	   The yen's unchecked fall eventually would bring down ``the
Japanese institutions and including the American market in the long
run,'' Tsang told reporters.
	   He said Japan and the United States ``must tell the rest of the
world which is a reasonable level from their point of view, for the
yen and dollar exchange rate to be at.''
	   ``We must urge ... the leading economies, particularly Japan and
America, to come forward to stabilize the situation. It is not
doing anybody any good at all. And G-7 (Group of Seven
industrialized nations), as well, must step in,'' Tsang said.
	   The Hong Kong stock market's blue-chip Hang Seng Index slumped
5.7 percent Monday as interbank interest rates soared in reaction
to the yen's slide to an eight-year low of more than 146 yen
against the U.S. dollar. The index ended 0.9 percent higher
Tuesday.
	   Tsang reiterated that Hong Kong will not scrap the peg of the
Hong Kong dollar at 7.80 to the U.S. currency.
	   ``In fact, moving the linked exchange rate now will create
immediate chaos and bring havoc to the economy. It is not something
we will contemplate at all. So rule it out of your mind, rule it
out completely,'' Tsang added.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation rose to a 6-year high of 4.2
percent in May, meaning the Labor government has missed its target
for consumer price increases in 11 of the past 12 months, officials
said Tuesday.
	   The higher prices, blamed largely on increases in fresh food,
caught business leaders off guard and stirred concerns that
interest rates may have to go up again.
	   ``This is terrible news for business in Britain, especially
exporters,'' said Vincent Burke, spokesman for the London Chamber
of Commerce and Industry. ``They are now getting hit with a
quadruple whammy of rising costs, rising interest rates, the strong
pound and problems in Southeast Asia.''
	   The chamber urged businesses and government agencies to show
restraint in raising wages for their workers.
	   Most British multinationals have seen their export earnings hurt
by the high value of sterling, and they were unsettled by the
prospect of even higher interest rates that would raise the pound
further against other currencies.

Tajik man caught smuggling heroin to Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Customs police have arrested at Tajik citizen
carrying more than 300 grams of heroin in plastic packages in his
stomach, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The 29-year-old man fainted on the plane en route from Dushanbe
to Moscow on Sunday, and was taken to a hospital after staff at the
Domodyedovo airport failed to revive him. Doctors then found 192
plastic balls containing more than 300 grams (10.5 ounces) of
heroin in his stomach, Interfax said, citing the State Customs
Committee.
	   Doctors think that 30 more capsules containing the drug are
lodged in the man's rectum, Interfax reported.
	   The man, whose name was not released, is now under police
surveillance in a city hospital intensive care unit.
	   A criminal case was opened in connection with the incident.
	   Earlier this year, another Tajik citizen died while trying to
smuggle heroin in his stomach from Dushanbe to Moscow, Interfax
said.

China signals desire for weak court at U.N. conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES, RECASTS throughout with China position, diplomatic
flap; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ China warned against turning a permanent world court
into a ``means of interfering in countries' internal affairs,''
declaring at a U.N. conference Tuesday support for what would
clearly be a weak tribunal.
	   Long stung by international criticism over its human rights
record, China said the court should only have jurisdiction when the
countries concerned gave their consent. That is something experts
say would have made war crimes prosecutions in Rwanda or the former
Yugoslavia impossible.
	   ``The court should not become a tool of political struggles or a
means of interfering in other countries' internal affairs,'' Wang
Guangya, head of the Chinese delegation, told the gathering.
	   And protective of its role as one of the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council, it said the tribunal should not
``compromise the principal role'' of the council.
	   That puts China on the same side as fellow council member United
States, which advocates close Security Council control of
prosecutions. The U.S. argues that arrangement gives individual
prosecutors and judges the political backing needed to do the job.
	   China also said there should be no vote on the treaty. Instead,
it suggested passage by consensus, something else experts call
impossible.
	   Organizers said Tuesday that 153 nations are attending. The
delegates will seek agreement on a statute establishing the court
and its rules. Individual nations must then ratify it. If approved,
it could take several years for the court to be set up.
	   The court would be aimed at trying defendants accused of crimes
of war and genocide and against humanity.
	   The project, born of the post-World War II Nuremburg and Tokyo
war crimes trials and fueled by the atrocities this decade in
Rwanda and Bosnia, culminates 50 years of efforts at the U.N.
	   Tuesday brought the conference's first flap.
	   On a complaint by China, U.N. officials cancelled a news
conference by Terre des Hommes, a non-governmental organization
that campaigns against violence inflicted on children.
	   According to Michel Hoffman, the group's director, China
objected to the presence of a Chinese pediatrician who worked at an
orphanage in Shang-hai where, she said, large numbers of children
were willfully allowed to die of starvation and lack of medical
care.
	   A U.N. spokeswoman, Susan Markham, said Terre des Hommes could
not use the news conference room without being sponsored by a
nation or the umbrella non-governmental group. The group was given
the room in an oversight, Ms. Markham said.
	   Hoffman said no country wanted to sponsor it after China's
complaint.
	   He, the pediatrician, Dr. Zhang Shu-Yun, and others from the
group spoke to reporters anyway in the hallway.

Egypt to rent satellite TV channel to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq, which was refused access to Turkish
and Arab satellites, will instead use a channel on a new Egyptian
satellite to broadcast its television programs, Egyptian officials
said Tuesday.
	   Egypt's state-run Egyptian Satellite Co. has agreed to rent a
channel on the Nilesat to Iraqi Television for broadcasting to the
Arab world, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They said the state-run Iraqi Television will start broadcasting
next month. The officials refused to give details about the deal or
say what kinds of programs will Iraq broadcast.
	   Last year, the Saudi Arabia based operators of ArabSat
communications satellite, which is owned by a group of Arab
nations, turned down Iraq's request for a channel. Turkey which
owns private satellites also refused.
	   Egypt launched the French-built Nilesat 101 last month. The dlrs
158 million satellite is capable of reaching audiences from North
Africa to the Gulf and other parts of the Arab world.
	   Egypt's relations with Iraq improved recently after Baghdad
increased its trade with Cairo under the U.N.-sponsored
oil-for-food deal. The deal, an exception to nearly eight years of
economic sanctions on Iraq, allows Iraq to sell limited quantities
of oil to buy humanitarian supplies and medicines.

Official: Russian ready to be extradited to Russia in gem case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A Russian jewelry merchant charged with
swindling a fortune in precious metals and gems from the Russian
government could be extradited next week, a Greek official said
Tuesday.
	   A Public Order Ministry spokesman, Vangelis Markoulis, said
Andrei Kozlenok could be returned to Russia as early as Monday.
	   Kozlenok, who was arrested in Athens in January, has fought the
extradition by claiming his life would be in danger in Russia.
Another suspect in the scheme, Sergei Dovbysh, a former Russian
Interior Ministry official, was found dead in February in a court
house cell in Moscow. The death was ruled a suicide.
	   Greek courts have rejected Kozlenok's appeals. Justice Minister
Evangelos Yiannopoulos signed the extradition order Monday.
	   The case is now in the hands of the Public Order Ministry, which
must arrange to send Kozlenok back.
	   Kozlenok, 38, was allegedly part of a scheme to defraud the
Russian government of dlrs 183 million. Prosecutors claim he set up
a fake contract between the Russian Committee on Precious Metals
and Gems and the San Francisco-based company Golden ADA Inc.
	   In 1995, the Russian government filed a lawsuit in San Francisco
alleging Golden ADA did not pay the money owed from the Russian
jewels received. Russia claimed the company sold the gems and used
the money to buy yachts, luxury cars and a mansion.
	   Kozlenok fled and was arrested at Athens airport after arriving
on a flight from Brussels, Belgium.

Bosnian Serb parliament deposes hardline speaker and deputy,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from the sacked speaker, CORRECTS that
one deputy speaker sacked, non-Serb envisaged for that post. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Supporters of a
pro-Western course in the Serb half of Bosnia early Tuesday deposed
the hardline speaker of parliament and one of his deputies, a move
expected to make the Serb republic more open to non-Serbs.
	   The parliament acted on a letter from the top international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who in late May asked
deputies to fulfill a promise made in January to choose one of the
18 Muslim or Croat deputies as one of three deputy speakers in the
83-member parliament.
	   Deputies living in the half of Bosnia that is a Muslim-Croat
Federation won seats in last November's parliamentary elections on
votes from the hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs driven out of
what is now the Serb Republic during the 1992-5 war.
	   The move to elect a Muslim or Croat as deputy speaker was
continuously blocked by hardline legislators loyal to wartime
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted by the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   A Karadzic loyalist, parliament speaker Dragan Kalinic, and his
deputy Nikola Poplasen from the ultranationalist Radical Party were
deposed by a vote of 43-35 in the early hours Tuesday.
	   Kalinic denounced his foes as showing ``their true colors of
servility to outside masters.''
	   The differences between Karadzic's camp and supporters of
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who last year turned
against Karadzic and supported the West's course in Bosnia, are now
``huge and irrevocable,'' Kalinic added.
	   Later Tuesday, the hardline Serb Democratic Party refused to
propose a replacement for Kalinic, although the party as the
largest in parliament has the right to nominate the speaker.
	   ``It would be the utmost hypocrisy'' to name a candidate, said
Kalinic, adding that noone in his party wants to be a figurehead
for a parliament run by others.
	   ``I see that the process of integration of Republika Srpska into
Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue and that there will be series of
laws and decisions that would transfer the authority _ which we
fought for so hard _ to (joint) Bosnian authorities,'' Kalinic
said, alluding to the hardliners wish for an ethnically pure
Serbian state separate from the rest of Bosnia.

Iraq calls deal with U.N. inspectors a breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's agreement with United Nations
weapons monitors for ending disarmament activities in two months is
a ``breakthrough'' that will lead to lifting of U.N. sanctions,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   He said the deal met a longstanding Iraqi demand that the arms
inspectors write down specifically what they wanted Iraq to do ``to
close the files (and) prepare the ground for the lifting of the
economic embargo.''
	   ``It is in essence a breakthrough,'' Aziz told reporters in
Iraq's first comment on the deal he reached with chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler on Sunday.
	   The comments, mirroring similar statements by Butler on Monday,
are the best sign yet that Iraq could soon be free from U.N.
sanctions, which have devastated the country's once- prosperous
economy by banning free sale of oil.
	   For the last seven years, the inspectors have been searching for
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and verifying Iraqi claims that
it destroyed its arsenal under cease-fire terms of the 1991 Gulf
War. The sanctions cannot be lifted until the inspectors, who work
for the United Nations Special Commission, certify that Iraq is
free of all long-range missiles and chemical and biological
weapons.
	   Iraq often complained that the inspectors don't say what they
are looking for and conduct surprise raids and checks on suspected
weapons sites. On their part, the inspectors feared that making a
definite list would prevent them from conducting wider searches.
	   Aziz said this agreement ``is specific in its nature, very
precise.''
	   He made the comments while opening an Egyptian trade fair, the
latest in a string of such exhibitions organized by several
countries with an eye to the future when sanctions are lifted.
	   UNSCOM has given Iraq a virtual clean bill of health on its
nuclear weapons program.
	   Aziz said ``very few issues'' remain unresolved in the missile
and chemical areas. ``They have to be addressed in coming weeks to
wrap up the whole work,'' he said.
	   As for germ warfare, Aziz said the two sides ``agreed on a new
practical approach within the context of disarmament, and we hope
we put it in the right course and finish it very soon.''

Tensions among Israeli leaders over talks with Palestinians

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 10-13 with more house demolitions &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted
Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a decision on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, despite pressure to accept a U.S. proposal.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with his defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, for pushing him to reach a decision soon.
	   ``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told
Israel Army Radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   Netanyahu suggested that a deal on a withdrawal, once reached,
might be the last agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians
for a long time, although a final Israel-Palestinian peace
settlement is supposed to be negotiated by next May.
	   ``We don't know if a permanent settlement will be achieved,''
Netanyhau said on Israel's Army Radio. ``Perhaps it will, and we
are striving for it.
	   But Netanyahu said that if the Palestinians insist on the right
of return for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars and
on the division of Jerusalem, ``There will be no agreement.''
	   ``Therefore it is possible that we will have to live for some
time, perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that
agreement.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal would be
the second of three to which Israel has committed itself.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Informal U.S. deadlines for an
Israeli decision have passed without the Clinton administration
taking any action against Israel.
	   The United States has criticized Israel, however, for going
ahead with expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
demolishing Palestinian houses while the peace process is at an
impasse.
	   On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
demolitions sent the ``wrong signals,'' at a time when the Mideast
peace process is so fragile.
	   Israel bulldozed three houses in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem on Monday, and demolished two more on Tuesday morning.
Israel says the houses were built illegally.
	   The Palestinians say Israel has significantly stepped up its
campaign of house demolitions in the city's contested eastern
sector in recent months.
	   Mordechai, who is considered one of the moderates in the
Netanyahu government, told a closed forum on Monday that ``We have
no choice but to carry out the second redeployment and the time has
come to take the decision,'' according to Israel Radio.
	   ``It is possible to wait another few days, maybe a week, with
this decision, but it is wrong to wait until the end of the summer
session of parliament,'' the Yediot Ahronot newspaper quoted
Mordechai as saying.
	   ``Time is running out. Palestinian frustration can endanger
Israel's security,'' Yediot quoted Mordechai as saying.
	   Mordechai is a member of the inner circle of Cabinet ministers
supervising the contacts with the United States and the
Palestinians. His nemesis in the so-called kitchen Cabinet is
Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon, who says Israel must not
hand the Palestinians more than 9 percent of the West Bank in a
second pullback.
	   Netanyahu on Tuesday denied reports that he agreed in principle
to a 13 percent withdrawal. ``We have not yet achieved such an
agreement,'' he said.

Minister: Australian-Asian ties could suffer from `racist
</HEADLINE>
politics' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's foreign minister warned
Tuesday that Australian-Asian relations could suffer if Australia
pursued the anti-Asian policies of politician Pauline Hanson.
	   Hanson's right-wing One Nation party swept almost a quarter of
the votes Saturday in the Queensland state election with policies
against Asian immigration high on its platform.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that if
those policies were pursued, it might lead to widespread hatred
against Asia.
	   ``This may strain ties between Australia and Asia,'' Abdullah
was quoted as saying by the government-owned Bernama news agency.
	   Abdullah said he did not hold Hanson's views as representative
of the Australian people but found it disconcerting that her party
won such stunning support.
	   ``What's worrying is whether more Australians will support
Hanson's racist politics,'' Abdullah said.
	   Hanson opposes many of Australian Prime Minister John Howard's
key planned reforms. Many voted against traditional conservative
parties in support of Hanson's platform, which includes policies
against free trade, Aboriginal welfare and Asian immigration.
	   Asked whether Hanson's comments would strain trade ties between
the two countries, he said Kuala Lumpur would not react in any way
to jeopardize ties with Canberra.
	   However, Abdullah said that students would be reluctant to study
in Australia if anti-Asian sentiment prevailed. Thousands of
Malaysian students enroll in Australian universities each year.

World Cup: Iranian officials upset over film on French TV
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) - At the World Cup, the Iranians have
been on a drive to show their good face to soccer fans around the
globe. But the showing of an unflattering U.S. film about Iran on
French TV has Iranian soccer officials seeing red.
	   By the looks of it, the screening of ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' a film based on a book by Betty Mahmoudi, could turn
into a diplomatic spat.
	   France's privately owned channel 6M showed the film late Monday.
It's based on the true story of an American woman who escapes from
Iran with her daughter against the wishes of her Iranian husband.
	   Sally Field plays the lead role in a film that portrays Iranians
as dirty, boorish and cruel, obsessed with their Islamic religion
and its attitudes toward women.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' said
Safaei Farahani, head of Iran's soccer federation said of the TV
broadcast. ``We hold the French government responsible for allowing
the screening of the film, and will register our severe protest,''
he told The Associated Press Tuesday.
	   He was due to meet with French soccer officials later Tuesday to
complain. Iran's team captain Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh was due to meet
the press later Tuesday to voice the players' protest.
	   Officials of channel 6M were not immediately available for
comment.
	   In its first World Cup match, Iran lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia on
Sunday. But the Iranians, who were expected to crumble against the
highly rated Yugoslavs, saw the result as a victory of sorts.
	   Iran's next game is against the United States on Sunday in Lyon.
With 20 years of enmity between the two countries, it will be the
most politically charged game of the tournament. Iran's last game
in the first round will be against Germany. The United States lost
2-0 to Germany on Monday in its first Group F match.
	   ``The showing of this film after our good game with Yugoslavia
and the upcoming game against the United States, is nothing but an
effort to dispirit our players,'' said Farahani. ``How can the
French government claim to provide a good environment for the games
and speak of fair play when such a film is shown on French
television,'' said Farahani.
	   The game with the United States is the one all Iranians want to
win.
	   In Tehran, hard-line opponents of the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami don't want the match to lead to a softening of
ties with the United States. They have asked the government to
order players not to exchange T-shirts with the Americans after the
match.
	   But the government-owned Iran Daily newspaper in Tehran said
that the game with the United States was like any other. ``One
shouldn't turn this friendly World Cup encounter into a battle of
two ideologies,'' the English-language paper said.

shouldn't turn this friendly World Cup encounter into a battle of
two ideologies,'' the English-language paper said.

Thousands flee as shelling continues in Guinea-Bissau capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ While government troops and rebels
continued to trade artillery fire Tuesday in the capital of
Guinea-Bissau, the onset of the rainy season increased fears for
the tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   Loyalist forces maintained their siege of a military garrison in
a suburb of the capital Bissau where renegade soldiers have been
holed up since June 7.
	   Aid workers reported the two sides were lobbing large-caliber
artillery and mortar shells.
	   ``The shelling is still serious,'' Michael Kleiner of the
International Red Cross said in Geneva.
	   Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was deserted, Kleiner
said.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported more than
150,000 refugees in the area.
	   ``The big problem is the lack of drinking water and food for the
people on the road,'' Kleiner said.
	   Portugal made plans Tuesday to send 30 tons of medical and food
aid to its former colony. Further evacuations of foreign residents
also were being prepared, the government said.
	   Heavy rain swept across the country Tuesday, raising fears about
the spread of disease, especially cholera.
	   Refugees walked for days through crocodile-infested mangrove
swamps and jungle to reach the border with Senegal.
	   The deputy chief of the country's armed forces said Tuesday that
his troops, supported by soldiers from Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea, were gaining the upper-hand.
	   ``They're on the retreat,'' Lt. Col. Afonso Pe said in an
interview broadcast on Portuguese radio station RDP-Africa.
	   He said the shelling created panic in the city, but said he
could not estimate the number of casualties.
	   ``We're in a war situation. No one knows when this will end,''
he said.
	   Senegalese forces were bolstering their positions around the
garrison, bringing up heavy artillery and machine guns, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The rebels were entrenched at the complex where they reportedly
laid mines and booby traps.
	   Government forces took up positions in several other towns,
apparently to halt any spread of the revolt, Lusa reported.
	   Fires caused by the shelling spread through Bissau on Monday.
The U.S. embassy, evacuated on Sunday, was burned out, and the
European Union representative's residence was destroyed by a shell,
according to Lusa.
	   The rebels have demanded that elected President Joao Bernardo
Vieira step down. They accuse him of corruption and abuse of power.

International charity holds executive meeting in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Executives of the charity organization,
World Vision International, are meeting in Lebanon to remind the
world of the needs of children in a country still recovering from a
devastating civil war.
	   ``Lebanon is the forgotten country,'' organization president
Dean Hirsch said in an interview Monday night.
	   ``The forgotten story is that Lebanon is going to need help,''
said Hirsch, an American. ``We have a responsibility to be a voice
of the children,'' he added.
	   World Vision has contributed dlrs 50 million in Lebanon since
the outbreak the country's civil war in 1975.
	   By the time the war ended in 1990, 150,000 people had been
killed and Lebanon's infrastructure was devastated. The government
has been borrowing heavily to finance reconstruction projects.
	   The World Vision team, which meets here on Tuesday and
Wednesday, will meet with President Elias Hrawi on Thursday.
	   ``We want to reaffirm for the president and the people that we
are here for the long haul,'' said David Jenkin, an Australian who
is World Vision's board chairman.
	   The group's budget for Lebanon dropped from dlrs 5 million in
1997 to dlrs 2 million this year because of a government policy
that does not allow tax exemptions to charitable organizations.
	   The executive meeting in Lebanon is one more confirmation of
international confidence in security and in the country's postwar
recovery.
	   Most international organizations used to operated here with
local staff. American companies used to have non-American
executives because of security conditions and a 10-year-old U.S.
ban on travel to Lebanon. The ban was replaced by an advisory in
July 1997 as security improved.

Iraq sends envoy to Yemen

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan left for
Yemen Tuesday to seek its backing for the lifting of U.N. sanctions
on Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The agency said Ramadan carried a message from President Saddam
Hussein to his Yemeni counterpart, Ali Abdullah Saleh, on bilateral
ties and Iraq's relations with the United Nations Security Council.
	   Saddam has recently sent envoys to several Arab and foreign
countries as part of a diplomatic drive to muster support for
ending the sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fireworks exploded Tuesday in a subway car in a
station near the Kremlin, injuring two people, police said.
	   The blast occurred at 2:15 p.m. (1015 GMT) in the Teatralnaya
station, one of three serving the Kremlin area, according to a
subway police spokesman who declined to give his name.
	   It was not clear what had ignited the fireworks, the spokesman
said.
	   A man and a woman people sustained slight injuries on their
faces, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The Federal Security Service, a successor to the KGB, said there
were no grounds to believe the explosion was deliberate, the
Interfax news agency reported. A spokesman for the security service
said that the device could have been fireworks or a signal flare,
Interfax said.
	   Subway service was not affected, the police spokesman said. The
subway car was taken to a depot for examination, but no other
explosive devices were discovered, he said.

Crackdown against hooligans; Toulouse braces for next English match

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ France cracked down with jail sentences
and expulsions Tuesday against World Cup soccer fans from England
who clashed with police and young Tunisian delinquents from rough
northern suburbs.
	   The official backlash came after running battles with police
left the city's Old Port an eerie no-man's land, with smashed
windows and broken bottles in the streets. Violence flared for a
second day Monday after England beat Tunisia, 2-0, in a first-round
World Cup match.
	   More than 50 people were injured in the violence, including an
Englishman whose neck artery was cut by a bottle and another who
was stabbed in the back.
	   Police detained nearly 80 people, but they were under fire in
local and national press who accused them of failing to control the
violence by hundreds of locals and drunken English fans.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who defended the
police actions, signed an order Tuesday to immediately expel five
English fans and a Tunisian, and he threatened other expulsions if
soccer violence recurs.
	   Late Monday, a Marseille court convicted and sentenced three
Englishmen to three months in prison for the violence, a four
others faced a hearing Tuesday. Five English and three French
suspects faced trial July 17, five days after the World Cup ends.
	   Twenty-five others _ 18 French, six English and a Tunisian _
remained held for questioning Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for
England's next match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English
fans were already reported in the city, prompting officials to
postpone a weekend music festival until July 11. They also
considered closing bars early.
	   Police rounded up 58 ticketless Scottish fans in Bordeaux on
Tuesday before an afternoon Norway-Scotland match there,
authorities said. They were fed and placed in a hall to watch the
match on TV, then were to be loaded on their bus and escorted out
of town.
	   Scattered clashes persisted until dawn between Marseille police
and suburban toughs, who attacked some English fans lingering in
the streets. Police protectively escorted hundreds of the fans to
Saint-Charles train station.
	   Monday's melee started after Tunisians waved their red national
flags at drinking English fans outside the stadium. A bottle flew,
and bitter fights erupted. Riot police charged and fired tear gas.
	   ``It was ludicrous, the way the two sides provoked each other,''
said Rob Spence, 29, a London financial specialist with no sympathy
for English hooligans.
	   Several thousand supporters for both teams settled into
bleachers in front of a large screen set up on Prado Beach for
people without game tickets. When England scored its first goal,
the clashes began.
	   Riot police flailing batons swept in to break up the fight, and
the whiff of tear gas reached the stadium a mile (1.5 kms) away.
	   Newspapers on Tuesday blasted both English fans and police. La
Provence said a police union leader criticized authorities for
failing to deploy earlier in more than one instance.
	   ``Where were the police? Nowhere,'' the paper said of one
incident. ``Police eventually took up position. Timidly.''
	   The Paris daily Le Monde reported that nervous police kicked
mistakenly-arrested fans already pinned down. Very few officers
spoke enough English ``to establish a dialogue with non-violent
fans.''
	   A top Marseille mayor's assistant urged Tuesday that the English
team be banned from the championship. ``The World Cup's image ...
requires that the team be disqualified or excluded,'' Renaud
Muselier said in a statement.
	   In Paris, FIFA soccer officials had no plans for that.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding for the 2006 games.
	   Jacques Lambert, the organizing committee's managing director,
said security would be beefed up around English matches.
	   He and Michel Platini, the former French soccer star and now
co-president of the organizing committee, said evidence showed the
Marseille violence had been planned by English hooligans.
	   ``They burned the Tunisian flag,'' Platini said. ``Think how you
would feel if you saw your flag burned in public.''

Trial of Red Army member resumes after 23 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The trial of a member of the Japanese Red Army
resumed Tuesday, 23 years after Japan's government had freed the
defendant to gain the release of hostages seized by the radical
leftist group in Malaysia.
	   Jun Nishikawa, 47, was put on trial in 1975 on charges of
attempted murder. Airplane hijacking charges were added after he
was sent back from Bolivia and arrested in Japan last November.
	   Nishikawa pleaded innocent Tuesday to the new charges of
hijacking a Tokyo-bound Japan Airlines flight in 1977, Kyodo News
reported.
	   Nishikawa is accused of conspiring with four other Red Army
members to hijack the plane over India, forcing it to land at Dhaka
airport.
	   The hijackers flew to Algeria after the Japanese government met
their demand for the release of six prisoners and a dlrs 6 million
ransom.
	   The earlier charges stem from a 1974 raid on the French Embassy
in the Netherlands, where the group held 11 people hostage.
	   Nishikawa's trial had been suspended since August 1975, when he
was released from jail along with four of his comrades in exchange
for 53 hostages taken by the Red Army when it shot its way into the
U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   Following the French Embassy raid, the Red Army members fled to
Syria in a French government-supplied airplane after freeing their
hostages and collecting a dlrs 300,000 ransom.
	   During Tuesday's court hearing, Nishikawa also denied he
intended any killing in the French Embassy raid, Kyodo said.
	   Formed in 1971, the Red Army was a shadowy group that carried
out a number of attacks, including a raid on Tel Aviv airport that
left 24 people dead. In recent years, its leaders have lived
abroad.

World Cup: No time off for Bergkamp as he fights for fitness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ While his Dutch teammates relaxed, Dennis Bergkamp
was hard at work on the training field Tuesday fighting to be fully
fit for the Netherlands' next World Cup first round match.
	   Bergkamp is badly needed in the lineup, with other first-string
striker, Patrick Kluivert, banned on a red card.
	   Before coming on as a second-half substitute in Saturday's
disappointing 0-0 draw with low countries rival Belgium, Bergkamp
had been out of action for six weeks following a hamstring injury.
	   The Dutch want a big win Saturday in Marseille against Group E
minnow South Korea to make up for what they see as two missed
points against Belgium.
	   Given a morning off by coach Guus Hiddink, other players were on
the golf course or tennis court or browsing the chic boutiques of
Monte-Carlo while Bergkamp was sweating it out in training.
	   ``I need it,'' Bergkamp said of sacrificing a free morning in
favor of more hard work. ``But I feel good. It's going well.''
	   Hiddink said he was working on Bergkamp's acceleration _ which
left English defenders floundering in his wake this season as
Bergkamp scored 16 league goals for his club, Arsenal.
	   ``We are working on his explosive bursts,'' Hiddink said.
	   ``He trained yesterday evening behind closed doors, we're going
to have a hard training session this evening and then again
tomorrow.''
	   After losing Kluivert to a two-match ban following his red card
against Belgium, the Dutch are keener than ever to see Bergkamp
back.
	   He now looks a certainty to start the South Korea match, but
Hiddink doesn't yet know if he will finish it.
	   ``We don't know if he can play an hour or one and a half
hours,'' he said. ``But with yesterday, today and tomorrow, we
should have him back with us again.''

Sampras gets tough draw in bid for fifth title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON (AP) _ Defending champion Pete Sampras will play
Dominic Hrbaty in the first round of what shapes up as a difficult
path to a fifth Wimbledon title in six years.
	   Tuesday's draw placed the top-seeded Sampras in the top half of
a draw loaded with dangerous players _ including Yevegeny
Kafelnikov, Petr Korda, Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi.
	   Sampras has had a disappointing year and is coming of a
second-round loss to Mark Woodforde at last week's Wimbledon warmup
tournament at Queen's Club.
	   He opens against Hrbaty, a Slovakian ranked No. 47 in the world.
Hrbaty is no pushover, having led Sampras 4-2 in the fifth set
before losing at the 1997 Australia Open.
	   Sampras could meet fellow American MaliVai Washington, the
Wimbledon runner-up in 1996, in the second round. Talented Swede
Thomas Enqvist could loom in the third round and Australia's Scott
Draper, winner at Queen's, in the fourth.
	   If the seedings hold, Sampras would meet No. 7 Kafelnikov,
winner at Halle, Germany, last week and considered among the title
favorites, in the quarters.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed, or Rafter,
the 1997 U.S. Open champion and No. 4 seed, could face Sampras in
the semis.
	   The top half also includes Agassi, the 1992 champion who is in
the midst of a comeback and is seeded No. 13. Agassi opens against
77th-ranked Spaniard Alex Calatrava, but could meet rising German
star Tommy Haas next and Korda in the fourth round.
	   The bottom half of the draw is much weaker, with No. 2 Marcelo
Rios of Chile and No. 4 Greg Rusedski of Britain the highest seeds.
	   Rios is not considered a grass-court expert, while Rusedski is
questionable for Wimbledon after suffering a severely sprained left
ankle last week.
	   Rios opens against Francisco Clavet and Rusedski faces a
qualifier.
	   The prospective quarterfinals in the bottom half have Rios vs.
France's Cedric Pioline, the 1997 Wimbledon runner-up and No. 8
seed, and Rusedski vs. Carlos Moya of Spain, the French Open
champion and No. 5 seed.
	   The most enticing first round match pits Kafelnikov vs.
Australia's Mark Philippoussis, one of the hardest servers in the
game. The Australian, however, has played poorly in recent months
and even considered withdrawing from Wimbledon.
	   On the women's side, defending champion and top seed Martina
Hingis drew a tricky first rounder against American Lisa Raymond.
No. 2 Lindsay Davenport will play Florencia Labat.
	   Hingis could face No. 3 Jana Novotna, the woman she beat in las
year's final, in the semis. Davenport would meet No. 4 Steffi Graf
in the other semifinal.
	   Seven-time champion Graf, continuing her comeback after a long
injury layoff, opens against Gala Leon Garcia. No. 6 Monica Seles,
in Graf's half of the draw, plays Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo.
	   But the most interesting section of the draw has the Williams
sisters, Venus and Serena, grouped together with fellow teen-age
stars Anna Kournikova and Mirjana Lucic.
	   Venus opens against Jana Nejedly of Canada, while Serena plays
Laura Golarsa.
	   The Williams sisters could meet in the fourth round, but Serena
would first have to get past Lucic in the second round and
Kournikova in the third.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ While government troops and rebels
continued to trade artillery fire Tuesday in the capital of
Guinea-Bissau, the onset of the rainy season increased fears for
the tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in the former
Portuguese colony.
	   Loyalist forces maintained their siege of a military garrison in
a suburb of the capital Bissau where renegade soldiers have been
holed up since June 7.
	   Aid workers reported the two sides were lobbing large-caliber
artillery and mortar shells.
	   ``The shelling is still serious,'' Michael Kleiner of the
International Red Cross said in Geneva.
	   Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was deserted, Kleiner
said.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported more than
150,000 refugees in the area.
	   ``The big problem is the lack of drinking water and food for the
people on the road,'' Kleiner said.
	   Portugal made plans Tuesday to send 30 tons of medical and food
aid. Further evacuations of some 500 foreign residents also were
being prepared, the government said.
	   Heavy rain swept across the country Tuesday, raising fears about
the spread of disease, especially cholera.
	   Refugees walked for days through crocodile-infested mangrove
swamps and jungle to reach the border with Senegal.
	   The deputy chief of the country's armed forces said Tuesday that
his troops, supported by soldiers from Senegal and the Republic of
Guinea, were gaining the upper-hand.
	   ``They're on the retreat,'' Lt. Col. Afonso Te said in an
interview broadcast on Portuguese radio station RDP-Africa.
	   He said the shelling created panic in the city, but said he
could not estimate the number of casualties.
	   ``We're in a war situation. No one knows when this will end,''
he said.
	   Senegalese forces were bolstering their positions around the
garrison, bringing up heavy artillery and machine guns, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The rebels were entrenched at the complex where they reportedly
laid mines and booby traps.
	   Government forces took up positions in several other towns,
apparently to halt any spread of the revolt, Lusa reported.
	   Fires caused by the shelling spread through Bissau on Monday.
The U.S. embassy, evacuated on Sunday, was burned out, and the
European Union representative's residence was destroyed by a shell,
according to Lusa.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva denied
rumors that President Joao Bernardo Vieira had fled the country.
	   ``I spoke to him twice'' on Monday, Delfim da Silva said in an
interview in Lisbon, where he was stuck due to flight
cancellations. Vieira was in Bissau, he said.
	   The rebels have demanded that Vieira step down. They accuse him
of corruption and abuse of power.

Ford plant goes off line due to supplier failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Some 8,000 workers at Ford's German
subsidiary were idled Tuesday because a supplier of door and trunk
locks for its Puma and Fiesta models stopped delivery last week.
	   Ford sent workers home on Monday as well, and spokesman Paul
Schinhofen said that stalled production was costing it about 40
million marks (dlrs 22 million) a day.
	   Ford is considering seeking compensation against the supplier
for the losses, Schinhofen said.
	   A plant in Britain that also produces the Fiesta and Puma models
also was interrupted by the failed delivery. In all, production
lagged by 2,500 cars a day, Schinhofen said.
	   The supplier, Kiekert GmbH, blamed a problem with its production
software.
	   However, sources at Ford told the mass circulation daily, Bild
Zeitung, that they suspect the supplier of putting pressure on the
car maker as both companies are currently renegotiating the terms
of the supply contract.
	   Ford representatives planned a visit to the supplier to see for
themselves what is causing the delays, Schinhofen said.

EU bans fish, mollusk imports from Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission on Tuesday banned the import of fresh fish and certain
mollusks from Turkey due to concerns about hygiene standards, an EU
official said.
	   The Commission banned the import of fish and bivalve mollusks,
which have two shells hinged together such as mussels, clams and
oysters, after EU inspectors found on a recent visit to plants in
Turkey that hygiene standards were inadequate.
	   The EU official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Commission will review the ban before the end of September. The ban
had been expected since EU veterinary officials endorsed it in
mid-May.
	   In 1997, the EU imported about dlrs 22.5 million worth of fresh
or chilled fish and about dlrs 847,000 worth of bivalve mollusks
from Turkey, according to the Commission.
	   In 1996, the EU imported about dlrs 14.3 million worth of fresh
or chilled fish and about dlrs 96,000 worth of bivalve mollusks
from Turkey.

Indonesian currency, stocks fall, minister says high inflation
</HEADLINE>
likely &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's battered currency and
stock prices dropped through important psychological barriers
Tuesday, and a senior Cabinet minister backed predictions that the
inflation rate would hit at least 85 percent by year's end.
	   Indonesia has been hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown and
is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said a
prediction of 85 percent inflation, made by the government's
statistician last week, was ``optimistic.''
	   Annual inflation is currently running at 49 percent.
	   The rupiah has lost more than 80 percent of its value since the
crisis struck last July.
	   On Tuesday, it broke through 15,000 rupiahs against the U.S.
dollar.
	   In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 15,200 rupiahs
compared with Monday's close of 14,550 rupiahs.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's main index closed down 1.7 percent
at 399.512 points, under the 400-point mark.
	   Analysts attribute the sinking currency and stock values to
escalating worries over Indonesia's economic and political
stability.

EU approves acquisition by Arco of Union Texas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission on Tuesday approved Atlantic Richfield Co.'s acquisition
of another U.S. company, Union Texas Petroleum.
	   In a statement, the Commission said the acquisition will not
give Arco a dominant position in the crude oil, natural gas and
petrochemical markets. The Commission can veto mergers or alliances
it judges will hinder fair competition in the 15-nation bloc.
	   Arco agreed last month to buy Union Texas Petroleum, a move that
will sharply expand Arco's oil and gas production and reserves.
	   Arco is active in exploration, production and marketing of crude
oil and natural gas internationally, and also produces
petrochemicals. Union Texas is an oil and gas company with
worldwide operations.
	   Based in Houston, Union Texas had 1997 sales of dlrs 933 million
and assets of dlrs 2 billion. Los Angeles-based Arco reported sales
of dlrs 1.8 billion and assets of dlrs 25.3 billion in 1997.

Singer wants to write song for slain fashion designer

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - British pop singer Elton John says he wants
to put his feelings for slain friend and designer Gianni Versace to
music.
	   Elton told reporters about his latest musical inspiration for
the piano, ``Gianni's favorite instrument,'' during a party Monday
night to inaugurate an exhibition of Versace's fashion.
	   The Italian designer was gunned down outside his Miami Beach
home on July 15. Elton John sang at the memorial service held in
Milan's cathedral the following week.
	   The pop star, long close to the Versace clan, was guest of honor
at the gala event held under a tent on the shores of Lake Como,
near Milan. Earlier he toured the exhibit at Como's Villa Olmo,
arm-in-arm with Versace's sister, Donatella, designer for the
fashion house since her brother's death.
	   The tribute to Versace is still unwritten, but the composer said
he already has a title --``Bitch.'' ``That's how we used to greet
each other on the phone,'' he quipped.

Runaway Russian ship releases South Korean captives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Russian ship that sailed away from
court-ordered custody has returned to its fishing base on Russia's
Far East coast and released two South Korean captives, police said
Tuesday.
	   The 683-ton refrigerator ship Tibiya disappeared last week from
the southeastern port of Pusan, where it had been impounded by a
Korean court in a legal dispute over debt payment.
	   When they fled, the ship's 18-man crew took along the two Korean
guards the court had posted on board to enforce its order.
	   On Sunday, the vessel docked at the Russian port of Magadan and
handed over the two Koreans to Russian authorities, police in Pusan
said. The guards were to return home soon.
	   Also Tuesday, police said they have released Chavshov Alexay,
the ship's Russian owner, who was arrested after the vessel
disappeared.
	   Alexay, 36, was in Pusan to negotiate payment of dlrs 1.5
million his ship owed to a South Korean dry dock company. The
company filed suit in a Pusan court, which impounded the ship when
it docked in the South Korean port in April.
	   Police suspected Alexay of instructing his ship to flee when
debt payment talks broke down. He was arrested at Kimhae airport
near Pusan as he tried to leave South Korea last week.
	   Police said they released the Russian ship owner Monday because
he agreed to pay back the debts and stay in Pusan until the two
Koreans return home.

Tehran mayor accuses court of extracting confessions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran on trial for corruption
sparred with a judge in court Tuesday, accusing him of improper
questioning and giving credence to confessions extracted under
pressure.
	   ``It's not fair that you are interrupting me. Why are you not
allowing me to defend myself?'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi told the
judge in the packed courtroom on the third day of his trial.
	   Judge Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei replied: ``When
your remarks are off the point, I will not allow you to speak.''
	   The judge became visibly irritated when, as in the previous
sessions, Karbaschi adopted a confrontational attitude to the
proceedings.
	   ``I will not allow you to discuss issues with me as you please.
This is a courtroom and you are a defendant here,'' Mohseni Ejaie
said.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested on April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hard-liner, on charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds.
	   He was released on bail on the orders of Iran's spiritual
leader, Ruhollah Khamenei, after Karbaschi's supporters took to the
streets and clashed with security forces.
	   The court case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories about the mayor. The walls of Tehran are covered
with spray-painted graffiti, in equal parts for and against the
mayor. ``Karbaschi must be convicted,'' and ``Karbaschi is the hero
of construction,'' are among the slogans.
	   When the judge asked Karbaschi Tuesday if money had left the
city's coffers without documentation, the mayor said such a
question was improper for a judge.
	   ``I am the judge and, according to the rules of public courts, I
can also interrogate you,'' Mohseni Ejaie replied.
	   At one point the judge quoted incriminating confessions from
former city council employees who had been interrogated in
detention.
	   ``I do not accept anything written while these people were in
prison, under pressure,'' said Karbaschi, implying the confessions
were false.
	   Replied the judge: ``You are making serious accusations against
the court and judiciary by implying the use of pressure against
prisoners.''
	   Karbaschi retorted: ``You are also making serious accusations
against government employees by calling us thieves.''
	   The judge adjourned the case to June 25.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.

Government to launch program to help coal miners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government promised Tuesday to make
sure that all coal miners are paid on time and announced a program
to retrain and resettle those who will lose their jobs as a result
of the closure of inefficient mines.
	   Wage delays running for as long as six months and a lack of
social guarantees to cushion the long-planned shutdown of
unprofitable mines caused a wave of coal miners' strikes last
month. Coal miners blockaded several key railroads, paralyzing
railway traffic throughout Russia.
	   The government managed to persuade the workers to end their
action by paying some of the debts, but coal miners have warned
they would resume the ``war on rails'' if the government fails to
meet the rest of its obligations.
	   Russian Deputy Premier Boris Nemtsov on Tuesday chaired a
meeting to discuss miners' demands. He pledged that the government
will borrow from foreign financial institutions and boost domestic
revenues to pay workers on time.
	   Next month, the government will open personal bank accounts for
miners to help them buy new housing and gain new jobs after their
mines are closed, Nemtsov said, according to Russian news reports.
	   Several dozen coal miners from northern Vorkuta have been
picketing the government headquarters in Moscow since Thursday to
protest the unpaid wages and demand President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation.
	   Vorkuta coal miners' union leader Viktor Semyonov, who is taking
part in the picket, said that the protesters were unimpressed by
the government's promises.
	   ``We hear nothing about their talks,'' he said on Russian
television as shirtless miners around him sat on the pavement near
the government's residence, shouting their protests.

Malaysian prime minister: Banks won't lend money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
railed Tuesday at Malaysia's commercial banks, accusing them of
needlessly seeking to tighten credit conditions when extending new
loans.
	   ``The banks have now decided to tighten the screws (so) that
people can't do business,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``The government didn't ask them to do it,'' he said.
``Apparently they are more interested in themselves than supporting
business. If they don't believe in the economy of this country,
they might as well close their banks.''
	   Mahathir said the banks were demanding that borrowers pay up to
100 percent of performance bonds instead of 10 percent at present.
A performance bond is essentially an instrument given by a bank to
a borrower who is taking on a potentially risky project. If that
project fails, the bank is primarily liable for the collapse of the
project.
	   But if the borrower pays up to 100 percent of the performance
bond, the borrower carries the bulk of the risk.
	   Mahathir's anger was palpable.
	   ``We are having too many problems with banks,'' he said. ``They
won't lend money, they keep their money, they pull back credit
lines, all kinds of things they are doing which are stifling the
economy.
	   ``If the economy goes into contraction, it's the banks that will
also fail,'' he added. ``The banks will have no business and they
will be crying for help from the government.''
	   Mahathir has frequently been at odds with Malaysia's banking
sector in recent weeks. Last week, he urged banks to reduce their
interest-rate spreads, effectively meaning they should lend to
businesses at lower interest rates.
	   Commercial bankers privately say they are wary of extending new
credit because of the danger of picking up more bad debt. Banking
analysts say that if banks narrow their interest-rate spreads, they
will lock in less profit. And that means they will have less cash
with which to provide for potential bad debts.
	   Many private economists believe Malaysia's economy could
contract 3 percent this year, with non-performing loan levels
reaching more than 30 percent by the end of the year.

International charity holds executive meeting in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Executives of the charity organization,
World Vision International, are meeting in Lebanon to remind the
world of the needs of children in a country still recovering from a
devastating civil war.
	   ``Lebanon is the forgotten country,'' organization president
Dean Hirsch said Monday night. ``The forgotten story is that
Lebanon is going to need help. We have a responsibility to be a
voice of the children.''
	   World Vision has contributed dlrs 50 million in Lebanon since
the outbreak the country's civil war in 1975. By the time the war
ended in 1990, 150,000 people had been killed and Lebanon's
infrastructure was devastated. The government has been borrowing
heavily to finance reconstruction projects.
	   The World Vision team, which meets here Tuesday and Wednesday,
will meet with President Elias Hrawi on Thursday.
	   ``We want to reaffirm for the president and the people that we
are here for the long haul,'' said David Jenkin, an Australian who
is World Vision's board chairman.
	   The group's budget for Lebanon dropped from dlrs 5 million in
1997 to dlrs 2 million this year because of a government policy
that does not allow tax exemptions to charitable organizations.
	   The executive meeting in Lebanon is one more confirmation of
international confidence in security and in the country's postwar
recovery.
	   Most international organizations used to operated here with
local staff because of security conditions and a 10-year-old U.S.
ban on travel to Lebanon. The ban was replaced by an advisory in
July 1997 as security improved.

	   Yeltsin and Milosevic met Tuesday morning at the Kremlin,
kicking off a series of negotiations that continued through most of
the day.
	   ``It's necessary that the whole world see what we agreed to, so
that there should be no steps back,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying.
Grim-faced, Yeltsin told reporters that the negotiations were ``not
simple.''
	   After their one-on-one meeting, Yeltsin and Milosevic were
joined by Primakov, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Vyacheslav
Trubnikov, the director of the foreign intelligence service.
	   ``President Boris Yeltsin once again spoke against any options
involving force and in favor of the search of exclusively peaceful
ways of settling the crisis,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin told
reporters at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. ``Unilateral,
provocative steps that could push the sides to escalate the
conflict should be avoided. A stable, long-lasting settlement can
only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian fans can't get no satisfaction.
	   For the second time in two weeks, the Rolling Stones have
canceled a concert in Milan, this time upsetting some 45,000 fans
who had bought tickets for Tuesday's night event.
	   This time the band's leader Mick Jagger got laryngitis. The May
30 date was canceled after Keith Richards broke a rib by falling
off a chair while reaching for a book.
	   ``We were looking forward to playing in Italy and we're very
sorry we're not able to,'' Jagger was quoted as saying in a
statement. ``But we can't start a concert at the risk of suspending
it after two songs.''
	   Organizers said they are trying to re-schedule the concert for
September. Tickets bought for Tuesday's event will be reimbursed.

Israel says Palestinians stealing beehives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Honey, who stole the bees?
	   Israeli beekeepers are in a tizzy over the theft of hundreds of
beehives _ more than 1,600 since the beginning of the year,
according to Roni Hassid, spokesman for the Honey Producers
Council.
	   Boaz Kanot, chairman of the Israel Beekeepers Organization, said
20 of his hives were taken Monday night.
	   Kanot said he suspects Palestinians are entering Israel by night
from the West Bank and making off with the hives, since most of the
thefts have taken place in areas near the border between Israel and
the West Bank.
	   ``They are building their honey industry at the expense of the
Israeli farmer,'' Kanot said Tuesday.
	   A single hive with its bees and full combs of honey easily be
worth a thousand dollars, he said. The hives are easy pickings,
because they are kept far from residential areas where wildflowers
are plentiful and the bees will not be a nuisance to residents.

Tehran mayor accuses court of extracting confessions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor accused a judge of
improper questioning and giving credence to confessions extracted
under pressure on Tuesday, the third day of his trial on
allegations of corruption.
	   ``It's not fair that you are interrupting me. Why are you not
allowing me to defend myself?'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi asked the
judge in the packed courtroom.
	   ``When your remarks are off the point, I will not allow you to
speak,'' replied Judge Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei,
who became visibly irritated when, as in the previous sessions,
Karbaschi adopted a confrontational attitude. ``I will not allow
you to discuss issues with me as you please. This is a courtroom,
and you are a defendant here.''
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hard-liner, on charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds. He was released on bail on the
orders of Iran's spiritual leader, Ruhollah Khamenei, after
Karbaschi's supporters took to the streets and clashed with
security forces.
	   The case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories about the mayor, who has been restricted by his
duties during the trial. The walls of Tehran are covered with
spray-painted graffiti for and against the mayor. ``Karbaschi must
be convicted,'' and ``Karbaschi is the hero of construction,'' are
among the slogans.
	   When the judge asked Karbaschi on Tuesday if money left the
city's coffers without documentation, the mayor said such a
question was improper for a judge.
	   ``I am the judge and, according to the rules of public courts, I
can also interrogate you,'' replied, Mohseni Ejaie, who at one
point, quoted incriminating confessions from former city council
employees interrogated in detention.
	   ``I do not accept anything written while these people were in
prison, under pressure,'' said Karbaschi, implying the confessions
were false.
	   ``You are making serious accusations against the court and
judiciary by implying the use of pressure against prisoners,'' the
judge said.
	   ``You are also making serious accusations against government
employees by calling us thieves,'' Karbaschi retorted.
	   The judge adjourned the case until June 25.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.

Kremlin and Moscow sign power-sharing agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The president of Russia and the mayor of Moscow
signed an agreement Tuesday to divide powers and responsibilities
over the capital city.
	   President Boris Yeltsin praised the city and its scrappy mayor,
Yuri Luzhkov, who is widely seen as something of a political rival
to Yeltsin and a likely presidential candidate in 2000.
	   The agreement delineates ``who is doing what, what is the
responsibility of the Russian government and what is (the
responsibility) of the mayor and the Moscow city government,''
Yeltsin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   However, both the presidential administration and the city
government declined to provide details when contacted by The
Associated Press.
	   Yeltsin said that in addition to giving Moscow ``a great deal of
rights,'' the agreement also includes ``quite a few
responsibilities,'' Interfax said.
	   Luzhkov is widely praised for a reconstruction campaign that
turned a somewhat dour communist city into a shiny, even racy,
modern business center.
	   He has lobbied for _ and won _ exceptions to some federal laws
for the capital city. For instance, Moscow still requires residence
permits, and will be exempted from some aspects of a housing reform
package that will raise living expenses around the country.
	   Luzhkov has previously complained that Moscow deserves higher
subsidies for the extra costs of supporting the federal government.

Deutsche Bank probed on suspicion of helping customers evade taxes

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Tax investigators are searching
offices of Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, for evidence that
employees helped customers evade taxes by hiding holdings in
foreign banks.
	   Some 300 investigators showed up unannounced at branches in
Frankfurt, Duesseldorf, Kassel and Freiburg on Monday to sift
through documents in an investigation that could take weeks,
Frankfurt prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   Prosecutors also have investigated two other major German banks
in the last two years to crack down on similar evasion that tax
officials have estimated is worth up to 20 billion marks (dlrs 11
billion) a year.
	   Deutsche Bank employees are suspected of helping clients hide
assets in banks in Luxembourg and Switzerland to avoid a
withholding tax on interest income that began in Germany in 1992,
said Job Tilmann, a spokesman for Frankfurt prosecutors.
	   Transferring money abroad is illegal when the interest income
isn't declared.
	   Prosecutors also will pursue any customers suspected of avoiding
taxes, Tilmann said.
	   Deutsche Bank spokesman Detlev Rahmsdorf said the is no
institutional policy to help customers evade taxes, and that the
bank was cooperating with the investigation to the extent required
under law.
	   Rahmsdorf noted that customers, not banks, are obligated to
declare interest income.
	   The German financial news service VWD quoted bank board member
Michael Endres as saying Tuesday that the bank maintains there is
``absolutely no grounds'' for the tax evasion investigation.
	   ``There were less grounds for suspicion at Deutsche Bank than at
any other of Germany's banks,'' Endres said.
	   Customers convicted of avoiding taxes face up to 5 years in
prison. There are no sentencing guidelines for employees convicted
of helping avoid taxes, Tilmann said, adding that their sentences
would be lighter than for customers.
	   Prosecutors already have uncovered hundreds of cases of tax
avoidance by customers of Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, Tilmann
said. Dresdner officials also have been investigated for evading
taxes themselves, prompting three top bank executives to resign
last year.

World Cup: Defense is bedrock of French strategy for Saudis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The Saudis be warned. Lost in all
the glory of France's newfound offensive prowess is the reliability
of its defenders.
	   And the defensive axis of Marcel Desailly and Laurent Blanc,
with Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu on the wings, don't mind
passing their time in the shadow of Zinedine Zidane and the forward
line.
	   Desailly started giggling long and loud Tuesday when he was
pressed to explain the ``super defense,'' the ``super Desailly'' of
France's 3-0 opening win over South Africa.
	   ``Don't compliment the defense too much. It's those guys up
front that make the difference,'' he said ahead of Thursday's match
against Saudi Arabia at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.
	   France leads Group C on goal difference ahead of Denmark, which
beat the Saudis 1-0. So the underdogs will be playing a do-or-die
game Thursday, needing a win to keep their chances of reaching the
second round alive.
	   Which means they will have to get past that vaunted defense.
	   For years now, France's power has been built on the back line
and its game was successful but dour.
	   In their search for a more adventurous style, coach Aime Jacquet
has stressed offense, and so far, defense has not been hurt, apart
from a brief fling with the three-man defense. France absorbed
three goals from Norway in an exhibition game and things quickly
went back to the old formation.
	   Against South Africa, the four-man defense manhandled the
opposition and yielded not a single chance.
	   ``We know we're solid behind, but accidents happen easily,''
said Desailly. And nobody wants to be fooled by Saudi Arabia's
disappointing performance against Denmark.
	   Known as the Brazilians from the desert, the Saudis have the
skills to turn things around in a second.
	   Four years ago, facing elimination, they stunned Belgium 1-0 and
reached the second round of the World Cup for the first time.
	   France now wants to deny them a similar comeback.
	   ``They'll rely on sudden speed and skills, so we have to respect
them,'' said Desailly.
	   ``There is no zero-risk game at the World Cup anymore,'' said
Lizarazu.
	   A second win for France will leave it with a healthy cushion for
the final first-round game against Denmark. It already has a
two-goal edge over Denmark in the goal difference category and with
a bit of luck, France could find itself only needing a draw to win
the group.
	   ``Three points will leave us in a great position,'' said
Lizarazu.

Government announces controversial draft press law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government referred to Parliament on
Tuesday a draft press and publications law that has been widely
criticized as restricting press freedoms.
	   The draft stipulates a 10-fold hike in the paid up capital of
daily newspapers from 50,000 Jordanian dinars to 500,000 dinars
(dlrs 702,000) and 15,000 dinars to 150,000 (dlrs 211,000) for
other publications.
	   It forces local media institutions to deposit with the
government cash guarantees of up to 100,000 dinars (dlrs 140,000)
from which fines can be deducted in case of violations.
	   If approved, the bill will replace a 1993 press law that had
been hailed as a reflection of public freedoms enjoyed under a
democratization process launched in 1989 after decades of martial
law.
	   The draft is likely to be passed in the 80-member Parliament,
dominated by pro-government legislators. A debate is expected later
this month. No date has been set for the voting.
	   ``It is against freedom of expression not only for journalists
but for all,'' said Abdullah Hasanat, chief editor of Jordan's only
English language daily, The Jordan Times.
	   But acting Prime Minister Abdullah Nsour said the new law will
``provide a higher ceiling of liberties in the field of media, but
at the same time create a more responsible journalism.''
	   The government says the 1993 law had led to a freewheeling media
that violated the ethics of professional journalism.
	   King Hussein has been specifically critical of Jordan's 22
tabloids, many of them affiliated with Muslim fundamentalist and
leftist groups opposed to his pro-Western outlook and the 1994
Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   Officials also say the tabloids crossed the red lines by
criticizing the leaders of conservative Gulf Arab states, who have
donated tens of millions of dollars over the years to keep the
economy of resource-barren Jordan afloat.
	   Jordanian newspapers published the 60-point draft law, which was
kept secret during two months of government debate. Information
ministry officials confirmed its authenticity.
	   On the foreign media, the draft stipulates that only Jordanians
can be chief editors of local bureaus. They will be responsible for
any violations leading to hefty fines and suspension of the
correspondent's credentials or his office's registration.
	   Local and foreign journalists are banned from publishing
information on investigations or trials taking place in Jordan.
	   The draft maintains controversial clauses from the previous law,
including a ban on coverage considered disparaging to the royal
family, the armed forces, head of states or violating vaguely
defined provisions related to the state's security and financial
stability.
	   It also maintains government censorship on foreign newspapers
and the right to close down local newspapers for violations. It
forces foreign and local correspondents to divulge their sources in
court.
	   But the draft bill revokes prison punishment for journalists and
for the first time stresses observance to copyright.

	   KANDLA, India (AP) _ There were no salt workers left in the
western Indian port of Kandla on Tuesday, a week after a deadly
cyclone swept through, killing hundreds of laborers and prompting
others to flee to nearby villages. Thousands remained missing.
	   ``The numbers are mind-boggling,'' said Oxfam worker Rajni
Khanna. ``At least 10,000 and up to 14,000 (people) have
disappeared without a trace.''
	   The number of people missing and feared dead as estimated by
Oxfam and other relief agencies was much higher than the 1,320
listed by the government Tuesday. But the government acknowledges
unregistered migrant workers also disappeared. An accurate death
toll may never be known.
	   The official death toll by Tuesday was 1,063 in Gujarat, the
hardest-hit state where Kandla is located, 530 kilometers (330
miles) northwest of Bombay. Another nine people were reported
killed in the neighboring state of Rajastan, and 12 were reported
dead across the border in Pakistan.
	   Oxfam based its estimate of the missing on reports from local
aid agencies whose workers visited about 100 area villages.
	   Mirai Chatterjee, secretary-general of the Self-Employed Women's
Association, a Gujarati development group, sent workers to another
150 villages to count survivors.
	   In many cases, they found only one person living in a family of
10 or more. Like Oxfam, Chatterjee estimated at least 10,000 people
were swept into the sea or remained buried in the debris.
	   Salt worker Bhupat Dhinga, interviewed in his village of Bachao,
45 kilometers (30 miles) from Kandla, said he lost eight relatives,
including a young son. He searched for three days in hospitals and
cremation grounds where mass pyres were lit, but found none of
their bodies.
	   The smell of death hung over Kandla port, where an unknown
number of bodies were believed to be buried under several beached
barges. The cyclone produced an 18-foot (5.4-meter) tidal wave that
crashed ships into shore, twisted jetties and wiped out salt
worker's mud huts.
	   The bulk of the missing were believed to be salt workers, men,
women and children who collected sea water in shallow pools and,
once the water had evaporated, scraped the salt into mounds.
	   Whole families worked for salt contractors. But usually only a
few adults were on the official payroll, earning 15 rupees (about
37 U.S. cents) each a day.
	   Foreman Parmar Singh said 450 workers were employed by Kandla's
Kutch Salt Co., and 300 of those died. Workers said 1,200 salt
workers unofficially labored for Kutch.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul blessed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who came to the Vatican for a brief
audience and thanked the pontiff for his pontiff Tuesday.
	   ``God bless you!'' declared the pope as the end of the 20-minute
private session.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Annan briefed the
pope about the U.N. conference that began this week in Rome as part
of efforts to start a permanent international tribunal to deal with
crimes against humanity and other war crimes.
	   Annan, said the spokesman, thanked the pope for his support for
the efforts.
	   The two men also discussed current events in Europe, Africa and
the Middle East, Navarro-Valls said.
	   Earlier this year, the pope praised Annan for his mission in
Baghdad to avert an attack on Iraq over the issue of arms
inspections.

Milosevic agrees to negotiate with moderate Kosovo Albanian leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
Tuesday to resume negotiations with a moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader, Russia's foreign minister said after a three-hour Kremlin
meeting.
	   Milosevic said he would meet with Ibrahim Rugova, a political
leader of Kosovo's Albanians, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said. Milosevic and Rugova met in May, but the Albanians canceled
further talks until Serbian government troops halted a reported
offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Rugova has lately been losing support to the more militant
separatists in the troubled province, whose uprising Milosevic has
tried to crush.
	   Milosevic also agreed to ``a whole series of very important
obligations,'' according to Sergei Prikhodko, a foreign policy
advisor to President Boris Yeltsin. However, he did not spell them
out.
	   The talks were to conclude with the adoption of a joint
declaration by the Russian and Yugoslav presidents, Prikhodko said.
	   Yeltsin and Milosevic met Tuesday morning at the Kremlin,
kicking off a series of negotiations that continued through most of
the day.
	   ``It's necessary that the whole world see what we agreed to, so
that there should be no steps back,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying.
Grim-faced, Yeltsin told reporters that the negotiations were ``not
simple.''
	   After their one-on-one meeting, Yeltsin and Milosevic were
joined by Primakov, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Vyacheslav
Trubnikov, the director of the foreign intelligence service.
	   ``President Boris Yeltsin once again spoke against any options
involving force and in favor of the search for exclusively peaceful
ways of settling the crisis,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   Rugova has sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, although
his goal _ independence for Kosovo _ remains the same as that of
the more militant separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin told
reporters at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. ``Unilateral,
provocative steps that could push the sides to escalate the
conflict should be avoided. A stable, long-lasting settlement can
only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Tuesday, security officials
said.
	   They said two Israeli jets fired four air-to-surface missiles on
hills near the deserted village of Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in southern Lebanon.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the stricken area, but there
was no immediate word on casualties from the 3:30 p.m (1230 GMT)
air strike, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is a frequent target of
Israeli warplanes.
	   The area is used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese
militiamen from the border enclave, which Israel set up in 1985.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted
Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a decision on a West Bank
troop withdrawal, despite pressure to accept a U.S. proposal.
	   Netanyahu reportedly is furious with his defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, for pushing him to reach a decision soon.
	   ``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' Netanyahu told
Israel Army Radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   Netanyahu suggested that a deal on a withdrawal, once reached,
might be the last agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians
for a long time, although a final Israel-Palestinian peace
settlement is supposed to be negotiated by next May.
	   ``We don't know if a permanent settlement will be achieved,''
Netanyhau said on Israel's Army Radio. ``Perhaps it will, and we
are striving for it.''
	   But Netanyahu said that if the Palestinians insist on the right
of return for Palestinian refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars and
on the division of Jerusalem, ``There will be no agreement.''
	   ``Therefore it is possible that we will have to live for some
time, perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that
agreement.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking a quick
decision by Netanyahu on a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank. The withdrawal would be
the second of three to which Israel has committed itself.
	   The U.S. plan was first introduced in January, and has been
accepted by the Palestinians. Informal U.S. deadlines for an
Israeli decision have passed without the Clinton administration
taking any action against Israel.
	   The United States has criticized Israel, however, for going
ahead with expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
demolishing Palestinian houses while the peace process is at an
impasse.
	   On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
demolitions sent the ``wrong signals,'' at a time when the Mideast
peace process is so fragile.
	   Israel bulldozed three houses in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem on Monday, and demolished two more Tuesday morning.
Israel says the houses were built illegally.
	   The Palestinians say Israel has significantly stepped up its
campaign of house demolitions in the city's contested eastern
sector in recent months.

Bank of Japan chief urges speedy solution to bad debt problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with central bank governor saying bad debt problem is
major cause of yen, stock weakness &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of Japan's central bank urged commercial
banks Tuesday to quickly resolve their bad debt problems, saying
these have become a major cause for the weakness of the nation's
currency and stocks.
	   But Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami also said that the
``weak yen is not the cause for the recent weakness of Asian
currencies.'' He said the basic strength of the U.S. dollar is
causing the simultaneous fall in the yen and other Asian
currencies.
	   In a regular news conference, Hayami said Japan is suffering
from rapid deterioration in employment and incomes, contributing to
a shrinkage in industrial output.
	   But, he added, ``Japan's economy isn't currently in a
deflationary spiral where falling prices are depressing corporate
earnings and further undermining the overall economy.''
	   The assessment came just days after the government announced
that Japan has slipped into recession for the third time this
decade and suffered its worst annual economic contraction since the
end of World War II.
	   Hayami said a quick and decisive resolution of the bad debt
problem, stemming from unrestrained lending during Japan's late
1980s speculative ``bubble,'' was vital to restore confidence in
the nation's economy and financial system.
	   Bad debts and the overall economic sluggishness were feeding off
each other to undermine growth, he said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, in its monthly review of the economy, the Bank
of Japan said small- and medium-size companies were still being
squeezed by the reluctance of private banks to lend money to any
but the most solid of Japanese corporations.
	   The central bank also said Japan's ability to export its way out
of economic difficulty has peaked as slumping Asian economies
purchase fewer Japanese goods.
	   Strong overseas sales have long been the sole factor supporting
Japan's otherwise moribund economy _ and Asia is Japan's largest
export market.
	   Although exports to the United States and Europe continue to
rise, ``recovery in net exports is likely to be modest in the near
term,'' the bank said.
	   The central bank report contained other bad news:
	   _Corporate investment has continued to fall as capital goods
shipments and orders for machinery and construction slump.
	   _Domestic consumption shows no signs of recovering.
	   _Prices continue to weaken.
	   Downward pressure on prices could turn out to be particularly
worrisome for Japan as many analysts predict the country's economic
woes and Asia's financial crisis will send it into a deflationary
spiral.
	   In such a situation, falling prices would cut into corporate
profits, which would put pressure on companies to cut jobs and
wages. That would further dampen already weak consumer confidence,
which has been the main factor behind Japan's stubborn economic
slump.
	   The bank warned that the government's recently announced 16.65
trillion yen (dlrs 116 billion) economic package will help boost
consumption only if the income and employment situation brighten.
	   Meanwhile, for the first time in weeks, a slew of senior
government officials made strong comments aimed at stopping the
dramatic slide of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
	   The head of the Economic Planning Agency, Koji Omi, said: ``An
excessively weak yen is undesirable for both the Japanese and world
economy.''
	   Omi said he believes the government will take action to bolster
the yen. But he didn't comment on when, or what that action might
be.

Gunmen kill three people in southern port city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen killed two members of a
government anti-corruption committee and a member of Pakistan's
right-wing religious party in separate incidents Tuesday in the
southern port city of Karachi, police officers said.
	   Mohammed Ali and Mohammed Shazad were on their way to work in a
taxi when two gunmen on a motorcycle attacked their vehicle. Two
others in the vehicle were seriously wounded, police said.
	   In Karachi's poor eastern district, Jamaat-e-Islami, 60, was
shot by four gunmen when he stepped out of his house.
	   No one took responsibility for either killings, but police
officials said they didn't believe the two were linked.
	   Several months ago, the government established anti-corruption
committees throughout the country to root out corruption and
inefficiency, particularly within the government.
	   Opposition parties have been highly critical of these
committees, accusing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of using them to
consolidate his hold over the bureaucracy and root out bureaucrats
loyal to previous regimes.

World Cup: Croatia turn up the heat for Japan game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France _ They took the waters at the spa to relax after
defeating Jamaica. Now Croatia's stars are gearing up for a crucial
game against the ``very dangerous'' Japanese.
	   Relief about Croatia's 3-1 debut victory against a World Cup
minnow gave way to calculated caution about the next opponent
Tuesday as Zvonimir Boban, Davor Suker and their teammates resumed
training.
	   ``The Japanese are great athletes and they fight 100 percent,''
coach Miroslav Blazevic said. ``We will have a total mobilization
for victory.''
	   Part of the task is tightening the Croatian defense, which
allowed Jamaica's Robbie Earle to tie Sunday's game at 1-1 just
before halftime with a fairly unchallenged header.
	   ``We will correct some defensive positioning during practice,''
Blazevic said. ``That goal was avoidable.''
	   Croatia, which has the potential to advance far at its first
World Cup, could virtually wrap up its second-round berth with a
win over Japan. One motivation is a reported 100,000 German mark
(dlrs 55,000) bonus for each player if they reach the knockout
stage.
	   Croatia's advantages in Saturday's game against Japan include
taller players, most of them playing in Europe's top professional
leagues. But Japan proved its determination in its narrow 1-0 loss
to Argentina, one of the co-favorites, in their opening match.
	   Croatian assistant coach Ivor Susak attended the game in
Toulouse. He said he was mainly impressed with Japan's disciplined
tactics and physical condition as well as team star Hidetoshi
Nakata.
	   ``They have all the signs of a very dangerous team,'' he said.
	   Japan beat Croatia 4-3 in the Kirin Cup last year, but the
Croatians were missing key players.
	   Against Jamaica, the European stars warmed up their scoring
instinct.
	   Robert Prosinecki, who played for Yugoslavia in the 1990 cup
before Croatia won its independence in war, notched a classy goal
from a tight angle to become the first player to score for two
teams at the World Cup.
	   Suker put the match beyond reach with the third goal and said
afterwards he was hungry for more.
	   He and the teammates who played Sunday night unwound on Monday
at the baths in this eastern French spa town where the team has its
World Cup headquarters.
	   Blazevic's main worry is keeping Mario Stanic fit. The AC Parma
midfielder knocked in Croatia's first tally against Jamaica and
later took a hit on his right shin that was still swollen Tuesday,
forcing him to pause with practice.
	   But Blazevic said he expects he won't have to change his lineup
for the game against Japan.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, security
officials said.
	   They said two Israeli jets fired four air-to-surface missiles on
hills near the deserted village of Sojod in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in southern Lebanon.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the stricken area, but there
was no immediate word on casualties from the 3:30 p.m (1230 GMT)
air strike, said the Lebanese officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is a frequent target of
Israeli warplanes.
	   The area is used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese
militiamen from the border enclave, which Israel set up in 1985.

Tunisian opposition leader on hunger strike hospitalized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The leader of Tunisia's main opposition
party was hospitalized Tuesday, nearly two weeks after he began a
hunger strike to demand an end to his house arrest and harassment
of his family, his son said.
	   Mohamed Mouadda, president of the Movement of Socialist
Democrats, began the strike June 3 in the Tunisian capital of Tunis
after the government accused him of undermining state security and
conspiring to assassinate unnamed political figures.
	   Mouadda was taken to Menzeh hospital in Tunis after his health
deteriorated because of complications caused by the prolonged
fasting, his son, Tareq, said in a written statement.
	   He is in serious condition because he was suffering from other
health problems, Tareq Mouadda said in the statement faxed to the
Associated Press in Cairo.
	   A telephone operator at the hospital refused to give any
information on Mouadda, saying the doctor is not available.
	   Mouadda was sentenced to 11 years in prison in February 1996,
then given a conditional pardon in December and placed under house
arrest.
	   Mouadda's conviction for sharing ``intelligence with a foreign
state'' has largely been viewed by human rights groups as an effort
to discredit him.
	   Tareq Mouadda, who lives in Morocco, said the telephone in his
father's house was disconnected and friends have been forbidden
from visiting the opposition leader.
	   Human rights organizations have condemned Tunisia for what they
say is a systematic harassment of human rights activists and have
called for an end to practices that impinge on basic freedoms.
	   They say harassment, denial of passports and arbitrary arrests
are common in Tunisia.

	   The lowest jobless rate in April 1998 was in Luxembourg, which
posted a 2.3 percent unemployment rate. Spain registered the
highest rate, with 18.9 percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following April 1998 jobless rates with April
1997 rates in brackets:
	   Luxembourg, 2.2 percent (2.6); Austria, 4.4 (4.3); Denmark, 4.7

U.N. seeks dlrs 6.5 million to feed Cambodian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. World Food Program appealed Tuesday for
dlrs 6.5 million to provide emergency food aid to tens of thousands
of Cambodian refugees who have fled to Thailand.
	   Refugees in four camps in Thailand's eastern Surin, Sisaket and
Trat provinces would benefit from the aid, WFP said in a statement.
It put the number of refugees at around 90,000.
	   The provision of almost 15,000 tons of food includes ``a
contingency for some 10,000 refugees who may cross into Thailand in
the coming weeks,'' WFP added.
	   Basic daily rations will be provided to each refugee for 12
months starting July 1 under the plan. WFP's existing emergency
operation has been under way since last October.
	   Although some Cambodians have accepted voluntary repatriation,
more than 16,000 new refugees arrived in Thailand from northern
Cambodia's Siem Reap province last month, WFP said.
	   Nearly 200,000 refugees have fled fighting in Myanmar, Cambodia
and Laos for neighboring Thailand during the last several years.
	   A Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman last week said Thailand's
economic crisis has hampered its ability to help refugees flooding
in from its neighbors.

Asia in `deep depression' until at least 1999, World Bank official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise reference to depression in Asia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ East Asia is in a deep recession
from which it is unlikely to emerge until the eve of the new
century, a senior World Bank official warned Tuesday.
	   ``We have one crisis behind us and we have entered a period of
deep and probably long-lasting depression (in East Asia),'' said
Jean-Michel Severino, the bank's vice president for East Asia and
the Pacific.
	   ``Growth rates for the region in 1998 will be in the range of
minus 2 to minus 15 percent and the prospects for 1999 are gloomy
as well.''
	   Speaking at the Australia Summit, a conference of Asian business
and economic leaders, Severino said now was a critical time for the
management of the Asian economic crisis, with the outcome
delicately balanced.
	   Japan was a critical factor for any economic recovery in Asia,
and it will be up to the Group of Seven leading industrialized
nations to stabilize the tumbling Japanese yen, he said.
	   ``I think it's in this group (G-7) that the key solutions are
lying,'' Severino said of an international stabilization plan for
the yen.
	   But the Japanese government must also present a ``consistent and
coherent'' approach to solving its own problems if any
international stabilization plan is to work.
	   The crisis had cost the five countries most affected _ Thailand,
the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea _ an amount
equivalent to around 80 percent of their gross domestic product
through the withdrawal of credits and capital outflows, Severino
said.
	   Additionally, the collapse of regional stock exchanges and
massive drops in exchange rates had had an enormous impact on
individual wealth.
	   Perhaps the most disturbing aspect was that depression was
occurring in virtually all of the region at the same time.
	   ``The depression is being exported from one country to the other
and everybody is going down at the same time,'' he said.
	   ``Regional trade, which makes up 50 percent of the total exports
of the region, has halved since last year.
	   ``Finding a way to bring the whole region up at the same time is
probably the most critical question we have to ask ourselves,'' he
added.
	   Also at the summit, Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai
Panitchpakdi, warned of dire worldwide consequences if the Japanese
currency could not be stabilized.
	   ``If the yen dropped with no bottom, a second Asian crisis would
take place,'' Supachai told reporters. ``That in turn could lead to
a world recession.
	   ``The whole world should pay more attention to the Japanese
problem.''

World Cup: Cha Bum-kun says his players to be more aggressive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ Despite the fact his team received
the first red card of the 1998 World Cup tournament, South Korea's
coach Cha Bum-kun feels his players are just too gentle.
	   ``The South Korean players are not aggressive enough,'' said
Cha, following his team's training session on Tuesday. ``They are
too gentle. They need to attack more, be more offensive, maybe hold
their opponents, drag them, they need to be tougher.
	   ``Belgium and Holland are not docile teams. They are very
aggressive and we need to be prepared for that.''
	   After having lost its opening round match 3-1 to Mexico on
Saturday, South Korea needs unlikely wins over the mighty
Netherlands and troublesome Belgium.
	   With his team lacking the technical skills of the Netherlands,
Cha said a more physical style of play is probably the only answer
for South Korea.
	   ``If you aren't good enough with technical skills, you may as
well try being aggressive,'' said Cha, who played for South Korea
in the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico. ``When you play aggressive,
your mentality becomes aggressive and you gain confidence.''
	   ``This is important for us, especially in our upcoming match
with the Netherlands, whom everyone knows is technically much more
skilled than South Korea,'' he said.
	   ``If we have no confidence, chances of a good result are
unlikely.''
	   Cha, who disagreed with the red card handed Ha Seok-ju for
back-tackling Mexican Ramon Ramirez during Saturday's match,
explained to his players that different referees see events in
different ways.
	   ``Refereeing is not objective but rather subjective,'' said Cha.
``That doesn't mean unfair, it just means two referees may not see
the same incident the same way.''
	   And not all referees are as rigid, Cha reminded his squad.
	   ``We have to see how the referees react, how strict they are,''
said Cha. ``Not all of them are as strict. Players need to see how
far they can push.
	   ``Yesterday the American players got away with a lot against
Germany, grabbing, pushing, not obvious fouls, but attacking
behavior.''
	   Cha expressed concern that Ha's red card might further inhibit
his team.
	   ``That should not worry the players,'' said Cha. ``After a team
gets a red card, many players tend to be a bit squeemish, too
cautious.''
	   The South Korean coach has watched most of the matches since the
start of France 98.
	   ``My players are the least rough, yet it was one of mine that
was disciplined and is suspended for a match,'' said Cha, who spent
10 years in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfort
between 1979 and 1989, winning the UEFA Cup with both teams.
``There is a lesson in there for certain.
	   ``You'll eventually get the whistle for whatever reason,''
concluded Cha. ``So we may as well take our chances.''

Singapore official acknowledges lower growth

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chief economist at Singapore's de facto
central bank said Tuesday the economy will grow about 2.5 percent
this year, rejecting for now recession predictions by several
international investment houses.
	   But if conditions worsen, ``it's not unfair to think that
Singapore's economy may dip into the negative,'' said Khor Hoe Ee,
economics department director for the Monetary Authority of
Singapore.
	   He also acknowledged, for the first time, that the economy has
contracted in the second quarter, compared to the first three
months of the year.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index continued its
two-week plunge, losing another .3 percent and edging within 5
points of the Jan. 6, 1996, low of 1,043.34. As the index has
dropped steadily almost every day, its Tuesday closing level of
1,048.96 was not expected to hold Wednesday.
	   Khor's 2.5 percent prediction is still within the official
government range of 2.5-4.5 percent growth for the year. The
government said recently it would revise that estimate later this
month, after receiving May's financial results.
	   Khor told the Institute of Southeast Asia Studies he expects
very low second- and third-quarter growth and that the government
should finish its review of the gross domestic product forecast
within two weeks.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the government announced Parliament would sit
June 29, and Singapore ministers have often used parliamentary
sessions to discuss the economy.
	   In Australia, Singapore's minister of trade and industry, Lee
Yock Suan, said he did not expect recession this year. The economy
is small enough for the government to keep a technical recession
from showing up on paper, some economists have said.
	   In his last appearance before Parliament, Finance Minister
Richard Hu reminded the house of the technical definition of a
recession, two consecutive quarters of contraction.

IMF sending special mission to Russia next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with IMF confirming that team arriving next
week, finance ministry confirming aid talks in Washington. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is sending a team
to Moscow next week to discuss new loans to help Russia stabilize
its shaky financial markets, government and IMF officials confirmed
Tuesday.
	   The IMF's chief representative in Russia, Martin Gilman, said an
``extensive dialogue'' is planned when the team arrives Monday, but
refused to say what kind of assistance may be offered.
	   Some officials and market analysts hope the IMF will provide a
bailout package, even though the fund and Russian government
officials have said repeatedly that the country is capable of
overcoming the crisis on its own.
	   The market collapse late last month prompted fears of a
devaluation of the national currency, the ruble, which would lead
to a sharp rise in prices. Russian officials worry that inflation,
combined with the government's continuing inability to pay state
workers their wages on time, could lead to social unrest.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin as saying Russia had still not officially requested funds
beyond its current dlrs 10 billion lending program.
	   However, Vyugin confirmed that his trip to meet the IMF's top
officials in Washington, D.C., last week was aimed at securing
additional assistance to Russia.
	   ``It was these preliminary negotiations that I was involved in
last week in Washington,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Russian markets tumbled for the seventh straight day Monday, and
were weakening again Tuesday. Top government officials have warned
that the country faces a ``heated autumn'' unless it can resolve
its financial crisis.
	   Stock prices plunged 7.3 percent on Monday, with the Russian
Trading System Index closing at 165.11, down from 178.13 Thursday
before a long holiday weekend.
	   Vyugin said the Russian government is aware that the IMF will
impose stringent conditions for additional aid.
	   The IMF has been pressing the government to boost tax
collections and rein in spending.
	   ``We do ourselves understand that the time for decisive and
tough measures has come, particularly in the sphere of budget
revenues,'' Vyugin said, according to Interfax.
	   A group of Russia's most powerful business leaders, commonly
called the ``oligarchs'' planned to meet late Tuesday to discuss
the financial crisis, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Foreigners face property shortage in Yangon: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's capital, Yangon, is the only
emerging property market in Asia with a shortage of supply for
foreign businesses, an international real estate developer said
Tuesday.
	   Other regional cities attracting foreign investors, such as
Beijing and Shanghai in China and Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi in
Vietnam, are suffering from oversupply, said Jones Lang Wootton.
	   Office, residential and industrial space in the capital of
Myanmar _ also called Burma _ are all in short supply, said a
summary of the company's new report on Yangon's property market.
	   Because of a lack of quality office space, many of the estimated
900 foreign companies operating in Yangon have taken space in
houses along main streets that suffer from blackouts, bad phone
lines and inefficient use of space, it said.
	   Little new office space is expected to enter the market in the
next two years, in part because Asia's economic crisis has forced
cancellation or delay of some planned projects.
	   The tight residential market for foreigners is expected to ease,
with four apartment projects with 633 units scheduled to open this
year, it said. At the same time, there has been an outflow of
foreigners from regional companies.
	   Three foreign companies _ from Japan, Singapore and Thailand _
have formed joint ventures with the Myanmar government to develop
industrial estates. But more development is needed for future
needs, said Jones Lang Wootton.

Bosnian Serb parliament deposes hardline speaker and deputy,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Kalinic, CORRECTS that one deputy
sacked, non-Serb envisaged for that post. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Pro-Western supporters in
the Serb half of Bosnia deposed the hard-line parliament speaker
and one of his deputies early Tuesday in a move expected to make
the Serb republic more open to non-Serbs.
	   The parliament acted on a letter from the top international
official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who in late May asked
deputies to fulfill a promise made in January to choose one of 18
Muslim or Croat deputies as one of three deputy speakers in the
83-member parliament.
	   Deputies living in the half of Bosnia that is a Muslim-Croat
Federation won seats in last November's parliamentary elections on
votes from the hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs driven out of
what is now the Serb Republic during the 1992-5 war.
	   The move to elect a Muslim or Croat as deputy speaker was
continuously blocked by hard-line legislators loyal to wartime
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who is wanted by the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   A Karadzic loyalist, Dragan Kalinic and his deputy Nikola
Poplasen from the ultranationalist Radical Party were deposed by a
vote of 43-35 in the early hours Tuesday.
	   Kalinic denounced his foes as showing ``their true colors of
servility to outside masters.''
	   The differences between Karadzic's camp and supporters of
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who last year turned
against Karadzic and supported the West's course in Bosnia, are now
``huge and irrevocable,'' Kalinic said.
	   Later Tuesday, the hard-line Serb Democratic Party refused to
propose a replacement for Kalinic, although the party as the
largest in parliament has the right to nominate the speaker.
	   ``It would be the utmost hypocrisy'' to name a candidate, said
Kalinic, adding that no one in his party wants to be a figurehead
for a parliament run by others.

Men face wide open Wimbledon; Hingis and teens grace women's side
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS throughout; edits &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON (AP) _ With Pete Sampras far from a sure thing to win
his fifth title, this year's men's side of Wimbledon shapes up as
the most open in years.
	   But the most intriguing tennis may _ as it's been recently _
with the game's teen stars like 17-year-old defending champion and
top seed Martina Hingis, eye-catch American sisters Venus and
Serena Williams, and Russian starlet Anna Kournikova.
	   Not to mention the return of seven-time champion Steffi Graf _
trying a comeback from knee surgery and various injuries _ and the
resurgence of French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   In Tuesday's draw, Sampras was paired against Dominic Hrbary, a
Slovakian ranked 47th who led Sampras 4-2 in the fifth set before
losing at the 1997 Australia Open.
	   The top-seeded Sampras, in the midst of a poor season, is in the
top half of a draw loaded with dangerous players _ including
Yevegeny Kafelnikov, Petr Korda, Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi.
	   Sampras could meet fellow American MaliVai Washington, the
Wimbledon runner-up in 1996, in the second round. Talented Swede
Thomas Enqvist could loom in the third and Australia's Scott
Draper, winner last weekend on grass at Queen's, in the fourth.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed, or Rafter,
the 1997 U.S. Open champion and No. 4 seed, could face Sampras in
the semis.
	   The top half includes American Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion
trying to re-start his career. He's seeded 13th and opens against
77th-ranked Spaniard Alex Calatrava, then could meet rising German
star Tommy Haas next and Korda in the fourth round.
	   The bottom half of the draw is much weaker, with No. 2 Marcelo
Rios of Chile and No. 4 Greg Rusedski of Britain the highest seeds.
	   Rios is not a grass-court player, and Rusedski is 50-50 for
Wimbledon after suffering a severely sprained left ankle last week.
	   Rios opens against Francisco Clavet and Rusedski faces a
qualifier.
	   The prospective quarterfinals in the bottom half have Rios vs.
France's Cedric Pioline, the 1997 Wimbledon runner-up and No. 8
seed, and Rusedski vs. Carlos Moya of Spain, the French Open
champion and No. 5 seed.
	   The best first-round match?
	   It must be Kafelnikov vs. Australia's Mark Philippoussis, one of
the hardest servers in the game. However, the Australian has played
poorly in recent months and even considered withdrawing from
Wimbledon.
	   On the women's side, Hingis drew a difficult first-rounder
against American Lisa Raymond. No. 2 Lindsay Davenport will play
Florencia Labat.
	   Hingis could face No. 3 Jana Novotna, the woman she beat in last
year's final, in the semis. Davenport would meet No. 4 Steffi Graf
in the other semifinal.
	   The 29-year-old Graff is continuing her comeback after a long
injury layoff. She opens against Gala Leon Garcia. No. 6 Monica
Seles, in Graf's half of the draw, opens with another Spaniard _
Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo.
	   The most interesting part of the draw _ men or women _ features
the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, grouped with fellow teen
star Kournikova of Russia and Mirjana Lucic of Croatia.
	   Venus opens against Jana Nejedly of Canada, while Serena plays
Laura Golarsa.
	   The Williams sisters could meet in the fourth round, but Serena
would first have to get past Lucic in the second round and
Kournikova in the third.
	   And there's a further complication for the Williams sisters.
Their mother Oracene, always at courtside, has been hobbled by a
broken ankle suffered since the family took up temporary residence
in Wimbledon, this leafy, well-off suburb in southwest London.

	   I READ with interest the article on the rhinoceros on the front
page of Life &AMP; Times on June 9. I once had the rare chance of
briefly seeing a one-horned rhinoceros in Tanjung Malim.
	   I don't think there will be a repeat viewing. For the life of
me, I will not understand the mentality of those who hunt such
animals. Is monetary gain so important? Do they place material
value above all else?
	   Thank goodness tigers and rhinoceros are now classified as
endangered species in Malaysia and protected accordingly.
	   Like tigers, the rhinoceros is a solitary animal which seeks
partners only during the mating season, after which they part
company, probably for ever. Less than 100 of the animals exist in
Malaysia today while the combined number in Bengal, Assam and Nepal
is about 600.
	   The white Indian animal, about two metres tall, is much larger
than its Malaysian counterpart. The smallest Sumatran rhinoceros,
the type found in Southeast Asia, is only 1 1/2 metres tall, almost
three metres long and weighs about one tonne. They are puny
compared to the huge Indian beast which weighs two tonnes and is 4
1/2 metres long.
	   The Sumatran rhinoceros is distinguished by its hairy coat and
love of wallowing in mud holes. Locals call the rhinoceros badak
kerbau (buffalo rhinoceros) because of its addiction to mud. Indian
rhinoceros had no chance to wallow in mud in days of yore. The
armoured animals (together with elephants) were trained by ancient
kings for warfare.
	   They were put on the front line of battle with iron tridents on
their horns - a frightening sight to any mortal! Their horns were
not used as weapons as the animal has another modus operandi of
dealing with opponents; it attempts to slice an enemy with its long
lower incisors known as tushes.
	   Once numerous, the rhinoceros population began to fall about 3
centuries ago during the Mogul dynasty. Encroachment of its
terrain, an increase in human population and hunting for sport and
profit decimated the animal.
	   Nepal has a reserve for the animal and many have been moved to
this safe area.
	   Of the three Asian species, the rarest is the Javan rhinoceros.
It is estimated that only 25 exist - all in the Udjong Kulon
Reserve in Java.
	   The female's horn is vestigial but that of the male's averages
25cm.
	   Because of its scarcity and wandering habits, hopes for its
survival is low. Although its horn has not been proven to be
beneficial, it is still highly valued in Asian medical lore.
Devotees swear it is the answer to many maladies including
impotence, the removal of thorns, easing of birth pains, shrinking
of lumps and as an antiseptic for closing wounds.
	   Even broken bones can be mended by powdered rhinoceros horn, it
is said.
	   Horns fetch some RM300 per 28 grammes. Other parts of the animal
too are valuable.
	   For example, one rite uses the body of a freshly killed
rhinoceros.
	   After it has been disem bowelled, those taking part in the
ritual squat inside the body cavity and recite prayers. The severed
horn is used as a receptacle and the animal's blood is offered to
the gods.
	   Even rhinoceros urine is valuable! Reports have it that a zoo in
Asia makes over RM3,000 per annum selling urine from its captive
pair of great Indian rhinoceros.
	   The small Sumatran rhinoceros is scattered throughout Burma,
Malaysia, Sumatra and Sabah. They are seldom, if ever, seen and
never by outsiders such as tourists.
	   Although blessed with keen hearing and smell, rhinoceros in
general are short-sighted and very wary.
	   They have an average life-span of half a century but are hard to
breed in captivity. In addition, the great Indian type is a most
unsociable fellow! Malaysia has the distinction of being the first
country to witness a rhinoceros in captivity - at the Malacca zoo -
giving birth.
	   The animal, unknown to its captors, was pregnant when it was
taken to the zoo.
	   One legend about rhinoceros horn cups was that they would
shatter if poison were poured in them. Rhinoceros' horns, unlike
those of other mammals, are made of compacted hair and many ancient
poisons were strong alkaloids which separated the hair-strands, of
the horn, causing noticeable disintegration inside the cup.
	   Rhinoceros are wanderers, which makes their protection vastly
more complicated. On the other hand, that also makes poaching
difficult.
	   Perhaps those who try to catch them may eventually give up.
Poaching may also stop if and when people accept the fact that
rhinoceros parts are not medically beneficial.
	   But until then, greed will continue to motivate hunters and push
the magnificent animal to extinction.

Au pair's father denies misusing her defense fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON(AP) _ The father of British au pair Louise Woodward
denied Tuesday that her family has misused a legal defense fund
which raised 245,000 pounds (dlrs 400,000).
	   ``I can see no sane reason for these allegations - and if people
have any questions, why not ask the trustees? Why run to the
nearest reporter or TV camera?,'' asked Gary Woodward.
	   Woodward spoke to BBC Radio 4 from Boston where he is waiting
with his daughter for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to
rule on prosecution and defense appeals of her conviction and
sentence.
	   Ms. Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder last fall in
the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, who had been in her care.
A judge later reduced the verdict to manslaughter and sentenced Ms.
Woodward, 20, to the 279 days she had served in prison since her
February 1997 arrest. She maintains she is innocent.
	   Her father urged people to concentrate ``on the main issue'' -
the court's ruling.
	   On Sunday, one of the founders of the defense fund said it
should be shut down. Jean Jones told Sky TV that Ms. Woodward's
mother, Sue, was initially concerned about her daughter, but her
primary concern then ``became money - the money became God.''
	   Referring to Jones' attack, Woodward said: ``We can't understand
why a one-time friend who at one time was very supportive, and very
helpful, should launch an unnecessary and unprovoked attack,
personal attack.''
	   Last week, the husband of a lawyer fired by Ms. Woodward accused
her mother of forging a dlrs 15,400 housing bill to get money from
her daughter's legal defense fund. Ms. Woodward and her parents
stayed with British-born lawyer Elaine Whitfield Sharp and her
husband, Dan, at their while their daughter was on trial.
	   After a special meeting, the fund's trustees issued a statement
supporting the Woodwards and saying the fund's money was for their
use as well as their daughter's.
	   Defending his wife, Woodward said Tuesday that over the past 16
months she ``has shown unstinting loyalty to Louise ... under the
most stressful conditions, without a thought for her own welfare.''
	   ``As a mother she is second to none,'' he said. ``She is the
most amazing woman I've ever known.''
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, the chairman of the fund's trustees, has
said the Woodward legal fund stood at dlrs 400,000 (245,000 pounds)
in December, but fell to about dlrs 80,000 (50,000 pounds) after
paying for Ms. Woodward's appeal.

Supreme court rejects former admiral's appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by a
former admiral who was convicted of abusing power in a housing
scandal, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Adm. Igor Khmelnov, the former commander of Russia's Pacific
Fleet who also served as chief of the navy's general staff, was
sentenced to two years probation in December for improperly
obtaining apartments for himself and his family in the Far Eastern
port of Vladivostok, the fleet's main base.
	   He was fired from his post in April.
	   Khmelnov ordered 64 decommissioned ships to be sold to South
Korea and India, promising to use the revenues for housing for the
fleet's officers and their families.
	   But the court found the money was illegally distributed among
people with ties to Khmelnov, who used it to obtain apartments for
themselves. Khmelnov also was convicted of misspending millions of
dollars allocated for the construction of a naval memorial center
in Vladivostok.
	   Corruption has become a serious problem in Russia's
cash-strapped armed forces, and a number of high-ranking military
officers have been charged with using their positions for personal
benefit.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Arrigo Sacchi, former coach of the Italian
national team and AC Milan, was hired Tuesday as coach of Atletico
de Madrid.
	   Sacchi, who replaces Radomir Antic, signed a two-year contract
with the Spanish club. Financial details were not released.
	   Sacchi, who led Italy to the World Cup final against Brazil in
1994, takes over an Atletico team eager to move into the top ranks
of the Spanish league and European play.
	   Sacchi has been without a job since being fired by AC Milan last
year after a disastrous comeback at the Italian powerhouse. In its
worst showing in a decade, AC Milan was knocked out of European
competition and finished a distant 11th in the 18-team Italian
first division.
	   Sacchi brought with him Bologna's defender Stefano Torrisi, who
signed a four-year deal with Atletico.
	   Antic's record with Atletico was laudable, capturing the team's
first and only ``double'' in 1996, claiming both the League
championship and the Spanish King's Cup.
	   Antic's departure after four seasons was due to differences with
the players.
	   Atletico secured its place in the UEFA for next season after
finishing seventh in the Spanish league.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops and rebels holed up in
a military garrison in the capital of Guinea-Bissau pounded each
other's positions with artillery fire Tuesday in what reportedly
was the heaviest fighting since an army revolt 10 days ago.
	   Bissau was rocked by about 90 minutes of shelling and clouds of
smoke billowed from the garrison in a suburb of the city, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Michael Kleiner of the International Red Cross said by telephone
from Geneva that Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was
deserted.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported more than
150,000 refugees in the area.
	   ``The big problem is the lack of drinking water and food for the
people on the road,'' Kleiner said.
	   Portugal made plans Tuesday to send 30 tons of medical and food
aid to its former colony in West Africa. Further evacuations of
some 500 foreign residents also were being prepared, the government
said.

Girl rescued from cave after 42 days dies in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of two teen-age girls rescued after 42 days
lost in a cave has died in a hospital, and the other is still
dangerously ill, state media said Tuesday.
	   Liang Xiaofei, 19, died Monday, two days after she and her
classmate, Li Qingzhu, were rescued from the cave in southwest
Guizhou province, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Li, 16, is still extremely weak and has a lung infection, it
said.
	   Two others in the girls' group died in the cave. The trapped
students had entered the cave May 2 while on an outing in a rural
area outside Guiyang, Guizhou's capital.
	   They had some water to drink while trapped, but no food, earlier
reports said. Four people exploring the countryside near Jinzitian
village in Guizhou discovered the survivors Saturday and called for
help.

World Cup: Soccer body says England staying in World Cup, despite
</HEADLINE>
rowdy fans &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ England will stay in the World Cup and its fans
will be more closely watched after three days of violence around
the team's first match in Marseille, officials said Tuesday.
	   Despite more than 60 arrests that were quickly leading to
deportation of a string of English fans, and calls from Marseille's
deputy mayor for the team to be kicked out, soccer's world body
said no action was planned against the country's sports interests.
	   ``There are no discussions of England being disqualified. There
are no discussions of England being banned from the World Cup in
2002,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   The federation said it was satisfied with anti-hooligan actions
taken by the English Football Association, which would not be
punished over the violence sparked by some 200-300 fans among
15,000 English followers in Marseille for Monday's 2-0 victory over
Tunisia, Cooper said.
	   The violence in Marseille was the worst at a World Cup since
June 1990, when English fans rioted in Rimini, Italy. Almost 250 of
them were arrested and deported after ravaging the seaside town.
	   The '90 Cup also was hit by violence involving Germans and
Yugoslavs, who battled in Milan and wound up fighting with police
and vandalizing shops and cars.
	   Cooper said that the Marseille violence would have no impact on
FIFA's consideration of England's bid to hold the World Cup in
2006.
	   The European Championships, held in English cities in 1996 with
no trouble by fans, ``proved that football can go ahead in a
peaceful manner in England,'' Cooper said.
	   It's when the soccer is abroad that English fans cause trouble,
and the latest outburst left Marseille's Old Port section
shattered.
	   ``The supporters behaved in the streets like louts,'' Marseille
Deputy Mayor Renaud Muselier said in an interview with the BBC.
``Today true football lovers wish they had been beaten on the
pitch. The image and the dignity of this Cup, symbol of a fraternal
competition, demands that the English team be disqualified or
excluded.''
	   Officials in Toulouse were preparing for a possible recurrence
of the violence when England plays there against Romania next
Monday.
	   Wherever the team and its fan go, more police will follow.
	   ``The security measures will be upgraded and strengthened
wherever it is a matter of public order, and the other matches of
England will lead to beefed-up security measures there,'' said
Jacques Lambert, managing director of the World Cup organizing
committee.
	   More security also will be provided at upcoming matches in
Marseille. There is a chance of England returning there if it
finishes second in Group G in the opening round and moves on to the
quarterfinals.
	   Asked if that July 4 match might be moved, Cooper replied:
``Nope!''
	   Throughout an hour-long news conference, Cooper, Lambert and
Michel Platini, the former French soccer star and now organizing
committee chief, stressed that there has been no problems with fans
in the stadiums and that the Marseille violence, the first directly
connected to World Cup matches, involved a small percentage of
English fans.
	   Lambert also said authorities had to be careful not to
overreact.
	   ``We have to guard against a form of paranoia about
foreigners,'' he said. ``If two individuals are fighting on the
street, it doesn't mean the revolution is at hand.''

Environmental accident feared as workers abandon oil refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Citizens of a northern Bulgarian city
expressed fears Tuesday that an industrial accident could threaten
their drinking water reserves after 2,000 oil refinery workers
walked off their jobs.
	   The workers of the Plama refinery, idled for seven months
because suppliers did not deliver raw materials, so far have been
arriving at their workplace every day, but left indefinitely
Tuesday. The company has neither paid suppliers nor workers for
months.
	   Only operators of the Plama refinery maintaining key
installations that prevent a spill-over of industrial waste into a
nearby river initially stayed behind but then went on a two-hour
warning strike. They threatened to be off their jobs for three
hours Wednesday unless they are getting paid.
	   The river Vit supplies Pleven, a city of 130,000, with drinking
water. A spillover of waste material could wreak havoc.
	   Evtim Yordanov, a civil defense official in Pleven, told the
state news agency BTA that his units were on alert to react to a
possible industrial accident at Plama.
	   Meanwhile, Bulgaria's gas company has asked a local court to
declare Plama bankrupt because of millions of dollars it owes in
unpaid bills. The National electric company has threatened to cut
off electricity for the plant for the same reason.
	   Environmentalists have warned that a gas or electricity outage
could also cause an industrial accident because it would halt the
plant's safety systems.
	   Plama, which produces mainly engine oils, is owned by
International Equities Inc., a subsidiary of Canada's Stellar
Global Corporation. Company debts inherited from the former state
enterprise reportedly total dlrs 135 million.

	   BOOKER Cash &AMP; Carry (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd will develop a network of
20 to 25 grocery depots in the country over the next five to six
years involving investment estimated at RM125 million.
	   The expansion plan, built on the success of its first depot in
Johor Baru, will commence with the opening of the Batu Pahat branch
next month followed by depots in Malacca and Kuantan.
	   This is in line with Booker's decision of making Malaysia its
launching pad to the Asian market.
	   Booker Malaysia is a joint venture of two local companies -
Malayassets Sdn Bhd (30 per cent) and Prinsip Intan Sdn Bhd (30 per
cent) - and public-listed Booker plc of Britain (40 per cent).
	   Booker plc is reputedly the world's largest grocery wholesale
group with worldwide sales of over RM30 billion in 1997.
	   It had said Malaysia was chosen as its Asian base because of the
stable government, widespread use of English in business, good
banking infrastructure and a sound legal system.
	   There is also a big pool of management talent in the country
capable of adapting the UK system for use here.
	   Booker Malaysia's trading concept is strictly ``trade only'' and
its grocery wholesale warehouses serve the needs of traders, not
end- consumers. It has established a customer base of close to
11,000 members.
	   The first outlet at the Tebrau Industrial Estate II, which also
houses Booker's regional headquarters, started operation in August
1996 and was officially opened by Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani
Othman yesterday.
	   At yesterday's official opening, Booker Malaysia also introduced
the ``Pelanggan Ria'' range of products to its customers.
	   Booker Malaysia managing director David Boner said the company's
range of Malaysian-made products would enable traditional traders
to sell products at affordable prices and compete against the
established hypermarket and supermarket chains.
	   ``We have about 20 products to start with. The products are
competitively priced without compromise on quality so that traders
can enjoy a higher profit margin.
	   ``We are here to help the small traders and caterers improve
their businesses in the face of changing customer needs and the
ever increasing competitive pressures.''
	   Boner said Booker's success in the UK and its network of depots
in Spain and Turkey was built on its ability and dedication to
meeting the needs of small, independent retailers and caterers.
	   ``We do not compete with them for the end-users. We work in
partnership with our valued customers and keep them in business
with our range of value-added services that will include
promotional materials, products and merchandising advice, and
training,'' he added.
	   Despite the current economic difficulties, the Johor Baru depot
is the top performer among Booker's network of over 250 depots
worldwide in business volume.
	   To support local manufacturers and in search of new markets,
Boner said Booker Malaysia had set up an international buying team
to work with local and regional suppliers to meet the growing
demand for ethnic food in the UK.
	   On its expansion plans in the region, he said Booker would next
enter the Thai market with the first depot in Bangkok scheduled for
opening in September.
	   ``We will consider other countries in the region, including
China.''

	   MALAYSIAN firms should increase the export of cement as the
country is currently experiencing an excess of some 10 million
tonnes of the material.
	   ``The (current) domestic demand for cement is only about 12
million tonnes (annually),'' Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
Minister Datuk Seri Megat Junid Megat Ayob said in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
	   He was speaking at the opening of the ``Buildmat Malaysia `98'',
the first exhibition and conference on Made-in Malaysia building
materials, at the Putra World Trade Centre.
	   Up till last April, Megat Junid said the country had exported a
total of 2,000 tonnes of cement as well as 72,000 tonnes of
clinker, an essential ingredient in cement.
	   According to an official from the Ministry, both raw materials
were exported to Bangladesh, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
	   Malaysia, which is capable of producing 22 million tonnes of
cement and 14 million tonnes of clinker annually, has been
experiencing an excess supply of cement since July.
	   During the second half of 1997, local stock market analysts had
already anticipated a slowdown in the demand for cement this year
and sufficient industry capacity in the coming years.
	   Malaysia had faced cement shortage in 1995, and had to obtain
supplies from 20 producers in China, whose products meet the
Malaysian standards of quality.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian Doctors Association (IDI) welcomed
yesterday the government's ``self-dispensing'' policy which will
see general practitioners directly provide medicines to their
patients.
	   The association lauded the Ministry of Health's June 9 decision
as ``a political decision which was taken for the sake of people's
welfare''.
	   ``There are two internationally known ways of handing drugs to
patients. One is through prescriptions, the other is
self-dispensing by doctors.
	   ``To date there is no data that shows which is superior, either
ethically or from the service quality point of view,'' it said in a
statement.
	   The statement, signed by association chairman Dr. Merdias
Almatsier and secretary-general Dr. Hasbulah Thabrany, said the
association urged members to uphold their professional integrity in
supporting the government's policy.
	   ``By so doing, it is hoped that we can answer worries and
concerns expressed by many parties that the policy will lead to
irrational medical therapy, more expensive health expenses and the
crippling of the drug distribution system if the policy is
implemented,'' its statement, distributed during a small seminar on
health development policy reform here, said.
	   One reason why the association welcomes the decision is that it
may help alleviate the costs currently passed on to patients.
	   ``The policy gives practicing doctors the opportunity to
dispense generic drugs that fit the socioeconomic background of
their patients,'' the announcement said.
	   However an association executive, Dr. M. Ahmad Djojosugito,
warned that the measure, aimed at cutting prices of generic drugs
by an average of 30 percent, could fail should there be ``badly
behaved doctors''.
	   ``The downside is that no control and reports are required ...
Some naughty doctors could just keep charging their patients the
same old prices (which are supposed to be 30 percent lower),''
Ahmad, who is also director of the state Cipto Mangunkusumo General
Hospital, told The Jakarta Post.
	   The association pointed out that the protracted distribution
chain of medicines contributed to the rising prices of generic
drugs.
	   ``This self-dispensing measure will cut a part of the
distribution chain and thus the prices of drugs significantly,''
the association said.
	   Not surprisingly, grumbles came from pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
	   Ahaditomo, of the Association of Indonesian Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers, argued that the exact opposite would occur as the
self-dispensing policy would simply ``extend distribution
networks''.
	   What was more essential, he said, was for industries to make
production of generic medicines more efficient and thereby
facilitate the lowering of prices.
	   ``More efficient production will automatically lead to lower
pricing,'' Ahaditomo, who is marketing director of PT Meiji
Indonesian Pharmaceutical Industries, told reporters.
	   Since the monetary crisis hit the country last year, prices of
patented drugs have reportedly increased up to 300 percent.
	   Generic drug prices, relatively stable since l993, have also
soared by as much as 150 percent recently, causing many public
complaints about their affordability.
	   Generic drugs account for about 80 percent of prescribed
medications.
	   Up to 90 percent of the raw materials used to manufacture the
country's medications are imported.
	   Yesterday, IDI also urged the government to eliminate various
fees, such as value-added tax, warehousing costs and illegal
levies, imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers importing raw
materials for medicines.
	   They argued that such raw materials should be considered ``basic
essentials''.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Lufthansa has agreed to publish an
apology in three Israeli dailies to a passenger at whom a Lufthansa
employee in Frankfurt directed an anti-Semitic slur, a spokeswoman
said Tuesday.
	   The airline declined to discuss details of the incident.
However, Israel Radio reported Tuesday that passenger Yitzhak Barak
was insulted as a Jew during a dispute over a seat in business
class.
	   The apology will appear in the Ha'aretz, Yediot Ahronot and
Ma'ariv dailies on Wednesday, Lufthansa spokesman Karin Weber said.
``It will say that Lufthansa apologizes to Mr. Barak and that
Lufthansa will do everything to make sure the incident is not
repeated,'' Weber said.
	   The form of apology was agreed to in a meeting between Barak and
Lufthansa vice president Karl-Friedrich Rausch, she said.
	   Weber declined to discuss what, if any, action was taken against
the employee.

	   THE portland cement produced by Pahang Cement Sdn Bhd at its
integrated plant in Bukit Sagu, Kuantan, contains 95 per cent local
content.
	   YTL Cement Bhd's director of operations (cement) Tan Check Hong
said yesterday that except for gypsum, the other ingredients were
sourced locally.
	   He said the company imported gypsum, an integral raw material in
cement production, from Thailand.
	   Limestone heated with a mixture of additives produces clinker,
which is then mixed with gypsum and other materials to produce
cement.
	   Tan said this at a briefing on the operations of the Pahang
Cement's plant, located about 50km from Kuantan.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad will officially
open the plant, a 50:50 joint venture between the Pahang Government
and YTL Cement Bhd, today.
	   Tan said the plant uses coal to heat the kiln as it ``was still
the cheapest source of energy''.
	   The company has adopted ``Cop Orang Kuat'' as its brandname.
	   Tan said the company believed that the Pahang Cement plant was
viable venture despite the economic problems.
	   ``The plant covers about 80ha and is adjacent to limestone and
clay quarries worked by Pahang Cement under long-term leases,'' he
said.
	   He said under agreements signed on Sept 4, 1995, RM560 million
in credit facilities were raised for the project.
	   ``The financing of the project marked another milestone in
infrastructure financing in the country as it was the first time
that a cement plant obtained financing for a 15-year tenure
strictly on a project finance basis,'' he said.

	   PAHANG Cement Sdn Bhd, which is expected to record annual sales
turnover of at least RM200 million, will be a major contributor to
YTL Cement Bhd's earnings, executive director Datuk Michael Yeoh
Sock Siong said yesterday.
	   The RM200 million turnover would come from the sale of one
million tonnes of cement from Pahang Cement's plant in Bukit Sagu,
about 50km from Kuantan. The RM700 million cement plant has a
capacity of 1.2 million tonnes per annum.
	   Yeoh said despite a slowdown in the construction sector, Pahang
Cement would still be able to achieve the targetted sales in view
of the sustainable demand for the product in the eastern corridor.
	   ``Although there will be a 30 per cent drop in overall demand
this year, the eastern corridor should see a sustainable demand of
about 800,000 tonnes per annum,'' Yeoh said.
	   YTL Cement posted a turnover of RM300 million last year. It
holds a 50 per cent equity in Pahang Cement, the only cement
factory on the east coast of the peninsula. The other 50 per cent
is held by the Pahang State Government - via Pasdec Corporation Sdn
Bhd (33.5 per cent) and State Secretary Incorporated (16.7 per
cent).
	   Saying that Pahang Cement has cash reserves of RM100 million,
Yeoh noted that the company was fortunate to have secured a 15-year
fixed rate loan of RM300 million at nine per cent per annum to
part-finance the plant before the financial problem struck.
	   Also, the highly automated Bukit Sagu plant has substantially
reduced workforce requirement.
	   ``Under normal circumstances, a cement plant with its size
requires 200 to 300 people. But, we only need 100 workers.''
	   Yeoh said Malaysia had the potential to be the main producer and
seller of cement in the region, given the technology and abundance
of raw materials such as limestone and clay.
	   The country can also capitalise from the current situation in
Thailand and Indonesia, where prices of cement have risen
substantially following the economic and financial shortcomings.
	   ``The prices in the country are relatively stable which make our
cement more competitive,'' he pointed out.
	   On when Pahang Cement expects to embark on the overseas market,
he said: ``Going overseas is nice, but it requires lots of
perseverance and efforts.''
	   ``The Indo-China markets are quite protected... We would
probably wait for the implementation of the Asean Free Trade
Agreement in 2003, as cement will no longer be a protected item
then.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Coordinating Minister for Development
Supervision and State Administrative Reforms revealed yesterday
that he had ordered all ministers, governors, heads of state owned
companies and related officials to speed up efforts to reduce the
incidence of corruption.
	   The minister asked all officials to terminate projects or
contracts with private companies if they found any irregularities
in the deals.
	   The minister said immediate family, distant relatives or friends
of government officials should not get any special business
privileges.
	   However, Hartarto warned officials not to violate the existing
law, including international law, with regards to contracts with
third parties.
	   ``Any ongoing projects which are corrupt in their nature or
which were awarded on a collusive or nepotistic basis are expected
to be renegotiated,'' Hartarto said after meeting with President
B.J. Habibie along with Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung and
head of the government audit agency (BPKP) Soedarjono.
	   Habibie vowed to stamp out chronic corruption shortly after
replacing Soeharto on May 21.
	   However, he pointed out the importance of distinguishing clearly
between the three unhealthy practices to ensure that all citizens
were equal before the law.
	   Hartarto distributed a circular letter which meticulously
defined each of corruption, collusion and nepotism in a bid to
prevent confusion among government officials.
	   Hartarto said that corruption, collusion and nepotism were
``projects or business which had been granted certain privileges''.
	   Opposition groups and students said the government should not
waste time defining each of the practices and should get on with
bringing them to an end.
	   The minister answered these criticisms by saying: ``It is very
important to alleviate (corruption) with a clear understanding to
avoid arbitrary actions.''
	   The minister also issued a strong warning to government
officials tempted to grant bank loans, tax or customs privileges,
exclusive rights or offer unnecessary mediation services.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran on trial for corruption
sparred with a judge in court Tuesday, accusing him of improper
questioning and giving credence to confessions extracted under
pressure.
	   ``It's not fair that you are interrupting me. Why are you not
allowing me to defend myself?'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi told the
judge in the packed courtroom on the third day of his trial.
	   Judge Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei replied: ``When
your remarks are off the point, I will not allow you to speak.''
	   The judge became visibly irritated when, as in the previous
sessions, Karbaschi adopted a confrontational attitude to the
proceedings.
	   ``I will not allow you to discuss issues with me as you please.
This is a courtroom and you are a defendant here,'' Mohseni Ejaie
said.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested on April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hard-liner, on charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds.
	   He was released on bail on the orders of Iran's spiritual
leader, Ali Khamenei, after Karbaschi's supporters took to the
streets and clashed with security forces.

	   INDUSTRIES need to be tuned in to developments in technology,
processes and breakthroughs in materials so that they can produce
better products more efficiently.
	   New discoveries in materials that can complement, enhance or
replace existing materials, especially naturally-occuring
materials, should be of special interest.
	   Minister of International Trade and Industry Datuk Seri Rafidah
Aziz yesterday said Malaysian companies can accelerate the process
of technology acquisition by establishing joint ventures with
foreign partners involved in new materials industry.
	   By doing so, they could benefit from their partners' expertise
and established marketing network.
	   Rafidah said that between 1994 and April this year, MITI
approved 22 projects with high-technology incentives, whose capital
investments totalled RM20.183 billion. Of this, 81.9 per cent are
foreign investments.
	   They are in the electrical and electronics sector (58.5 per
cent), fabricated metal products sector (25.6 per cent), and
transport and equipment sector (9.9 per cent).
	   Rafidah was speaking at the opening of Universiti Malaya's
Advanced Materials Characterisation Allied Laboratories. Amcal is a
one-stop centre for training, testing and research.
	   She said the Government encourages the development of
high-technology industries including those in new and advanced
materials.
	   The Government also supports efforts to commercialise research
and development results such as in the area of new materials.
	   Under the Commercialisation of Research and Development Fund of
the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation, between 50 per
cent and 70 per cent of the cost of undertaking the
commercialisation of R&AMP;D efforts can be considered.
	   Activities eligible for such grants include market and
feasibility studies, design and development of the product or
process, standards conformance and certification and intellectual
property registration.
	   High-technology companies engaged in the production of promoted
products in the areas of new and emerging technologies are eligible
for either the pioneer status incentive, or investment tax
allowance.
	   Non-fiscal incentives offered include flexibility in the
employment of foreign scientists and technical experts and the
approval to open foreign exchange accounts.
	   To be eligible, these companies need to fulfil certain criteria.
Local R&AMP;D expenditure to gross sales has to be at least one per
cent on an annual basis.
	   Companies are allowed three years from commencement of
operations to comply.
	   In addition, the percentage of science and technical graduates
to the total workforce has to be at least seven per cent.
	   Rafidah said in the advanced materials industry, several sectors
were identifed for consideration of such incentives.
	   They are polymers and biopolymers, specialty polymer materials,
high efficiency separation membranes used in the medical field,
artificial organs, super conductors, fine or advanced ceramics, and
high-strength composites.
	   She commended Amcal for creating a link beteen academia and the
private sector, and urged it to use Miti's network to publicise and
commercialise its functions.
	   ``It is time for the community and academia to strategise a
comprehensive way forward, complement each university and find your
own niche to strengthen the country's industries,'' she said.

China renews appeals to Japan to stabilize yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed deep concern Tuesday about the
pressure imposed on Asian economies by the weakening Japanese yen,
but said it would not devalue its own currency in response.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said quick action to halt
the yen's slump was needed to help Asian economies recover from the
region's nearly yearlong financial upheaval.
	   Similar calls came Tuesday from Hong Kong and Malaysia, which
accused Japan of ``foot-dragging.''
	   ``We shudder to think where we will be if the yen continues to
slide,'' Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a speech.
``The social impact will be severe.''
	   Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said, ``We must urge
... the leading economies, particularly Japan and America, to come
forward to stabilize the situation. It is not doing anybody any
good at all.''
	   Japan's central bank governor, meanwhile, said the ``weak yen is
not the cause for the recent weakness of Asian currencies.'' Bank
of Japan chief Masaru Hayami said the basic strength of the dollar
is causing the simultaneous fall in the yen and the other Asian
currencies.
	   Chinese spokesman Zhu, while urging Japan and other countries
that he did not name to stabilize the yen, indicated that China has
no plans to devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   ``The international balance of payments in China is in good
shape and the (yuan) will remain stable,'' he said at a
twice-weekly briefing for reporters.
	   China's decision not to devalue its currency has been widely
praised for keeping battered Asian economies from sinking further.
China has used its decision not to devalue, despite pressures on
its economy, to project itself as a responsible partner in the
global market.
	   ``In stabilizing the financial crisis, China has made tremendous
contributions. China has taken risks and paid prices,'' Zhu said.
	   China's central bank governor, Dai Xianglong, also has
criticized Japan for not stabilizing the yen, and the bank's
newspaper, the Financial News, on Monday blamed both the United
States and Japan for allowing ``the yen to depreciate without
making any efforts'' to stabilize it.
	   Zhu stopped short of openly blaming Tokyo or Washington but said
China hoped Japan and ``relevant countries'' will ``strengthen
cooperation to prevent an escalation of the situation.''
	   Japan is a major Chinese trading partner and investor. The
weaker yen is likely to make it tougher for China to attract
Japanese investment and export to Japan, thereby putting pressure
on the yuan.
	   ``Given the impact of the Japanese economy and the Japanese yen
in East Asia and on the world economy, we are very concerned about
the continuous low of the Japanese yen,'' Zhu said.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's Anwar told a delegation from New
Zealand, ``The weakness of the yen and Tokyo's slowness in putting
its economy in order, particularly its foot-dragging instead of
strengthening its fragile banking system and opening its markets,
are making the regional situation gloomy indeed.''
	   Anwar urged the United States and other leading industrialized
nations to help Japan out, saying the country could not handle all
its problems on its own.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's
vice president for East Asia and the Pacific, said it will be up to
the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations to stabilize the
yen.
	   ``I think it's in this group (G-7) that the key solutions are
lying,'' Severino said at a conference of Asian region business and
economic leaders.
	   But the Japanese government must also present a ``consistent and
coherent'' approach to solving its own problems if any
international stabilization plan is to work, he said.

	   Trip aims at discussion of whole
	   gamut of bilateral issues: Samad
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina leaves Dhaka for Delhi this
(Tuesday) morning on a 14-hour visit to the Indian capital to
discuss the bilateral issues and the issues related to regional
cooperation as well.
	   ``This will be a working visit by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
to India and the objective of the visit is to discuss the whole
gamut of bilateral issues,'' said Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
while talking to The Independent yesterday afternoon.
	   ``Personally I am happy that Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister to visit his
country after the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan,''
Abdus Samad added. However, he maintained that Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina would not play the role of a mediator, rather the
visit would fully concentrate on bilateral issues.
	   Foreign Minister said that apart from discussing the bilateral
issues Bangladesh and Indian Prime Ministers would get the
opportunity to develop a personal rapport during their first
meeting.
	   Asked whether the Prime Minister would discuss the disarmament
policy of India during her visit Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
said that Bangladesh had already iterated that it was against all
kinds of arms race and signed Non Proliferation Treaty and
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He said that Bangladesh was bound to
abide by the principles of those treaties.
	   It is the first visit by Bangladesh Prime Minister to India
after the BJP came to power early this year.
	   She is also scheduled to visit Pakistan on June 24.
	   The visit is an outcome of the initiatives taken by Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina to ease tension in this region after the
nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan. Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina in her replies to the letters written by Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaj Sharif of Pakistan on June 1
proposed to visit both the countries. Subsequently India accepted
the offer of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and invited her to visit
his country to discuss bilateral issues.
	   Hasina's move has already been lauded by diplomats in Dhaka,
while Japan and German embassies' spokesmen have expressed the hope
that her efforts would contribute in reducing tension in the
region.
	   During her brief stay for only 14 hours in New Delhi Sheikh
Hasina will have talks with her counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
the stability in the region and the bilateral issues as well.
	   According to a Foreign Ministry source, the bilateral issues
include, border trade, Dhaka-Calcutta bus service, illegal
immigration, smuggling, freer trade, Dahagram-Angarpota issue and
others.
	   She is also likely to meet former Indian Prime Minister IK
Gujral and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
	   The Prime Minister will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan
Chowdhury, Foreign Secretary Mostafizur Rahman, Principal Secretary
to PM Dr S A Samad and some senior officials of Foreign Ministry.
	   She is scheduled to return home this evening at 9 p.m.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri.- Deputy vice-chancellor of Universiti
Kebangsaan Malaysia Professor Datuk Dr Zakri Abdul Hamid has been
appointed member of the United Nations Environment Programme's
steering committee on Global Biosafety.
	   The main role of the committee is to advise on capacity
building, particularly on human resource development in
biotechnology and biosafety, to 18 participating countries in the
UN-sponsored pilot project.
	   Biosafety is the safe transfer, handling and use of any
genetically modified organism resulting from biotechnology.
	   GMOs have been used in areas of medicine, agriculture and
industry.
	   However, there is also concern about the potential risks GMOs
pose on biodiversity and human health.
	   At the Convention on Biological Diversity, the issue of
biosafety received special mention and a legally binding treaty was
formed.
	   The treaty was ratified by 171 countries including Malaysia.
Zakri is the original author of Article 19(3) of the treaty which
calls for the consideration of a biosafety protocol.
	   A veteran in biodiversity and biotechnology affairs at the
national and UN levels, Zakri is also the founding chairman of the
Genetic Modification Advisory Committee.
	   On several occasions, he has lead the Malaysian delegation in
negotiations of biosafety protocol.
	   The 25-member Steering Committee on Global Biosafety carries out
activities initiated by UNEP.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A police officer who was taken hostage in the
Caucasus republic of North Ossetia was killed along with his
kidnapper when law enforcement officials tried to free him, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   The kidnapper took the policeman and another Interior Ministry
officer hostage near the village of Veseloye at midday on Monday.
	   One officer was released and told to distract the attention of
police at a checkpoint, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing the
local Interior Ministry.
	   Police shot and wounded the kidnapper while he was in a car with
the other hostage. But the kidnapper detonated a hand grenade,
killing himself and seriously injuring the other police officer who
died in a helicopter en route to a hospital, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Caucasus region, which includes the breakaway region of
Chechnya, has been swept in recent months by a wave of kidnappings
and other crimes. Most of the abductions are for ransom, but some
also appear to be in retribution for previous hostage-takings.

Tehran mayor accuses court of extracting confessions

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor accused a judge of
improper questioning and giving credence to confessions extracted
under pressure on Tuesday, the third day of his trial on
allegations of corruption.
	   ``It's not fair that you are interrupting me. Why are you not
allowing me to defend myself?'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi asked the
judge in the packed courtroom.
	   ``When your remarks are off the point, I will not allow you to
speak,'' replied Judge Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei,
who became visibly irritated when, as in the previous sessions,
Karbaschi adopted a confrontational attitude. ``I will not allow
you to discuss issues with me as you please. This is a courtroom,
and you are a defendant here.''
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hard-liner, on charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds. He was released on bail on the
orders of Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, after Karbaschi's
supporters took to the streets and clashed with security forces.
	   The case has, 6th graf pvs.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Fri. - Steps are being taken to re-issue Sabah
birth certificates with security features to curb falsification of
documents, the National Registration Department said.
	   Another step to be taken is to limit the validity of temporary
identity card receipts to six months with extension granted only if
necessary. This will enable the receipts to be verified every six
months against the genuine documents or with reliable witnesses.
	   NRD director-general Azizan Ayob made the announcement here in
the wake of the detention of seven NRD staff under the Internal
Security Act last month for suspected involvement in forging NRD
documents.
	   He regretted that despite repeated reminders for NRD staff to
carry out their duties and responsibility honestly, diligently and
efficiently, there were still ``black sheep'' in the department.
	   Azizan said the NRD staff were detained because of their
involvement with an illegal syndicate.
	   He said this proved that NRD's actions to strengthen the control
of documents, improve working procedures, relocate staff and
addition of office equipment since 1996 had prevented attempts to
issue documents improperly.
	   He said it also showed that the existing NRD officers and staff
not involved with the syndicate were clean, honest and dedicated
although they faced tremendous pressure.
	   ``Steps have also been taken to improve the department's
services in Sabah, including transferring several staff to replace
those detained.''
	   Azizan said NRD officers and staff in Sabah would be provided
training to enhance their motivation and dedication. The first
training programme will be held at the end of the month.
	   The NRD management will conduct regular visits to its district
offices to find out if the changes planned had been implemented.
	   Additional allocations will be sought to upgrade facilities at
district NRD offices in Sabah, such as installing a facsimile
machine to ensure easier and more efficient communication with the
State and Federal NRD headquarters.

	   Prof Golam Azam, Ameer of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh came under
fire in Parliament Monday for allegedly cautioning Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina that she might have to face a consequence like that
of August 15.
	   Abdul Latif Mirza of the Awami League, given the floor during
the half hour earmarked for unscheduled discussion demanded
exemplary punishment of Golam Azam for allegedly conspiring to
destroy the democratic atmosphere.
	   The AL lawmaker said that Azam had in the past conspired to undo
the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh. Now he and his
party were trying to create anarchy in the country in the name of
organising long march in alliance with the BNP.
	   Recalling the August 15 incident in which Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman was killed along with the members of his family and
the subsequent killing of four national leaders in jail, he urged
all to remain cautious against new conspiracies.
	   Abdul Latif Mirza that said that Golam Azam had used the words
of caution against the Prime Minister when he addressed a gathering
of Jamaat workers at Ramna park before the start of the long march
on June 9.
	   He charged the late president Ziaur Rahman with murder and said
Zia had brought Prof. Golam Azam back to Bangladesh in a planned
way.
	   It was for the first time in the Bangladesh Parliament that an
unscheduled discussion was allowed at a fixed hour. Advocate Fazle
Rabbi of the Jatiya Party was first to take the opportunity
yesterday and speak on the adoption of unfair means in the Higher
Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations.
	   In reply, Education Minister ASHK Sadek said that the government
would initiate a discussion in Parliament on the problem with a
view to finding a solution. He said that the education policy had
been finalised and would be placed in Parliament soon.

	   A NINE-year-old autistic savant boy (think Dustin Hoffman's
character in Rain Man) cracks a sophisticated national security
code.
	   Government bigwigs panic. They have spent tons of money to
create this code, and a child cracks it. Orders go out to kill the
boy.
	   One way or another, FBI agent Arthur ``Art'' Jeffries (Bruce
Willis) takes the savant under his wings. They run all over Chicago
to hide from an assassin ... and you know the rest of the story.
	   The compelling performance is by Miko Hughes, who plays the
savant, Simon, with searing realism. Hughes spent time with
autistic children to get their mannerisms down to a pat.
	   Willis' roles are becoming pigeonholed. He's the outcast whom
everyone depends on to save the day. There's a small difference
here as he develops a relationship with the boy, but it isn't
enough to hide the movie's deficiencies.
	   Jeffries' unorthodox ways could have saved some bloodshed during
a bank robbery at the beginning. He's eventually relegated to
listening to wire taps.
	   Simon is in a world of his own. He sees the answer to the code
(planted in a puzzle book by government programmers to test it),
and soon, his parents are killed.
	   It looks like the parents committed suicide, but Jeffries (as
the smart one predetermined by movie convention) thinks otherwise.
He finds Simon and takes him into hiding when someone tries to kill
the boy.
	   Viewers get to see the standard car chase on the Chicago freeway
and a close encounter with death on the railway tracks.
	   In a scene that pushes the limit of plausibility, Jeffries pops
into a restaurant with Simon and begs a single attractive woman
(another standard movie role) to look after the kid for a moment
while he goes to do something important.
	   He asks for the woman's full name before he leaves, and that's
the cue to know they will meet again. Later that night, Jeffries
and Simon appear at the woman's apartment dishevelled, asking for a
place to stay.
	   If you were that woman, woken up in the wee hours by strangers,
would you consent? I don't think so, but the movie doesn't believe
in realism.
	   Alec Baldwin plays Nicholas Kudrow, the head of the covert
government agency whose code was broken by the savant. He sneers
with all the conviction of a slimy, suave bureaucract who is
certain that what he's doing is actually for the good of the
country (see his other slimy role in 1993's Malice).
	   If the savant can break a top-secret code, I hope he can crack
this run- of-the-mill fare.

	   An activist of the BNP's student wing, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal
(JCD), opened fire following a conflict at the party's central
office at Naya Paltan in the city Monday evening.
	   According to witnesses, the activist opened fire from his gun
immediately after the JCD General Secretary, Habibunnabi Sohel,
adjourned the JCD central committee meeting amid pandemonium.
	   The meeting sources said, some JCD leaders were demanding action
against the workers who assaulted JCD Organising Secretary Monwar
Hossain Rana, in Khagrachhari during the long march and another
central leader Kazal at Ziaur Rahman's mazar.
	   Following the firing, the people present at party ran for
safety. The situation, however, became normal shortly afterwards.
	   The news reached the BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, who was
then at her Minto Road official residence. She later met the JCD
leaders and asked them to busy the hatchet and work for the
organisation unitedly.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Army Chief of Staff Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo has
pronounced a ``pure accident'' as the cause of the crash of an Army
helicopter in East Timor earlier this month, Antara reported
yesterday.
	   The Army's investigation confirmed the preliminary finding that
the Bell 205 aircraft crashed after hitting a tree and the side of
a mountain in bad weather, Gen. Subagyo said.
	   It was not shot down by East Timor separatist rebels, he told
reporters during a visit to Bandung, West Java.
	   All 12 officers on board the helicopter were killed in the June
4 crash in Viqueque regency in East Timor. They included Maj. Gen.
Yudomo Sastro Suhardjo, the chief of the Udayana Regional Military
Command, and Col. Slamat Sidabutar, the chief of the East Timor
military command.
	   The Udayana Regional Military Command oversees provinces of
Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara and East Timor.
	   Yudomo had only served in the post for eight days, having
replaced Maj. Gen. Syahrir M.S., who had been appointed chief of
the Army's special force (Kopassus).
	   Subagyo said the investigation team, formed a day after the
crash, had completed its work and presented its report, complete
with photographs.
	   Meanwhile, Army spokesman Brig. Gen. I Dewa Putu Rai announced
yesterday the appointment of Maj. Gen. Adam R. Damiri, chief of the
Army's Strategic Reserves Command (Kostrad) First Division, as the
new chief of the Udayana command replacing Yudomo.
	   Maj. Adam is a 1972 graduate of the Armed Forces Academy.
	   Col. Suhartono Suratman, chief of Kopassus Group 3 for education
and training, will fill the post of Sidabutar, Putu Rai said.
	   Brig. Gen. I Gede Dewa Purnawa, deputy chief of the Army Staff
and Command School (Seskoad), will take over Adam's Kostrad
position.
	   Two other appointments were made to fill posts left vacant due
to fatalities in the crash. Lt. Col. Edy Sunardi has been appointed
assistant for intelligence affairs to the Udayana Command chief of
staff, and Lt. Col. Budi Heriyanto will be assistant for operations
to the Udayana Military Command chief of staff.
	   Edy replaces Col. Pangandaran Napitulu, and Budi replaces Col.
Satria Buana.
	   Putu Rai also confirmed that Brig. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif,
currently chief of staff of the Brawijaya regional military
command, will become the new Armed Forces (ABRI) spokesman,
replacing Brig. Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan.
	   Mokodongan will soon be assigned an educational task at the
National Resilience Institute (Lemhanas).

	   GETTING THE BEST VIEW ... This area will provide a visual feast
for visitors to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang as
it overlooks aircraft taking off and landing on Runway I.
	   KLIA's ``observation hill'' is already a hit among many who
visited the airport, which will be officially opened on June 27.
	   Located about 5km from the Main Terminal Building and accessible
via the airport's Perimeter East road, the hill is near the area
where aircraft will touch down on the 4km long runway.
	   KLIA will operate a single runway when it starts commercial
operations on June 30. A second runway will be operational in two
months.
	   Malaysia Airports (Sepang) Sdn Bhd operations executive Khaw Sim
Min said the hill will also provide visitors and aviation
enthusiasts with a panoramic view of the airport.
	   ``In future, the area will be developed into a tourist spot,
with shops and restaurants for the public's convenience,'' he told
the New Straits Times yesterday.
	   ``With this area, we hope that KLIA will be more than just an
airport.''
	   He added that more than 100 palm trees had been planted to
create an ``oasis'' atmosphere.
	   The airport will also have an observation deck at the Contact
Pier to view aircraft movements on the apron.

EU reconstructs livestock in disputed town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ It's not only homes and
factories that are being repaired here. The European Union will
supply farmers in the disputed northern town of Brcko with pregnant
cows, officials said Tuesday.
	   Brcko is currently under Bosnian Serb control. An international
arbitrator has yet to decide if the town will ultimately become
part of the Muslim-Croat Federation or remain under the control of
the Bosnian Serb substate.
	   ``As a part of its wider efforts to help the restructuring of
the agricultural sector in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the European Union
is currently financing a project for a consignment of 1,000
pregnant cows in the Brcko area,'' said Ivo Ilic Gabara, an EU
spokesman.
	   The project is part of an initiative for the rapid agricultural
reconstruction in the Brcko area, worth four million German marks
(dlrs 2.35 million), an press release said.
	   The cattle is currently put under a three-week quarantine in a
farm outside Bosnia. After health tests according to European
standards, it will be transported to Bosnia.

	   Steps taken to reduce trade gap with Delhi
	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed Monday informed
the Jatiya Sangsad that the present government had taken various
measures under the bilateral agreements, Bangkok Agreement and
SAPTA Agreements to reduce the trade gap with India.
	   Replying to a question of BNP member Mashiur Rahman, the
Commerce Minister said after two rounds of negotiations, a third
team is now continuing discussions with India under the SAPTA
agreement.
	   He said India gave Bangladesh tariff concessions from 50 per
cent to 100 per cent on 57 items in the first round of
negotiations.
	   It also gave Bangladesh tariff concessions from 25 per cent to
50 per cent on 513 commodities and withdrew non-tariff restrictions
on 180 items of Bangladesh in the second round of negotiations.
	   The Commerce Minister said the first and second meetings of the
third round of negotiations had already been held where Bangladesh
sought tariff concessions from India for 18 sectors and 63 items
and additional or special tariff concessions on 224 commodities
which earlier got some duty relief. Besides, he said, Bangladesh
sought duty-free export of 86 commodities to India.
	   The minister said Bangladesh could take the opportunity of 20-40
per cent tariff facilities approved in the SAARC Commerce
Ministers' meeting at Islamabad recently to boost its export to
India.
	   He said Bangladesh had been participating in the trade fairs in
New Delhi and Calcutta every year to familiarise Bangladeshi
products there. Besides, he said, Bangladesh was trying to raise
its export earnings by sending government and private trade
delegations to India.
	   The country's overall trade deficit is still around 38 per cent,
Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed informed in Parliament yesterday.
	   In a written answer to Master Mujibur Rahman (AL), the minister
said, the exact figure would be available by the end of June.
	   He said the government is planning to meet the trade deficit
gradually by increasing the volume of export.
	   In 1996-97 fiscal year, the deficit was $ 2731.72 million or
38.21 per cent. During the period export stood at $ 4418.28 million
as against import $ 7150 million.
	   Tofail said the market economy and transparency in the
government's policy have succeeded in reducing the trade gap from
the previous years.
	   A five year (1997-2002) export-import policy has been approved
by the cabinet. The policy will be announced shortly after
completing certain formalities, the minister said in replying to
another question by Kazi Sekandar Ali (AL).
	   He told Abdul Latif Mirza (AL) that the export earning of the
first eight months to February of the current fiscal year stood at
$ 3008.38 million which was 16.75 per cent higher compared to the
corresponding period of the previous year.
	   Replying to Tohura Ali (AL), the minister said Bangladesh has
proposed to liberalise the ``rule of origin'' to increase country's
export within the SAARC countries.
	   He said Bangladesh has exported frozen fish, tea, furnace oil,
glycerine, chemical fertiliser, leather, leather products, books,
stationary, jamdani saree, raw jute, jute products, knitwear,
ceramic products, ready-made garments, transformer, generators,
accumulator battery and parts, audio cassette, PVC bag, organic
fertiliser, polythene sheet, dry fish, vegetable, fruits, bamboo,
medicines, handicrafts, shrimp, textile fabric, telephone cables,
footwear and primary products to different SAARC countries during
the first 10 months of the current fiscal year.
	   In reply to Moulana Delwar Hossain Sayeedi (Jamaat), the
minister said during the first quarter of the current year
(July-September 97) imports from India amounted to Tk 727.90 crore
as against the export of Tk 222.34 crore.

	   YOGYAKARTA: Former Bantul regent Col. Sri Roso Sudarmo was
grilled for more than six hours by the military police here
yesterday over allegations that he tried to bribe a Soeharto-linked
foundation with Rp 1 billion (US$68,000) to get reappointed as
regent.
	   The former regent, who was mobbed by waiting reporters after the
questioning, refused to comment on his questioning.
	   The head of the Military Police investigating team, Lt. Col.
Unggul K. Yudoyono, who was interviewed later, also refused to
reveal much about the interrogation.
	   ``Many questions were asked,'' he said, adding that only the
Central Java Military Police chief in Semarang could give material
details of the interrogation.
	   Sri Roso was grilled as a suspect for in 1996 allegedly agreeing
to give a ``donation'' to the Dharmais Foundation chaired by former
president Soeharto if he could retain his post.
	   Sri Roso may also be questioned over the unsolved murder of
Bernas daily journalist Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, alias Udin, in
1996.
	   Many people believe the journalist's death was probably tied to
corruption reports he was investigating in Bantul.
	   The head of the Yogyakarta police detectives, Lt. Col. Erwin
Tobing, said yesterday that 27 people had been interrogated in the
new probe into Udin's murder.

Police kill 44 Maoist rebels in Nepal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Police shot to death 44 Maoist rebels
since they started combing the jungle for their hide-outs three
weeks ago, a government minister said Tuesday.
	   Two policemen were killed and another 31 were injured in gun
battles with the rebels, Nepal's Home Minister Devendraraj Kadel.
	   The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional monarchy and demand
that the Himalayan state be turned into a republic. More than 200
people have been killed since the insurgency began two years ago,
said Kadel.
	   ``We have to intensify our actions against the rebels for the
sake of maintaining peace and security in the country,'' the
minister said.
	   Police are demanding extraordinary powers to arrest and detain
the suspects for a period longer than the 25 days permitted at
present. A person can be jailed up to two years for keeping
unlicensed fire arms and ammunition.
	   Nearly 1,500 policemen are combing 10 insurgency-hit districts,
located 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Katmandu, the Nepalese
capital, the minister said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's top brass and premier jointly
announced at the end of an emergency meeting on Tuesday that
radical Islamic activities were deemed as a domestic threat,
according to a statement.
	   The military called the meeting apparently to pressure Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz into stepping up the fight against radical
Islamic groups, which want to turn Turkey into a religious state.
	   The military, which has staged three coups since the 1960s, has
asserted itself as the guarantor of the modern Turkish state in
this predominantly Muslim but secular country. Last year, the
military forced Turkey's first Islamic-led government to resign.
	   The statement also said that in the emergency meeting, the high
military council, led by Yilmaz, took disciplinary decisions
against some military personnel.
	   Earlier in the day, private NTV television said the council
would sack 20 officers suspected of taking part in pro-Islamic
activities.
	   The military has dismissed more than 300 officers accused of
being affiliated with Islamic groups over the past two years. The
council's decision is final and the courts have no jurisdiction.

World Cup: Savicevic's injury rocks Yugoslav team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-GALMIER, France (AP) _ A controversy about whether Dejan
Savicevic, the main Yugoslav midfielder, is fit enough to play at
the World Cup hampered the team preparations Tuesday ahead a match
against chief rivals Germany.
	   Savicevic, who has missed Yugoslavia's 1-0 World Cup opener
against Iran and most of its warmup matches, says he still feels
pain in his right knee ligaments.
	   Team officials claim the pain is imaginary, triggered by fear
after a series of injuries the AC Milan star suffered over the past
year while playing in the Italian league.
	   ``Savicevic is fit and all his problems are psychological,''
said Yugoslavia's assistant coach Vujadin Boskov. ``The problem is
that he has not been playing for two months.''
	   Other team officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Savicevic's reluctance to play or enter full practice sessions
represented a bad example for younger Yugoslav players who have
been training hard.
	   There was no comment from Savicevic who has been evading the
media since the team arrived in France.
	   The 31-year-old technical wizard, known among the fans as ``the
Genius,'' is considered the architect of Yugoslavia's play and a
spiritual leader of the team.
	   Boskov said that Savicevic is still a doubtful starter for the
match against Germany, Yugoslavia's chief rival in Group F, next
Sunday in Lens. Germany and Yugoslavia lead the group standings
with three points, ahead of Iran and the United States with none.
	   ``We still have four more days till the match, and it all
depends on Savicevic,'' Boskov, a former trainer of many top
European clubs including Real Madrid and Sampdoria, said.
	   During practice sessions in this small French village resort,
Savicevic trained mostly outside the team with the AC Milan
physical expert from Italy, Mario Luigi. On Tuesday, he joined a
slow practice session with the other teammates for the first time.
	   ``Mario says Savicevic will feel the pains for the next three
months,'' Boskov said. ``We can't wait that long.''
	   Adding to Yugoslavia's troubles are slight injuries of the
goal-scorer against Iran, central defender Sinisa Mihajlovic, and
right back Zoran Mirkovic. The two missed the joint practice
Tuesday, but are likely to be ready for the Germany game.
	   Commenting Monday's 2-0 German victory over the United States,
Boskov said: ``Both teams played better than we did against Iran.''
	   Yugoslav striker Savo Milosevic said he was ``impressed'' by the
Germans.
	   ``Germany displayed the best soccer of all teams so far at the
World Cup,'' the former Aston Villa forward said. ``We'll have to
correct many things in our game if we want a good result against
the Germans.''

	   KUALA KANGSAR, Fri. - Middle East tourists are keen to make
Malaysia their new destination for their summer vacation and good
marketing is needed to tap the market, International Trade and
Industry Minister Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz said today.
	   She said this was conveyed during her discussions with Middle
East countries during her visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates last month.
	   ``I've held discussions with representatives from the Chambers
of Commerce in Jeddah, Sharjah, Mecca (Saudi Arabia) and Dubai
(UAE) and they have expressed the wish to make Malaysia their
holiday destination during the summer months.''
	   Rafidah was speaking to newsmen after launching Mariwasa
Kraftangan Sdn Bhd's showroom and factory as Kuala Kangsar's new
tourist destination and manufacturer of Sukom souvenir products.
	   Currently Malaysia has been the transit point for Middle East
holiday makers on their way to Australia's Gold Coast.
	   Rafidah said the Kuala Lumpur 16th Commonwealth Games would be a
good way to help promote and introduce Malaysian products.
	   Mariwasa, a subsidiary of Boustead Holdings, has been appointed
by Sukom Ninety Eight Berhad to provide gold, silver, gold and
silver plated items.

	   TEGAL, Central Java (JP): At least 40 shops, a gas station and
numerous vehicles were burned when about 15,000 people were
involved in a riot with police and military personnel in the
Central Java town of Tegal yesterday.
	   The riot occurred when the demonstrators, who had assembled in
the mayoralty office compound to demand the sacking of Mayor Zakir,
were involved in a tussle with security personnel after being
expelled from the compound.
	   Tegal Military District commander Col. Amirul Lanaeni declined
to comment on the causes of the riot, while Tegal police chief Lt.
Col. Tedjo Sularso only said that prior to the outbreak
demonstrators were already throwing stones at security officers.
	   Sularso admitted that the demonstrators became angry when they
were refused access to meet the mayoralty council to deliver their
demand.
	   Sari Ali, an eyewitness, said that at least 80 were injured in
the riot, seven seriously.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (Dow Jones) _ A group of businessmen are to set
up a new Islamic investment bank in Bahrain with $100-million in
capital, a Bahraini news agency said Tuesday.
	   The bank will be called The Investors Bank and will operate
under an offshore license with a paid-up capital of $30 million,
the Gulf News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The agency did not say when the bank will open its doors.
	   The bank elected its board of directors on Monday. The chairman
is Sami al-Bader and the chief executive is Ahmed al-Janahi.
	   Al-Bader said that 99 investors are shareholders, including
institutional investors. The institutions hold about 81 percent of
the paid-up capital.
	   The shareholders include wealthy individuals from Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman.
	   The bank will operate under Islamic rules which bans the paying
or taking of interest.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Canada is to donate dlrs 1.7 million for a
waste water project in northern Jordan, an embassy official said
Tuesday.
	   A development officer at the Canadian Embassy, Nabil Anshasi,
said the project at Deir Alla, 46 kilometers (28 miles) northwest
of Amman, will employ a new technology which is ``low cost and
sustainable in the long term.''
	   The technology is based on the duckweed plant, which that floats
on waste water and absorbs its protein. The plant is then collected
and used as fertilizer.
	   Anshasi said an agreement is expected to be signed once the
project's design has been finalized.
	   The Jordanian government will contribute an unknown portion of
the funds.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some 120 Egyptian firms mounted a trade
fair in Baghdad Tuesday, trying to win contracts under Iraq's
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   Iraqi-Egyptian relations soured after Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait in 1990, but they have improved recently.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz opened the fair, telling
reporters that ``political ties between Iraq and Egypt are on the
move.''
	   The goods on display range from foodstuffs to machinery.
	   The Iraqi newspaper al-Ittihad quoted Egypt's charge d'affaires,
Mahmoud Sarhan, as saying Egypt sold dlrs 200 million worth of
goods to Iraq in the past few months.
	   Before the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq because of
the Kuwaiti invasion, Iraq imported goods worth about dlrs 500
million a year from Egypt and about two million Egyptians worked in
the country.
	   Aziz said Iraq was determined to expand trade with Egypt.

	   In the local forex market, the demand for US Dollar was moderate
yesterday. In the interbank market, the exchange rate for US Dollar
was between BDT 46.46 to BDT 46.47. The call money market just went
berserk. In the morning, the market assumed a very tight liquidity
and started borrowing at as high as 20 per cent for payment of
T-bills worth of Taka 363 crore. Some were said to discount their
T-bills due to mature on June 17 and lend it at higher rate to take
the advantage of the tipsy situation of the market. But later, the
tension in the market eased and the call rate came down between 10
per cent and 13 per cent. The call market is expected to remain
tighter as a substantial amount of T-bills maturing on June 17 has
already been discounted.
	   The US dollar reached 146 level against Yen due to backing by
commercial buying and strong bids from interbank operators. Also
the market players supported the rise of US Dollar against Yen as
the prospects of Bank of Japan's intervention and G7 actions
gradually faded. But profit taking and corrective setting is still
restraining the US Dollar from going further up. Now the market is
waiting to see how soon US Dollar reaches 150 psychological level.

Minister: Corruption threatens ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruling coalition pledging support to Mahathir,
comment from prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Corruption and nepotism will be
hot topics as the annual general assembly of Malaysia's ruling
party opens Thursday, a senior party leader said.
	   ``Corruption is a cancer which can ruin the party,'' said
Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi.
	   It could ``erode the support of the people to the government and
the party,'' Abdullah, a vice president of the United Malays
National Organization, said in an interview with the national
Bernama news agency Tuesday.
	   The call to focus on corruption, and specifically charges of
nepotism and cronyism, has come from some of the younger leaders of
the party in the aftermath of the Indonesian developments and
President Suharto's ouster.
	   The head of the powerful UMNO youth wing, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi,
said evidence of corruption and power abuse would be brought before
the general assembly. But Zahid has denied leading an assault on
the UMNO leadership.
	   In recent weeks, a former party vice president and chief
minister of Selangor state, Muhhamad Taib, was hit with corruption
charges for failing to declare colossal assets that included swanky
real estate overseas. Two of his former aides were subsequently
charged with misusing their office to influence a real estate deal.
	   The party has not listed corruption as an issue to be discussed
during the UMNO general assembly, which runs through Sunday. Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad is scheduled to address the assembly
Friday in a nationally televised speech that is expected to focus
on the economy.
	   Badawi said only two resolutions would be presented for debate
at the general assembly. One would focus on the economy, the other
on religion.
	   But the party leader in charge of vetting resolutions for debate
agreed that nepotism was a problem.
	   ``Not as serious as (in) some other countries in East Asia. But
this process of reform should be conducted within the party,
because the prime minister has advocated that UMNO be a party to
reform the Malay culture,'' said Education Minister Najib Tun Abdul
Razak, also a party vice president.
	   Najib and Abdullah both said the potentially debilitating
economic crisis would occupy center stage.
	   ``We hope the debate on the economic problems will go beyond
rhetoric ... in the sense of raising constructive ideas that would
enable the party to chart its response and approach,'' said Najib.
	   The UMNO is the dominant party in a 13-party coalition, the
National Front, which overwhelmingly represents the three ethnic
groups in Malaysia: the Malays, Chinese and Indians. This leaves
the opposition with little influence on the national scene.
	   But opposition is said to be building against Mahathir from
within his own party over leadership issues and his handling of the
economy. Political observers are anxious to see if a showdown
surfaces at the annual gathering.
	   The president of the Malaysian Chinese Association party on
Tuesday proclaimed all the parties in the ruling coalition had
pledged their full support for Mahathir.
	   ``We decided unanimously that we will stand 100 percent behind
our prime minister and his team ... including (Finance Minister)
Anwar Ibrahim and (economic adviser to the government) Daim
Zainuddin,'' said Ling Liong Sik, who is also transport minister.
	   Mahathir responded with modesty.
	   ``I'm very gratified they pledged their loyalty to me,'' he
said. ``I'm sure it's not personal. The country needs a leader, so
they pledged loyalty to the current leader.''

Celebrities, politicians celebrate Joyce in pubs _ and on Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Politicians, celebrities and academics
devoted Tuesday to celebrating James Joyce's masterwork,
``Ulysses,'' with a series of readings that filled Dublin literary
pubs and reached across the globe on the Internet.
	   The annual ``Bloomsday'' festivities chart the course of the
epic novel's protagonist, Leopold Bloom, as he wanders among the
streets and public houses of the Irish capital.
	   This year's festivities featured readings far beyond Irish
shores, which were conveyed by audio worldwide on the Irish Times
newspaper's website.
	   Starting in Melbourne, Australia, then moving next to Tokyo,
Joyce aficionados read their favorite passages from the book, which
earned Joyce the Nobel Prize for Literature but mostly scorn at the
time from his conservative countrymen.
	   In Dublin the readers included President Mary McAleese and
novelist Edna O'Brien, and in London the actress Sinead Cusack. In
Capetown, South Africa the contribution came from Kader Asmal, a
government minister and former Dublin resident.
	   In New York City, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Frank McCourt
was among the final readers scheduled to contribute.
	   Organizers said their decision to conduct readings from time
zone to time zone was inspired by the opening words of ``Ulysses,''
which read: ``Early morning, set off at dawn. Travel round in front
of the Sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever, never
grow a day older technically.''
	   ``Ulysses,'' published in Paris in 1922, was long banned from
publication in Ireland because of its irreverence towards
Catholicism and its sexual content. Today Joyce's life and work has
been embraced in Dublin with a cultural center and an international
summer school.

	   MEDAN, North Sumatra (JP): Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan
Hamid swore in yesterday Maj. Gen. Rizal Nurdin as the new governor
of North Sumatra, replacing Lt. Gen. (ret.) Radja Inal Siregar.
	   The swearing-in ceremony was held during a plenary session of
the provincial legislature presided over by speaker H.M. Iskak.
	   Nurdin, former chief of the Bukit Barisan Military Command
overseeing northern Sumatra, won the gubernatorial election in the
provincial council last month.
	   Nurdin's nomination had met opposition from several mass
organizations in the province which accused him of being involved
in nepotism since his nomination and not being supported by a
majority of the people in the province.
	   The provincial council received Nurdin's nomination after he won
the support of the Armed Forces (ABRI) leadership.
	   Syarwan asked Nurdin to eliminate collusion, corruption and
nepotism in the provincial administration.
	   ``The demands for reform in all areas in the province should be
given a positive response and accommodated in accordance with the
Constitution,'' he said.

Scrambled, soft-boiled eggs banned in Israeli army kitchens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's army is giving the boot to scrambled
eggs and sunny-side up.
	   From now on, because of food poisoning fears, only hard-boiled
eggs will be served to soldiers, the army said Tuesday.
	   New regulations, prompted by cases of salmonella poisoning among
soldiers, allow kitchens to serve only eggs that have been boiled
for at least eight minutes.
	   That means no fried, soft-boiled, poached or scrambled eggs, or
omelettes.
	   Eggs not used within a week of delivery to a unit must be thrown
away.
	   The army's Medical Corps nutrition department initiated the
regulations, which also prohibit mayonnaise and uncooked spreads
containing eggs.
	   Eggs can still be used in cakes and to coat schnitzel.

	   INTERPERSONAL conflict and aggression in the workplace are
problems facing many companies in today's fast-paced,
highly-technical, international business community.
	   Should these problems go unchecked, employees' morale and
productivity will be greatly impaired. In addition, there appears
to be an increasing number of violent episodes occurring within the
workplace.
	   Many large companies are now trying to obtain a better
understanding of the factors contributing to increasing stress
levels as well as interpersonal conflicts. They hope to develop
policies addressing how to lower stress levels, facilitate conflict
resolutions and eliminate aggression in the workplace.
	   Both individual and organisational factors may contribute to
stress and conflict in the workplace. As individuals, employees
bring to the workplace their personal history, values, belief
systems and coping mechanisms. Not surprisingly, at times they
bring worries from home to the office.
	   Depending on their own particular tolerance level, some
employees are more adept than others at not letting these personal
worries interfere with job performance and interpersonal
relationships.
	   But as stress levels rise, this becomes increasingly difficult.
An employee may then begin to display greater anxiety, less
concentration and impaired judgment and become more difficult to
get along with.
	   As job performance declines, increased pressure is often placed
on the employee to keep up with job responsibilities.
	   At this point, it would be common for the employee to experience
increasing frustration coupled with growing anger. He or she may
then begin to exhibit aggressiveness towards co-workers or
supervisors.
	   Another factor is when there is a personality clash between two
employees. They may be co-workers or supervisor and supervisee.
	   Similarly, there are interdependent conflicts between groups of
workers in the same company. These may occur along race, ethnic,
religious or gender lines, between temporary and permanent
employees, or around some other type of group distinction.
	   Other factors include particular job requirements,
organisational structure of the company, style of management and
company strength.
	   Certainly, some jobs are more stressful than others. Some
require contact with difficult customers or consumers, patients,
clients, etc.
	   Organisational structures that are unclear, poorly-defined or
are in the process of reorganisation may result in heightened
anxiety levels.
	   Also, when companies are struggling and employees are worrying
about their financial compensation and/or job status, it tends to
have a major impact on stress levels.
	   Regardless of the factors, a company's primary concern is in
managing situations so that they don't escalate to the point where
employee relationships are strained and/or violence occurs.
	   Thus, it is important to be able to identify potential problem
areas between employees and/or the early warning signs. It is also
imperative to notice when personality conflicts and job
dissatisfaction begins to get into the way of performance.
	   Should an employee exhibit these warning signs, referral should
be made either to an in-house human resource person or to an
external counselling agency.
	   A thorough assessment should be conducted with specific
attention to potential violence and/or substance abuse as this
often leads to lowered inhibitions about the use of violence. The
individual should be counselled on stress reduction skills,
interpersonal communication and conflict resolutions.
	   A clearly-defined continuum of response needs to be developed so
that the company has a planned strategy to use in these types of
situations.
	   Utilisation of mediation skills and crisis management training
are extremely important when someone is close to acting out violent
or self- destructive impulses.
	   When the conflict seems more of a personality clash, clearly
individuals need to be involved in the assessment and conflict
resolution process.
	   Once again, it is essential to understand what lies beneath the
overt conflict. The employees need assistance in finding ways to
talk about the conflict to negotiate, to brainstorm about potential
solutions, and to find ways to decide on and implement solutions.
	   Lastly, it may be essential to review the processes of
decision-making as well as grievance and dispute resolution.
Policies need to be developed with regard to sensitive issues such
as employee discipline, discrimination complaints and termination.
	   The writer is a licensed clinical social worker, trained in the
United States and will be speaking at a seminar organised by the
Taman Desa Psychological Counselling and Testing Centre, entitled
``Managing Male Aggressive Behaviour in the Family,'' on June 18 at
7pm in Kuala Lumpur.

	   JAKARTA (JP): IMF Asia-Pacific director Hubert Neiss has been
busy working out the formula to help restore Indonesia's ailing
economy. Neiss, who left the country for Washington two weeks ago
to report to the fund's executive board, returned last Wednesday.
	   Unlike on previous visits, Neiss held meetings with
nongovernment figures, mostly politicians, to learn about the
situation in Indonesia since the May 21 resignation of former
president Soeharto.
	   This indicates that the IMF, which never interferes in a
country's political affairs, is now trying to weigh up the
political future of this country.
	   But Neiss has kept the IMF's next step obscure. He was quoted by
Bisnis Indonesia as saying that the next tranche of the IMF's aid
for Indonesia was likely to be disbursed next month. But he said
the decision would be made by the fund's executive board.
	   More confusing is his recent statement that he would first study
the latest conditions in Indonesia, indicating that almost all the
assumptions the IMF had used to make its past decisions are now
changing. Does it mean that all or most of the agreed points in its
reform programs will be changed?
	   Why does Neiss need to come to Jakarta again and again to make
these studies? If he sticks to the old matrices but wants to follow
hour-to-hour political developments in Indonesia, he is likely to
become perpetually confused in writing reports to Washington given
the rapid social and political changes.
	   The basic question now is whether the IMF and its donors will
disburse the remainder of their pledged aid of US$43 billion in
bulk or in small doses to help Indonesia overcome its pressing
economic problems.
	   If the IMF sustains such procedures, the effectiveness of its
assistance to overcome Indonesia's economic difficulties is
questionable. In almost a year it has disbursed only the first
tranche of its aid. Most of the time has been used ferrying, at
great expense, its staff to and from Jakarta, while there has been
``no action but talking only'' (NATO).
	   Meanwhile, the economy continues to deteriorate with the annual
inflation rate rising to more than 100 percent, a lot of factories
closing down and the number of unemployed people increasing to 20
million. The danger of starvation is lurking, forcing the country
to import three million tons of rice.
	   Many ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs have lost their businesses
after their shops were vandalized in the mid-May rioting, while
some of them have left the country. Many good professionals prefer
to stay and look for jobs in countries where they have graduated.
	   The IMF has made many mistakes so that it has lost much of the
momentum to help overcome Indonesia's economic difficulties.
	   The IMF, for example, failed to help strengthen the rupiah when
it considered the currency's equilibrium value Rp 5,000 to the U.S.
dollar -- before being revised downward to Rp 6,000.
	   It was still convinced the rupiah would strengthen if the reform
programs were accomplished. But events have proven it wrong and the
rupiah fell further, to Rp 15,000 on June 11.
	   Had the IMF, as I suggested in my article on Feb. 23, disbursed
$20 billion of its aid then, the rupiah would then have
strengthened to Rp 5,000 per dollar and investors would have
repatriated their dollars again into Indonesia.
	   The fatal decision of the IMF was the closing down of 16
insolvent private banks without a full guarantee on the return of
their depositors' funds in October. This drove depositors to rush
on other private banks to cash in their savings and move them to
state-owned and foreign banks.
	   The government's announcement on the full guarantee of savings
came too late because the central bank was forced to print money --
more than Rp 100 trillion ($7.7 billion) -- for bailing out the
banks affected by the rush.
	   Panicked by such developments, Bank Indonesia raised interest
rates on its short-term promissory notes, SBIs, to up to 58
percent, thereby driving commercial banks to increase lending rates
to about 60 percent to 70 percent a year. As a result, companies
highly dependent on loans were forced to close down.
	   The IMF's reform programs are aimed at abolishing market
distortions but it fails to introduce emergency programs to push up
the rupiah's value. This is like trying to mend a broken house but
the ailing patient in it is left without any efficacious drugs. As
soon as the house is mended, the patient dies.
	   What Indonesia needs is a national leader who can invite the
people to sustain further suffering while struggling without
precipitating social unrest. B.J. Habibie seems to be unable to do
this. If he stays much longer, social explosions are likely to
erupt. So, it is becoming an urgency to replace the national
leader.

	   Countrywide tree plantation drive, tree fair launched
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Monday said tree is essential for
protecting the environment, eliminating anxiety in lives and
creating dynamism in economy.
	   ``Trees in one hand are improving the environment and on the
other helping improve the socio-economic condition of the people,''
she said inaugurating the national tree plantation campaign at
Dhanmondi Play ground Monday afternoon.
	   Forest and Environment Ministry has launched the
three-month-long country wide tree plantation drive and a 15-day
tree fair at Dhanmondi ground.
	   Forest and Environment Minister Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Alhaj
Moqbul Hossain, MP, and Forest and Environment Secretary Ahbab
Ahmed also spoke on the occasion.
	   The government has taken a vast afforestation programme for the
region, Hasina said mentioning that Tk 136.50 crore will be spent
for tree plantation in the hilly areas.
	   After the restoration of peace in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
region, she said. a scope has been created for massive
afforestation in the prospective areas.
	   She said in last two decades, huge trees were destroyed in the
CHT region creating an adverse effect on the ecology, wild life and
inhabitants of the region.
	   Even the Kaptai Lake was affected by the destruction of trees
and power generation was hampered, she said adding that scarcity of
raw materials of paper and rayon mills were also created for this
reason.
	   The Prime Minister said the government has taken a massive
programme for expansion, development and preservation of the forest
resources.
	   ``We have taken a massive social afforestation programme, the
forestry Sector Project, at a cost of Tk 400 crore to strengthen
rural economy by creating and developing forest resources,'' she
said.
	   This massive project will be implemented through the direct
participation of the people, Hasina said.
	   She said the country's forest area has been gradually shrinking
due to increase of population and unabated destruction of trees.
	   In ideal condition, the country needs at least as per cent of
forest areas, but it is much more less than the requirement, she
added.
	   Referring to the green belt in the coastal areas, she said the
green belt has been created along 1,533 kilometre areas of the
coasts, she said.
	   This will help protecting the people from cyclone and tidal
surges and help improve the living condition of the coastal poor
people, the Prime Minister added.
	   Referring to the Sundarbans, the Prime Minister said it is the
single largest mangrove forest of the world, which has been
declared as the ``World heritage site''.
	   ``We want to project the natural beauty of the Sundarbans though
echo-tourism.''
	   Programmes have also been taken to rehabilitate the unemployed.
neglected freedom fighters through afforestation programme. Some
10,000 freedom fighters' family will be benefited through this
programme.
	   In the historic Mujibnagar site in Meherpur, she said, the
government will build the Mujibnagar complex, where six big gardens
will be created to mark the six-point movement.
	   ``Many mills and factories of our country are totally dependent
on forest resources for their raw materials,'' the Prime Minister
said.
	   In some cases scarcity of raw materials has been created for the
destruction of trees, she said suggesting the people to go for
afforestation programme to overcome the problem.
	   She also stressed on cultivation of herbal plants and protection
of wild life for ecological balance.
	   ``You will have to plant at least one fruit-bearing tree and one
timber producing tree,'' she told the gathering and called upon the
people to plant more trees for the national interest.
	   Hasina also mentioned the steps those the Father of the Nation
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had taken for protection of
environment and expansion of forest.
	   Earlier, the Prime Minister planted a Ashak sapling and an Olive
sapling at the Dhanmondi ground and visited different stalls of the
tree fair. She also enjoyed a cultural function titled ``Tree and
life''.
	   Some 70 stalls have been set up in the tree fair with huge and
varieties of collections of saplings.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- The Italian coast guard patrolling the

	   The ``Luckymar'' vessel belongs to the Lebanese ``Marco Mar
Lines'', the crew was from Cyprus. The ship sailed under a
Cambodian flag, ATA said.
	   It was captured by the Italian financial police patrolling the

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Tuesday.
	   Two Israeli jets attacked the deserted village of Sojod in Iqlim
el-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied
border enclave in southern Lebanon, said Lebanese security
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Twenty minutes later, the jets returned to fire two
air-to-surface missiles on Aqmata, a village a few kilometers east
of Sojod and 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of Nabatiyeh, the
major market town in the south, the officials added.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the stricken areas, but
there was no word on casualties. The Israeli military confirmed the
raids and said the planes returned safely.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah is a frequent target of Israeli warplanes.
	   The area is used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese
militiamen from the border enclave, which Israel set up in 1985.

	   JAKARTA (JP): International Monetary Fund (IMF) Asia Pacific
director Hubert Neiss estimated yesterday that the Indonesian
budget deficit in the 1998/99 fiscal year would be significantly
higher than the initial estimate of 3.2 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP).
	   ``We have to accommodate more (expenditure) for subsidies and a
program to help small-scale businesses so the deficit will be
significantly above previous assumptions of below 4 percent,''
Neiss told members of the House of Representatives here.
	   He told the Inter-Parliamentary Cooperation Body (BKAP) that the
government had no choice but to raise expenditure on social welfare
programs such as food and fuel subsidies to minimize the impact of
the economic crisis.
	   It would also have to increase expenditure on health, education
and job creation schemes.
	   The supplementary agreement between Indonesia and the IMF,
signed here in April, states that the budget deficit for the
1998/99 fiscal year should be limited to 3.2 percent of GDP.
	   One hundred and three BKAP members signed a letter addressed to
the IMF managing director Michel Camdessus urging the fund to
quickly resume disbursement of loans to help restore the country's
economy.
	   The IMF brokered a US$43 billion bailout program, $10 billion of
which comes from the fund itself, to help lift the Indonesian
economic crisis. So far $4 billion has been disbursed.
	   A further $1 billion was due on June 4 but was delayed following
last month's massive riots which led to a change of the presidency.
	   The body handed the letter over to Neiss during yesterday's two
hour meeting.
	   At the meeting, Neiss also said that the year-end exchange rate
target of Rp 6,000 to the U.S. dollar was no longer realistic and
must be revised.
	   Neiss refused to make a forecast, but said the exchange rate
would be likely to be below Rp 11,000 to the dollar.
	   The rupiah closed at 14,700 to the dollar yesterday, compared to
its pre-crisis level of 2,450 last July.
	   Neiss noted the importance of keeping interest rates high to
prevent the rupiah from sinking even further.
	   Monetary policy should be conducted ``in way that doesn't lead
to an outbreak of hyperinflation'', he said.
	   Neiss suggested several measures to help relieve the effect of
high interest rates on business, including interest rate subsidies
for small and medium sized enterprises.
	   Neiss said the IMFs immediate objective was to rehabilitate the
distribution network for essential goods.
	   It also hoped to speed up the rehabilitation of the banking
system to prevent collapse of the country's banking sector, he
said.
	   He pledged to finish his task in Indonesia as expeditiously as
he could and to avoid any unnecessary delay, but stressed that his
work could not be done overnight.
	   ``Overcoming the crisis is not only urgent for Indonesia but
also for the rest of the world because the crisis affects other
countries,'' he said.
	   But he quickly asserted that recovery lay solely in the hands of
Indonesia.
	   ``The IMF and other agencies can make a useful contribution ...
and provide financing needs, but only Indonesia itself is in
control of events,'' he said.
	   Asked whether the country's political situation had delayed the
disbursement of loan installments, Neiss said the IMF never set any
political conditions.
	   ``If you look in all the letters of intent there's no mention of
any political conditions,'' he said
	   However, political stability was important for economic programs
to succeed, he said.
	   ``That's no condition, that's a fact of life.''

	   UNITED Engineers (Malaysia) Bhd said that the regional trial
court of Makati, Manila in the Philippines, has lifted the
temporary restraining order on UEM Mara Philippines Corporation
(UMPC) which restrained the latter from collecting toll on the
Manila-Cavite Toll Expressway. However, the same petitioner,
Ernesto B. Francisco Jr has immediately thereafter filed a motion
requesting the court to reconsider its decisions. This subject is
still pending court hearing but UMPC has commenced toll collection
on June 11, 1998.

	   Diplomats of western countries and government leaders in a
meeting in Dhaka Monday unanimously agreed to consolidate peace and
accelerate development process in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
	   The diplomats and the UNDP representative met members of the
special cell on Chittagong Hill Tracts at the Planning Ministry for
a review of the CHT situation and programmes.
	   Officials said the envoys were apprised of various steps taken
for peace and development in the Hill Tracts and the programmes
taken up by the Planning Commission.
	   The government, in principle, endorsed the programmes prescribed
in the report made by a recent UNDP mission sent to the hill
districts.
	   State Minister for Planning, Science and Technology Dr Mohiuddin
Khan Alamgir thanked the UNDP for sending a 'Need Assessment
Mission' for the hill region's reconstruction and development after
restoration of peace there.
	   ``The government has very carefully examined the mission's
report,'' the Minister told the foreigners.
	   Chief Whip of Jatiya Sangsad Abul Hasnat Abdullah also attended
the meeting.
	   The UNDP resident representative and ambassadors and
representatives of the USA, Canada and European countries were

	   TIMBERMASTER Industries Bhd confirmed that it is aborting the
proposed acquisitions of the entire equity interests in Masaha Sdn
Bhd and Cheraka Plantation (M) Sdn Bhd as it could no longer raise
funds for the transactions. It said the restrictive measures
imposed on corporate proposals by the government, in its effort to
address the economic crisis, has affected its position adversely
and has left it with no alternative but to abort the proposals.
Following this, the previous sale and purchase agreements and
supplemental agreements signed to acquire both companies were
rescinded.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's top brass and premier jointly
announced at the end of an emergency meeting on Tuesday that
radical Islamic activities were deemed as a domestic threat,
according to a statement.
	   The military called the meeting apparently to pressure Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz into stepping up the fight against radical
Islamic groups, which want to turn Turkey into a religious state.
	   The military, which has staged three coups since the 1960s, has
asserted itself as the guarantor of the modern Turkish state in
this predominantly Muslim but secular country. Last year, the
military forced Turkey's first Islamic-led government to resign.
	   The statement also said that in the emergency meeting, the high
military council, led by Yilmaz, took disciplinary decisions
against some military personnel.
	   Earlier in the day, private NTV television said the council
would sack 20 officers suspected of taking part in pro-Islamic
activities.
	   The military has dismissed more than 300 officers accused of
being affiliated with Islamic groups over the past two years. The
council's decision is final and the courts have no jurisdiction.

	   I GIVE up. I've tried shame, but it seems Malaysians have none.
I've tried sarcasm, but people take me literally.
	   Violence excepting, I HAVE RUN OUT OF WAYS to say that the
CINEMA IS NOT THE PLACE in which to HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON YOUR
MOBILE PHONE.
	   Thankfully, Tanjong Golden Village Cinemas has somewhat
lightened my burden.
	   As of May 1, patrons are reminded via an advertisement
(pictures) to turn off their telephones before each film.
	   I am grateful. Because despite my earlier haughty tone, I often
forget to turn the darned thing off when I should.
	   It rings at the most inopportune moments - during meetings, in
church (once), and most recently and mortifyingly, when I was in
the cinema, viewing the ad to write this story! ``We have signs to
remind patrons, and from time to time, ushers do tell them to turn
their phones off. But obviously, this isn't working,'' said Pauline
Ng, marketing manager of TGV.
	   Remind is the key word. The ones who desperately fumble in their
pockets or bags when they hear the dreaded Rrrrring, will be
thankful to be told in advance.
	   But the patron who natters on unperturbed during a film is made
of different, impenetrable stuff. Earlier this year, reader
Kamariah Mohamed said her RM9 ticket included not just a film, but
also running commentaries from viewers, bawling babies, hyperactive
kids, oblivious parents, and now loud phone conversations. The only
thing missing, she said, were flashers.
	   In another incident, also highlighted by a reader, a viewer gave
a loud, blow-by-blow account of the film into his phone.
	   Sadly, there is no threat backing up this new reminder.
Customers who insist on being rude will not be shot or hanged. They
won't even be removed.
	   And given that a cineplex has up to 10 screens, ushers do not
stay in one hall for the duration of a film.
	   The absence of an official presence naturally makes
troublemakers bolder. It also means anyone wishing to make a
complaint will have to go outside the hall to alert an usher. If
the usher cannot deal with the problem, the manager will have to be
called in, and still there is no guarantee the disturbance will be
quietened.
	   ``And a 10-minute scene is far more disruptive than a
five-minute phone- call,'' says Ng.
	   I went to university in a very small, very quiet town in the
dreaded West.
	   Before the start of every film at the local cinema, a plain
black-and- white slide would appear, with the followng text:
``Patrons are reminded that this is a no-smoking cinema.''
	   There wasn't much in the way of entertainment, so the place was
always packed, mainly with young, boisterous students.
	   Yet in four years, I didn't see a single person light up.
	   If it worked there, I'd like to think it would work here.
	   TGV ushers and cinema managers report a significant drop in
mobile phone usage, while cinema-goers still come back with tales
of woe. So far, it is too early to say.
	   I'm tempted to say it will take more - a moving commercial,
moral and all, with a dire threat backing it.
	   But if so, what kind of people are we, that we need laborious
lessons in common decency?
	   Still, I live in hope. It could happen - out of the cobalt blue.

	   JS told Education Minister ASHK Sadique Monday informed the
Jatiya Sangsad that his ministry had almost completed the
preparation of a comprehensive report on improving the public
examination system for raising the standard of education.
	   Responding to a question raised by Jatiya Party Whip Advocate
Fazle Rabbi on adoption of unfairmeans in the public examination by
a section of students, the Education Minister sought the
cooperation of all in stopping this bad practice and said he would
soon place before the House a comprehensive report in this regard.
	   The Education Minister said it is true that at a number of
examination centres there is a growing trend of adoption of
unfairmeans by a section of students and it should be stopped.
	   But, he asserted, there are also a large number of centres where
there has not been a single incident of unfairmeans and those
institutions have proven good track record.
	   The Minister said it is also true that by adopting unfairmeans
no one can achieve good results but the very practice contaminates
the examination system.
	   He said it is very difficult to carry any reform programmes in
public examination system in a country like Bangladesh.
	   Saidque said ``We have to take actions against those students
who adopt unfairmeans irrespective of party affiliation.
	   Earlier, the Jatiya Party Whip brought to the notice of the
House that there is a growing trend of adoption of unfairmeans by a
large number of students pollute the entire public examination
system which needs drastic reforms.
	   Advocate Rabbi said it should be dealt strongly without favour
to any section of the students who resorts to terrorism and
unfairmeans.
	   The government has imported 1.54 lakh metric tons of wheat and
83,000 metric tons of rice till June 8 of the current fiscal year
to meet food deficit.
	   Food Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury told this in the Parliament
yesterday responding to Mohammad Fazlul Azim of BNP.
	   The import was made in cash of Tk 215.44 crore, she said, adding
that the food deficit could be met by the present stock of food.
	   Motia informed the House that the present stock of rice was
146,682 metric tons and that of wheat 486,595 metric tons (till 28
May).
	   The total stock of rice and wheat will reach at 5.66 lakh metric
tons if another 80,000 metric tons of wheat from donors commitment
is added with the present stock.
	   Replying to another question from Prof Panna Kaiser of Awami
League the Food Minister said that during the present IRRI-Boro
season the government has so far (till June 6, 1998) procured
16,698 metric tons of rice which is about 8.39 per cent of the
target.
	   Procurement of paddy during the current season registered 8.39
per cent of the target (two lakh metric tons) by the first week of
this month (June).
	   This was stated by Food Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury yesterday
in reply to a question from ruling Awami League member Prof Panna
Kaiser.

Thailand to allow 49 percent foreign holding in national airline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Foreigners will be allowed to own up to
49 percent of the shares in the national airline, Thai Airways
International, Thailand's Cabinet decided Tuesday.
	   The preliminary approval to increase the maximum foreign
shareholding from 30 percent came as the government was preparing
to sell part of the Finance Ministry's 93 percent holding in the
airline.
	   The Cabinet said in a statement that under the government's
privatization program, the state will hold no more than 49 percent
in any state enterprises.
	   Thailand agreed to accelerate privatization under the terms of a
dlrs 17.2 billion bailout loan organized last year by the
International Monetary Fund to help the country deal with its
currency crisis.
	   The Cabinet said that because of the continuing economic
downturn, it believed local investors would take only 15 percent of
any offering of Thai Airways shares. It said the remaining 85
percent would have to be sold overseas, which would push the
foreign holding over the 30 percent currently allowed by the
aviation law.
	   The Cabinet's proposed amendment to the law needs approval from
Parliament.
	   Last week, Supachai Pisitvanich, the Finance Ministry's
permanent secretary, told reporters the Cabinet had authorized the
Finance Ministry to sell 235 million shares in Thai Airways. He
said the Cabinet had also approved the issuance by the airline of
100 million additional shares to raise capital.
	   Thai Airways has not set a price for these shares.

	   PONTIAN, Fri. - The theory of a rejected suitor is one of two
motives which the police are investigating as they probe into the
horrific killings of a smallholder, his wife and their two children
at a farm house in Benut.
	   The other motive, which the police have not ruled out in their
investigation, is the probability of rivalry stemming from a failed
business transaction.
	   Based on these motives, the police have detained six people in
connection with the killings of Redzuan Mansur, 55, his wife Rosnah
Busari, 44, their soon-to-be married daughter Hamsah, 20, and son,
Mohd Azizul, eight, at the house in Kampung Parit Hj Arif near
Parit Madirono.
	   The six, including an Indonesian immigrant, were picked up by
police in a series of raids in the village between last night and
early today.
	   The senseless killings - believed to have occurred between
Sunday evening and Monday morning - have left the farming community
in Benut, stunned.
	   District police chief Superintendant Gingkoi Seman Pancras said
the police were working on two main motives - that of a rejected
suitor and business rivalry.
	   ``We are awaiting the results of the forensic tests and
chemistry analysis which we believe, might give us more clues.
	   ``We have seized three parangs, a kitchen knife and a pair of
scissors from the farm house to facilitate investigations, he
added.
	   On Wednesday evening, the partly-decomposed bodies of the four
deceased were discovered by Hamsah's fiance, Md Zali Tarhib, and
her sister Misiah, at the house.
	   The bodies of Redzuan, Rosnah and Mohd Azizul were found piled
on a bed in one of the bedrooms. They were hacked on their necks,
the impact of which almost severed the heads of Redzuan and Azizul.
	   In another bedroom, Hamsah's semi-nude body was found lying
face-up, with a towel stuffed in the mouth, a pillow over the face,
and strangulation marks on the neck.
	   She was believed to have died of suffocation and shock while
being raped.
	   The dead couple's two older daughters live away from home.
	   Rosnah's brother, labourer Kassim Kasari, described Redzuan and
Rosnah as ``very ordinary kampung farming folk who mingled well
with the people in the community''.
	   ``Redzuan was very much a farmer at heart. He never had a bank
account and had the odd habit of keeping all his savings at home,''
he said.
	   The bodies of the four victims were buried at the Masjid Lubok
Sipat cemetery late yesterday, after post-mortems at the Sultanah
Aminah Hospital in Johor Baru.
	   Meanwhile, police have offered a RM20,000 reward to anyone with
information leading to the arrest of the person or persons
responsible for the murder.
	   In a statement issued tonight, State Criminal Investigation
Department chief Senior Assistant Commissioner II Mohd Mokhtar
Hassan urged anyone with the above information to contact him at
tel 07-2202206 or Pontian CID chief Assistant Superintendant V.
Puspanathan at tel 07-6871222.
	   He said the informants could also call the Benut police station
at tel 07-6903222 or the nearest police station.

	   The Dhanmondi Club ground has become a place of greenery as the
fortnight-long Tree Fair '98 started there Monday.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Monday inaugurated the Tree Fair
and a three-month-long country-wide Tree Plantation Drive.
	   About 70 stalls of different organisations - both government and
private - are displaying hundreds of species of rare as well as
common varieties of plants and herbs in the Fair. The exhibits
include common trees like mango and banana, different varieties of
colourful orchids and cactuses, ornamental plants and colourful
ferns, miniature forms of huge trees like the banyan in pots called
``bonsai'' and rare medicinal plants.
	   A bonsai one hundred year old banyan tree attracted the
attention of visitors. The employees at the stall of the Barisal
nursery where the bonsai was kept said that the tree was also
displayed in the last year's Tree Fair and a customer had offered
Tk 60,000 for the plant.
	   Small mango trees in pots bearing mangoes at Rangabon Nursery
drew many visitors. Among some 250 species of plants being
displayed at the Rangabon nursery is the Agar plant. This plant is
used for making very costly perfumes, said an employee of the
nursery.
	   Among the exhibits of Mahua Bon nursery are several species of
colourful ornamental plants including American Red Palm plant and
American ferns. Mahua Bon Nursery won the first prize at the
national flower exhibition held at Dhaka International Trade Fair
in '98. Farkunda Akhter of Mahua Bon Nursery said the Tree Fair was
not being effective because there was no follow-up programmes.
	   Dr Ferdousi Begum, a biotechnologist working with the
organisation named ``Development of Biotechnology &AMP; Environmental
Conservation (Debtec)''. She has set up a stall at the Fair. Many
medicinal plants of rare varieties were being lost due to lack of
proper steps to preserve those she said, and added that plants
could be saved from extinction through tissue culture. She said
plantation of common varieties of trees and plants are encouraged
but almost no steps have been taken to save these rare species. She
said, the practice of monoculture' was doing the damage and making
it impossible to preserve bio-diversity in this region.
	   Dr Ferdousi Begum said many medicinal plants like
``Sarpagandha'' and ``Nayantara'' were now on the verge of
extinction. She said Sarpagandha is a medicinal plant having the
property of reducing blood pressure while Nayantara has anti-cancer
substances in it. She said there were more than 3000 species of
medicinal plants in the country. She said special steps should be
taken to preserve these plants.
	   Dr Ferdousi said old people and mentally retarded persons who
are incapable of doing heavy physical labour could be employed for
preserving medicinal plants.
	   Sandipan Pratibandi School of Panchdona in Narsingdi has set up
a stall at the Tree Fair. Masuda Faruk Ratna of the School said she
became involved with the organisation after her son became mentally
retarded due to wrong treatment. She got her son admitted into the
School. She said the School was established on a plot of land
donated by the noted neurosurgeon Dr. Rashiduddin. She said 31
students of the School, under the supervision of two teachers, were
taking care of different plants, especially medicinal plants. Ratna
said by retarded people could be turned into a productive workforce
by involving them with such activities.
	   During the fortnight long Tree Fair at the Dhanmondi Club ground
different cultural organisations will present cultural programmes
in the afternoon. The programmes include Folk Songs, Gamvira, Baul
songs, Bhaoaia songs and folk dance. The organisations include
Bulbul Lalitkala Academy, Ansar and VDP Sangeet Dal, Santal Shilpi
Gosthi of Dinajpur and Tribal Cultural Institute, Rangamati. The
artists who will participate include Quddus Bayati, Abdur Rahman
Bayati, Indra Mohan Rajbangshi, Deepti Rajbangshi, Rathindranath
Roy and Kangalini Sufia.

Polish train engineers threaten nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish train engineers, demanding pay
raises and early retirement schemes, threatened to go on strike
after breaking off negotiations with the government on Tuesday.
	   The action could be prevented and negotiations resumed if the
government spokesman apologizes for calling the strike political,
according to the head of the engineers union, Jan Zaborowski.
	   The union leader said the spokesman, Jaroslaw Sellin, had until
8 p.m. to apologize. Otherwise, some trains could be idled
Wednesday, he said, without offering further details.
	   Sellin ruled out any apology and appealed to the engineers to
reconsider their plan.
	   ``We count on reason,'' he said. ``This will be a blow not
against the government but against ... the people.''
	   Transport ministry officials said they were nearing an agreement
after weeks of negotiations. But the engineers broke off the talks
Tuesday morning.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said the union action was discrepant
with labor procedures. He added the government was prepared for the
action.
	   The engineers want a 300-zloty (dlrs-88) raise in their monthly
pay, currently about 1,000 zlotys (dlrs 300).
	   They want to be eligible for retirement at 55 if they have
worked for at least 20 years. They want the age limit dropped for
those who have worked for at least 30 years. The current retirement
age is 65 for men and 60 for women.
	   In addition, the engineers want the government to funnel 1
percent of its annual budget to subsidize the railways, which are
strapped for cash but need to lower prices to compete with cheaper
road travel.

	   LUMUT, Fri. - The Defence Ministry will spend RM2 million to
ship military equipment, contributed by British defence companies,
to Malaysia following the withdrawal of the 795-strong Malaysian
Contingent V from Bosnia- Herzergovina.
	   Its Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar said the vehicles would
be shipped back using Malaysian International Shipping Corporation
vessels next month.
	   ``We consider the cost economical. Anyway we did not pay for the
vehicles as they were loaned to us,'' he told reporters after
witnessing the passing-out parade of 228 Royal Malaysian Navy
Volunteer Reserves at the RMN base here.
	   The volunteers will be based in Labuan, Sandakan, Tawau,
Kuching, Kuantan, Penang, Manjung, Klang and Johor.
	   Among the RM26 million worth of military equipment are soft-skin
vehicles.
	   Malaysian troops, working under the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation's Stabilisation Force, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, operated
in sectors placed under British command.
	   Syed Hamid said the Ministry would spend several million ringgit
more to bring its military assets back to Malaysia following the
end of S-For mandate on June 30.
	   The assets include armoured personnel carriers, weapons and
other equipment.
	   The first batch of Malcon V troops arrived at the Royal
Malaysian Air Force base in Subang last night. The remainder will
arrive in two batches on June 23 and July 10 respectively.
	   Over the past three years, Malaysia sent some 10,000 men to
Bosnia at a cost of over RM1 billion.
	   On RMN Volunteer Reserves, he said the navy hoped to recruit
5,000 volunteers by the year 2000.

11.
	   Chief Inspector Lim Nee Kon told magistrate Manoj Kurup that
Liew had been certified fit to stand trial based on a report from
the Sarawak Mental Hospital.
	   Liew was alleged to have murdered Chong Boi Kuan about noon on
April 20.
	   She faces the mandatory death sentence under Section 302 of the
Penal Code if convicted.

default six months' imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to
possessing Ecstasy pills on April 1, 1997.
	   Tiong Hing Siong was accused of possessing four Ecstacy pills at
the Kuching International Airport here.
	   He was charged under Section 12(3) of the Dangerous Drugs Act,

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas warned
yesterday that a referendum on East Timor's status, as demanded by
some East Timorese, would likely lead to clashes between supporters
and opponents of integration with Indonesia.
	   Alatas also dismissed the notion that a referendum would solve
the East Timor problem.
	   ``A referendum is something that we think is inappropriate and
is unacceptable to the majority of the East Timorese people because
they feel that they have already decided (the issue) several years
ago.
	   ``A referendum, by the way, would also be something fraught with
all kinds of risks,'' he told reporters in his office.
	   A group of about 20 young East Timorese staged a demonstration
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, denouncing calls for
reform and stating their support for East Timor to remain a part of
Indonesia.
	   On Friday, some 1,000 East Timorese students from various cities
in Java converged on the ministry to call for a referendum on the
status of the former Portuguese colony.
	   The government has insisted that the question of East Timor's
status was settled when a group of East Timorese leaders,
representing the majority of the population, declared their
intention to join the republic in 1976.
	   Alatas said that those calling for a referendum were ``the very
parties which did not even want anything close to a referendum or a
democratically achieved solution.''
	   He was apparently referring to Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ramos
Horta and the Fretilin movement which has been fighting for an
independent East Timor.
	   ``They preferred to solve the East Timor issue through force of
arms when political parties in East Timor declared for integration.
Now, they are turning around and becoming defenders of a
referendum.''
	   Alatas underscored President B.J. Habibie's offer to grant a
special status for East Timor to break the current impasse in
negotiations with Portugal on the status of the territory.
	   ``I hope the other side will not just react in a negative way
before even knowing what the context is,'' he said. ``We need the
political will to try to move (forward) to find a solution
acceptable to both sides.''
	   Indonesia and Portugal have been conducting negotiations on East
Timor under the auspices of the UN secretary-general.
	   A group of activists calling themselves the Committee for
Solidarity for a Peaceful Solution to East Timor met with
legislators from the Armed Forces yesterday to call on the
government to allow a referendum to take place in East Timor to
resolve the problem once and for all.
	   ``The anti-integration demonstrations, the growing calls for a
referendum and the increasing number of East Timorese seeking
political asylum overseas are evidence East Timor is a problem that
needs solving,'' Helmy Fauzi, coordinator of the group, said.
	   Other activists present included Hendardi, H.J.C. Princen, Bonar
Tigor Naipospos and Yenny Rosa Damayanti.
	   Supporters of East Timor's integration said the call for a
referendum betrayed the Balibo Declaration made by their leaders in
1976.
	   Former East Timor governor Mario Viegas Carrascalao said those
calling for reform never thought of the consequences for East Timor
if it split from Indonesia.
	   ``It's suicidal. East Timor does not have the capacity to stand
on its own,'' Carrascalao said as reported by Antara.
	   Domingos MD Soares, chairman of the Center for Development
Studies in East Timor, said integration with Indonesia remained the
best course for East Timor's advancement in the future.

resignation date, ADDS background. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and an
opposition leader have formalized a deal reached earlier this month
to hold early elections in April, the opposition chief said
Tuesday.
	   Deniz Baykal, the leader of the Republican People's Party, a
social democrat party, told his deputies that he and Yilmaz signed
the agreement that calls for Yilmaz to resign by the end of the
year.
	   A caretaker government would then lead the country to elections,
which should be held either on April 18 or April 25, according to
the agreement.
	   Baykal did not say when the agreement was signed. Turkish
newspapers said it was signed Monday.
	   Baykal had been pushing for early elections in return for his
party's continued support to Yilmaz's minority government,
especially on issues of tax reform and a bill aimed at curbing
radical Islam.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year in a coalition of his
center-right Motherland Party, the Democratic Left Party and the
Democratic Turkey Party after the military forced the previous,
Islamic-led government out of power.
	   No single party has gathered enough votes to have an absolute
majority in parliament since 1991, and three governing coalitions
have collapsed since 1995.

	   PENANG, Fri. - Researchers from three local universities will
carry out a survey to determine if lead poisoning has lowered the
intelligence levels of pre-schoolers in Sabah. The 12-month
exercise is to begin in August.
	   It has been commissioned by the Sabah Foundation and involves
Universiti Sains Malaysia's National Poison Centre together with
researchers from Universiti Putra Malaysia and Universiti
Kebangsaan Malaysia.
	   USM's poison centre director, Professor Dzulkifli Abdul Razak
told the New Straits Times the study was a follow-up to a 1995
survey on lead poisoning among 435 pre-schoolers in Sabah.
	   Covering 13 kindergartens in six districts in Sabah, it revealed
that seven per cent of children had an excessive level of
10-microgrammes of lead in their bodies.
	   ``Studies carried out in countries like the United Kingdom and
the United States have shown that this amount of lead in the body
can affect IQ levels.
	   ``The Sabah Foundation therefore has agreed with our proposal
for follow- up action and monitoring of the 120 children,''
Dzulkifli said.
	   ``Studies on lead poisoning among children are done routinely in
developed countries,'' he added.
	   He said the earlier study showed 20.7 per cent of the 435 pupils
had between five and 9.9 microgrammes of lead in their bodies while
72.4 per cent had between zero and 4.9 microgrammes.
	   ``From the study, three districts - Ranau, Kota Belud and Tuaran
- can be categorised as high risk areas.
	   The other districts in the study were Papar, Kota Kinabalu and
Penampang.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After publication of an article on Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's contacts with reporters, a U.S. federal
judge summoned key lawyers for an unusual evening proceeding behind
closed doors.
	   Two of Starr's deputies were among a crowd of lawyers who
arrived at the U.S. courthouse Monday evening. White House Counsel
Charles Ruff and a deputy were there, along with David Kendall,
President Clinton's private lawyer; Neil Eggleston, the private
attorney representing the White House in a dispute over a
presidential aide's testimony; and the three-man legal team
representing Monica Lewinsky: Plato Cacheris, Jacob Stein and
Nathaniel Speights.
	   While nobody would comment on the proceeding on orders of Chief
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, Starr took aim at a
magazine article that asserted he was illegally leaking evidence
from grand jury witnesses by giving background briefings to
reporters.
	   ``Let me now be clear,'' Starr said in a statement. ``The OIC
(Office of Independent Counsel) does not release grand jury
material, directly or indirectly, on the record or off the record;
the OIC does not violate Department of Justice policy or applicable
ethical guidelines and the OIC does not release (and never has
released) information provided by a witness during witness
interviews except as authorized by law.''
	   But Rep. John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee, said the article published over the weekend in
Brill's Content, a new magazine on the news media, ``raised
profound questions about whether he (Starr) is qualified to remain
serving as independent counsel.''
	   Starr acknowledged to author Steven Brill that he and a top aide
gave briefings to reporters about his investigation of the alleged
presidential affair and cover-up involving Ms. Lewinsky, but only
on condition the sources of the information not be identified.
Brill claimed Starr broke the law.
	   Starr responded Monday that ``Mr. Brill's statements ... are
false.''
	   Brill was not available for comment, his office said.
	   Johnson called the hearing to discuss Brill's allegations after
the president's private attorney, Kendall, inquired about the
status of his earlier complaint accusing Starr of illegal leaks,
said a source familiar with the proceedings.
	   The judge set a hearing for July, the source said.
	   Federal Election Commission records show Brill made a dlrs 1,000
donation to Clinton's 1996 campaign and dlrs 6,000 more to
Democratic Senate and House candidates since 1993. The FEC records
show no donations to Republican candidates.
	   ``I should have disclosed'' the donations, Brill told The
Washington Post. But he said that when he ran American Lawyer
magazine he published a story arguing that Paula Jones had a strong
sexual harassment case against Clinton. ``It's hard to come to a
conclusion that I'm ideologically tainted,'' he told the newspaper.
	   Leaking grand jury material is a federal crime and discussing
evidence in pending criminal investigations violates Justice
Department policies.

	   JAKARTA (JP): President B.J. Habibie yesterday replaced Attorney
General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro with the head of the Armed Forces
(ABRI) prosecutor's office, Maj. Gen. Muhammad Ghalib.
	   The move has raised eyebrows since Soedjono was one of the old
faces retained by President B.J. Habibie when he announced his new
Cabinet just three weeks ago.
	   The transfer was made public by Minister/State Secretary Akbar
Tandjung who announced that the move was mandated in Presidential
Decree No. 145.
	   There was no specific reason given for the move.
	   But he was quick to dispel suggestions that the replacement was
connected to an investigation recently launched by the Attorney
General's Office into alleged corruption by former president
Soeharto and his officials.
	   ``It is not true, there is no relation at all,'' Akbar asserted
after accompanying Ghalib and Soedjono in their meeting with
Habibie at the Bina Graha presidential office.
	   Soedjono, sworn in by Soeharto on March 19, announced early this
month that his office had launched a massive investigation into
corruption during Soeharto's 32-year rule.
	   Soedjono also disclosed last week that Soeharto had appointed
Yohanes Yacob as a counselor to face immense criticism against him.
	   Habibie's government is facing mounting public pressure to take
Soeharto to court over the former president's accumulated wealth to
help starving people.
	   After meeting with Habibie last week, Soedjono gave no
indication he was to be removed and even said he had proposed that
his office become a separate and independent institution.
	   Akbar had nothing but praise for Soedjono, who is due to
officially hand over his post this week.
	   ``The President deeply appreciates his very proactive attitude
in responding to the policies of the Reform Development Cabinet in
granting amnesty for political prisoners and dropping charges
against political detainees,'' Akbar remarked.
	   Akbar ducked questions on why Habibie had chosen an Army
two-star general and not a civilian prosecutor, saying only that
``the President has considered various aspects and sides. This is
the best choice.''
	   Akbar also denied that Ghalib's appointment was influenced by
suggestions from third parties, including from ABRI.
	   Earlier in the morning, Minister of Defense and Security/Armed
Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto unexpectedly met with the President
but declined to talk much to journalists.
	   ``There will be big announcement this week,'' Wiranto remarked
smilingly as he walked away from chasing journalists.
	   Like Habibie, Ghalib is also a native of South Sulawesi. He was
born in Bone on Jun. 3, 1946.
	   He was director of the Academy of Military Law before serving as
South Sulawesi deputy governor between 1992 and 1997.
	   He then returned to Jakarta to head the Armed Forces
prosecutor's office and the Armed Forces Law Development Body.
	   Both Soedjono and Ghalib refused to talk to the media after
meeting with Habibie yesterday.
	   Akbar indicated that Soedjono's career in the government may not
be over just yet.
	   ``The President is giving very serious attention to Pak
Soedjono's future,'' he said.

	   DUE to labour shortage, lucrative wages and rapid economic
growth over the past few years, there has been an influx of foreign
labour into the country. In spite of many economic, social and
political problems attributed to foreign workers, their presence
has stimulated the growth of many sectors, mainly plantation,
construction and manufacturing.
	   Based on the issuance of work passes by the Immigration
Department between July 1992 and Jan 1, last year, these three
sectors used 75.6 per cent of the total immigrants in the country.
	   Nevertheless, the dependence on foreign labour is no more than a
short- term measure to fulfil market needs.
	   One of the ways to overcome the labour shortage is to boost the
participation of women in the workforce.
	   Although the number of women entering the labour market is
increasing, the participation rate has been fairly stable over the
years. It increased only marginally from 44.9 per cent in 1980 to
47.3 per cent last year.
	   The participation of women in the workforce has been rather
selective: The most popular choices are as production and related
workers, transport equipment operators and labourers (23.7 per
cent); clerical and related workers (19.1 per cent) and
agricultural, animal husbandry, forestry, fishermen and hunters
(16.8 per cent).
	   In fact, women's activities rated by age tend to show a typical
M-shaped curve, initially increasing during the early years and
reaching a peak between the ages of 20 and 24. However, it declines
during the childbearing years, increasing again after the children
have grown up and reaching another peak between the ages of 40 and
44.
	   Finally, it trends down for good as the retirement age
approaches.
	   Survey data reveals that the main reason for women not seeking
work is to do housework (82.7 per cent). This is in contrast to men
who want to further their studies (70.2 per cent).
	   Empirical evidence shows that family-related measures and
complementary support system are equally important to effectively
boost female participation in the workforce. Some policies, rules
and regulations are already in place.
	   Unfortunately, based on the availability of the existing support
systems, such measures are not effective. According to a study done
in a factory in Bangi, Selangor, most parents placed their children
in their relatives' care (between 35 and 75 per cent) instead of
child-care centres (between seven and 36 per cent), while others
hired maids to take care of their children (about 10 per cent).
There are several reasons for such preferences. First, the quality
of child-care centres may not be up to expectations.
	   Second, considering the fee per child (RM180 on average), the
mean monthly gross household income (approximately RM2,125 last
year) and the average number of children per household of more than
two, some might not be able to afford to send their children to
private centres.
	   Third, the cost of sending children to the centres is actually
high, in terms of commuting time, transportation charges and
preparation of food, especially for those who are rushing to work
in overcrowded and traffic- filled cities.
	   Moreover, there is a dearth of centres in many housing areas.
	   Those with high incomes might decide to hire maids, either local
or foreign. However, there is a limited supply of local maids. The
locals prefer to take on jobs in other sectors which offer more
lucrative remuneration and freedom.
	   The maids could be hired for other responsibilities, for
example, taking care of the elderly. If the parents are financially
better off, they can hire maids from the Philippines, who are on
average better educated than those from Indonesia. However, almost
88 per cent of foreign maids are from Indonesia, with the rest
coming from the Philippines.
	   The Indonesians are mostly primary school leavers. Furthermore,
maids taking care of children are mostly untrained or with no
knowledge or experience on child development. In such
circumstances, parents cannot be assured of the quality of child
development during the formative years (birth to 6-years-old),
which are generally considered as crucial to a child's life.
	   Since the children are with the minders most of the day, the
maids who come from various backgrounds somehow become their role
models. Having maids at home could also make the children less
accustomed to household responsibilities. In view of work-related
stress and difficulty in devoting quality time to the children,
complementary legislative and administrative measures are obviously
needed to enhance not only female participation but also commitment
to work responsibilities.
	   For example, the quality of child-care centres could be upgraded
by imposing a ceiling on the child-to-staff ratio. At the same
time, the training of the child-minders could be made mandatory
with more effective enforcement.
	   More child-care institutes, set up by both the private and
public sectors, could serve these needs. The graduates from these
institutes could be granted some recognition by the relevant
ministry with better rewards or remuneration. The maids hired for
the same purpose should undergo similar training as well.
	   Alternatively, the school system could be changed in the long
run to suit the working hours of working mothers with greater
availability of infrastructure and teaching staff. In line with
this, the working hours of female employees, especially those with
infants and school-going children could be made more flexible.
	   Such measures may sound detrimental to career development of
women, but it is feasible provided that the employers' evaluation
systems are objective-oriented. Given that some problems are
related to the women's attitude and commitment, this flexibility
may be made selective depending on the sectors and occupations that
are critically in need of women staff or their skills.
	   Other options include the establishment of Outside School Hours
Care Centres or multi-purpose care centres in ``high-need'' areas
to cater to the needs of school-age children before and after
school, as well as during holidays. Employers themselves should be
more concerned with family- related issues and be
socially-oriented.
	   Employers who have a stipulated number of workers must be made
to set up subsidised child-care centres with incentives given by
the Government. Co- operation among several employers may help
reduce the burden of the set-up cost. There should not be a
trade-off between commitment to work and bearing responsibility for
proper child upbringing and development.
	   To stimulate woman participation, the opportunity cost of being
full- time housewives must be raised as well. This could be done by
increasing the education level of women and by lessening gender
discrimination to provide more opportunities for women in higher
positions.
	   Although there are studies which indicate female children of
working mothers perform better than boys, there must be an
environment supportive of women to enable them to reach full
potential at the workplace.
	   Therefore, a full range of programmes is needed to meet the
needs of working-class families for a sustainable future
generation.
	   Information on such improved facilities and programmes must be
disseminated to the public with the help of integrated information
services through appropriate communications channels, compatible
with the target groups so that the benefits can be shared by a
larger working-class population.

World Cup: Fourth Iranian player to join German Bundesliga
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Midfielder Alireza Mansourian will
become the fourth Iranian player in Germany's Bundesliga, he
announced Tuesday.
	   Mansourian, 27, said he would be joining Hamburg after the World
Cup.
	   Mansourian, who entered Sunday's game against Yugoslavia in the
68th minute, said he had been due to join Dortmund, but that his
plans had changed.
	   Pejman Nozad, editor of Toop, a U.S.-based magazine that
specializes in Iranian football, said Mansourian should have been
more effective in the game against Yugoslavia, which Iran lost 1-0.
	   ``I think he was trying to show off for talent scouts rather
than playing for the team that day,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Iranian goalkeeper Nima Nakissa said he was open to
offers from European clubs after the World Cup.
	   ``I will definitely leave Iran after the World Cup to play in
the European league,'' said Nakissa, 22. ``I will take every offer
seriously,'' he said.
	   Nakissa stood guard at the Iranian goal for main goalkeeper and
captain, Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh, who was out with a bad knee.
	   Iran's three star strikers, Ali Daei, Khodadad Azizi and Karim
Bagheri, play in the German Bundesliga.
	   Daei has signed up to move from Armenia Bielefeld to Bayern
Munich, and Azizi has said he is open to offers from a Spanish
team.

	   THE Arab-Israeli issue has been in existence for the better part
of the second half of the 20th century. It is a most emotionally
charged issue and finding a solution has been difficult.
	   However, after prolonged negotiation it came close to a
resolution in the early 1990s. Since then the issue has again
become intractable.
	   When Britain hosted talks in London early last month, there was
a glimmer of hope. This arose as a result of the success achieved
by British Prime Minister Tony Blair in reaching a historic
agreement on the Northern Ireland issue. It was hoped that a
similar formula could be worked out in the case of Israel and
Palestine.
	   The failure of the London talks and subsequent parleys were
particularly unsettling to the United States which has invested a
lot in the peace process in the Middle East.
	   The resolution of the Arab-Israel conflict has implications
worldwide.
	   The United States, due to the dictates of internal politics, has
played a dominant role in resolving the issue.
	   As the area is of strategic importance, the US, by its
involvement, has placed itself in a most difficult position. For
Washington it has a geo- strategic dimension.
	   Recent American Presidents and Secretaries of State have been
involved.
	   Former President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger were particularly noted for their grand design.
	   Kissinger's activities in the Middle East became well known as
he wooed the various contenders tirelessly in his shuttle
diplomacy. In finding a solution he believed that the United States
should consider its long term interest.
	   The Middle East issue has the interest of the Arab and the
Muslim world.
	   In time the Arab world will become an important factor in world
politics.
	   This factor is not lost on successive American leaders.
	   Nixon had recognised this important factor and the need for the
United States to be closely engaged with the Muslim world. In his
book Seize the moment he wrote ``the Muslim World is a vital
civilisation searching for its historical identity ... In the 1990s
and beyond these countries will renew the search for their place in
the world. The United States needs an active policy to effect that
evolution in constructive ways''.
	   He noted that during the Cold War, Islam stood up in many ways
better than the Christians to the communist threat. He also pointed
out that Islam has no doctrine of terrorism. He wrote ``tolerance
marks the key thrust of modernist Islam, with the nations of the
West not condemned as unbelievers but embraced as other people of
the book''.
	   Referring to the Middle East, Nixon wrote: ``When a major event
occurs in one part of the Muslim world it inevitably reverberates
in the other''. He noted ``the Arab-Israel conflict poisons our
relations with the Muslim World''.
	   Referring to Egypt's role he wrote: ``President Sadat could not
have signed the Camp David accord without Israel's commitment to
establish transitional arrangements for the West Bank and Gaza for
a period not to exceed five years. Under the agreement Palestinians
were to receive local autonomy as soon as arrangements could be
worked out, with negotiations over the final status of the
territories to start within three years.
	   ``With that timetable, the entire process should have been
concluded in 1984. Nothing has happened. To put it bluntly, Israel
stonewalled the United States and Egypt.''
	   Nixon wrote that both American and Israeli interests would be
best served by a settlement based on land for peace. He wrote: ``If
Israel retains the occupied territories, it will corrupt its moral
case.''
	   The two sides had taken into account this factor which had led
to the agreement and the peace process. As a result, in 1994 an
economic conference was held in Casablanca, Morocco, co-chaired by
the United States and Russia. It was well-attended and an economic
blueprint was considered to rehabilitate the Middle Eastern
economies.
	   Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres were prominent in
their presence at the conference. In his speech Peres said, ``the
Casablanca conference was not to negotiate peace politically, nor
to sustain peace militarily, but to build peace economically''.
	   He further said that ``the sources of strength and wealth are
not expanded territory, but concentrated sciences. Scientific
accomplishments cannot be achieved by arms''.
	   The United States being the dominant player has a crucial role
to bring about a settlement. The inability to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict would affect its credibility and erode
confidence. Inevitably this would invite the other players into the
region.
	   During the detente days of Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy he had
tried to keep the Soviet Union out of the region. The longer the
issue remains unresolved, the greater the chances of other players
such as Russia or even China re-emerging and taking the initiative
in the region.
	   The United States was successful in Bosnia and had won world
respect.
	   The Muslim world and the world at large including Europe looked
to the positive resolution of the Middle East dispute. It would
serve the United States' interest to have the issue resolved and
ensure its long-term role in the Arab and Muslim world.

No decision planned on cross at the Auschwitz memorial, church

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ No decision is planned in the near future
concerning a large cross outside the former Nazi Auschwitz death
camp, Poland's Roman Catholic Church official said Tuesday.
	   The Rev. Jerzy Urbaniec made the comment in response to a hunger
strike that three people have been holding by the cross since
Sunday to demand it remains.
	   ``The cross remains where it was and there is no point making a
problem of it. You need peace, quiet and prayer to make a decision
about it,'' Urbaniec told the state news agency PAP.
	   Urbaniec is a close associate of the region's bishop, Tadeusz
Rakoczy, who has the power to decide whether the cross should be
removed.
	   The hunger strikers say they will continue until Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek and Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the head of Poland's powerful
Roman Catholic Church, answer their letters demanding the cross
stays. Their leader, Kazimierz Switon said he will set himself on
fire if anyone tries to move the religious symbol.
	   Jewish organizations say the 26-foot-tall cross, visible from
the former death camp, disturbs the memory of the Jews who died
there and want it removed.
	   But many Poles view the cross _ located where 152 Nazi resisters
were murdered in 1941 _ as a symbol of the nation's martyrdom under
German occupation.
	   The cross commemorates a mass that Polish-born Pope John Paul II
held outside the Auschwitz memorial in 1979.

Estonia, Russia border guards hold joint military exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - In an infrequent rare sign of
cooperation between their armed forces, Estonian and Russian border
guards on Tuesday held joint exercises at a lake bordering the two
former Soviet republics.
	   Bilateral relations have been cool since the collapse of the
Soviet Union nearly a decade ago. The neighboring countries have
not even signed a formal border agreement.
	   Russia has been angered by Estonia's bid to join the NATO
military alliance.
	   A spokesman for the Estonian Border Guard, Arre Soome, said the
one-day exercise involved about 50 men and three boats, and aimed
to improve communication in such tasks as anti-smuggling.
	   ``We are neighbors, so it simply makes sense for our border
guards to work together as well as possible,'' said Soome, speaking
from Border Guard headquarters in Tallinn.

	   THE good news was that a huge arsenal of weapons stolen from a
military base outside Bloemfontein had been recaptured. The bad
news was that the theft of the weapons has uncovered a state of
military discipline that would disgrace a banana republic.
	   Imagine. Thieves drive off with a vast haul that includes
semi-automatic assault rifles, light, medium and heavy machine
guns, rocket-propelled grenades, grenade launchers, binoculars and
other bits of kit. Two trucks are also adrift. A couple of days
later another truck from the same base carrying 200,000 rounds of
ammunition is hijacked - the driver and co- driver are killed.
	   The theft of the ammunition leads to an arrest. The arrest leads
to the finding of the ammunition, and most of the weaponry stolen
earlier. The finds lead to another arrest. The men arrested are
white members of the defence force, with suspected right-wing
links.
	   In the meantime one of the two trucks which disappeared turns
up. But it turns out that it had nothing to do with the weapons
heist. The soldier who took the truck just wanted to take it home
for the weekend. It is apparently a common practice at the base for
drivers to ``borrow'' military vehicles if they feel they need
them.
	   The company commander who sent the ammunition truck off to make
a delivery to another base without a proper escort, is now under
arrest and faces a court martial. A board of enquiry is set up to
examine the circumstances surrounding the thefts.
	   But all has not been well in the defence forces for some time. A
report from a British military advisory and training team suggests
that racist attitudes persist within the army. The amalgamation of
the old South African Defence Force with the armies of the four
quasi-independent black homelands, and the guerilla armies of the
liberation movements, has resulted in an apparent transformation.
But old attitudes persist.
	   When a white sergeant major teargasses his black superior
officers, he is given a reprimand, but gets a service bonus and a
good-conduct medal soon afterwards. When 13 black soldiers stage a
protest strike they are accused of mutiny and discharged.
	   The author of the British report is accused by the chief of the
army of a personal vendetta. The criticisms are glossed over.
	   The discovery of an intelligence report suggesting that black
senior officers and populist politicians are plotting to disrupt
next year's elections with a campaign of assassinations, is kept
from the Minister of Defence by the chief of the armed forces, and
put directly on the President's desk. The report - examined by the
country's Chief Justice and two other senior judges - turns out to
be a bizarre fantasy.
	   The lack of trust between the armed forces chief and the
Minister has now led to the general's resignation. And finally a
black general, former chief of staff of the ANC's guerilla army,
has taken overall command.
	   He has an unenviable task. Not only does he now have to tackle
the problem of welding the disparate groups under his command into
a coherent and credible force, he has to clear up the discipline
problems which are rotting even the old white commands. He has to
do this while much of the defence force equipment is obsolete and
outworn.
	   The Defence Ministry has long complained that it simply does not
have the vehicles, ships and airplanes to fulfil its commitments.
The navy is unable to protect the sea fisheries around the southern
ocean islands of Marian and St Edward, and such valuable food
resources as the Patagonian toothfish are being grossly overfished
and depleted. Neighbouring countries like Mozambique and Tanzania
would like to rely on the South African armed forces to help them
patrol their waters too.
	   But the democratic government has not cared much for
re-equipping the military. Of more importance the new politicians
have believed is the transformation of health care and education,
the building of houses, and the supply of water and electricity.
	   The are of course right, but the acceptance by the Cabinet and
Parliament of a defence review outlining the force structure, the
battle order and the equipment needed in future has settled the
argument of ``guns or butter''. The purchasing programme is now
under way.
	   The next problem to be faced by the new chief is force
reduction. The new battle plan requires far fewer soldiers than the
present bloated amalgamation. So 20,000 members of the armed forces
are going to have to be demobilised. That too is going to increase
tensions both within and without the defence force.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Four police officers summoned yesterday by
prosecutors in the military tribunal investigating the Trisakti
shooting said that neither of the defendants had shot the four
victims.
	   Sworn in under their respective religious oaths, the witnesses
also insisted that none of the police officers at the scene had
guns loaded with life ammunition.
	   West Jakarta Police chief Lt. Col. Timur Pradopo, the field
commander on the fateful day, told the court that troops from West
Jakarta 0503 Military District and Jakarta Military Command were
also deployed at the university.
	   ``I do not know the exact number of military personnel because
my responsibilities lay only with the police squads,'' he said.
	   Timur said none of the police personnel had been issued with
live ammunition.
	   ``Each officer had their guns loaded with three blank bullets
and 12 rubber bullets,'' he said.
	   Timur said that he, the West Jakarta Military District Commander
Lt. Col. Amril Amir and head of security at the university Ari
Gunarsa were standing between crowds of demonstrators in front of a
building formerly owned by West Jakarta Mayoralty on Jl. S. Parman
when shots were fired.
	   ``Police officers were trying to herd students back onto the
campus and I was stuck in the middle of the crowd. I ordered the
police squads to stop shooting,'' he said.
	   Only police personnel in his immediate vicinity obeyed the
order, he said, adding that the gunfire lasted for 30 minutes from
5:40 p.m. to 6: 10 p.m.
	   Timur, however, was unable to say whether or not the gunshots
were warning shots and who fired them.
	   ``I don't know. I didn't see. I only heard the shots,'' he said.
	   When presiding judge Col. Sudji Suradi and prosecutors pressed
him further on the fatal shootings that killed four students and
injured many others, Timur replied:
	   ``I tell you again, I do not know who shot the four students.
But I can tell you this, neither of the defendants nor I were at
the flyover in front of Trisakti. We were all busy on the
streets,'' he explained.
	   The second witness, Sgt. Cecep Dadang S., commander of the
police Mobile Brigade group, said he was standing on Jl. S. Parman
when he heard shots fired.
	   ``I received an order to open fire from my company commander
(defendant First Lt. Agus Tri Heryanto).
	   I fired my weapon towards the crowd. I was sure that it was
loaded with three blanks bullets and 12 rubber bullets. We checked
it during the morning briefing,'' Cecep told the court.
	   When asked by defense lawyers about his experience of handling
riots, Cecep said that he had frequently been in the situation.
	   ``I've done it many times, Sir.''
	   ``Do you know the difference between firing live ammunition and
rubber bullets?'' asked one of the lawyers.
	   ``Yes I know that, Sir. We use rubber bullets to herd
protesters, in this case, the students. My squads were not armed
with live ammunition,'' he added.
	   Cecep also said that none of the police officers went across the
pedestrian bridge close to the university compound where most of
the dead and injured students were found.
	   ``We were standing in front of the building which used to belong
to the West Jakarta mayoralty office, some distance from the
campus,'' he said.
	   He admitted that he heard shots after squads had been ordered to
stop shooting.
	   ``I do not know who was firing, but I'm sure it was none of the
personnel in my group because we had run out of ammunition,'' he
said.
	   Timur's and Cecep's statements were backed up by the final two
witnesses, Second Sgt. Sunarto and Private Arwan Saleh Siregar,
both of whom are members of the police Mobile Brigade.
	   ``I thought at that time (when the shootings took place) that
the protest was over.
	   I took the opportunity to relax for a while. I was sitting near
police vehicles at about 5:40 p.m. when I heard gunfire,'' Arwan
said.
	   He said he heard a small number of shots, but did not know where
they came from.
	   Meanwhile, Second Sgt. Sunarto, another group commander, said
that none of his personnel were standing on the flyover.
	   ``We were busy on the street. Members of the public and students
were mixing and we were trying to herd the students back onto the
campus and separate them from the angry crowds,'' he said.
	   In the aftermath of the May 12 incident, several Trisakti
students said that they saw uniformed members of the security
forces firing shots from the flyover.
	   During the fourth session of the military tribunal yesterday,
presiding judge Sudji agreed not to charge the defendants with
causing the death of the four students, as requested by defense
lawyers.
	   ``We can understand and accept defense lawyers' objections to
the indictment and I, therefore, order the prosecutors to erase the
statement 'causing the death of the four students' from their
letter of indictment,'' Sudji told the court.
	   However, he said the defendants would be still charged under
Article 103 of the Military Penal Code for committing an
undisciplined act.
	   Sudji adjourned the trial until today, when six more witnesses
are to be brought before the court.

Report: 2,000 demonstrate in China city for pensions, benefits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Some 2,000 retirees and laid-off workers
demanding unpaid pensions and unemployment payments demonstrated in
the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Tuesday, blocking traffic
before dispersing peacefully, a human rights group said.
	   The demonstration, which attracted hundreds of onlookers and
lasted about six hours, was the fourth in the city in six days, the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   The roughly 2,000 demonstrators pensioned or laid-off from a
metallurgical construction company demanded that the company and
the local government provide pensions and unemployment payments
that had been unpaid for months, the group said.
	   The company shed half of its once 30,000-strong work force over
the last two years, but is still struggling and is often in arrears
with wages, it said.
	   Millions of workers are being laid off as China attempts to
revamp its crumbling state-owned enterprises. The layoffs have
raised fears of possible widespread labor unrest.
	   The Information Center said the other three demonstrations in
Wuhan, a large industrial city, on June 11 and 13 involved about
200 to 300 people demanding either unpaid wages and pensions or
increased salaries.

	   IF there had been no President Suharto there would have been no
invasion and annexation of East Timor. Now he's deposed, one of the
world's dwindling number of territorial injustices can be remedied
in a weekend's negotiations - the leadership of East Timor is ready
and waiting.
	   If President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, won't do it then
a newly elected President in the elections now being pushed for
early next year will have to, if a new war is to be avoided.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a Portuguese colony in the
Indonesian archipelago in December, 1975. It was a massive assault,
involving bombers, paratroopers and marines. The army wreaked
havoc: there was indiscriminate killing and rape. Later, the
Indonesian vice-governor admitted that 60,000 Timorese had been
killed - more than a tenth of the population.
	   For too long the sounds of protest have been next to inaudible.
But, gradually, the penny has dropped as nations have been woken up
to the principles involved by the National Council of Timorese
Resistance which in recent years has ratcheted up the decibels -
for which it was awarded the Nobel Peace prize two years ago.
	   It has lobbied and wooed the world's governments with the facts.
First and foremost, that Indonesia, despite its proximity, has no
historic claim to the land it invaded. For 400 years East Timor was
under Portuguese control. It was never a member of the Dutch
Indonesian empire or at any time part of the archipelago's
political structure. The Indonesian claim is as far-fetched as
would be a Cuban claim to Jamaica.
	   As late as the year before the invasion, the Indonesian Foreign
Minister, Adam Malik, had been saying, ``The independence of every
country is the right of every nation, with no exception for the
people in Timor''.
	   But events and opportunity changed Suharto's mind. The Salazar
dictatorship in Portugal was overthrown. At the same time there
were bitter internal struggles for power within East Timor and the
victor, the radical Revolutionary Front for an Independent East
Timor, unilaterally declared independence. This provided the excuse
for Indonesia's invasion.
	   At the United Nations the initial response seemed promising. A
majority, including the West, the Soviet bloc and the Third World,
voted against Indonesia's takeover and demanded its immediate
withdrawal, arguing that East Timor was still legally part of
Portugal and had a right to self- determination and, if it chose,
independence.
	   But, over time, both Western and Soviet enthusiasm for the
resolution eased. It was Third World nations that kept the issue
alive but they too, with the passing years, lost interest.
	   The US and Europe, putting principle aside - the same principles
Britain would later summon up in defence of the Falklands and the
US and Western Europe in defence of Kuwait - began a strategic
relationship, supplying arms to the Indonesian military as a way,
they argued, of maintaining stability in a potentially volatile
corner of the globe. Australia, only 480 km to the south, even
recognised the island as ``part of Indonesia''.
	   Not only has Suharto now gone, so has his infamous son-in-law,
Lt Gen Prabowa Subianto, the man most hated in East Timor for his
ruthless record. For many years he treated East Timor as his
personal estate, encouraging his in-laws to exploit the island's
coffee, sandal wood and marble, using his troops with wanton
abandon to supress any criticism, and organising youth gangs to
abduct and eliminate East Timorese opposition leaders.
	   Despite the recent political eruptions in Indonesia, the East
Timorese have shown extraordinary restraint, influenced by Xanana
Gusmao, the imprisoned leader of the resistance. It is a
non-violent movement of immense self-discipline that has worked on
a long timetable, convinced that one day circumstances would change
and its voice would be heard.
	   Non-violence wasn't always East Timor's way. In the first five
years of the struggle at least 10,000 Indonesian soldiers lost
their lives and in the large-scale bombardment of villages, meant
to suppress the revolt, the deaths were so numerous that the late
Professor Leo Kuper of the University of California, who was the
world's leading authority on mass killings, described it as
``genocide''.
	   Expectations are now running high. If the world does not move
more quickly to pressure the Habibie regime to get a move on and
redress this wrong, the non-violent leaders could find their
influence waning and the baton being passed to those who want a
return to violence. But the last thing Indonesia needs in its
present parlous state is another war.
	   As much for Indonesia's own sake as for that of the East
Timorese, Habibie needs to enter a weekend date in his diary and
negotiate an honourable conclusion to his predecessor's great
mistake.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A newspaper reporter was indicted at Central
Jakarta District Court yesterday for faking a press identification
card specially designed for members of the media covering the
general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in
March this year.
	   Prosecutor Sambara Hasbul said the defendant, Minsidi Suharta, a
stringer for Bandung Pos daily, superimposed his picture, name and
employer on a card originally issued for Adhi Kurniawan from Ipphos
photo agency.
	   Sambara told the court that the 27-year-old defendant forged the
card on the eve of the session which opened on March 1 to elect a
president and vice president.
	   The forged card gained Suharta access to the Assembly building
and the use of free media facilities, including a facsimile machine
and telephone provided by the committee. Sambara said the card had
been used for eight days before the forgery came to light. The
general session lasted for 11 days.
	   ``The defendant caused losses to the MPR public relations
department because he used the press center facilities during the
general session,'' Sambara said.
	   He said the prosecutors had yet to calculate the total losses
caused by the defendant in the three-and-a-half-month old case.
	   The reporter was charged under Article 263 (1) of the Criminal
Code which carries a maximum punishment of six years in jail.
	   After the session, Suharta told The Jakarta Post outside the
court that many other reporters had forged general session press
cards.
	   He said the distribution of press identification cards, the
responsibility of MPR public relations officers, had been chaotic.
	   Suharta said he was arrested at the Sahid Jaya Hotel on March 9
when he turned up to interview a member of the Armed Forces'
Faction, Maj. Gen. Agum Gumelar.
	   There were rumors that Agum, who was in charge of the Wirabuana
Military Command in Ujungpandang, South Sulawesi, at the time, had
been appointed governor of West Java.
	   Suharta's daily was based in the West Java capital of Bandung
but stopped publishing last Wednesday for financial reasons.
	   Shortly after his arrest, the newspaper's management denied
being associated with the defendant.
	   ``I'm sure my paper was afraid and thought that I was involved
in a political case,'' he said.
	   After his arrest, police charged Suharta with committing a
political activity which could endanger the president and vice
president and for faking the press card.
	   ``But they dropped the first charge for unknown reasons,'' he
added.
	   Suharta still believes that he was detained because of his
political activities. He was active member of Pijar Indonesia youth
organization and a frequent participant in demonstrations.
	   Suharta, accompanied by his lawyers from Jakarta Legal Aid
Institute, said he was once questioned at Jakarta Military Police
headquarters about his relationship with several people, including
with former legislator Ibrahim Saleh and a number of activists from
the banned People's Democratic Party (PRD) organization.
	   Ibrahim, who was arrested on March 6 for using an improper
visitors card during the MPR general session, told military
investigators that he did not know Suharta.
	   Presiding judge Rusdi As'ad adjourned the trial until Monday to
hear the defendant's lawyers' statement. The defendant remains in
detention at Salemba Penitentiary.

	   Discord over supply of gas to the Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company
(KAFCO) in Chittagong by Petrobangla has deepened with the
government demanding upward revision of gas prices, and the latter
reminding the government about the possible default of contract
from August next, in case of failure to supply gas.
	   The Ministry of Energy (MOE) has also sought rearrangement of
the mode of payment for the gas by KAFCO, which consumes 62 million
cft gas per day, prior to the resumption of supplies, suspended
since May 13. The US $ 514-million, largest fertiliser factory in
the country, is suffering a loss of US $ 200,000 every day due to
lack of gas.
	   The source in the MOE said that though the Bakharabad Gas System
Ltd (BGSL) is the supplier of gas to KAFCO, the latter had to make
payment to the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC),
while the BCIC in turn paid the BGSL later, after deducting a sum
from the amount paid by KAFCO.
	   While the KAFCO, as per agreement, used to pay the price of gas
keeping in view the international market rate of urea fertiliser,
the BCIC used to pay the price of gas to the BGSL at a fixed rate.
	   According to MOE sources, the KAFCO paid US $ 61.2 million to
the BCIC from May 1995 to May 1997. The BCIC paid the BGSL only US
$ 34 million while the rest was shown as profit by the BCIC in the
government books.
	   Since May 1997, KAFCO has failed to pay the gas price which
accumulated to US $ 14 million till May 1998, as the company failed
to make profit due to payment of debt service liabilities worth
about US $ 56 million a year. As per agreement, in case of any
emergency, the KAFCO was allowed to defer the payment of gas, but
would have to pay interest on it. The agreement also provided that
the company would get such opportunity till December 1998.
	   But now the MOE has decided not to supply gas to KAFCO till the
payment of outstanding dues and upward revision of gas price from
December next.
	   Meanwhile, the Ministry has proposed that KAFCO be supplied with
only 35 million CFT of gas everyday, but the KAFCO source said that
it would not be possible to run the mill with so a less quantity of
gas, the minimum requirement being at least 50 mcft.
	   As per agreement the Bangladesh government was supposed to
supply 64 mcft gas everyday but it was reduced to 50 mcft from
September 1996 due to overall shortfall in gas exploration in the
Bakharabad gas field.
	   In view of this decision, Vice President of the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan Yuji Kiyokawa wrote to
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on June 8, seeking her personal
intervention into the matter.
	   In the letter, the OECF, also a partner of the KAFCO said that
if the BGSL failed to supply the required quantity of gas it would
not be possible for KAFCO to continue its operations, ``resulting
in possible default on the August due date.''
	   He said that the KAFCO was facing instability in its operations
due to non-fulfilment of the agreement regarding gas supply.
	   According to an OECF source in Dhaka, 14 parties are involved in
the project and if it failed to run smoothly it might affect the
international environment of investment in Bangladesh.
	   The project is insured by MITI of Japan, OPIC of the USA and
ECGD of the UK, while Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation is
the largest shareholder of the project with an investment of US$
53.6 million.
	   With the resumption of gas supply from the Sangu gas field it
would be possible to supply gas to KAFCO. The Ministry source said
that as the Bakharabad gas field had failed to supply the required
amount it was not possible to supply gas to KAFCO till now. But the
government would have to pay 2.40 dollars per thousand cft gas from
Sangu for the 30 per cent share of the Cairn and Shell company. The
remaining 70 per cent would be gained by the government free of
cost. As such if the government supplied gas to KAFCO it would not
be costlier than US $ 0.72 per thousand cft.
	   The KAFCO, which paid an average 1.54 US dollars for per
thousand cft gas, would have to pay about US $ 0.73 because the
price of urea in the international market has already gone down
below $ 125 per ton, as per agreement. If the price of urea goes
above US $ 125 the price of gas would also be higher for KAFCO.
	   But now the government is trying to bring a uniformity in the
gas price instead of keeping it fluctuating in consonance with the
price of urea in the international market.

	   SELANGOR Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar seems to be
preoccupied with leakages these days. There is the ongoing debacle
of a dilapidated water- distribution network which has
systematically leaked for years, going by records of non-revenue
water losses.
	   His latest worry is that contents of classified documents are in
unauthorised hands. Last Tuesday, he broke a silence of several
months to reveal that secrets and classified documents from State
and district-level meetings have been leaked by as yet unknown
persons. He warned department heads and staff and politicians that
this is an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1972.
	   Over in Sibu, Sarawak, the municipal council has barred
journalists from its monthly meetings. This was in retaliation for
``inaccurate reports'', and it now proposes only to brief the Press
on the outcome of discussions.
	   The context may differ, but the conclusion drawn will be the
same - that some in authority are distinctly unhappy at having
their decisions scrutinised. But where a miffed municipal council
may yet be placated through negotiation, it may prove difficult to
take on a Menteri Besar who has chosen an inappropriate time to
flex his muscles.
	   Technically, Abu Hassan has the law on his side. Under the OSA
schedule, the documents and records of decision-making processes of
the Cabinet and State Executive Council and their sub-committees,
are classified as secret. So, too, are documents concerning
national security, defence and international relations. This much
cannot be legally challenged.
	   But what can be done is to objectively re-visit the scope of a
law inherited from British colonisers, who introduced the 1911 (and
then the 1920) Official Secrets Act of the United Kingdom here. The
spirit and intent of the OSA, presumably, is to arrest matters
``prejudicial to the safety and interests of Malaysia''.
	   Over the years, however, this has been extended to include
routine decision-making processes, including meetings of elected
representatives.
	   The reasons and criteria for classifying or de-classifying
materials as official secrets are known only to Ministers and
Menteris Besar and Chief Ministers. The law provides that the
accompanying certificate is conclusive evidence, not to be
``questioned in any court on any ground whatsoever''.
	   It defies logic when elected representatives deny their very
constituents access to information of legitimate public interest.
The classification process is arbitrary and not open to
verification of the need for secrecy. And there is nothing to
prevent public agencies from using the OSA to seek legalised
protection from accountability.
	   Today, as strategies for improved transparency sweep around the
region, Malaysia's inexplicable fixation with protecting the most
ordinary secrets from her own citizens will bewilder onlookers. The
incongruity of the all encompassing OSA, in its present form, must
be recognised.
	   It would not be untimely for an independent commission to be set
up, to review the nature of decisions being made under the OSA and
to determine if reasonable limits are being exceeded. At very
least, guidelines must be drawn up to streamline the classification
process, removing all but the most ``prejudicial'' matters from the
present open-ended menu of official secrets.

	   The federal government's Chiapas peace coordinator, Emilio
Rabasa, said Monday the Army will not back off until the Zapatista
Army of National Liberation (EZLN) returns to the negotiating
table, Notimex reported. Rabasa's statements come after the
congressional commission for Chiapas talks, known by its acronym
Cocopa, called on the government to pull back troops in an attempt
to reduce tensions in the region.
	   Cocopa member Sen. Carlos Payan met with Interior Secretary
Francisco Labastida Monday to analyze the situation and said
bringing the rebels to the table is important toward promoting a
final solution to the troubled state. A delegation of Cocopa
members is expected to tour sites of recent violence Tuesday and
attempt to make contact with the conspicuously silent Zapatista
spokesman Sucomandante Marcos. Rabasa did wax optimistic about
Cocopa's tour, saying the federal government is doing all it can,
short of pulling back troops, to create a positive environment for
peace talks. ``The first thing is to find an inclusive encounter
with Cocopa,'' he said, responding to questions about the troop
pull-back.
	   Meanwhile, a day after facing angry villagers screaming for
vengeance, a human rights official promised to investigate a
police-and-Army raid on pro-rebel villages in Chiapas that resulted
in nine deaths, the Associated Press reported.
	   At a news conference Sunday, Adolfo Hernandez Figueroa said the
National Human Rights Commission had opened an investigation and
would examine all aspects of the case.

	   JAKARTA (JP): At least 200 employees of Sumber Waras Hospital
staged a rally inside the hospital complex on Jl. Kyai Tapa in West
Jakarta yesterday, demanding the resignation of the chairman of
Sumber Waras Health Foundation, Padmo Sumasto.
	   Arend Karel Ponggawa, a director of the hospital who led the
protest, said Padmo had not been open about financial matters
during his 30-year chairmanship of the foundation.
	   ``He is no longer popular among the employees for many reasons,
especially the indiscriminate actions he frequently takes,'' Arend
told The Jakarta Post.
	   During the rally, the employees claimed they had established a
committee, called Sumber Waras Salvage Committee, in charge of
temporarily taking over the hospital's operational activities until
their demand was met.
	   Yesterday's rally was the second in two weeks.
	   Arend, however, said it was up to the donors of the foundation
to choose a new chairman to replace Padmo.
	   He said the rally did not interrupt the hospital's medical
services.
	   Mudjiem, one protester, said she had finished her shift in the
morning before joining the rally.
	   She expressed concern over the low salaries decided on by the
foundation over the years.
	   ``New employees in other hospitals earn about Rp 500,000 per
month, but here they get only Rp 170,000,'' said Mudjiem.

	   PHOENIX, Arizona -- Cooperation in the fight against drug
trafficking at the Mexico-U.S. border could have a new, localized
``anti-drug czar'' if White House Office of Drug Control Policy
(ODCP) Director Barry McCaffrey has his way, Reuters reported
Monday. McCaffrey, who arrived in Phoenix Monday to meet with state
and county officials, said a proposed border anti-drug director
would help improve communication among all the different official
anti-drug trafficking organs working on the 2,000-mile border.
McCaffrey is expected to propose this new position this week
following the meetings in Phoenix. The U.S. ``anti-drug czar''
pointed out his country spends two billion dollars a year fighting
the trade in illegal drugs, and said a lot is wasted in
``inter-agency rivalries'' among the ten policing organizations
involved with the fight. ``We have to come to an agreement about
who does what and who serves whom ... to the end of establishing a
coordinator for the entire border,'' ODCP strategy director Jim
McDonough told The Arizona Republic.
	   The proposed position would have a two-year term which would
rotate among the various involved agencies. For example, a
representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) would
hold the post, then someone from Customs, etc. Specific details as
to how the first director would be named and how the person is
chosen will be released in September pending the federal
government's approval of McCaffrey's plan. McCaffrey said Monday he
considers a ``closing of the border'' between Mexico and the United
States impossible, financially or technically, and that better
coordination between U.S. agencies and their Mexican counterparts
specifically in intelligence gathering would be the best answer to
fighting the region's rampant drug-trafficking and organized-crime
problems. In May, McCaffrey pointed out that to shut off Mexico
from the anti-drug fight would be counterproductive.
	   ``We cannot alone hope to eradicate a threat that has no respect
for borders, and only by mutual efforts can we assure a long arm of
the law which is as broad as the problem (itself).''McCaffrey
specifically cited better cooperation between the United States and
Mexico as paramount to a proper solution to the issue.
	   The issue of binational cooperation has gotten a lot of
attention on both sides of the Rio Bravo since the May 18
announcement by the U.S. government of indictments against several
Mexican bankers and three banks following a three-year unilateral
sting called Operation Casablanca. Since the announcement, Mexico
has formally complained of the unilateral aspect of the operation,
as well as the possibility U.S. agents broke federal law by
operating within national boundaries to capture Mexican nationals.
Stings are considered a form of entrapment and are illegal under
Mexican law.

	   Privatisation yes, but not at workers' cost
	   The government is determined to carry the privatisation process
through, but would never harm the legitimate interests of the
workers, Finance Minister SAMS Kibria said here Monday.
	   ``We're committed to privatisation, but not at the cost of
workers' interests,'' he said inaugurating a day-long seminar on
``Privatisation Policy in Bangladesh and Options'' at a local
hotel.
	   Although the Finance Minister vowed to continue the
privatisation process, participants in the seminar felt that there
was a lack of political consensus to implement the process.
	   As political consensus was singled out as the most important
factor for denationalisation, the Finance Minister called upon the
mainstream opposition to come forward to help implement the process
effectively.
	   ``We must carry on privatisation. I hope the opposition will
joint our endeavour and help us implement the process as quickly as
possible,'' he told the seminar.
	   Kibria said the government was not in a position to run the
losing SOEs. He identified colossal losses incurred by the SOEs and
the huge bad loans as ``two albatrosses hanging over the neck of
the economy.''
	   Referring to some businessmen who had bought public enterprises
but not paid the money, he requested the Privatisation Board to
look into the matter which was setting ``a bad example in
privatisation.''
	   Speaking on the government's denationalisation strategy,
Agriculture Minister Begum Matia Chowdhury said the government was
committed to economic reforms and had already been working on a
comprehensive privatisation policy.
	   She also said there should be a consensus between political
parties on the issue. ``The progress so far achieved in this effort
is not satisfactory... this is not success story.''
	   Acting Country Director of the World Bank Mohsin Ali Khan dealt
with three issues - inefficiency of the SOEs, the process of
privatisation and the post-privatisation benefits.
	   He said the Bank's worldwide experience suggested that the
government should not be involved in running industries.
``Successful privatisation is possible by involving the workers in
the process.''
	   Khan mentioned that the losses incurred by the SOEs in last two
decades amounted to Tk 45,000 crore which was 2 per cent of the
country's GDP.
	   A conducive atmosphere has already been created in the country
for privatisation. ``But it needs a consensus among the government,
the opposition and the workers' community.''
	   Quoting a World Bank survey, FBCCI President Yusuf A Harun said
one Jamuna Bridge could be built every second year if the losses
from the SOEs were averted through offloading.
	   Our Staff Reporter adds: Discussants at the day-long seminar
felt that the privatisation of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
was going slow in the absence of a clearly spelt out policy and
strong government support to the programme.
	   ``There is dilly-dallying in the very approach,'' said a
participant in the seminar adding: ``even the policy makers of this
government and those of the previous governments don't know why it
is not progressing and what will bring success to it.''
	   The seminar was organised by the Privatisation Board (PB) with
assistance from the World Bank.
	   It was attended by government ministers, Parliament members,
diplomats, business leaders, trade union leaders, academics and
senior government officials.
	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed, Agriculture
Minister Motiya Chowdhury, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul
Hassan Chowdhury, State Minister for Jute Faezul Haq, State
Minister for Civil Aviation Eng Mosharraf Hossain, Chairmen of the
Privatisation Board and also the Board of Investment (BOI) Kazi
Zafarullah and Farook Sobhan participated in the discussion divided
into three working sessions.
	   The President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), Yousuf Abdullah Harun, Presidents of
the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Laila Kabir,
Forashuddin, Mahfuz Anam, Tanvir Akram, trade union leaders
Shahjahan Khan, MP, Abul Bashar, Nurul Islam, Shah Abu Zafar and
others attended the day-long deliberations.
	   The discussants said that there was no doubt about the need for
privatisation. The questions was how to achieve it quickly and in
doing so how the interests of the society in general and that of
the workers in particular could be protected.
	   The speakers felt that there was a need for equipping the
Privatisation Board with a comprehensive legal cover. Delegation of
decision-making powers to the board was essential.
	   Shahjahan Khan, MP (AL) said that the trade union leaders were
not opposed to privatisation. Nurul Islam of the Trade Union Centre
said that the privatisation programme must be devised taking into
consideration the local condition and any abrupt' move should be
avoided.
	   Another workers' leader stressed the need for developing a
congenial environment in the manufacturing sector to make sure that
industries after their hand-over to private ownership were able to
earn profit. This is what privatisation wanted to achieve and also
the workers expected to see as part of their job security.
	   Laila Kabir pointed to the need for changing the SOE service
rules to make possible for private owners of divested units to run
business profitably. She said that the railway service from Dhaka
to Narayanganj, handed over to private operators sometime ago or
the domestic flights by private aircraft owners were facing
difficulties under strictly government control service rules.
	   Another participants pointed to the need for a complete change
of operational rules and relation of the government with the
private sector to create an environment for increasing private
sector's interest in the SOEs listed for sale.
	   But another referred to a situation of deep suspicion about the
motive of the country's private sector as manifested in huge loan
defaults and said it was partly responsible for lack of progress in
the privatisation of SOEs.
	   Abul Hassan Chowdhury blamed the bureaucracy for foiling moves
to changes.
	   Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed urged the
opposition political parties, mainly the BNP, to lend total support
to the privatisation process. He said the workers leaders supported
the privatisation move and privatisation would be easier now.
	   The Chairman of the Privatisation Board Kazi Zafarullah, said he
was strengthening the institutional capacity of the board to deal
with the increasing load of privatisation. He said that he had sent
several delegations comprising MPs and workers' leaders to
countries where privatisation had achieved success. He hoped that
disposal of more SOEs would take place in the near future.

Taliban shuts down privately run schools for girls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army on Tuesday
shut down more than 100 private schools that were quietly educating
thousands of girls in defiance of the Taliban's ban on education
for girls.
	   The Taliban's Religious Affairs Minister Haji Khulimuddin
announced the closures at a news conference in the beleaguered
capital of Kabul, where he warned that violators would be punished.
The Taliban had allowed the schools to operate without officially
recognizing them.
	   It wasn't immediately clear what caused the clamp down.
	   A survey conducted in January by several international aid
groups showed at least 107 so-called informal schools in Kabul
providing education to more than 6,500 children, half of whom were
girls.
	   When the Taliban religious army swept into Kabul in September
1996, they shut down girls schools, saying the curriculum was
against the tenets of Islam. Schools for boys have since re-opened
and the Taliban have allowed girls, 8 and younger, to study only
the Islamic holy book, the Koran. After 8, girls must leave school.
	   Khulimuddin told reporters that the Taliban discovered several
14- and 15-year-old girls receiving education in private homes.
	   ``These schools weren't just for children. They also included 14
and 15 year old girls,'' he said. ``These schools were operating
against the principles of Islamic law.''
	   The Taliban also announced it was shutting down vocational
training programs for girls, which effectively shuts down dozens of
programs such as carpet weaving and sewing projects, that had been
quietly running to give young girls a skill and a way to earn
money.
	   ``This rule will seriously affect all community-based programs
for girls and women,'' said one international aid worker, who asked
not to be identified.
	   The Taliban's religious affairs minister also accused foreign
aid workers associated with these home schools of propagating
anti-Taliban propaganda.
	   The Taliban's harsh brand of Islamic law bans women from working
and girls from attending schools. But it also bans music, most
forms of light entertainment. It requires men to grow beards, wear
a head covering and attend the mosque.
	   Khulimuddin said school operators will have to apply for a
license from the ministry of education before they will be allowed
to operate.
	   ``Right now we have no control over these schools,'' he said.
``If they get permission then we can control them.''

	   LIVING in a multiracial society is complex. It requires an
insight into the other races' psyche and culture. It requires one
to transcend stereotypical behaviours assigned to an ethnic group
and see a person of another race as an individual, not by his race.
	   In short, it requires real integration.
	   I will share my experiences of living in a multiracial society.
It taught me a lot about innocence lost, prejudice and intolerance.
	   Bear in mind that these problems are not exclusive to one race.
	   My first recollection of being exposed to a multiracial setting
was when I was six years old. My parents sent me to the Holy Family
Kindergarten, the nearest pre-school institution near my house in
Kajang. Here, I met children of many races: Chinese, Indians,
Punjabis and Caucasians. At that time, it did not strike me that my
friends were different. The only difference that I could perceive
was that some were males and some were females.
	   There wasn't any racist name-calling heard. Those of the same
race did not stick together. I thought that this was the status
quo, that in all situations, people of different races mixed.
	   When I joined primary school, the situation was the same. If
fights broke out, racist epithets were never uttered.
	   There weren't any stereotypical characteristics attributed to a
race.
	   Now, I noticed the different skin colours of my friends.
However, it never occurred to me that skin colours implied
superiority or inferiority, good or bad. They were just different.
	   I remembered playing tag with Easwaran. Mooching food from
Choong Cheng Keong. Playing hide-and-seek with Al-Shams. Teasing
Dalbir Kaur.
	   To me, these people were unique. They were not part of any
ethnic groups that could be identified through a ``typical'' trait
that each group purportedly had.
	   This was the first phase of my life in terms of race relations.
I was unbiased and unaware of racism. The second phase came when I
moved to Bandar Baru Bangi at the age of nine.
	   This was and still is a place where 90 per cent of the
population are Malays. When I first enrolled in the one and only
primary school there, I was surprised to find that almost everyone
was Malay. This was something new to me, and the few non-Malays
would stick together.
	   Gradually and unconsciously, I was taught a new way of treating
people, that is, through their race. My new friends didn't say it
outright - that non-Malays were bad people. It's the little things,
like the comment that it was typical for a Chinese or an Indian to
commit ``unsavoury'' acts that Malays would never do.
	   Can we blame them? These people had probably never established
close contact with non-Malays before. The only time when they got
to see non- Malays were in public places, and here they formed
their opinions on the other races' characteristics. Ignorance
breeds prejudice.
	   While we (I finally became one of them) shunned most non-Malays,
we were quite close to a ``select'' few by virtue of us being in
the same class. I remember three names: Kumaran, Liong Choon Kit
and Sunita Devi. They were one of ``us''.
	   However, we considered them honorary Malays; not Chinese,
Indians or Punjabis. To us (or me, at least), they were not of
another race. Why do I say this? Because we refused to acknowledge,
let alone understand, their religions and cultures while they tried
to understand ours.
	   Back then, I didn't know (and probably wasn't interested to
know) that a Chinese person's first name is his family name. I
thought Sikhs were Hindus when they have their own religion.
	   I didn't know that Buddhists celebrate Wesak. I didn't know that
Sinhalese are Buddhists. I didn't know that Chinese New Year is
more a cultural than a religious event. Meanwhile, Choon Kit,
Kumaran and Sunita seemed to know our religion and culture inside
out.
	   These people acted differently from the way the people of their
race acted. They were OK because they acted like us. They were
essentially Malays.
	   Here lies the paradox. While we looked unfavourably on other
races as a whole, stereotyping the other races' (mis)conducts, we
seemed to accept the few non-Malays we were friends with.
	   That is why I mentioned that racism is a complex thing. It's not
as black and white as some politicians argue. Strength of
expression does not necessarily equate with depth of conviction.
People whom we think are racists may have many close friends of
other races.
	   When I was in Form Four, I went to a boarding school in
Terengganu where all the students were Malays. This was the third
phase of my life, when my views on race relations changed
radically, thanks to the teachings and influence of my teachers and
friends.
	   Some of the teachers, whom I suspected had never had any
contacts with non-Malays in their lives, made blatant racist
remarks. They taught that non-Malays in Malaysia were scheming to
overthrow the Government and kill, or at least, oppress Malays.
	   In Bangi, non-Malays were derided for their stereotypical
behaviour.
	   Here, they were the embodiment of evil. An ustaz said it was not
a sin to steal from a non-Muslim shop. Non-Malays, according to the
dogma preached to us, would be generous or kind to us only if they
had ulterior motives, which, naturally, was destructive to the
Malay interest.
	   Other people's religions were looked down on and were condemned
for promoting debauchery and mischief. Their culture was said to be
savage and unrefined. Non-Muslims (meaning non-Malays) were
misguided by their religion and culture. The non-Malays were ``out
to get us''.
	   Being at an impressionable age, I was converted. Whatever my
teachers and friends said to me was gospel. It made sense. Never
had the ``truth''
	   been so clearly demonstrated to me. This was to be my new
ideology: we must defend ourselves from being harmed. We must stick
together.
	   In boarding school, there was a girl who was of mixed parentage.
Her father was Chinese. I did not give it much thought then but I
now wonder how she felt when some teachers were denouncing the
Chinese. It must have been painful.
	   When I left the boarding school after Form Five, my views on
race relations were totally altered. I consciously tried to
minimise making contact with non-Malays, looking askance at them
whenever there was a need to talk to them.
	   The next phase came after I received a scholarship to further my
studies abroad. Before leaving, I was sent to a private college in
Petaling Jaya for matriculation. I was forced to come into close
contact with non- Malays. In college, I witnessed how the students
(Malays and non-Malays) mixed with each other without caution or
hesitation.
	   I was disturbed. Haven't they heard of the ``truth''? That the
non-Malays were ``out to get us''? I decided to ``play along'' and
mix with the non- Malays but my relationship with them was confined
to pleasantries and bantering.
	   This uncomfortable atmosphere continued throughout my college
year. My ideas changed, however, when I started thinking for
myself, rather than letting other people do the thinking for me. I
realised how and irrational were the ideas ingrained in me by some
of the teachers in my boarding school.
	   How can these people have ulterior motives in everything they do
to us?
	   It's an absurd notion. I began to relax and opened up to my
non-Malay fellow students. My views on race relations changed
again, this time, I hope, for the better.
	   I am ashamed to admit that only at this juncture of my life did
I learn that a Chinese person might not understand what another
Chinese is saying.
	   This is because they have many dialects.
	   Previously, I assumed that whenever a Chinese spoke, every
Chinese would understand him.
	   After college, I worked for six months before going abroad. This
was my period of enlightenment. My earlier held racist ideology was
now dead. I became good friends with many of my non-Malay fellow
students.
	   When I was studying abroad, two of my closest friends, Bryan and
Gideon, were Chinese. Sometimes I can't help but laugh at myself
for being naive, allowing myself to be hoodwinked into having such
bigoted views about the Chinese.
	   Bryan and Gideon helped me adjust to life over there. I found it
far- fetched for them to have ulterior motives in their kindness to
me.
	   There are no more hang-ups or prejudices against them.
	   My new ideology is simple. People are people. Whatever evil,
peculiar or ridiculous things that they do, they are only
representing themselves.
	   They don't represent their race.
	   Is everyone born a racist or is it a result of conditioning?
Some theorists say that this phenomenon is a natural defence
mechanism inherent in every person in order to protect his ``tribal
interest''.
	   Am I naive to think that racism should and could be completely
eliminated? On top of the obvious solution, which is education, can
interracial relationships, which are getting more common, reduce
this problem?
	   Should we encourage it? Dare I say that a child of mixed
parentage will never be a racist, since he is a product of two or
more races? Or will it only aggravate the matter, by virtue of it
diluting the ``purity'' of a race, thereby creating new problems?

	   Parliament continued discussion on the 1997-98 supplementary
budget Monday, when a leading Jatiya Party MP brought allegation of
corruption and inefficiency against the bureaucracy.
	   ``What's the use of spending so much money of the tax payers for
government officials who are neither transparent nor accountable,''
said Dr Rustam Ali Farazi.
	   He said there was no instance that files moved without giving
``bribe'' starting from a Secretary to a Peon.
	   The JP member also quoted the Prime Minister and said she had
also admitted that bribe was yet to be stamped out from the
administration.
	   Farazi also mentioned Telecommunications Minister Mohammad
Nasim's reported statement that despite the decisions of the
cabinet, development works slowed down due to bureaucracy.
	   ``Why people will pay their tax for this corrupt and inefficient
bureaucracy,'' he said, adding that the supplementary budget was
needed this year because of lion's share of spending on salary and
allowance of government officials.
	   Referring to the crises of electricity and water in Dhaka city,
the JP member said in the name of system loss, some people are
plundering money.
	   Dr Farazi advised the government to maintain austerity and stop
wastage of money from the public exchequer.
	   Three members from the treasury bench also took part in the
discussion yesterday. They were: Deputy Minister for Food Dhirendra
Devnath Shambhu, Mahmuda Sawgat and Segufta Yasmin.
	   BSS adds: The Treasury Bench members have highly appreciated the
performance of the government in the key economic sectors during
the outgoing fiscal year.
	   Participating in general discussion on the supplementary budget
they described the proposed budget for 1998-99 as a true guideline
which would lead the nation towards gradual progress by
implementing the commitments of the present government to fulfil
the hopes and aspirations of the people.
	   Taking part in the discussion first, Biren Sikder (AL-Magura)
said the GDP growth rates of 5.9 per cent in 1996-97 and 5.6 per
cent in 1997-98 achieved by the present government were the
manifestation of its success in proper economic management in the
country over the last two years.
	   He bitterly criticised the long march organised by Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies and said such demonstration
was aimed at disrupting peace and creating unrest in the country.
	   ``BNP gave importance to long march, not the budget,'' he said
adding when the world highly acclaimed the peace accord on CHT, BNP
held its long march to mar it.
	   Participating in the discussion, Mrs Mahmuda Sawgat (women
seat-13) thanked Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria for presenting a
realistic budget for the fiscal 1998-99 and said it would rid the
nation of poverty and bring about a positive change in the
industrial sector by dint of the present government's
well-thought-out approaches.
	   Speaking about her area in Barisal, Pirojpur and Jhalakathi, Mrs
Mahmuda Sawgat drew the attention of the Minister for Post and
Telecommunications for installing digital telephone exchanges in
the area.
	   Speaking next, Mrs Segufta Yasmin (women seat-21) congratulated
the finance minister for presenting the supplementary budget for
1997-98 and the annual budget for 1998-99.

	   COLOURFUL balloons, tied to tables and chairs, bobbed merrily;
Alanis Morissette's eerie Uninvited filled the air; three
good-looking male models in the original leather trenchcoats used
by the angels in Brad Silberling's latest film, City Of Angels,
walked around, each with a bottle of Declaration in hand.
	   Their mission: To give guests a whiff of Cartier's latest
perfume.
	   What occasion was this? It was Warner Bros' City Of Angels party
at the Iguana restaurant-pub in Bangsar Shopping Complex in Kuala
Lumpur last Friday night. The party was followed by a private
screening of the film at the Golden Screen Cineplex of the complex.
	   It was a night of pure fun! Bottles of Declaration were given
away, finger food went around and members of the media, invited
guests and celebrities like Harith Iskandar, Paula Malai Ali,
Prema, Ning Baizura and members of Innuendo and Poetic Ammo caught
up on each other's news.
	   After the party, guests were ushered to the cineplex for the
movie, which moved many.
	   Reymee, the youngest member of Innuendo and his lovely date,
both enjoyed the movie, but felt the ending was a tad sad. ``It was
a good movie. I was very touched,'' confessed Reymee.
	   Singer Prema Lucas, a self-confessed ``romantic sobber'', felt
it was entertaining, enlightening and inspirational. ``City Of
Angels was reminiscent of a few films I have seen about angels. It
was a good movie and I had a good cry about it.
	   ``What made it more special was knowing that Dawn Steel (one of
the producers), was dying of breast cancer when working on the
movie. It must have been quite an inspirational and spiritual movie
for her.''
	   Paula Malai Ali, who called herself a cynic, said: ``It was a
well- written story and very touching. I don't normally feel
touched by a film and I never cry at movies, but I thought City Of
Angels was lovely.''
	   For those interested in watching the movie earlier than its
nationwide opening on June 18, you can do so by attending the
charity screening by the National Cancer Council (Makna) on June
14.
	   It will be held at the Smile-UA Cineplex in the new UE3 Plaza
(Plaza Uncang Emas 3) in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur.
	   Proceeds from the charity screening will go to the Makna fund.
Makna is trying to raise over RM100 million to establish the Makna
Cancer Institute, the first of its kind in Malaysia, by the year
2000. So far, about RM25 million has been collected.
	   Makna, set up on Nov 10, 1994, is a non-governmental and
non-profit organisation, with the sole purpose of providing
assistance to cancer sufferers.
	   The screening is dedicated to the memory of Mohammad Shafiq
Sabaruddin, the four-year-old cancer patient who died on May 25 and
to producer Dawn Steel, who died of breast cancer last December.
	   The patron of the charity screening is Datin Seri Dr Wan Azizah
Wan Ismail, wife of the Deputy Prime Minister, who is also patron
of Makna.
	   The project is supported by Warner Bros (M) Sdn Bhd, Smile-UA
Cineplex Holdings Sdn Bhd and UE3 Plaza.
	   Tickets are RM150, RM100 and RM50. For details, call
03-4569178/4569179, fax 03-4569203 or e-mail makna &LR; po.jaring.my

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - It was a memorable moment for retiring
headmaster of Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Damansara Utama in Petaling
Jaya, K.
	   Vijayasuriar, 55, when he was taken on a ride with a banner on
his last day at school yesterday.
	   The sign was prepared by teachers who were obviously reluctant
to let him go after barely two months there since May 1.
	   For Vijayasuriar June 12 will always be memorable at apart from
being his retirement day it is also his birthday.
	   He will be replaced by Jamaluddin Mohd Yusuf from the Hulu
Langat District Education Office, who starts on June 15.
	   Vijayasuriar said it was hard to say goodbye after being
attached to the schooling system from seven, when he first attended
school, until retirement.

	   Lawyers for Angel Isidro Rodriguez Saez, also known as ``El
Divino,'' said Monday they are confident of their client's
innocence and their ability to permanently secure his freedom.
	   Rodriguez Saez is currently free on parole due to injunctions,
or amparos, filed by his lawyers against warrants issued Sunday by
two federal judges and other orders.
	   Hector Lobato Perez, one of El Divino's lawyers, said the fact
that 12 other people charged with bank fraud surrounding a
34-million-peso loan to a ghost company (Aerotransportacion
Comercial) were cleared of charges gives him confidence his client
will also be cleared. This statement comes after the judges ordered
Rodriguez Saez, the former head of failed Grupo Financiero
Asemex-Banpais SA, to stand trial on embezzlement charges as the
government seeks to expand its case against the former banker,
Bloomberg reported.
	   Rodriguez, who was extradited from Spain two weeks ago, is
accused of embezzling 579.09 million pesos (64.0 million dollars)
in illegal loan transactions. He is also charged for granting
illegal loans worth 34.73 million pesos.
	   The two accusations are the latest in a series of accusations
brought by the government against Rodriguez, who allegedly carried
out fraudulent transactions for as much as 400 million dollars as
head of Banpais.
	   Finance officials began detecting Rodriguez's alleged illegal
transactions in early 1996.

Campaigning opens in Portugal for referendum on abortion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Official campaigning for the June 28
national referendum on the divisive issue of abortion began Tuesday
with pro-choice and anti-abortion activists placing newspaper ads
and unveiling billboards.
	   Voters will be asked whether they agree with a law to allow
abortions on request through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Portugal's current abortion law permits the termination of
pregnancy only for strict medical reasons, such as fetus
malformation or perceived risk to the mother's life.
	   The result of the referendum will be binding only if more than
half of 8.5 million registered voters participate.
	   Portugal is the third country in the European Union to hold a
referendum on the decriminalization of abortion. Italy approved it
in 1978, whereas in Ireland it was rejected in 1992.
	   One anti-abortion billboard showed a woman's naked stomach with
a ring-pull inserted into the skin. ``Don't believe in easy
solutions to difficult decisions,'' it said.
	   The billboard was placed by the Platform for Solidarity and
Life, one of five civic movements against abortion which gathered
the 5,000 signatures entitling it to participate in the official
campaign.
	   The anti-abortion movements are backed by the powerful Roman
Catholic Church.
	   The only organized pro-choice group, the Yes to Tolerance
Movement, was running the slogan ``Who am I to condemn others?''
	   Pro-choice groups claim that some 16,000 women each year have
illegal abortions in dangerous sanitary conditions. They face a
jail term of up to three years, but the law is rarely enforced, and
there currently are no women in prison on such charges.
	   An opinion poll published May 1 in daily Publico indicated a
clear majority in favor of easing restrictions. Almost 70 percent
said they would vote yes, against 30 percent who opposed the move.
The poll had a margin of error of 2.73 percent.
	   The country's two main political parties, the governing
Socialist party and the Social Democratic party, took no official
stance on the issue and allowed their members to vote according to
their conscience.
	   Public figures, including actors and pop stars, were scheduled
to appear in both sides' campaigns.

Albania accuses Yugoslavia of `genocidal massacres'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - Albania on Tuesday accused Yugoslavia of inflicting
``genocidal massacres'' on ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
	   Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo issued the unusually harsh
rhetoric in addressing delegates to a U.N. conference on a global
court.
	   Yugoslav Serb forces have cracked down on separatists in the
province, where ethnic Albanians are 90 percent of the population.
More than 300 people have been killed since March, and about 65,000
have been forced to leave their homes.
	   The violence has raised fears Albania, which borders the
province, and other Balkan nations could be drawn into the
fighting.
	   Milo also called resistance by ethnic Albanians
``self-defense.''
	   ``We are often witnessing monstrous crimes produced by criminal
governmental policies and practices'' in the world, the minister
said. The ``most convincing example'' were massacres carried out by
Serbs in Bosnia, he said, and are being repeated in Kosovo.
	   ``We are deeply convinced that the genocidal massacres (by) the
Serb authorities in Kosovo are a consequence of an
institutionalized policy of genocide, of state terrorism realized
through the military, paramilitary and police machinery against
Albanian elders and minors,'' Milo said.
	   He said Albanians in Kosovo are the victims of ``ethnic
cleansing.''
	   ``The self-defense resistance of the Albanian population against
this policy can never be identified with so-called terrorism,''
Milo said.
	   Armed members of the Kosovo Liberation Army have been fighting
Serb forces.

	   YOU may have seen Kajol as a psychotic killer in Gupt last year.
This time around, in Dushman, she plays the victim.
	   The story is a welcome relief as it is different from the
boy-meets-girl Bollywood staple.
	   Praise for this goes to its producer - actress Pooja Bhatt,
daughter of famed director Mahesh Bhatt.
	   It needs guts to finance an off-track movie like this one, even
though it boasts two top stars in Kajol and Sanjay Dutt.
	   This is Pooja's second movie after her critically-acclaimed
Tamanna. You may remember she came to Malaysia last year to attend
its screening at the Penang movie festival.
	   Tamanna revolved around the life of a girl raised by a
transvestite.
	   Dushman, by debutante director Tanuja Chandra, depicts woman
power.
	   Despite Sanjay's presence, this is undoubtedly Kajol's movie.
	   Kajol plays identical twins Sonia and Naina who live with their
mother (Tanvi Azmi). Sonia becomes a victim of depraved postman
Gokul (Ashutosh Rana) who stalks pretty girls.
	   Naina is the next target. While fleeing her attacker, she bumps
into blind ex-army major Suraj (Sanjay Dutt) who teaches her
self-defence.
	   This prepares Naina for the final confrontation with Gokul.
	   Dushman is well-directed and Tanuja maintains its suspense
throughout.
	   Cinematographer Nirmal Jani and art director Gappa Chakraborty
deserve praise for the pleasing shots.
	   The songs by Uttam Singh (famous for his songs in last year's
big hit Dilto Pagal Hai) are well-spaced out and don't intrude into
or disrupt the story flow.
	   Dushman is a well-made movie which will appeal to those who want
a good story, suspense and a bit of love. Above all it showcases
Kajol's wide spectrum of emotions and a subdued but memorable
performance from Sanjay.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second air raid, Israeli confirmation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.
	   Two Israeli jets attacked the deserted village of Sojod in Iqlim
el-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied
border enclave in southern Lebanon, said Lebanese security
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Twenty minutes later, the jets returned to fire two
air-to-surface missiles on Aqmata, a village a few kilometers east
of Sojod and 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of Nabatiyeh, the
major market town in the south, the officials added.
	   Plumes of black smoke billowed from the areas, but there was no
word on casualties. The Israeli military confirmed the raids and
said the planes returned safely.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah is a frequent target of Israeli warplanes.
	   The area is used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese
militiamen from the border enclave, which Israel set up in 1985.

	   PERUSAHAAN Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) has entered into an
understanding with Lotus Engineering Ltd to upgrade the ``ride and
handling'' aspect of Proton cars.
	   Through the partnership, Proton plans to increase its capability
in ``ride and handling'' by three-fold within the next five years.
	   In a statement, Proton's general manager of research and
development, new platform and power train, Kamarulzaman Darus, said
that the agreement was in line with Proton's intention to market
its future products using ``ride and handling'' as a main signature
for its vehicles.
	   ``The upgrading of ride and handling in Proton's product range
will not only improve the performance of its cars but more
importantly, re-position its image by giving the cars a distinct
feature in the domestic and overseas markets,'' he said.
	   Proton said the re-positioning conformed with market research
indicating that vehicle selection was often determined by styling
and unique characteristics rather than safety, emission and
performance measurements.
	   Proton research and development (testing and homologation)
manager Tengku Azizan Tengku Ahmad said that in automotive
language, ``ride'' refers to the quality of a vehicle's ride which
relates directly to passenger comfort level.
	   ``Handling'' on the other hand refers to the quality of vehicle
traction, balance and response which determines the stability of
the vehicle.
	   Proton's effort to upgrade its ``ride and handling'' capability
was an important initiative to narrow the gap between the opposing
levels of comfort and stability, the company said.
	   ``Achieving the five-year goal to acquire ride and handling
capability will require specific planning and initiatives to be
implemented, which in turn, will require critical investments in
manpower, facilities and equipment,'' Kamarulzaman said.
	   Under the agreement, Lotus Engineering will provide relevant
training, infrastructure, software and data to Proton.
	   The company said in terms of training, personnel would undergo
specific training in vehicle driving assessment apart from other
forms of critical training such as chassis engineering and design.
	   It said that Proton would collaborate with Lotus Engineering in
other areas as well.

	   The stock market (Bolsa) posted its biggest one-day decline in
five months Monday, triggered by sliding oil prices and currencies
and the continuing Asian crisis.
	   External factors from Asia are prompting the drop, said Sergio
Garcia, head of analysis at Value brokerage.
	   ``Lots of people are talking about Fobaproa and social unrest in
Chiapas or Guerrero,'' he said. ``But the magnitude of the effect
is from Asia instead of internal factors.''
	   The Bolsa's main IPC index plunged 166.69 points or 3.95 percent
to 4048.99, completing its sixth day of decline.
	   Oil prices dropped to a 12-year low further damaging stocks.
	   Part of the problem is high oil inventory in Europe and the
United States lessening the demand for Mexican oil, said Garcia.
	   Mexico is highly dependent on oil with 38 percent of its revenue
coming from oil sales. However, Garcia said he expects oil export
prices to remain steady.
	   TV Azteca posted the worst performance with a 12-percent
decrease to 6.74. Special events organizer Corporacion
Interamericana de Entretenimiento (CIE) fell 9.8 percent to 22.1.
	   The second half of the year should be tough for economic growth
and will be reflected in the numbers of the two budget cuts, Garcia
said. But mainly the concern lies in Asia, he said.
	   ``Asia has been extremely slow in making the necessary
structural reforms,'' he said. ``It's going to take a couple of
years.''
	   Of the 85 company issues traded, two gained, 75 dropped, and
eight remained unchanged, according to Bloomberg News. Although it
will take a couple of years, Mexico has strong fundamentals and
will recover faster in the long run, said Garcia.
	   ``The Bolsa and peso have been hit hard by external factors,''
he said, ``but they are not as vulnerable as other Asian economies.
We have already passed through that time.''

Germany's beer consumption down again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Germany's thirst for beer eased again
last year. And the industry's outlook is grim: Beer ranks seventh
in beverages, behind both cola and coffee.
	   The German Association of Brewers said Tuesday that the
pro-capita beer consumption dropped slightly last year to 131
liters (34 gallons), from 132 liters (34 gallons) in 1996.
	   Germans, once the world's top beer drinkers, are now second
place behind the Czechs.

	   JOHOR Baru has what it takes to become the regional headquarters
for multi-national corporations with business interests in the
region, said Pelangi Bhd managing director Frank S.K. Goon
yesterday.
	   He said the city was strategically located with excellent
infrastructure facilities to support world-class businesses.
	   Goon added Johor Baru offered several top-notch executive suites
for companies seeking suitable office space, with a full range of
telecommunications and other business infrastructure.
	   It, therefore, made good business sense for these companies to
relocate their offices here as it was cheaper to operate than
Singapore or Hong Kong.
	   ``MNCs and other institutional operators should take advantage
of Johor Baru's proximity to Singapore and relocate their offices
as it is so much cheaper to operate from here.''
	   ``Johor Baru offers value for money for foreign companies keen
to set up their regional headquarters here in terms of cheaper
office rentals, support facilities and manpower costs.''
	   Goon was speaking to reporters after the `topping up' ceremony
for Johor Baru's new City Square project by Menteri Besar Datuk
Abdul Ghani Othman.
	   The RM350 million project in the heart of the Johor Baru, is a
joint development between the Johor Baru City Council and the Kuok
Group of companies.
	   It is being built on a 2.2ha site fronting Jalan Tun Abdul Razak
and Jalan Wong Ah Fook, which was previously the site of the Johor
Baru Central Market.
	   The fully-integrated mixed-use development comprises a
six-storey retail podium offering over 120 units of speciality
shops, a five-screen cineplex, an amusement centre and a 30-storey
office tower with 640,000 sq ft of prime quality office space.
	   The take-up rate for the retail units, which are all on lease,
is over 70 per cent, while over 55 per cent of the office space has
either been sold or leased to date, said Goon.
	   Among the anchor tenants in the retail podium with more than
350,000 sq ft of shopping space, are Aktif Lifestyle Department
Store (formerly known as Yaohan) and Tops Supermarket.
	   The shopping centre is due for opening later this year, while
the office tower, in which Maybank alone has taken up four floors,
is scheduled to be ready by mid 1999.
	   Goon said City Square was a fine example of a prestigious
property offering the best in shopping and office space for
discerning international companies keen to set up base here.
	   He noted that several other top-notch office towers had emerged
here of late, including Menara Pelangi, Kulim Towers, Menara
Landmark, Metropolitan Towers and Public Bank Building - all within
the Johor Baru central business district. He pointed out that
office space in Johor Baru was significantly cheaper than
Singapore, with prime space going for as little as RM4.50 in the
City Square project.
	   A similar-class property in Singapore, he noted, would run into
double- digit figures and in Singapore dollars.

EDs: LEADING to add information on underlying inflation and the
</HEADLINE>
government's target, more comments from Treasury, industry &QL; 
 &UR; British inflation creeps higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation rose to a 6-year high of 4.2
percent in May, meaning the Labor government has missed its target
for consumer price increases in 11 of the past 12 months, officials
said Tuesday.
	   The higher prices, blamed largely on increases in fresh food,
caught business leaders off guard and stirred concerns that
interest rates may have to go up again.
	   The Treasury called the rising inflation ``temporary'' and
predicted inflation will retreat in July.
	   But business lobbyists and the political opposition had a harsh
reaction.
	   ``This is terrible news for business in Britain, especially
exporters,'' said Vincent Burke, spokesman for the London Chamber
of Commerce and Industry. ``They are now getting hit with a
quadruple whammy of rising costs, rising interest rates, the strong
pound and problems in Southeast Asia.''
	   The chamber urged businesses and government agencies to show
restraint in raising wages for their workers.
	   Kate Barker, chief economic adviser at the Confederation of
British Industry, pointed out that since the seasonal rise in some
food costs was the big culprit, the latest figures are reason to
panic, but rather ``potential cause for concern.''
	   Most British multinationals have seen their export earnings hurt
by the high value of sterling, and they were unsettled by the
prospect of even higher interest rates that would raise the pound
further against other currencies.
	   Inflation had stood at 4 percent in April. The underlying rate
of inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, rose to
3.2 percent in May, up from 3.0 percent in April and well above the
government's elusive target of 2.5 percent.
	   The current overall inflation rate is the highest since May
1992, when it stood at 4.3 percent.
	   The Bank of England has been inching interest rates higher over
the past year to try to bring inflation down to 2.5 percent, but
thus far the monetary tightening has not worked.
	   The central bank has imposed six rate increases of a
quarter-point each _ the most recent on June 4 _ since the Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair took office in May 1997.
	   The opposition Conservative Party characterized the latest
figures as Labor's failure to keep the economy under control.
	   ``Business now has to worry about further interest rate rises as
the Bank of England tries to control the mess the government has
made,'' said lawmaker John Redwood, who speaks for the
Conservatives on trade issues.

	   AMSTEEL Securities (M) Sdn Bhd's application for a summary
judgment to recover outstanding debts amounting to RM17.2 million
from its two clients and their guarantor Tan Sri Teong Teck Leng
will be decided on July 17.
	   The debts were incurred as a result of trading in shares listed
on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange by businessmen Kam Hock Aun and
Chan Yong Sin.
	   Teong is the chief executive officer of Malaysia Electric
Corporation Bhd and chairman and chief executive officer of listed
Kuala Lumpur Industries Holding Bhd.
	   When the matter came before Kuala Lumpur High Court Senior
Assistant Registrar Noriza Samdin yesterday, she asked counsel for
Amsteel Securities Y.N. Foo and the defendants' counsel Mohamad
Hanif Khatri to submit written submissions and fixed July 17 for a
decision.
	   Amsteel Securities is claiming RM9,082,580.66 from Chan, whom it
said opened a share trading account with it on Jan 14, 1997, with
Teong becoming his guarantor by an agreement on Feb 18, 1997 - in
which he agreed to bear any losses suffered by Chan.
	   In the matter against Kam, who opened his trading account on Jan
17, 1997, Amsteel Securities is claiming RM8,148.904.66.
	   Teong and MEC director Datuk Leong Wye Keong had stood as
guarantor for Kam by an agreement dated Feb 18, 1997 - however, the
action against Leong was discontinued by Amsteel Securities.
	   In another matter, Kuala Lumpur High Court Senior Assistant
Registrar M.
	   Nithiyaanantham allowed an application by Teong and British
Virgin Islands-based company Pepita Gold Ltd for a stay of
proceedings.
	   This is pending their appeal against an earlier ruling that they
pay RM2.4 million in outstanding debts to Amsteel Securities.
	   The ruling was made on May 18 when Nithiyaananthan allowed
Amsteel Securities' summary application for the recovery of
RM2,424,863.73 debt owed by Pepita Gold - arising from losses
incurred by Pepita Gold as a result of trading in shares on the
KLSE.
	   Teong and Leong were also sued in their capacity as guarantors
but the action against Leong was withdrawn after the summary
judgment was ordered.
	   Amsteel Securities said Pepita Gold had opened the trading
account on Jan 17, 1997 with Teong and Leong as guarantors by an
agreement on Feb 18, 1997.
	   The appeal against the ruling is to be continued for hearing
before Kuala Lumpur High Court Judge Datuk Steve Shim on June 22.

	   The Superintendent of Police denied the report published in a
section of the press that a girl was violated at Shimrail on the
night before the opposition's Long March on June 9.
	   Briefing journalists this afternoon here SP AHM Nooruddin said
the opposition BNP issued a statement to different dailies
depicting ``an imaginary incident with a view to undermining the
administration.''
	   However, the SP said that on June 6 a BNP leader, Nuruddin,
along with his associates, abducted two workers of the Olympic
Factory. One of the two girls was violated, the SP said.
	   On the basis of the case filed with Siddhirganj thana, police
arrested a BNP worker, Abdul Mannan alias Mona, and sent him to the
court, the SP added.

	   FURNITURE manufacturer Len Cheong Holding Bhd plans to develop a
furniture industrial park on a 10.5-hectare-land near Seremban,
Negri Sembilan.
	   The project is expected to take off by next year when
negotiations with potential partners are expected to be finalised.
	   ``We are having talks with several furniture and furniture
component manufacturers locally and from Japan on taking up units
there as well as being our joint-venture partners,'' executive
director Lo Chee Kong said after the company's general meeting in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   He said the proposed park to be built in Mukim Ampangan would
cater almost exclusively for furniture manufacturers who export
their products.
	   Len Cheong, listed on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange last year, registered a pre-tax profit of RM7.34 million
for the financial year ended Dec 31, 1997, with a turnover of
RM31.97 million.
	   Lo said 70 per cent of the turnover came from their exports to
Japan.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leo Gomez hit a grand slam home run in the top of
the ninth inning Tuesday as the Chunichi Dragons beat Yomiuri 6-2
at Tokyo Dome and took over the Central League lead from the
Giants.
	   Gomez's winning homer came after pinch hitter Koji Yamaguchi
drew a bases-loaded walk from the second reliever, Koichi Misawa,
tying the game 2-2.
	   Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has 10 homers.
	   Giants pitcher Balvino Galvez, formerly with the Texas Rangers,
gave up seven hits and four walks over 8 1/3 innings and took the
loss. He is 4-6.
	   The Dragons now have a half-game lead over the Giants.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Kohta Soejima singled home the winning
run in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Yakult Swallows a
4-3 victory over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.
	   At Kusanagi, pinch hitter Jun Inoue drove in the only run in the
eighth with an infield hit as the Yokohama BayStars blanked the
Hanshin Tigers 1-0.
	   Motonobu Tanishige singled, reached third on a sacrifice bunt
and a grounder, and scored on Inoue's hit.
	   In the Pacific League, Domingo Martinez hit a three-run home run
and Taisei Takagi belted a grand slam as the Seibu Lions beat the
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 10-5 at Seibu Dome.
	   The Lions ended their losing streak at three.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A team, hit his 13th homer of
the season in the first inning. Takagi, who now has five, hit his
in the eighth.
	   The Fighters are still 1 1/2 games ahead of the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks, who downed the Orix BlueWave 3-1 at Kobe.
	   The Hawks tied 1-1 on former Cleveland Indians player Luis
Lopez's one-run single in the sixth inning and won on Koji
Akiyama's seventh-inning homer, his sixth of the season.
	   At Fujiidera, the Kintetsu Buffaloes extended their winning
streak to four with a 12-8 victory over the Chiba Lotte Marines on
four home runs, including a three-run shot by Phil Clark.
	   Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 10 homers.

Sotheby's sale spotlights Dutch love affair with tulips
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ For more than four hundred years,
the Dutch have been smitten by the svelte tulip.
	   It seduced and brought ruin to many who dealt in options on
bulbs back in the 1600s, and its bulbs even fed the war-starved
Dutch during World War II.
	   Cashing in on this love affair, Sotheby's devoted an entire
auction to tulip artworks Tuesday, selling off hundreds of
paintings, prints and drawings of the perennial that has become
synonymous with this flower-crazed nation.
	   ``They are so Dutch. When people think about Holland, they think
about tulips,'' said Diana Ridderikhoff, spokeswoman for Sotheby's
in Amsterdam.
	   Selling nearly all of 183 lots, the theme auction netted 1.5
million guilders (dlrs 750,000), overshooting the 1-million-guilder
(dlrs 500,000) expectations of the organizers.
	   Prices ran from 1,500 guilders (dlrs 750) for the smaller works
to 45,000 guilders (dlrs 22,500) for more elaborate pieces.
	   Highlighting the sale was a collection of more than 400
decorative 17th and 18th century watercolors of tulips.
	   These pieces were likely for albums documenting flowers that
were being bought and sold at the time, either for individual's
records or for illustrated nursery catalogs.
	   The Netherlands is the world's largest tulip bulb producer with
some 3.3 billion bulbs each year. Its bulbs are also exported to 80
different countries.
	   Tulips came to the Netherlands in 1593, when botanist Carolus
Clusius planted the first bulb in Dutch soil.
	   By 1634, the slender flower became a status symbol for the idle
rich of the Dutch Golden Age, sparking a brief but highly
speculative ``tulip mania'' that pushed prices for tulip bulbs even
higher.
	   At the height of the fervor in 1636-37, a rare tulip bulb could
cost as much as the price of a house. The options market ultimately
crashed, leaving investors in financial ruin.
	   But the tulip redeemed itself during World War II, when the
famished Dutch dug bulbs out of the fields and boiled them to
survive the infamous Hunger Winter of 1944.

World Cup: Valiant loss gives Japan confidence against Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ The Japanese are taking their 1-0
loss to Argentina at their first World Cup game as an almost-win,
or at least a draw that slipped away.
	   That's why they are preparing to win the next one against
Croatia Saturday.
	   ``It gave me confidence. Everybody told us we did well,'' said
22-year-old striker Shoji Jo.
	   ``It wasn't like: 'Can Japan play soccer?' '' said defender
Yutaka Akita, who was unflinching against Argentine striker Gabriel
Batistuta. ``I expected a bigger difference.''
	   Akita said the team proved they could handle aggressive players
who push forward and take the ball to the goal. And so why
shouldn't they do better against Croatia, which moves more
gradually, steadily grinding down the opposing defense?
	   ``We can handle either way fine,'' Akita said.
	   But Japan had lacked the final touches to score.
	   ``That was the difference between Argentina and us. Unless you
can score at that one opportunity, you can't win at the World
Cup,'' Akita said.
	   ``There was a problem with the finish in our offense. If we go
with more confidence, we can do better,'' Jo said. ``My level of
playing went up. I'm surprised. But we all have to move up one more
level.''
	   Coach Takeshi Okada said he plans to slightly change the
offensive line against Croatia.
	   Besides starters Jo and Masashi Nakayama, the forwards are
Masayuki Okano and Brazilian-born Wagner Lopes, who was sent in
toward the end of Sunday's game along with midfielder Takashi
Hirano.
	   Also on the bench for midfield are Hiroaki Morishima, who scored
for seven straight games since the opening of J-League this season;
Teruyoshi Ito, who had the solitary goal in the 1-0 upset against
Brazil in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics; as well as Shinji Ono, the
only teen-ager on Japan's squad.
	   Defensive midfielder Toshihiro Hattori is widely believed to
have been selected on the team specifically for the match against
Croatia.
	   ``It will be as difficult as our game against Argentina, if not
more difficult,'' Okada said, adding that he was impressed by the
``destructive power'' of Croatia's 3-1 victory over Jamaica. ``They
aren't going to come underestimating us this time.''
	   Captain Masami Ihara said the next one was a must-win for Japan.
	   ``If we lose, we will not get past the first round,'' he said.
``We have to make very careful preparations.''

	   KLUANG, Fri. - High cost of feedmeal and low demand for rabbit
meat has forced the Kluang Veterinary Institute to reduce their
rabbit rearing venture.
	   The institute which started with 3,000 rabbits about seven years
ago, has only about 400 animals now.
	   Institute director Md Yusoff Sudin said the institute spent
about 10 sen on feed for each rabbit daily. It consisted of
imported ready-mix maize, soya bean and mulberry leaves.
	   ``The first 40 to 45 day, the rabbits are fed by its mother.
	   ``After that, we provide them with high protein and fibre
feedmeal, which cost about 80 sen per kg, until the rabbits are
about two kg before we sell them for their meat or as pets.
	   ``Despite its low-fat characteristic and being accepted by all
races, there is a lack of demand for rabbit meat in the market,''
he said in an interview.
	   The animal is sold at an average of RM5 per kg depending on
their grades. Most of the rabbits are sold to restaurants or hotels
in Johor Baru.
	   The institute also sells the rabbits to farms for breeding at
RM350 per pair. These selected breeder stocks are fed until they
are about 4kg to 4.5kg before they are sold.
	   Only rabbits which produce about eight offsprings each time and
at an average of six times a year are selected for artificial
insemination.
	   ``We are very strict with our selection. Those which produce
more than eight youngs each time are slaughtered for its meat.
	   ``We also do not sell them as breeder stocks if their youngs are
too tiny. The California White species are the favourite because of
their snow white fur and also they are very prolific,'' he said.
	   The institute, about 8km from Air Hitam and 13km from Kluang
town centre, also rears other rabbit species including New Zealand
White, New Sigmoner and other cross-breeds.

	   BANGI, Fri. - The National Higher Education Fund, previously
available only to school leavers pursuing first degree courses at
local public and private universities, is now open to civil
servants on half-pay study leave.
	   National Higher Education Fund Corporation chairman Ahmad Husni
Hanadzlah said this was to alleviate the financial burden of civil
servants pursuing first degree courses at the 11 public
universities and three selected private universities - Universiti
Telekom Malaysia, Universiti Petronas and Universiti Tenaga
Nasional.
	   The fund is open to civil servants for the 1998/99 academic
session, which commenced last month.
	   Application forms for this year will be available from this
month and loans disbursed either this month or the next.
	   Ahmad Husni said the decision to extend the fund to civil
servants was made after a meeting with Education Minister Datuk
Seri Najib Tun Razak two weeks ago.
	   ``The decision was made based on feedback from civil servants on
half-pay study leave, many of whom have to live on tight budgets.
We are supportive of civil servants who are keen to continue with
their studies.''
	   On whether the extension to civil servants would cause some
students to be deprived of loans, Ahmad Husni said this would not
happen as the number of civil servants eligible was small,
numbering about 500.
	   ``Compared to the 9,091 students eligible last year, 500 is only
a small number.''
	   The fund, allocated RM100 million last year, was allocated
RM205.3 million this year.
	   Ahmad Husni was speaking today after presenting loans under the
fund to Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia students for the 1997/98
academic session.
	   Also present was UKM vice-chancellor Professor Datuk Dr Anuwar
Ali.
	   A total of 676 UKM students received RM6 million in loans.
	   A total of 400 are Arts students and 276 Science students.
	   Ahmad Husni said the criteria of eligibility for civil servants
on half- pay study leave was the same as for other students.
	   ``They must be Malaysians and have to satisfy a means test.
	   ``They must also not be receiving other loans or scholarships,''
he said, adding there was no age limit.
	   ``They must also be studying first degree courses at the 11
public universities and three selected private universities.''
	   Ahmad Husni said those studying Arts courses in public
universities would receive RM6,500 a year and those taking Science
RM7,000 a year.
	   Arts students at private universities will receive RM12,000 each
a year and Science students RM12,500.
	   There are no plans to extend eligibility for loans under the
fund to students pursuing postgraduate courses as yet.
	   Ahmad Husni reminded students they must begin repaying loans six
months after completing their studies. He also said recipients of
loans need not secure guarantors.

	   An extensive housing project has been undertaken in the 16
northern districts under Rajshahi Division to ease the housing
problem in the region. The project includes construction of a total
of 1,60,000 housing units in the region within the year 2005 for
the low income group of people. It is a part of the nationwide
housing programme of 20,00,000 housing units at a cost of Tk
55,00,33,00,000 within the year 2005.According to sources
concerned, the housing and accommodation problem in the region has
become acute in recent years and especially the people of low
income group are facing hardships for their accommodation. No
initiative has so far been taken up by the government in the region
to solve the housing problem. Only a few solvent people have built
some flats in an unplanned way for rental purposes. According to
the source, a total of 1,60,000 units will be built at district
headquarters, thana headquarters and town levels of the division.
	   Each fanily of low income group will be provided with a loan of
Tk 25,000 for long term with 5 to 7 per cent interest . The Housing
Affairs Organisation of the UN will extend its technical assistance
to make the programme a success. The people of the region will be
the main beneficiaries of the project. The people with Tk 100 to Tk
150 daily income level will also be provided with the long-term
loans for housing. Besides the 15-year term loan, the people will
be supplied with construction materials at reasonable prices and
technical assistance to build their houses at a comparatively low
cost. A total of 1,50,000 units under the project will be built in
the region. Another 10,000 units will be built by the Bangladesh
House Building Directorate in the region under it's massive
programme of building another 50,000 housing units throughout the
country within the same period.
	   Under this programme 3,000 units will be built in the
metropolitan city of Rajshahi alone. The concerned authorities will
undertake programme to provide 2 to 3 'katha' plots to the people
in the region for housing under the credit programme to accelerate
the project. Local observers appreciated the government initiative
to solve the housing problem in the region.

	   JOHOR BARU, Fri. - Distributors of pirated software are believed
to be sending their products across the Causeway to cash in on the
strong Singapore dollar.
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (Johor) branch
deputy director Jamil Buang said the seizure of 4,000 pirated video
compact discs found hidden in the floorboard of a van at the
checkpoint in Woodlands on June 8 was ``just the tip of the
iceberg''.
	   The discs, valued at S$60,000 (RM138,000), were suspected to be
pirated copies and many contained pornographic material.
	   He said they were believed to be manufactured in Kuala Lumpur
and supplied to wholesalers and retailers in Johor Baru for
redistribution in the city and the island republic.
	   ``The discs fetch a higher price in Singapore and are retailed
at S$7 per title.''
	   ``Because of strong demand for the discs, there is stiff
competition among the retailers, many of whom have lowered the
price to S$6 per title.
	   This is an attraction for distributors in Johor Baru to push
more copies across the Causeway,'' he said in an interview.
	   He urged the Johor Customs to intensify checks on export cargo
at the Tanjung Puteri Customs Complex to ensure that all goods were
declared and inspected.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said Tuesday
his decision to resume negotiations with ethnic Albanian leaders in
Kosovo was not prompted by NATO exercises in the Balkans.
	   ``I see no connection here,'' he told reporters after a day of
talks with Russian officials.
	   Milosevic said he would not conduct those negotiations with the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the main main militant group fighting to
sever the southern Serb province from Yugoslavia. A more moderate
political leader has reportedly been selected.
	   ``Political leaders ... don't recognize those terrorist
groups,'' Milosevic said. ``I see no reason to conduct negotiations
with terrorists.''
	   Milosevic also said refugees would be allowed to return to
Kosovo without restrictions.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Senior managers wanting safeguards against
the potential business impact of the Year 2000 problem should make
a beeline for an upcoming forum by the Association of the Computer
Industry Malaysia, or Pikom.
	   Titled ``If You Think It's Just a Computer Problem, You Better
Think Again'', the one-day forum on June 30 will feature Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie as its
keynote speaker.
	   The Year 2000, or Y2K, problem refers to the inability of some
computer chips to recognise any year beyond (19)99 in their
time-sensitive functions, which may result in system errors or
shutdowns.
	   A National IT Council report in April said only 25 per cent of
local banking, finance, brokerage and insurance industries had
taken concrete steps to ensure Y2K compliance in their systems.
	   The forum is co-organised by the Small and Medium-Scale
Industries Enterprise Development Corporation, or Smidec, and is
supported by the Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Ministry.
	   Topics include an overview of the Y2K problem, assessing
solutions, strategies and tests to deal with it, external staffing
solutions and legal issues.
	   The problem is estimated to cost the world US$1 trillion to US$2
trillion (RM3.7 trillion to 7.4 trillion) in lawsuits alone.
	   Pikom chairman Shaifubahrim Saleh said today the problem could
affect marketing, purchasing, production, stock control and
customer billing.
	   ``Considering that 15,000 to 30,000 companies may be regularly
using computers in the country, they should at least be aware of
the problem and any steps they can take to prevent it,'' he said.
	   ``Waiting until the economy recovers is too late. There may be
widespread repercussions if computer systems fail when they are
most needed, when business picks up again.''
	   He said more than 2,000 companies under Smidec were registered
with the Government's Industrial Linkage Programme, which had RM100
million in funds for use by SMIs to solve the problem.
	   The registration fee for Pikom and Smidec members is RM200 and
for non- members, RM270.
	   Those interested can register with Pikom by calling 03-2920297
or through its web-site at www.pikom.org.my.
	   Other avenues for dealing with the Y2K problem include the
National IT Council homepage at http://www.jaring.my/nitc, which
allows Malaysian businesses to register for a free sample of IBM's
Y2K Assessment Tool.
	   Local businesses not hooked up to the Internet can obtain the
Shell Y2K Survival Guide book from the Energy, Telecommunications
and Posts Ministry by calling 03-2575000.

Refugees say Serb helicopters attack makeshift camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Two Yugoslav army helicopters, including
one with Red Cross markings, allegedly opened fire on refugee camps
on a mountain near Kosovo's frontier with Albania, killing two
people and sending dozens fleeing towards the border.
	   The accounts of the incident from Kosovo Albanian refugees could
not be independently verified.
	   ``As soon as the first camp was burned, we left immediately,''
said Hilmi Ziberi of the attack late Monday.
	   Ziberi and 50 other refugees walked across the mountains
separating Kosovo from Albania and arrived at this border post
early Tuesday.
	   According to the 39-year-old and other eyewitnesses, the MI-8
helicopters were backed up by dozens of Serb soldiers in the attack
against two mountain camps housing hundreds of Albanian refugees
who were waiting to flee Kosovo into Albania.
	   Both helicopters used heavy machine guns and also dropped hand
grenades as they buzzed the camps, Ziberi claimed. A Yugoslav army
helicopter with Red Cross markings was seen flying over the border
near this post on Monday.
	   The alleged helicopter attacks came on the same day as 85 NATO
aircraft from 13 countries flew over Albania and its border with
Kosovo in a show of force meant to discourage Serb attacks.
	   Ziberi said most of the refugees were from the large village of
Junik and a smaller settlement nearby named Mulliq.
	   ``They want us to leave the country at all costs,'' said Ziberi,
adding he did not know how many refugees from their group remained
across the border. He said two people were killed. He gave no
figure for any injured.
	   Aid workers from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees were taking the refugees to the nearby town of Bajram
Curri, 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) south of the border. Nearly all
are being housed with families.
	   ``We walked for eight hours and crossed the border, but many
people were unable to do it because there are Serb patrols,''
Ziberi said.

Thai police: More than 100 arrested so far for World Cup gambling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police arrested 109 gamblers and
bookies during the first five days of the World Cup soccer
tournament, a television report said Tuesday.
	   In the latest raid, Monday evening, police discovered a ledger
alleged to list more than 10 million baht (dlrs 229,000) in bets on
World Cup matches, ITV television reported. The betting list was
hidden behind an air conditioner's vent.
	   A survey earlier this month estimated that the 64-game
tournament will generate about 30 billion baht (dlrs 682 million)
in bets.
	   Bangkok respondents to the survey by the Thai Farmers Research
Center said they were putting aside an average of 38,860 baht (dlrs
903) to bet, up 35 percent from an average of 28,740 baht (dlrs
668) during the last World Cup finals.
	   Gambling is illegal in Thailand, but the laws are widely
ignored.
	   Soccer has become an increasingly popular gambling vehicle among
Thais since the World Cup matches were first broadcast live here by
satellite in 1994.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - In the midst of the economic problems
facing the country, a writer's association has initiated monthly
poetry reading sessions to instil cultural awareness among the
city's cosmopolitan population.
	   The Malaysian National Writer's Association (Pena) today had its
inaugural poetry reading session, planned to be held on the first
Friday of each month. Tonight's event was sponsored by Pena, the
literary magazine Karya and the Writer's Academy.
	   The session, held in the garden of Rumah Pena in Jalan Lapangan
Terbang, was a tribute to Malaysian poet Baha Zain, the pen name
for the former deputy director of Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Datuk
Baharuddin Zainal.
	   Baharuddin, who is also Pena deputy president, said the current
economic problems should not affect local cultural activities.
	   ``Poets mirror the soul of the people,'' he said. ``We have to
be a moral force, fighting for social issues and the interests of
the community.''
	   He hopes the sessions would continue for the next few years.
	   Pena has also opened its doors for poets and writers who write
in English and in vernacular languages to take part. Participation
will not be restricted to those who write in Bahasa Malaysia.
	   ``If we do not, we will just live within a limited intellectual
scope,''
	   he said.
	   The session was not just limited to Baharuddin's poetry, but
that of others as well. Among them was New Straits Times group
editor Datuk A.
	   Kadir Jasin who shared a poem he wrote for his children.
	   There was also a discussion on current social issues by Datuk Md
Noor Azam, the former chairman of TV3.
	   Among those who read Baharuddin's poetry were Pena executive
secretary Sutung Umar RS, T. Alias Taib, Dinsman Shamsudin, Pena
permanent chairman Rahman Shaari, Sani Sudin, Lim Swee Tin and
Faridah Manaf.
	   Rahman described the response to tonight's event as ``good'',
adding it showed that poetry was not a dying art.
	   Among the poets whose works will be read are Hashim Yaacob and
Rahman on July 3, Ahmad Yatim (Aug 7), Pak Utih (Sept 4), Sani
Sudin (Oct 2), and Firdaus and Kemala (Nov 6).

	   About 13,000 acres of land in Dhulauri and Dhupadho unions under
Santhia thana of the district remain uncultivated every year due to
waterlogging.As a result about 3,000 farmers of the areas are
deprived of 1.5 lakh maunds of paddy and other crops worth about
Taka at least 2 crore every year.According to a reliable source ,
embankments were built on both sides of the river Ichhamati in 1989
under the Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP).
	   As a result, about 300 acres of land in Boro-Payiksha Beel, 100
acres in Fulbaria Kashiapara Beel, 500 acres in Ataria Beel and 100
acres in Chamur Peeha Beel areas in Dhupadho union remain under
water in all the seasons. As a result, the farmers cannot cultivate
their lands causing huge losses.Before the construction of the
embankment the flood and rain water would rush through the main
canal of Bahula Beel near Payiksha village and then would fall into
Ichhamoti easily, local farmers said. But due to construction of
the embankment at Ichhamoti river water cannot be discharged to
river Ichhamoti causing waterlogging in Routi, Fulbari,
Ramkantopur, Choto-Payiksha, Boro-Payiksha and Gopalpur villages.
	   Local farmers cannot cultivate different varieties of crops like
Ropa-Aman, Irri-Boro, mustard, wheat, onion and pulses on about
13,000 acres of land. As a result, farmers are deprived of Taka 1.5
crore annually.Some affected farmers told this correspondent that
the problem was brought to the knowledge of the officials concerned
of WDB, Pabna. But no initiative was taken to solve the
waterlogging problem.The re-excavation of the main canal of (PIRDP)
is in progress.If the water is discharged through the main canal of
PIRDP it may solve the water logging problem in the affected areas,
villagers said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The military on Tuesday sacked 167
military personnel accused of being affiliated with radical Islamic
groups _ the highest number ever dismissed from military ranks at
one time, a television report said.
	   Among them were 109 officers and 58 non-commissioned officers,
private NTV television said.
	   The decision was made at a high military council meeting, where
Turkey's top brass and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz discussed
radical Islamic activities and later jointly announced the
activities were deemed as a domestic threat.
	   A statement from the council said disciplinary decisions were
taken against some military personnel without citing a number.
	   The military has dismissed more than 300 officers for having
ties with radical Islamic groups over the past two years. The
council's decision is final and the courts have no jurisdiction.
	   The military called Tuesday's meeting apparently to pressure
Yilmaz into escalating the government's battle against the radical
Islamic groups, which want to turn Turkey into a religious state.
	   The military, which has staged three coups since the 1960s, has
asserted itself as the guarantor of the modern Turkish state in
this predominantly Muslim but secular country. Last year, the
military forced Turkey's first Islamic-led government to resign.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The United States plans to accept
up to 500 Rwandan and Burundian refugees from Tanzania for
settlement this year, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
	   Some 400 refugees will be from refugee camps in northwestern
Tanzania near
	   Burundi's border and the rest are those referred to the U.S.
Embassy by the U.N. High Commissioner for refugees, the official
said. He asked not to be identified further.
	   The official said the refugees being settled in the United
States are those who cannot return home or permanently live in
Tanzania for a variety of reasons.
	   The Burundians and the Rwandans fled their homelands to escape
ethnic and political violence which began in Burundi in October
1993 and in Rwanda the following April.
	   ------
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A delegation of U.S., British,
European Union and World Bank officials has begun discussing
potential aid packages with government officials in battle-scarred
Sierra Leone.
	   The 22-person mission, led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Refugees and Migration Julia Taft, toured hospitals and refugee
camps Monday and were due to meet with President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, a U.S. embassy statement said.
	   The delegation was due to leave Sierra Leone on Wednesday.

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Six human rights and
election-monitoring groups in Ivory Coast have turned to the
Worldwide Web in a bid to promote democracy and good governance in
the West African country.
	   The rights groups were introduced to e-mail and the Internet by
the Washington-based National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs early this year, the NDI said in a statement.
	   The groups, including the International Association for
Democracy in Ivory Coast, have since been provided with e-mail
capability, Internet access and have begun conducting advocacy
activities on the Web.
	   Each of the rights groups were involved in monitoring Ivory
Coast's first democratic elections in 1995,won by President Konan
Bedie.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Around 20 state leaders from West and
Central Africa plan to meet with international lenders in Senegal's
capital of Dakar later this month to discuss integrating African
economies into the global market.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn has been invited to the
meetings scheduled for June 20-21, the World Bank's regional office
in Accra, Ghana said. The statement did not specify which leaders
would attend.
	   Participants also expect to discuss managing Africa's natural
resources and the effectiveness of existing aid partnerships with
developed countries.
	   A similar forum for leaders of southern and east African states
was held in Kampala, Uganda in January.
	   ------
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Two more people have been killed in
KwaZulu-Natal province, and authorities suspect the deaths are
linked to political tensions in the area or to a rivalry between
taxi-van operators.
	   Five people have been killed in the region near the town of
Richmond since Saturday. The bodies of the most recent victims were
found Tuesday morning.
	   The violence in the eastern province is believed to be part of
conflict between supporters of the African National Congress and
the United Democratic Movement, a rival party.
	   Police Superintendent Errol Reddy said the area was tense and
reports had been received of groups of residents mobilizing.
However, no further incidents were reported since Monday night.

	   IPOH, Fri. - The State MCA Public Complaints Bureau wants the
National Registration Department (NRD) to investigate thoroughly
why a person issued an identity card was now being accused of
forging it.
	   Bureau chief Anthony Pook said Wong Jenn Chang, 31, had gone
through proper procedures to apply for his new IC.
	   Wong had applied to change his old identification card in July
1990. He was issued with a new IC two years later.
	   Wong, who is now working as a restaurant chef in the United
Kingdom, wanted to apply for an international driver's licence.
	   He mailed his Malaysian driver's licence and his IC home so that
his father could apply for the international driver's licence on
his behalf.
	   However, the Road Transport Department rejected the application
claiming Wong's IC was fake after consulting the NRD. Wong's IC and
driver's licence were seized.
	   Pook said the MCA complaints bureau then intervened and
requested an explanation from the NRD.
	   ``An officer said the picture on Wong's IC was not shaped in an
arch and they had doubts the IC was genuine.'' Wong's picture in
his IC was square.
	   Pook then asked the NRD to show him a copy of Wong's application
and was shown a file with the old IC. ``If he had forged the IC,
then how is it his old IC is in the file?
	   ``This means that Wong had followed proper procedures and the IC
is genuine,'' Pook said, adding that the NRD now wanted Wong to
return to the country so that they could take his thumb prints.
	   Pook said others with squarish photos in their ICs did not face
such problems.

	   The Rangamati zone of the Cotton Development Board has taken up
a scheme to bring 12,825 acres of land under cotton cultivation to
produce 5,105 bales of cotton in the ongoing season. According to
official sources, 8,220 acres of land were brought under cotton
cultivation during the last harvesting season and expected yield
was achieved. A vigilence team comprising four experts visited the
demonstration plots and expressed their satisfaction, the sources
added.

	   SEREMBAN, Fri. - The State will find ways to resolve problems
faced by industries, including those related to staff shortage,
through its newly- formed Industrial Liaison Committee.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad Isa Abdul Samad said the
committee, formerly known as the Senawang Industrial Liaison
Committee, comprised 70 factories and would meet three times a
year.
	   ``Owing to the increasing number of industries, especially in
Nilai and Rembau, the committee had expanded and is now responsible
for all factories in the State,'' he said after chairing the
committee's first meeting at Wisma Negri today.
	   He said the meetings, to be chaired by the director of the State
Economic Planning Unit, would be attended by a representative from
all the factories concerned and government departments.
	   He said the main issue discussed at the first meeting was the
shortage of workers, especially in the electronics industry.
	   ``We expect demand for workers to increase, especially since
more than RM754 million had been invested in the State from January
till March this year,'' he added.
	   He said when all these projects were completed, there would be
job openings for more than 1,700 workers in the State.
	   On the water needs of these industries, the Menteri Besar said
supply to industrial zones had become more regular with 12 to 19
hours supply daily.
	   He said that water had never been an issue for these factories
as most had storage tanks to last at least two days.

Refugees say Serb helicopters attack makeshift camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PADESH, Albania (AP) _ Two Yugoslav army helicopters, including
one with Red Cross markings, allegedly opened fire on refugee camps
on a mountain near Kosovo's frontier with Albania, killing two
people and sending dozens fleeing toward the border.
	   The accounts of the incident late Monday from Kosovo Albanian
refugees could not be independently verified.
	   ``As soon as the first camp was burned, we left immediately,''
said Hilmi Ziberi of the attack.
	   Ziberi and 50 other refugees walked across the mountains
separating the troubled Serbian province from Albania and arrived
at the border post of Padesh early Tuesday.
	   According to the 39-year-old and other eyewitnesses, the MI-8
helicopters were backed up by dozens of Serb soldiers who attacked
two mountain camps housing hundreds of Albanian refugees waiting to
flee into Albania.
	   Both helicopters used heavy machine guns and also dropped hand
grenades, Ziberi claimed. A Yugoslav army helicopter with Red Cross
markings was seen flying over the border near this post Monday.
	   The alleged helicopter attacks came on the same day as 85 NATO
aircraft from 13 countries flew over Albania and its border with
Kosovo in a show of force meant to discourage Serb attacks.
	   Ziberi said most of the refugees were from the large village of
Junik and a smaller settlement nearby named Mulliq.
	   ``They want us to leave the country at all costs,'' said Ziberi,
adding he did not know how many refugees from their group remained
across the border. He said two people were killed. He gave no
figure for any injured.
	   Aid workers from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees were taking the refugees to the nearby town of Bajram
Curri, 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) south of the border. Nearly all
are being housed with families.
	   ``We walked for eight hours and crossed the border, but many
people were unable to do it because there are Serb patrols,''
Ziberi said.

	   Produc-tion in Ghorashal Urea Fertiliser Factory here remained
suspended for seven months due to lack of gas supply.Official
sources said , the factory , which won the best prize for its
production in 1990-91, was closed on December 22 last year and
after seven months the amount of loss stood at over Tk 50
crore.Though the production of the factory remained suspended it
has to pay over Tk one crore per month as salary to its officers
and employees.
	   The factory with 305 tons production capacity needs 17 million
cubic feet gas per day, the sources added.Meanwhile, employees of
the factory gheraoed its administrative building on May 13 and
demanded supply of gas immediately to the factory for resuming
production. An official said that he had requested the authorities
concerned time and again to supply gas to the factory but nothing
has yet been done in this regard.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The certificate which Malaysian law
graduates from Australian and New Zealand universities must obtain
to qualify as a lawyer without sitting the Certificate in Legal
Practice is to ensure that they had met the exemption criteria.
	   Legal Profession Qualifying Board director Khalid Yusoff said if
everything was in order, the certificate would be issued
automatically.
	   The board yesterday announced that students who enrolled in
universities in these two countries, on or before April 30, will be
exempted from the CLP.
	   This extends the exemption to current students, and relaxes the
earlier decision to require all who graduate after May 1 next year
to pass the CLP. The earlier decision would have exempted only
final year students.
	   ``We decided on June 3, to extend the exemption to another group
of students,'' said Khalid.
	   To qualify for exemption, the students must also be in fulltime
study, commenced their first year or first semester in a law course
and complete their course in Australia or New Zealand. This
includes students within recognised twinning programmes.
	   However, students who transfer courses from a university outside
Australia and New Zealand, into one in these two countries, are not
exempted. Students enrolling on or after 1 May, are also be bound
by the guidelines.
	   Khalid said the board had written to the 14 Australian and five
New Zealand recognised universities, asking them to provide the
names of all current Malaysian students and their dates of
enrolment, by July 15.
	   When graduates apply for an exemption certificate, the board
will check against these names to ensure that they genuinely
qualify for exemption.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
Tuesday to resume negotiations with a moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader, but said his decision had nothing to do with NATO exercises
in the region.
	   Milosevic said he would meet with Ibrahim Rugova, a political
leader of Kosovo's Albanians, and not with the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the main militant group fighting to sever the southern Serb
province from Yugoslavia.
	   ``I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists,''
Milosevic told reporters after meeting with Russian officials for
several hours.

	   One person , beaten up mercilessly by his in-laws following a
brawl over money, succumbed to his injuries at the Narsingdi Sadar
Hospital recently. It is learnt , Abul Kalam Azad (35), son of late
Md. Habiuddin of Pakuria village in Sadar thana , had lent some
money to his brother-in-law and uncle-in-law a few months back. But
their relations turned sour when Abul Kalam put pressure on his
in-laws to return the money.
	   On May 22 he went to his father-in-law's house in Baghata
village in Sadar thana and demanded the money. As a result an
altercation ensued . At one stage Azad's in-laws brutally beat him
up and took him to Sadar Hospital in a critical condition. He died
at about 11 am on May 22. The victim's in-laws allegedly told the
doctors that Azad had taken poison while trying to commit suicide.
Elder brother of the victim filed a case with Sadar thana accusing
his wife, brother-in-law and uncle-in-law . None was arrested so
far.

	   IN an increasingly health-conscious world, ostrich meat has been
dubbed ``the red meat of the future'' due to its low-fat,
low-cholesterol and high- protein content.
	   Having the reddish tinge and texture of tender beef and the
taste of venison, ostrich meat is fast becoming popular among
Malaysians due to promotional efforts by Government agencies,
breeding farms and restaurants.
	   However, the meat, either imported or obtained from Malaysian
farms, is currently available only at exclusive restaurants as
supply has not been able to meet demand.
	   It is said that meat from ostrich reared on Malaysian farms can
be expected to be sold to the general consumer in the next one or
two years.
	   Some farms are in Hulu Jabor in Terengganu, Sungai Siput and
Sungkai in Perak, Padang Serai in Kedah, Pantai in Negri Sembilan,
Ulu Tiram in Johor, and Kota Belud and Papar in Sabah.
	   The Ti Chen Chinese Restaurant, open to the public and not just
to members of the Saujana Golf and Country Club in Petaling Jaya
where it is located, is holding an Ostrich Promotion until June 30.
	   Chef Kam Chan Siong says there are many possibilities with
ostrich meat, be it in Western, Chinese, Malay or Indian cooking.
As with beef, mutton and venison, you can have ostrich steak,
kebab, satay, stew, stir-fried, curry and rendang.
	   Available a la carte for lunch and dinner, dishes include
Stir-Fried Ostrich Meat with Ginger and Spring Onions, Ostrich Meat
Claypot with Chinese Greens, Ostrich Meat Sizzling Platter with
Barbecue Sauce, and Ostrich and Gingko Claypot.
	   If you can't get ostrich meat, use mutton, beef or venison
instead.

EU says goodbye to Mandela _ amid plaudits and trade prods

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Singing with kids, receiving plaudits from
city leaders and giving the presidents and prime ministers a prod
about trade, South African President Nelson Mandela said goodbye
Tuesday to the European Union.
	   EU leaders threw a farewell lunch for the 79-year-old Mandela,
who steps down next year, at the end of their two-day meeting in
the Welsh capital. And the Welsh, proud of organizing small local
boycotts when Britain and the rest of the EU refused to impose
punitive trade embargos on apartheid South Africa, gave him the
freedom, or key, of their capital.
	   In brilliant sunshine at Cardiff Castle, a choir sang the South
African anthem ``Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika,'' or ``God Bless Africa,''
and Wales' ``Land of Our Fathers.''
	   Mandela dotted the ceremony with touches of informality.
	   ``I'll sing for you _ if you sing for me,'' he told a class of
7-year-olds in the castle grounds as he left the official party. He
broke into ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,'' and the kids sang
along, too.
	   He swung to the rhythm of a Welsh choir, Ardwyn, and during the
ceremony beckoned to 6-year-old Emma Williams, the granddaughter of
a local dignitary. Emma, wearing the Welsh national dress, climbed
on his lap and stayed there until it was his turn to make a speech.
	   ``The knowledge that local authorities all over Wales were
banning apartheid products from canteens and schools, and that the
universities, the Welsh Rugby Union and the choirs had cut their
links, was a great inspiration to us in our struggle,'' he said.
	   ``Democracy has brought new and even greater challenges,'' he
added. ``I will be able to tell my people that in the people of
Wales we have friends indeed, ready to join hands with us in
building a better life for all.''
	   Mandela met individuallly with several leaders, including the
Greek, Belgian and Portuguese prime ministers, and was meeting
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the summit host, later Tuesday.
	   In an end-of-summit communique, the EU pledged to conclude a
virtual free trade pact with South Africa by the autumn.
	   Blair's aides said the deal would cover 90 percent of South
African exports to the EU _ now running at more than dlrs 9 billion
a year. The outstanding issues are over canned fruit and
vegetables, the aides said.
	   A 19th round of EU-South Africa trade negotiations ended last
week in Brussels with hopes of a breakthrough, but no final deal.
	   Mandela, in an interview with APTV, recalled that the
International Monetary Fund has said the big industrialized
countries have a duty to help poorer nations, particularly with
speedier lowering of tariffs.
	   ``It seems to me one of the most powerful points ... the fact
that we have the backing of such an organization,'' he said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): About 30 percent of people of working age are
jobless in Tangerang regency's population of two million, its
regent has said.
	   Agus Junara promised Sunday that his office would soon provide
free chicks and fish to poor families so they could raise the
livestock.
	   He also vowed to allocate idle land to jobless residents for
farming to provide them with a livelihood.
	   ``Apart from that, the regency office will soon distribute free
essential goods,'' Agus said. He did not give details on the date
for the distribution or those who would qualify for the assistance.
	   He was quoted by Antara as saying that all the aid would be
handed over directly to the people, who would be selected by local
officials.
	   Hardest hit in the downturn are the fishermen who live with
their families along the northern coast of Tangerang.
	   The regent admitted that distributing free goods to residents
was not educative.
	   ``But it has to be done. Hopefully, the program can train the
people on how to breed fish at many giant ponds available on the
land here used for sand quarrying, for instance.''
	   At 1,396 square kilometers, the regency is about twice the size
of Jakarta.
	   In addition to problems from the economic downturn, Tangerang is
now facing a serious unemployment problem following the massive
destruction of hundreds of shops, banks, hotels, restaurants and
other business centers in the area during the mid-May riots.
	   Most owners of properties have balked at reopening their
business because of continuing political and economic uncertainty.

	   At least 50 people, including 4 policemen were injured, during a
clash following the expulsion of five BA examinees from the Sylhet
Government College today.
	   The clash between police and students, supported by outsides,
began when a magistrate expelled five examinees for adopting
unfairmeans.
	   Police fired teargas and rubber bullets to disperse the mob.
	   Earlier, the angry students attacked the Principal's office
damaging furniture and other property. The students also tried to
assault the magistrate who was taken to the principal's room for
his safety.
	   During the clash, the movement of vehicles on the Sylhet-Tamabil
road was disrupted for an hour.

	   Q: FOR the past two months, I've been trying some of your
recipes. Could you provide me with a recipe for Mushroom Cream
Soup?
	   A: TRY this creamy mushroom soup which requires homemade
vegetable or chicken stock for a better flavour.
	   There are many ready-made stocks available in granules, powders
or cubes, but their flavour does not rival homemade stocks, which
may take extra time to prepare but are worth the trouble.
	   To make your own vegetable stock, roughly chop about 250g each
of onions, carrots and celery. Put them in a large saucepan with
1.2 litres of water.
	   Bring to a slow boil. Add two bay leaves, a few sprigs of
parsley and spring onion and a good sprinkling of pepper. Simmer,
covered, for 30-40 minutes. Then strain and use as required.
	   There should be about 800ml of strained vegetable stock. It can
also be frozen for future use.
	   For chicken stock, use about 4-5 chicken carcasses, chopped into
small portions. Use about two litres of water and simmer for 50-60
minutes.
	   Strain and cool the stock. Refrigerate and then skim off all the
oil that will coagulate on the surface before using. Unused stock
can be frozen.
	   For many who have written in for wild mushroom soup, use wild
mushrooms instead of cultivated mushrooms for that special flavour.
	   MUSHROOM CREAM SOUP 50g butter 1 onion, finely chopped 2 cloves
garlic, finely chopped 375g fresh button mushrooms or a mixture of
oyster and fresh button mushrooms, thinly sliced.
	   2 tbsp plain flour 600ml vegetable or fresh chicken stock 150ml
low-fat milk 1 tbsp dry sherry, optional 120ml single cream 4
rashers rindless bacon, cooked until crisp and chopped, optional
Salt &AMP; pepper Parsley to garnish Method Melt butter in a large
saucepan and fry onion, garlic and mushroom until soft. Sprinkle
over flour and stir. Gradually pour over stock and milk, stirring
to blend. Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat and simmer,
covered for 15 minutes. Season to taste. Stir in sherry, if using
it, and half the cream. Cool a little, then puree in a blender.
	   Return pureed soup to saucepan and reheat gently. Stir in
remaining cream.
	   Spoon into individual soup bowls. Sprinkle with chopped bacon
and garnish with a sprig of parsley.

	   BOGOR (JP): The body of a man buried by garbage in Rancamaya on
Saturday was found yesterday.
	   The body, identified as that of Usup, 25, was discovered at 8:30
a.m. by his brothers after a lengthy search.
	   A number of police and military officers, assisted by local
residents, searched for Usup's body with the help of a bulldozer as
soon as they heard Usup had been buried at the site on June 6. The
search, however, was stopped four days later after they failed to
locate the body.
	   Kodir, the young brother of Usup, said he and his older brother,
Dadang, and Usup's brother-in-law, Ajat, started the search again
yesterday, this time starting from where a bad smell emanated.
	   ``We started digging from different directions early in the
morning,'' Kodir said.
	   One witness, Marhum, said Usup had been buried when the bank of
a nearby river gave way and struck the rubbish dump in which Usup
was standing. The riverbank had been reinforced nine months ago.

	   Milosevic said his decision was based on a desire to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict, rather than pressure from NATO
air exercises over Albania and Macedonia that began Monday.
	   ``I see no connection here.''
	   Milosevic and Rugova met in May, but the Albanians canceled
further talks until Serb government troops halted a reported
offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Rugova has lately been losing support to the more militant
separatists in the troubled province, whose uprising Milosevic has
tried to crush.
	   Milosevic met Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin on
Tuesday morning, kicking off a series of negotiations that
continued through most of the day.

World Cup: Hooligans could lose jobs, club membership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with action planned against hooligans when they
return &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English hooligans convicted of violence at the
World Cup in Frace face losing their jobs and being banned from
club matches when they arrive back in England.
	   Premier League club Leeds United said Tuesday it has imposed a
life ban on James Shayler, who was sentenced to two months in jail
by French authorities for his part in rioting by English fans in
Marseille.
	   Pictures of the 32-year-old roofer, with an English flag
tattooed across his bare stomach, were splashed throughout the
British media Tuesday. He was identified by police as a ringleader
of the violence in Marseille.
	   Leeds United chairman Peter Ridsdale said the club banned
Shayler as an example to the ``mindless minority who become
involved in anti-social behavior in the name of football.''
	   Ridsdale said Shayler was not a season ticket holder but held a
membership card for the club, a card which is a requirement for any
individual wishing to purchase tickets for Leeds ' away games.
	   Two Liverpool postal workers could be fired when they return to
England after serving three-month jail terms in France for their
part in the Marseille violence.
	   Graham Whitby and Christopher Anderson, both 26, were the first
England supporters to be jailed following clashes between rival
fans.
	   The pair were found guilty of criminal damage and inciting other
fans to riot.
	   ``It is general policy that the Post Office may follow its
internal disciplinary procedure against any individual convicted of
a criminal offense while working for the business,'' a Post Office
spokeswoman, who asked not to be identied, told the British Press
Association.
	   Royal Airforce fireman Philip Bryan, who was remanded in custody
by a court in Marseille after Monday's trouble, will face an
investigation when he returns to his base in Bruggen, Germany.
	   ``Once the French authorities have dealt with him we will mount
an investigation into his case,'' an RAF spokesman was quoted by
the Press Association as saying. ``If it is proved he has brought
the reputation of the RAF into disrepute he will be dealt with
appropriately.''
	   Bryan, 37, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, is due to stand trial on
July 17 accused of breaking windows by throwing cans at them, and
of assaulting police in Marseille.
	   Bryan's father, Darryl Bryan, said his son had never been in
trouble before
	   ``He is just a normal bloke, a grown man, who loves football,''
Bryan said. ``He is not an aggressive type of person and has never
spoken about violence when he has followed England. I am just
amazed he has got involved in this. I can only think that he was
one of the innocent fans who got roped in by the real hooligans.''
	   First Division side Stockport County is moving to ban one fan
for life after he was photographed at the heart of Monday's trouble
in Marseille.
	   The shaven-headed man, wearing a replica Stockport County shirt,
and beer bottle in hand, was pictured in newspapers as he helped
burn a Tunisian flag.
	   Stockport County secretary Gary Glendenning said police had been
asked to confirm the man's identity.
	   ``I think what he was doing was far worse than being caught up
in a brawl and I wish he'd been wearing anything other than a
Stockport County shirt,'' Glendenning said.
	   Coverage of the Marseille violence overshadowed England's 2-0
victory over Tunisia in Tuesday's newspapers.
	   The Independent urged the England team to pull out of the World
Cup so the tournament could return to being ``a festival of
football.''
	   The commander of Britain's police operations at the World Cup,
Tim Hollis, was quoted in several papers as saying authorities
expect more trouble as the tournament progresses.
	   He told the Guardian that known hooligans are either already in
France or on their way to orchestrate more violence, but noted that
``significant numbers'' of those arrested were unknown to British
police.
	   Many papers said the fan violence could doom England's hopes of
hosting the World Cup in 2006. But the Independent argued that if
England stages the tournament ``we will only destroy our own
cities.''

	   Q: I AM am very keen to try out the pau recipe from your column;
it was entitled ``Quick way to make tasty pau''. However, there
must have been some mistake. The ingredients for the dough were:
240g Hong Kong flour 1 tsp double action baking powder 25g
vegetable shortening 1 tsp easy-blend yeast Combine: 100ml warm
water 30g castor sugar 1/2 tsp vinegar Salt is not mentioned, but
the recipe says ``stir salt into the flour and baking powder
mixture.'' Please clarify.
	   May I use this recipe for cha siu pau? Could you give me the
recipe for pork cha siu pau filling, too?
	   The Golden Fruit Cake recipe you give in your book Asian
Delights turned out beautifully; I recommend it to all cake lovers!
A: THE Golden Fruit Cake recipe has always been a firm favourite.
It makes delightfully moist fruit cake which cuts well and keeps
well.
	   As for the Quick Pau (Steamed Buns) recipe, the amount of salt
was left out due to a typographical error.
	   A quarter-teaspoon of salt is required. This is an easy recipe,
as the food-processor does all the work.
	   It is a great recipe as it turns out a wonderfully white, light
pau. For those who would like to try it, the recipe with a spicy
mustard chicken filling is in my book Betty Yew's Kitchen Secrets.

Thai police: more than 100 arrested so far for World Cup gambling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police has arrested 109 gamblers
and bookies during the first five days of the World Cup soccer
tournament, a television report said Tuesday.
	   In a raid Monday evening, police discovered a ledger with
alleged to list more than 10 million baht (dlrs 229,000) in bets on
World Cup matches, reported ITV television. The betting list was
hidden behind an air conditioner's vent.
	   A survey earlier this month estimated that the 64-game
tournament will generate about 30 billion baht (dlrs 682 million)
in bets.
	   Bangkok respondents to the survey by the Thai Farmers Research
Center said they were putting aside an average of 38,860 baht (dlrs
903) to bet, up 35 percent from an average of 28,740 baht (dlrs
668) last time the tournament was played..
	   Gambling is illegal in Thailand, but the laws are widely
ignored.
	   Soccer has become increasingly popular gambling vehicle among
Thais since the World Cup matches were first broadcast live here by
satellite in 1994.

	   ``It's necessary that the whole world see what we agreed to, so
that there should be no steps back,'' Yeltsin said. Grim-faced,
Yeltsin told reporters that the negotiations were ``not simple.''
	   After their one-on-one meeting, Yeltsin and Milosevic were
joined by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the director of
the foreign intelligence service.
	   ``President Boris Yeltsin once again spoke against any options
involving force and in favor of the search for exclusively peaceful
ways of settling the crisis,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters.
	   Rugova has sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, although
his goal _ independence for Kosovo _ remains the same as that of
the more militant separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other nations on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Rakhmanin told
reporters at the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. ``Unilateral,
provocative steps that could push the sides to escalate the
conflict should be avoided. A stable, long-lasting settlement can
only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.

	   Incurring losses of about Taka three crore in less than three
years of air service operation Aero Bengal Airlines has stopped
flight operation since May 23 this year. Aero Bengal suspended
flight operations on several occasions earlier too. Those were for
short periods. But this time, the pioneer in private airlines in
the country has stopped flight operation for overall change of all
its three aircraft which will be returned to the suppliers.The Aero
Bengal management is making efforts to procure other aircraft for
resumption of air service on the domestic routes. This decision of
Aero Bengal management has made it absolutely uncertain as to when
the airlines will be able to procure other aircraft for replacement
of the old ones and resume flight operation again.
	   Aero Bengal was launched on July 17, 1995. It started flight
operation on Dhaka-Barisal route with two Chinese built 17-seater
Y-12 aircraft. Later a leased Russian built 48-seater N-24 aircraft
was inducted in Aero Bengal's fleet. Aero Bengal then opened
Dhaka-Sylhet and Dhaka-Chittagong routes too.This correspondent
talked to Aero Bengal Airlines' chairman Dr. H.B.M Iqbal, MP
several times. ``We are running the airlines incurring losses,'' he
said on every occasion. ``So far by operating air service on
domestic route we have sustained losses of about Tk 3 crore,'' said
Aero Bengal Airlines' Deputy Managing Director Captain Imam Anwar
Hossain while talking to this correspondent on June 13.''We have
already applied to the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh for
returning all of our three aircraft and looking for procuring new
aircraft from other sources.''
	   Asked if Chinese manufacturers would return their money, he
said, ``We did not make full payment for those and so question of
getting back money from suppliers does not arise.''Asked how they
sustained such huge losses in such a short span of time, Captain
Hossain said, ``It was our own fault because we could not make
certain calculations correctly.''About resumption of flight
operation he said, ``We are making efforts to procure aircraft from
different sources. It may take one or two months or even more to
resume flight operation again''.Talking about employees, he said
Aero Bengal Airlines has only 12 employees on payroll. The
airlines' passenger tickets are sold by travel agents on 7 to 9 per
cent commission basis.
	   ``The crew members, including pilots, were in aircraft
procurement package deal.''On June 14 an employee at Aero Bengal
Airlines' sales office at Motijheel told this correspondent
``Procurement of big-capacity aircraft in place of STOL (Short Take
Of and Landing)-type of aircraft was a mistake on our part. We
could not sell tickets to fill in the big-capacity aircraft with
passengers.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): Governor Sutiyoso guaranteed yesterday that the
city administration would not withhold or cut salaries of its
employees due to the crisis. ``Don't worry about that.
	   I can't imagine the government would make such an extreme
decision to reduce or suspend civil servants' salaries,'' he said.
	   Rumors have circulated among the workers in recent days that the
city, reeling from depleted revenues, only has sufficient funds to
pay salaries for the next three months.
	   But Sutiyoso did not state how long the city administration
would be able to pay its 70,000 personnel.
	   The governor also could not promise how long the city would pay
its ``welfare allowance'', which includes meal and transportation
fares, to workers.
	   ``In the future, we will probably no longer be able to provide
this allowance, which we have provided up to now.''
	   Another rumor claims the city will use essential goods in
exchange for cash to pay salaries.
	   In response, Sutiyoso commented: ``I don't think it will go that
far.''
	   He admitted his office was facing serious financial difficulties
which had forced it to cut expenses in all sectors, including
overtime allowances.
	   The city administration's secretary, Fauzi Bowo, said the
overtime allowance was no longer given to employees on the grounds
that there were no current projects.
	   A female official at the City Council said yesterday the
administration has yet to pay the welfare allowance to her and her
colleagues.
	   ``We are supposed to get about Rp 140,000 (US$14) a month for
the welfare allowance and we usually receive it in the second week
of the month at the latest,'' said the woman, who asked for
anonymity.
	   She was disturbed to hear about the possibility of the
administration cutting back or terminating the allowance if the
crisis persisted.
	   ``Please, don't do that to us.
	   ``Does the government expect us to go to work on foot, or
what?''
	   Cost-cutting measures have included use of telephones and
electricity.
	   Some telephones at the administration and City Council have been
reprogrammed to only receive incoming calls and make internal
calls.
	   A middle-ranking employee, who also asked not to be named,
complained the administration's efficiency drive was impinging on
work productivity.
	   ``We have been unable to make outgoing calls since Friday. Our
work here has been terribly difficult ever since. We badly need the
phone to collect information and data from related offices out
there.''
	   An official said last week the administration's public relations
office had drastically decreased expenses, including to develop
pictures taken at official functions.
	   But a city administration spokesman, Kamaludin Santos, denied
the staff members' complaints about inhibited activities.
	   He said his office was considered as playing an important role
in the administration's functioning and it still received adequate
funding.
	   But he admitted his office was required to minimize its
expenses, including for lunch boxes given out to staff and city
hall reporters.
	   ``Maybe we'd better recount the exact number of people to
receive the meals so that we don't have to order fan excessive
number,'' he said.

	   FOR romantics in search of a distraction from the mainly loud
offerings strewn our way by planet Hollywood, City of Angels is a
good bet.
	   With two strong lead actors (Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, as angel
Seth and heart surgeon Dr Maggie respectively), City of Angels
tells the story of the celestial Seth falling in love with mortal
Maggie and the internal struggles and changes these characters
undergo in their psychological make-up - falling ever deeper in
love, meanwhile.
	   The romance comes about when Maggie goes through a moment of
crisis after losing a patient and Seth tries to comfort her.
	   Cage, as the doe-eyed and inquisitive angel mesmerised by Ryan,
is surprisingly, err, childlike in his interaction with Maggie.
	   (Uh-oh, mean streak coming on here... Seth's more, like, dense
in his interaction with Maggie. Are angels pea-brained or
something? Don't they learn anything about human beings, having
roamed amongst the sinful lot for thousands of years? Hello!)
Yikes... anyway, Cage, with the support of his trusty trenchcoat,
delivers a performance lovestruck types will appreciate, while Ryan
convincingly delivers her spin of a delicate doctor with still
quite a bit of a punch left in her.
	   The woman is definitely the silver screen's undisputed queen of
hearts.
	   At this point, it must be added that, thankfully, the film does
not pretend to be profound and the screenplay is suitably shallow
for today's masses, drunk on pop culture.
	   One of the most memorable lines in the movie has to be when Seth
says, ``I don't know what a pear tastes like TO YOU,'' when Maggie
tells him that a pear tastes like, well, a pear! Doing justice to
the top-notch lead names, the film offers some of the most
beautiful cinematography seen in recent times.
	   The memorable scenes - the sight of the angels seated in lofty
places, ranging from freeway signboards to billboards and
scaffoldings - could induce vertigo in those with weak stomachs.
	   In complementing the idea of angels and all things serene, the
tone of this movie is also mellow and the pacing liberally
leisurely.
	   The humour is also well placed.
	   Uh-oh, wicked side speaks again... next to the relative ultra
sophistication and intelligence of screenplays like Ridley Scott's
Thelma &AMP; Louise (1991), Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection
(1997) and Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs (1991), City of
Angels' screenplay is obviously the work of a novice.
	   This film is nowhere near the fabulously out-of-the-world Wings
of Desire (1987) by Wim Wenders, on which it is loosely based.
	   On a brighter note, alongside its score of haunting angelic
chorals, City of Angels has some great songs by some of the hippest
artistes around like the Goo Goo Dolls' Iris and the amazing Alanis
Morissette's Uninvited.
	   The latter is easily a best-song-of-the-year contender.
	   Verdict: Please don't expect a happily-ever-after ending like
yours truly did. Sob!

 &UR; Eds: Will be led after 1800 GMT Havel appearance on TV &QL; 
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Three days before elections
President Vaclav Havel bills as a choice between democracy and ''a
banana republic,'' he was under fire for saying he may not choose
the largest party to form the next government.
	   Noone expects any political clarity to emerge from the vote
Friday and Saturday, held two years ahead of schedule follwing the
ouster of Premier Vaclav Klaus and the collapse of his center-right
coalition last winter. A caretaker government under banker Jozef
Tosovsky has run the country since.
	   Center-left and center-right parties are bitterly opposed to one
another, and neither has hope of a clear majority _ even if
alliances are made with smaller, questionably stable parties.
	   Latest opinon polls show the Social Democrats of Milos Zeman the
top of the 13 parties running for the 200-seat lower chamber of
parliament, with a projected 23.2 percent.
	   Zeman's bitter rival, Klaus, is just behind, with his Civic
Democratic Party polling 20.7 percent in polls with a 3 percent
margin of error.
	   Only five other parties are expected to cross the five percent
hurdle needed to get into parliament. Of these, two are the old
guard Communists and extreme Republicans, excluded by all
mainstream parties as possible coalition partners.
	   That leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels against Klaus, favored by
Havel _ and the eclectic Pensioners for a Secure Life as potential
partners in government.
	   Although polls show that almost half of the 8.09 million voters
would support a grand coalition uniting the Social Democrats,
Klaus' party and the Freedom Union, all three rule it out _ at
least for now.
	   The Social Democrats say they would be willing to form a
gvoernment with the populist pensioners' party, which has about
seven percent support, and the Christian Democrats, Klaus' former
coalition partner.
	   They could even make it with just the pensioners' party, and
tacit support from the Communists _ but the latter insist on a
referendum on the country's membership in NATO, which already has
been approved by both houses of parliament, but the Reds still
reject.
	   Klaus says his only possible coalition partners are the Freedom
Union and the Christian Democrats. The latter's leader, Josef Lux,
says no way again with the often-arrogant Klaus: ``This would be an
alliance of confrontation.''
	   Lux' idea is to join up with the Freedom Union and Social
Democrats to ``suppress latent communism'' among the latter.
	   Jan Ruml of Freedom Union says he might prefer more early
elections to that combination.
	   Regular parliamentary elections had been scheduled for 2000. But
Klaus' government collapsed in November over a party financing
scandal.
	   Klaus now warns the Czech Republic is at a crossroads and
socialism soon may be back. Havel agrees the country is at a
crossroads but says there is no threat socialism would return.
	   ``The country is at a crossroads,'' Havel said on television
Saturday, facing the choice between becoming a ``civilized
democracy'' or turning into a ``banana republic.''
	   Havel is constitutionally responsible for tapping the man to
form a new government after voting ends Saturday. He has praised
the current caretaker government _ which he played a large part in
forming _ but refused to ally himself with either left or right.
	   At odds with Klaus, and no supporter of Zeman, Havel says he may
not necessarily pick the head of the strongest political party to
try to form a government.
	   That statement galvanized all sides into unusual unity.
	   ``Let's stick to the usual practice that the winner has the
first chance,'' said Ruml. ``It's important that the president asks
the winner,'' insisted Lux. ``Any other alternative,'' snipped
Klaus, ``would go against the very sense of democratic elections.''

	   The guts uphold the heart and not the heart the gutsSo goes the
proverb that elucidates the power of food to bolster up the soul.
Possibly keeping in mind this age-old maxim Dhaka Sheraton Hotel
has recently introduced a lunch extravaganza that can be termed ``a
king's treat for a pauper's income''. As the mushrooming of
international restaurants has become a permanent feature of
city-life, tastebuds of the Dhakaites have undergone an adventurous
transformation. They are no longer hesitant in indulging in the
succulent fish fillet or the mussles and squid salad. With the
expansion of our palate the demand for good food has also
increased.
	   We are now capable of discerning between the appetising and the
unpalatable in the international standard. The Bengali gourmands
now get into conversation over Beluga, smoked salmon, Lemon
Morangue, Charcoaled Haddock and many more delectable food items
that so far had been confined within the colourful World of 007.
Adding to this fast developing obsession Sheraton's Lunch Bonanza
is the passport to the epicureanists paradise. A dip into the world
of delicious dishes the Friday-Saturday treat is a tribute to the
perennial gastronomical fantasies of the urban middle class. With a
reduced rate of Tk 495 for adults and Tk 250 for children below 12
it is a smashing offer to get stuffed without a deflated look on
your wallet.
	   The Bithika is the place you want to be on the holidays - the
magnificent array includes Mutton Biriyani, Roast Chicken, Ruhi
Fish Bhaja, Chicken Malai Tikka, Matar Paneer, Shabji Bhoona, Thai
Noodles, Chowmein (Prawn and Beef), Steam Phomfret, a variety of
soups and a countless number of desserts and salads. (Boy! this
writing has got me salivating). The food is just Tres Delicieux.
How do I know? Well, last Friday I was there, trying to set an
example for a glutton. The most noticeable thing there, was the
number of young children accompanying their parents. ``We have
tried to create an atmosphere that will allow the kids to come and
have fun with their parents in a secure place,'' said Rashida
Muhiuddin, the Director of Public Relations.
	   ``As we are charging just Tk 250 for toddlers below 12 we are
getting a sort of kiddie get-together, where children can have a
good time, make friends and eat as much as they want,'' she added.
The ambience exuded a kind of radiance as families were eating,
jesting, having a leisurely Friday afternoon generously supplied by
a wide range of food. ``We are here, the whole family, eating and
having fun, and after that we will have the complimentary swim,''
said a jovial Mr. Arif. The Lunch Bonanza also includes a free swim
till five and evening snacks comprising biscuits, tea or coffee at
the Sarobar Pool Cafe. The wide variety of food is basically a
mixture of cuisines from different countries. There is Chinese,
Indian, Italian, Bengali. ``This is a sort of a cosmopolitan
lunch,'' said Ms. Muhiuddin.
	   ``Basically there are few places in the town where one can go
along with the family and have fun, eat food and come back
satisfied. Sheraton's latest lunch -thing is all these things
combined, a fun package very few people can resist,'' remarked Mrs.
Shurma Chowdhury pointing at her animated children getting ready
for the swim. ``The response is awesome, and we sometimes have to
put up more tables to accommodate the guests who usually come after
Jumma prayers,'' said Polly, a smart waitress always rushing about,
with the constant smile on her divine face. ``An excellent value
for money - this is the hottest eating joint in town,'' said Atiq,
who was having lunch with his girl friend. Sheraton has apparently
provided something for the often frustrated middle class Dhakaites.
The weekends won't be that spice-less, after all.

	   HARRISON Ford as Chill Out Jones, a man wrongfully accused of
drunk- driving, forced to battle sadistic policemen, drug addicts,
prostitutes and large, horny African men in police station.

rescue. Faces adversity from long electronic teller queues,
sinister Indonesian security guards and babbling barristers.

toilette is plunged unexpectedly into adventure. a truly dashing,
noble and courageous character. Owner of Tortoru, wonder cat,

	   Guest stars Quentin Tarantino and Wesley Snipes as Dzul and
Paddington, lawyer-adventurers who join our heroes in the climatic
final scene.
	   Catch Isabella Rosselini as Kristina, hysterical secretary of
the year! SCENE One. Saturday morning, 3am. Phone rings. Very
sleepy and pre- menstrual writer rolls over in bed to answer call.
	   ``Dins? Dins!!!''
	   ``% &UR; &AMP;((. Chill Out?''
	   ``Guess where I am, baby?''
	   ``Bali?''
	   ``Campbell jail.''
	   ``Haaaaaaahhhhhhh? Why?!''
	   ``Drunk driving.''
	   Dina goes bonkers and lectures Chill Out on the perils of drunk
driving and the morality of it all.
	   Chill Out is tense and very, very afraid. He was arrested near
KLCC and was plonked in a Black Maria to face his counterparts, who
were very happy, actually. Two ``working girls'', a bunch of
junkies, tiga penyamun (''Aku dah kata, kalau kita jual karipap,
tak payah le nak mencuri!''), merry husbands and boyfriends, and
one huge African who kept making eyes at Chill Out and licking his
lips. Then they were whisked by garang policemen who made them walk
in their underwear and barefooted.
	   ``So how come you're calling? I thought they took everything
away!''
	   ``Well, they stripped me to my boxer shorts, but I'm allowed to
make one call. Aku takutttttt Dinsssssss!!!''
	   ``What colour are they?'' Dina is possessed by temporary
insanity, hence the barmy question.
	   ``Brown. You know me, everything must be black, blue or brown.''
	   A scuffle could be heard. Then a deep voice boomed, ``OKEY KAMU
SEMUA! TELANJANG SEKARANG!''
	   ``Arghssssssssss Dinaaaaaaaaa, you gotta help meeeeeee!''
	   Click.
	   Our hero is searched and thrown into jail, which has slime and
urine for a floor. A merry expat jailbird yells, ``Cheers!!!''
	   Dina falls asleep.
	   Scene Two. Saturday morning, 10.30am.
	   Dina has bruised her arm badly and is putting an icepack on it.
A phone call. It was Chill Out.
	   ``Dins, what are you doing?''
	   ``Oh, hi, just now, I banged something and then this huge
bruise.''
	   ``I don't care about your arm, you have two grand on you?''
	   ``Well, I did just finish a job, so I got paid, I think the
cheque has come through.''
	   ``DINA! Bring the money to the courts now! If you don't, I'll be
in jail for a week!''
	   A brick hits Dina's head as she realises the seriousness of it
all.
	   Calls up Kristina, banker extraordinaire, who screams at the top
of her lungs when she hears the news.
	   ``You better call Dzul! He's a lawyer! He can help!
Argggggghhhhh, how, how, how?''
	   Scene Three. 10.40am.
	   Dina runs down to wonder neighbour Na'a's house and gatecrashes
him as he performs morning ablutions. He boots her out, clad in a
towel. Torturo, Na'a's savage cat, chases Dina out of the room.
	   Dina runs into room again and falls over Na'a's kura-kura. Drags
a half- dressed filmmaker down to the car.
	   Na'a runs to room again to find his glasses, finds them beneath
kura- kura and runs down again.
	   Scene Four. 10.55am.
	   BBMB ATM. Long queue filled with customers who have to check
their balance first, think before taking out money and then leaving
the machine, without money.
	   Scene Five. 11am.
	   Dzul, lawyer wunderkind, flown in from Jakarta as his apartment
was set on fire during the riots, receives a message on his banana
handphone. He is shocked to hear his best buddy Chill Out clapped
behind bars.
	   Calls Dina but no answer. Calls Kristina.
	   ``Dzullllllll!!! What? Oh. Dunno lah.''
	   ``Kris! How can you not know which court he is in?''
	   ``I just came back from UK-lah, how do I know?!!!!''
	   Dzul, with his connections, calls up Paddington, another tai-koh
lawyer.
	   Paddington chokes on his roti canai and zooms down to get Dzul.
	   Scene Six. 11.30am.
	   Dzul and Paddington dash about KL. Dzul directs Paddington to
the Taman Duta courts. Uh-oh. Wrong place. Chill Out breaking out
in cold sweat. The judge glares at him. The bailiff sneers.
	   Dina and Na'a drive about looking for a parking space. Decide to
park illegally, battled for a space with another car, and won.
	   Scene Seven. 11.35am.
	   Chill Out protests his innocence and decides to plead guilty.
Seeing the judge is a man of good judgment with a heart of gold,
Chill Out tells a fairy tale about him being retrenched next week
and that at the end of the month, he's going to get married. With
all these financial problems, he decides to drink for the first
time and gets caught.
	   ``You mean you have never drunk alcohol ever?''
	   ``Sob. never. Tuan Hakim. Pity my fiance. She loves me and I
love her.''
	   Bailiff and judge mull over the predicament.
	   ``Who's paying your fine then?''
	   ``My beloved fiance.''
	   CUT TO ...
	   Dina bumps into a security guard at courts and asks him where
the Room of Doom is. ``Oh, enggak tau. Saya baru bekerja di sini,
dong.''
	   Eh?
	   CUT TO ...
	   Dzul and Paddington run into courts to find Chill Out most
emotional.
	   Dzul plonks down the two grand. Chill Out hugs and kisses Dzul,
further confusing judge on the sex of fiance.
	   Scene eight. 11.45am Na'a and Dina meet two barristers and ask
where the courts are.
	   Barrister: The courts? It is over der, what are you looking for,
oh your friend has been caught drunk driving, that would be
Mahkamah YKK, you know, how to get der? Oh very easy, you take
right, another right, then you walk down
straiiiiiiiighhhhhhhhhtttttt and then you turn left, another left,
you don't have to vo-ry, all the rooms have signs and...''
	   Na'a grabs Dina's hand and thanks long-winded lawyer. Both agree
thank god they did not end up as one; so cerita Hindustan! Scene
Nine. 11.55am.
	   Chill Out, Dzul and Paddington are in front of the room. The
worst is over. Na'a and Dina run; Chill Out grabs to hug Dina,
``Sayang, thank God you are here, you darling you!''
	   Then he whispers: ``You're supposed to be my fiance! Now act
angry!''
	   Oh.
	   Dina swings at Chill Out with her itsy bitsy handbag, screaming,
``Tak gune punya jantan, tak boleh bagi dia keluar sejam pun! Macam
mana nak kahwin kita?!'' Whack! Whack! Dina really gets into method
acting and enjoys whacking Chill Out. Bailiff restrains her.
	   ``Dik... maafkan dia dik. kan dia bakal suami dik. ni nak
berrumah tangga ni, kena-lah tolak ansur.''
	   ``Hmmmmph! Tiada maaf bagi mu!'' Another whack. Dina thinks she
has never had so much fun in her life.
	   Another thwack on Chill Out.
	   Chill Out is a sorry sight. He has not had a bath, he smells,
and he had slipped down right onto human excreta when he went to
the jamban at the jail. Everyone moves FAR away from him. Advise
him to eat bottles of Vermox as he could have contracted worms and
to put kerosene in his hair.
	   Suddenly everyone starts to scratch their heads.
	   Scene Nine. 1pm.
	   Alexis. Buys ex-jailbird a sumptuous lunch. He cries and thanks
God for allowing him to have such a meal. He tells his friends of
his ordeal at the jail. Not only was he stripped stark naked, he
was body-searched for concealed weapons. The working girls kept
asking him if he wanted to blow balloons, and the junkies played
with their sores. His worst fear was ending up as the African man's
boyfriend the next day, ``I swear! He kept winking at me, and
licking his lips! He wants me-lah!''
	   The very idea breaks his friends into laughter.
	   Chill Out is remorseful. At the end of it all, he has a
superficial but impressionable view of what really happens if one
is on the wrong side of the law. There are no decent toilets, a
felon would be treated badly, and even though the women were
prostitutes, it was not a place for women. They should have been
treated well, being women. His jailmates consisted of junkies, who
live for a quick fix. These people could have been him, doing well
in life and he could end up like them, a downward spiral into an
abyss of despair.
	   Scene 10. 9pm.
	   Dina is watching TV when her phone rings.
	   ``It's me! I'm clean and smell wonderful now! Next week, we
party to celebrate my freedom yah?''
	   Rosaakkkkkkkk, rosaaaaaakkkkkkkkk!!! Characters is this film are
not based on true persons and experience.

	   There is the well repeated story of Oscar Wilde who, when
confronted by the US customs, said,''I have nothing to declare but
my genius''. At the end of last month Ms Shaila Mahbub Shishir, an
air hostess working for Bangladesh Biman, failed to declare her
genius and also a sum of about 14000 US dollars to the Customs
authorities at Dhaka. Then again at the beginning of June, Chief
Purser of Biman Khalilur Rahman, on way to Bangkok, was discovered
possessing nearly US$ 1,05,000 in cash and US$ 20,000 in bank
drafts. In these days of liberal imports and lower duties and
tariffs, serious smuggling is now confined to items such as
currency, jewellery, drugs, and pornography. However, despite the
two recent incidents involving foreign currency, most of the cabin
staff in most of the airlines do not engage in any amount of
contraband smuggling.
	   They have, on the other hand, a developed sense of making the
most of the fringe benefits that may be obtained from their
respective airlines. An efficient cabin crew can strip a 747 in 30
minutes of all available and moveable stuff. They often do so,
usually when the lights are dimmed after dinner and before
breakfast on long haul flights. Others prefer the final approach to
landing, when passengers are strapped in the seats and the curtains
round the galleys are pulled shut. They first rumble' (the
professional word for such looting) the dry store. Tins of soup,
corned beef, packets of cake and biscuits, bottles of mayonnaise,
instant coffee, tea bags, are secreted in the coat bags of stewards
or hand bags of stewardesses. The coat bag' is the steward's best
friend and he can outloot stewardesses who do not carry an
equivalent. By using the dry store items so looted, and milk and
fruit juice from the galley, cabin attendants can get through a
three-day stopover without spending anything on meals and saving
the meal allowance ($ 65 or so for the Biman staff per day).
	   He or she can also stock up for the whole household back home.
The unused still-frozen steaks, vegetables, fruit, cheese disappear
into the coat bags or hand bags. As the galley is thoroughly done
over, liquor for first or business class (now served free without
limits), and after that the complimentary cigarettes are divided
up. Then there is a mad rush for the lavatories, where the girls
are permitted by tradition to have first claim on the baby powder,
skin tonic, the milky cleanser, moisture and hand lotion, eau de
cologne and tampax. The stewards clean out the after and pre-shave
lotions, the talc and the kleenex, and toothpaste. Rumbling' is
relatively safe away from home base, but at home the Customs may,
if suspicious, detain the crew for a thorough checking, and also
pass on the names of frequent rumblers' to the airlines. The moment
of truth may come when there are honest customs officials or
airlines security men, or even those on the take who have been
denied the share in the past. Perks of airlines staff extend beyond
stripping the aircraft.
	   Some cabin crew are basically self-employed businessmen. They
have husbands or wives or friends running shops and boutiques at
home which are stocked with curios and antiques which the crew fly
back wholesale - cameras and hi-fis from Hong Kong, gems from
Myanmar, crocodile handbags and watchstraps from Rio and Buenos
Aires. Even the pilots are on to some of the rackets sometimes. A
British Airlines captain was discovered to be running a flourishing
fruit importing business purely on the ability to freight in fresh
fruit jet-quick, and completely free, in the forward freight
compartment of his 707. A group of American pilots maintained a
chain of highly successful seafood restaurants on the East Coast
because they were flying in cheap West Coast seafood at a cost only
to their unwitting airlines.Few cabin crew deny the more innocent
of the perks indulged in. After all, this is why they joined the
airlines - to see the world and live off it.

	   JAKARTA (JP): A group of about 70 blind people went to City Hall
yesterday to protest the cancellation of their cooperation with the
city administration to manage a plot of land at Ragunan Zoo in
South Jakarta in 1985.
	   Wearing ``peaceful reform'' headbands, the protesters, who
arrived at City Hall in two buses, demanded that the administration
return their investment of least Rp 500 million in the joint
project.
	   As soon as they got out of the bus, they were met by several
security officers. The protesters entered City Hall in groups, and
held onto each other to ensure that they did not become separated.
	   The protesters said they wanted to meet Governor Sutiyoso. They
waved banners which read, among others, ``Return our rights'' and
``Be honest, you must return our money''.
	   The delegation leader, Ony Sanomasi, said the administration had
once promised to return the funds belonging to the Foundation of
Handicraft Training for the Blind (Pekerti).
	   ``Actually, we have asked the administration many times to
return the money, but the officials frequently sent us from one
office to another.
	   ``They used to promise to involve us by allowing us to sell and
display our handicrafts at the site, which has now been altered
into a park. In reality, however, it only happened once,'' he said.
	   Some of the protesters, most of whom work as masseurs, were
unaware of the purpose of the protest. ``Ony just asked me to
follow him to protest here,'' said Ato, one of the protesters.
	   Asked whether he would ask the governor for money for himself,
Ato said, ``That's a good idea. Who knows, maybe the governor will
be generous.''
	   Another female protester, named Aji, said, ``Just to shake hands
with the governor will also be OK.''
	   As they failed to meet the governor, some of them played with a
deck of Braille cards and waited to negotiate with Deputy Governor
of Development Affairs Budiardjo Soekmadi.
	   Ony said that in 1985 the Pekerti foundation decided to
cooperate with the administration to build a park of arts and
handicrafts at the zoo.
	   The park was originally designed to be a place for displaying
handicrafts and other arts.
	   After waiting for about two hours, the protesters were received
by Budiardjo.
	   The city spokesman, Kamaludin Santos, told reporters that during
the meeting the administration principally agreed to return their
money.
	   ``But the administration will hold a meeting first on Thursday
to decide when the money will be returned,'' he said.
	   The chairman of Pekerti, Surojo, stated that he was satisfied
with the administration's decision for the time being.
	   ``We will wait for the realization of their promise,'' he said.

	   BUTTERWORTH, Fri. - Plans are afoot to appoint mediators among
community leaders to help resolve disputes involving sensitive
issues, especially religion and race, at the grassroot level.
	   For a start, the proposal will involve Rukun Tetangga members.
	   The New Straits Times has learnt that the State Unity
Department, with the co-operation of several government agencies,
will provide special courses for a group of mediators to be
selected from all 118 RT sectors early next year.
	   ``This is a proactive effort to check any dispute involving
sensitive issues such as religion, as was the case in Georgetown
earlier this year,''
	   a source told the New Straits Times.
	   In March, a clash attributed to small groups of agitated youths
and hooligans broke out between two groups of people from different
faiths.
	   According to the source, the mediators are to complement other
existing institutions set up to foster greater understanding among
people from all races and religious beliefs.

Ginette Mathiot, best-selling cookbook author, dead at 91
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Ginette Mathiot, best-selling French author of
millions of cookbooks sold worldwide, has died, her publisher said
Tuesday. She was 91.
	   Mathiot died Sunday in a retirement home in Paris, the publisher
Albin Michel said. No cause of death was given.
	   Her ``Je Sais Cuisiner,'' (I know how to cook) was a bible for
generations of French homemakers preparing everything from lobster
bisque to crepes suzettes.
	   First published in 1932, it sold more than 5 million copies,
translated into English, Spanish, Russian, Swedish, Serbo-Croatian
and Japanese.
	   She also published a variety of books on bread, pastry, canning
_ even recipes for camping trips.
	   Her success was due in part to how she stressed classic French
repertoire, and always sought to keep food costs down.
	   Mathiot's approach to food was teaching would-be cooks the
basics of food preparation, gradually readying them for more
complicated recipes. Recipes were clear and precise, down to the
``take out the cake, turn off the oven.''
	   Mathiot was an inspector general of France's homemaking academy
and a member of the French Legion of Honor.
	   She frequently accused the cooking establishment of being a
touch sexist, chiding the male-dominated profession.
	   As top French baker Lionel Poilane put it: ``Since she couldn't
get out of her kitchen, she brought the world into it.''
	   Funeral services were planned for Wednesday in Paris. Mathiot
never married.

	   SHAH ALAM, Fri. - Recommended retail prices will have to be
imprinted on the packaging of imported food and beverages, Deputy
Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk S. Subramaniam
said today.
	   ``It will be up to the importers to ensure that the recommended
retail price are imprinted or embossed on the packaging of imported
food and drinks,'' he said.
	   He was speaking to reporters after delivering a talk at a
training session for Syarikat Bekalan Air Sdn Bhd customer service
staff at the Shah Alam Stadium.
	   All manufacturers are required to either imprint or emboss a
recommended retail price on all packaging for about 600 types of
food and drinks manufactured locally which would go on sale from
Jan 1 next year.
	   The move was agreed to by all parties in the food and beverage
manufacturing and retail industry a few months ago.
	   Subramaniam said the RRP requirement was not a move to control
the prices of foodstuff as the price is determined by the industry
and not his ministry.
	   It would merely serve as a guide for consumers who would know
the correct price of a particular item.
	   He said the RRP would not allow retailers to sell items at a
price which was higher than the RRP but he could sell them at a
lower price.
	   ``The introduction of the RRP will not require any amendments to
present laws. The Price Control (Price Labelling by Retailers)
Order 1993 will be used to enforce it.''
	   At present, cooking oil and rice already have their respective
RRPs imprinted on their packaging.
	   Subramaniam said the RRP would allow the entire country to have
a standard ceiling price, and this would help curb profiteering by
retailers.
	   When asked whether this move would result in the RRP being
higher than current prices, Subramaniam said one should see the
requirement being beneficial to the consumer.
	   ``Consumers will more likely get these items at the right
instead of inflated prices, and experience has shown that many
retailers often sell at a price which was lower than the RRP,'' he
said.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Yohanes Yacob, an advisor hired by Soeharto to
defend his interests, said allegations that the former president
and his family had illegally amassed trillions of rupiah were
untrue.
	   Yohanes, who heads the so-called Cendana Consulting Team, said
Soeharto only had limited savings in local banks and no overseas
holdings.
	   He said that after being accepted as a consultant he immediately
asked Soeharto whether reports of his enormous wealth were true.
	   ``He told me that the money comes from his salary as a retired
officer in the Armed Forces and president for 32 years,'' Yohanes
said during an interview with TVRI.
	   Yohanes said the money was savings Soeharto had intended to use
as an ``old-age retirement fund''. He did not say exactly how much
or in which banks the money was deposited.
	   Yohanes, however, said Soeharto was willing to surrender his
deposits for people's welfare if the public considered them to be
excessive.
	   Yohanes also said that Soeharto was delaying his intention to
explain publicly about his alleged accumulation of wealth as he
wanted to respect the Attorney General's Office investigation into
alleged corruption under his leadership.
	   ``Soeharto is actually longing to explain the matter but he
decided to give the Attorney General's Office a chance to complete
its investigation first,'' Yohanes claimed, adding that the
77-year-old former president remained steadfast amid the enormous
public onslaught regarding his wealth.
	   Yohanes revealed that he had been working at Soeharto's
residence on Jl. Cendana for the few past days, hence the name
Cendana Consulting Team.
	   His name shot to fame over the weekend when it was revealed that
he was leading a team of consultants advising Soeharto on his
interests.
	   He did not reveal the makeup of his team, saying only that he
had divided the team into several divisions, including legal,
economic and political.
	   Yohanes is an almost unknown in prominent legal circles. Many
continue to raise eyebrows that Soeharto would choose someone so
obscure without even a law degree to lead his team of advisors
which may soon face a barrage of legal issues concerning Soeharto's
wealth.
	   Former attorney general Soedjono C. Atmonegoro revealed last
week that Yohanes had presented letters on his power of attorney to
represent Soeharto.
	   Yohanes is a graduate of Pacific Western University in Los
Angeles, United States, with a doctorate in political science.
	   He is currently chairman of an organization called
Yayasan/Lembaga Perlindungan Budaya Hukum Nasional ``Keadilan
Sosial Indonesia'' (Foundation for the Protection of National
Culture and Law ``Indonesian Social Justice'') which has its office
in Tebet, South Jakarta.

	   Speakers at a seminar on ``Dhaka Water Resources Management
Programme'' held on Sunday last were unanimous in their opinion
that the water supply system in the city needs to be streamlined in
order to meet the demands of an ever-growing population.Scarcity of
water is a major problem that the city-dwellers have been grappling
with for more than two decades. Admittedly, the planners in the
seventies failed to form a picture of the predicament that we are
in today, and were unable to install a water supply system that
could cater to the needs of more than eight million people.
	   The result, of course, has been disastrous with many localities
being denied any supply of water for days or even months
together.Experts have long been saying that too much dependence on
ground water (95 per cent in Dhaka's case) can indeed create
insurmountable problems in the long run. So, the planners have, for
good reasons, turned to alternative sources of water. It has been
reported that a scheme is afoot to supply water from the river
Meghna to the city. However, the plan itself indicates that the
water of the rivers around the city is now too polluted to be used
safely. It is another aspect of the issue that deserves a closer
look.
	   If pollution is not checked we will soon be left with no sources
of water whatsoever.Efforts, we are told, are being made to
increase WASA's supply capacity to meet the demands of the
residents of Dhaka. There is no doubt that such measures should
have been adopted well before the situation took a critical
turn.Obviously, the plan to collect water from a big river like the
Meghna should go some way to easing the water crisis in the city.
But the point to bear in mind is that the demand for water will go
up steadily in future also. So the planners have to examine the
issue in all its ramifications. They should not commit the mistake
that their predecessors did.

Thousands of teachers rally, requesting higher wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Thousands of teachers rallied near the
government building Tuesday to press demands for a 12.5 percent
wage hike and protest the state's decision simply to close schools
a week early to avoid teachers' strikes.
	   Police prevented the teachers from reaching government
headquarters in a peaceful protest.
	   ``There is enough money for many other state departments, so
there should also be some money for the education,'' said Vesna
Kanizaj, head of the biggest teachers' union.
	   A monthly teacher's salary is an equivalent to dlrs 350, below
the national average of dlrs 400.
	   The government says it has no money for a wage increase, but
teachers' unions insist education deserves more than 8 percent of
the dlrs 6.4 billion state budget.
	   About 80 percent of teachers participated in the May 20 and June
4 nationwide strikes. All six unions, united for the first time for
the same cause, threatened to strike indefinitely until the
government fulfill their requests.
	   The threat could have paralyzed the educational system and the
government closed the classrooms a week earlier than scheduled. It
said strikebreakers will work on final exams, and get a bonus for
that.
	   The government is facing increased popular dissatisfaction, as
most of people struggle to make ends meet, while a wealthy elite
thrives on alleged political connections and financial scams.
	   Pensioners, who make up a fifth of the country's 4.5 million
people, also announced protests if the government doesn't raise
their pensions.
	   Social discontent could dent President Franjo Tudjman's so far
undisputed rule.
	   Zlatko Seselj, a teacher at a private school, recently said that
the government ``does not understand the importance of education
for a modern country.''
	   ``If they cannot change their medieval behavior, it is time for
us to have a new government.''

	   PENANG, Fri. - In a move to alleviate the constant flood problem
in Penang, the Penang Island Municipal Council has embarked on
massive desilting of all 60 monsoon drains.
	   Its president Dr Teng Hock Nan said today: ``We are serious
about tackling the flood problem within the city. It is our utmost
concern.
	   ``This is why the council workers have been working very hard to
clean the drains in the city in anticipation of heavy rain.''
	   However, he said it was no easy task as many of the drains were
still clogged with silt, garbage, pieces of unwanted furniture and
other items.
	   ``Many people are still treating the drains as rubbish dumps and
throwing rubbish into them indiscriminately. I appeal to them to
refrain from continuing to throw rubbish into the drains.''
	   Dr Teng said this after a site visit to Lorong Carnavon where he
was briefed by Urban Services Department officers on the cleaning
of drains.
	   He said about 30 per cent of the flood problems could be solved
if residents helped keep the drains free from rubbish.
	   Even an hour's downpour is enough to cause floods in certain
parts of the city.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British boxing promoter Frank Warren said Tuesday
he is negotiating with the U.S. television network HBO for Roy
Jones Jr. to challenge for the WBO cruiserweight title.
	   Jones is the current WBC light heavyweight champion and former
IBF middleweight and super middleweight champ.
	   Warren said he wants Jones to fight the winner of the July 18
WBO cruiserweight title bout in Sheffield, England, between Carl
Thompson and Chris Eubank.
	   Considered by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the
world, Jones is 36-1 with 31 knockouts. In his most recent fight,
he stopped Virgil Hill in the fourth round in Biloxi, Miss.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Alatas said
yesterday that Indonesia would open three north-south sea-lanes to
international shipping next year and that another east-west sea
passage was also under consideration.
	   Alatas said the Maritime Safety Committee of the London-based
International Maritime Organization (IMO) had officially adopted
the three archipelagic sea-lanes proposed by Indonesia on May 19.
	   Upon the opening of the lanes, foreign shipping, including
military vessels, will be able sail freely through the three
passages without prior permission. They, however, will not be
allowed to travel outside the established lanes.
	   Previously, each ship had to request prior permission from
Indonesian officials and provide its proposed route.
	   ``It is hoped that next year, these three archipelagic sea-lanes
will be fully operational and respected by all countries,'' Alatas
told a news conference at his office.
	   Alatas was accompanied by Navy Chief Adm. Arief Kushariadi, the
foreign ministry's Director General of Political Affairs Nugroho
Wisnumurti, Ambassador-at-large on Sea/Maritime Law Hasjim Djalal
and the Navy's head of hydrology and oceanography, Commodore
Nicolas P. Elok.
	   Alatas said only technical details, such as laws covering the
setting up of a monitoring, surveillance and control mechanism,
remained to be worked out.
	   The three lanes will allow international passage of vessels and
overhead flights through the archipelago on a north and south axis.
	   One route lies through the Sunda and Karimata straits leading to
the South China Sea, while a second runs through the Lombok and
Makassar straits leading to the Celebes Sea.
	   The third lane connects the seas of Sawu, Timor and Arafura to
the Pacific Ocean through the Leti Strait, the Banda Sea and the
Moluccas Sea.
	   Alatas said several countries had been pressing for sea-lanes
that traversed an east-west axis of the archipelago.
	   ``But, we believe that for the time being, the three north-south
sea-lanes will be sufficient.'' Alatas said.
	   ``We are not closing the door altogether on looking into the
possibility of an east-west sea-lane passage, but as of now we
believe that there is an understanding between us and the major
maritime users. We will see how the three north-south sea-lanes
function,'' he added.
	   Hasjim said flights would also be allowed along the sea-lanes
and that submarines would not have to sail on the surface.
	   The establishment of the sea-lanes were required under the
recognition of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea of Indonesia's archipelagic concept.
	   Seas within an archipelagic state are considered the state's
territory, where foreign vessels must obtain the permission of
state authorities.
	   Indonesia covers a land mass of 1.9 million square kilometers
and has territorial waters of nearly four times that size.

	   In an incident of unpremeditated violence in Khulna on June 14,
officers of the court, i.e. lawyers ransacked the offices of Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, the Assistant Commissioner (Land), rooms
of the District Accounts Office, the Nezarat Section of the
Collectorate, and some court rooms. In turn the employees and staff
of the Khulna Collectorate threw stones and brickbats at the newly
constructed building of the Khulna Bar Association, shattering most
of the windowpanes and leaving 13 lawyers injured. Some thirty
people are reported to have suffered injury in the fracas, nine of
them government employees.
	   The shameful incident was the result of a simple dispute between
the lawyers and the district administration about the closure by
walling of a short-cut passage between the Bar Association building
and the Collectorate buildings that house the courts. The lawyers
are now demanding that the Deputy Commissioner and the Additional
Deputy Commissioner (General) of Khulna be removed, and boycotted
all courts to press their point.There could not be a better example
of how the creeping cancer of intolerance, albeit compounded by
administrative insensitivity, is eating away at the roots of our
social order.

hundred people attacked the Power Development Board Office and
vandalised several office rooms and equipment, enraged by severe
loadshedding imposed on the city, reportedly to supplement the
national grid for the benefit of World Cup soccer watchers on
television. The Chittagong incident also indicates that it is
perhaps not a good policy to rob Peter to pay Paul, leaving aside
the question of social justification of cutting down on industrial
production to indulge soccer craze.But the growing tendency of
intolerant response to perceived wrongs is the thing that the
authorities must tackle with an iron hand in the first place, if at
all the fabric of social order is to be saved.

	   BETTER LIFE AHEAD ... Felda settlers Taib Jasmin, 69, (third
from left), Mohd Yusof Mohd Noor, 68, (second from right) and Mohd
Amin Mohd, 63, looking at the title deeds to their land with family
members.
	   They were among 96 Felda Sungai Sayong settlers who received
their titles on Wednesday from Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani
Othman.
	   With the deeds, they are now legal owners of 3.2ha of land under
Phase Four and Six of the Felda scheme.
	   Taib, from Kg Sri Gading, Parit Bengkok in Batu Pahat, has no
regrets leaving his hometown 30 years ago.
	   ``Compared with life back then, it is more comfortable now.
Before, we were only paid RM2.10 to RM2.90 each 0.4 hectare, but
the price now is RM30.
	   Agreeing, his neighbour Mohd Amin, a father of 11 said he had to
work extra hard to make ends meet.
	   Amin who had been working in various towns including Singapore
decided to settle down in Sungai Sayong when more land was
developed by Felda.
	   ``Now that most of my children are already working, life is
easier,'' he said.
	   The oldest of the trio, Mohd Yusof, described Sungai Sayong as a
remote land without proper infrastructure when he arrived 30 years
ago.
	   ``There were few oil palm trees in the estate and no proper
access road to town but now it is all tarred. After toiling for 30
years, I am very happy to receive the title,'' he said.
	   Development of Felda Sungai Sayong has been implemented in seven
phases totalling 1,747 hectares, including 119ha of housing area.
Phase One of the development started in 1964 while the last phase
was launched in 1980.
	   At present, there are 399 settler families in the land scheme.

	   A three-month-long countrywide tree plantation drive has been
launched. A Tree Fair '98 has also been organised at the Dhanmondi
Playground on the occasion. President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed in
a message called for increasing forest resources by large-scale
tree plantation and to reduce dependence on natural forests for
firewood. In another message Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called
upon all to take part in the nationwide programme to save the
country's environment.
	   Though tree plantation drive is a recurrent annual programme,
its significance remains undiminished, all the more so when
deforestation is posing a serious ecological threat to the country.
As afforestation is a high national priority the whole nation has
to be mobilised towards that end. Programme like this one has great
motivational impact and can help to create popular awareness and
enlist popular participation.Ceremonial tree plantation, however,
has one limitation: after the programme is over, its impact is
often not sustained.
	   Afforestation is not a one-time activity and trees need to be
nursed. Simply planting is not enough. Fruit trees are expected to
be emphasised in this programme which is not commonly done.The
drive for growing trees is to be accompanied by one of saving
trees. If felling of trees goes on unchecked, the benefits of tree
plantation will be neutralised. Substitution of wood by steel or
other material, whenever possible, should be made mandatory and
government agencies which are still using wooden furniture
exclusively, will have to take the lead in this regard.

	   JAKARTA (JP): PT Jamsostek, a state company that operates the
only social security insurance policy for workers, has often been
in the media spotlight in last eight months.
	   Most reports have been unflattering, leaving the company with,
to say the least, a severely damaged reputation.
	   Criticism continues to pour in of when, last year, then minister
of manpower Abdul Latief used Rp 3.1 billion (US$210,000) of
Jamsostek's funds to finance the deliberation of a controversial
labor law.
	   As part of the wave of reform, workers have continuously accused
company officials of rampant corruption and are demanding an end to
Jamsostek's monopoly in the provision of social security.
	   Ackmal Husin, who was hastily appointed the company's new
president two weeks ago, has spoken to The Jakarta Post to respond
to this criticism and the challenges ahead:
	   Question: What is your response to the allegations of rampant
corruption in the company?
	   Answer: I am against corrupt practices. I'm trying to create a
clean management structure and promote a transparent managerial
system.
	   Every year the company's performance is audited by the
government audit agency (BPKP) and all its audit results have been
followed up with immediate action.
	   All financial leakages are being thoroughly investigated.
Officials and employees found guilty of embezzling the labor fund
have been given strict sanctions. This includes some dismissals.
	   Many employees have been fired for corrupt practices but is it
necessary for us to publicize this? Such practices can be found in
other companies, government offices and private institutions.
	   Q: How about the allegation surrounding the construction of the
multistory Menara Jamsostek buildings on Jl. Gatot Subroto, South
Jakarta, which cost about Rp 360 billion?
	   A: BPKP has audited the construction project accounts and no
deviations have been found. The two towers were built by private
companies which had no links to Jamsostek officials, and the tender
was offered to the public transparently. Nothing in the project was
hidden.
	   I knew everything about the project because I was director of
investment and finance (between 1994 and 1998) when the two towers
were built.
	   The construction has been completed and the towers are ready for
rent. A number of companies, including foreign investors, have said
they will move to the towers which are strategically located in the
business center.
	   Regarding the land used to construct the towers, South Jakarta
district court decided in 1984 that the land belonged to Jamsostek.
	   However, the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office is also investigating
its ownership. We will accept whatever decision is eventually
reached.
	   Q: How about the Rp 3.1 billion taken from the company by former
manpower minister Abdul Latief to finance the controversial labor
law?
	   A: Of course, it is true that the company paid Rp 3.1 billion to
finance the law's deliberation. But let me tell you that the money
was taken not from the funds collected from employers and workers
but from the government's participatory share in the company. The
government has a Rp 5 billion participatory share from when the
company was established in 1976.
	   Both employers and workers can rest assured that the company has
never used the workers' money for unnecessary expenditure,
including the company's annual operation costs.
	   The company's expenditure and operational costs are taken from
the profit the company gains from its investments.
	   The company's assets are Rp 6.1 trillion. A major part of the
funds the company has collected from employers and workers has been
reinvested in participatory shares in other companies, property,
including housing for workers, Bank Indonesia certificates and bank
deposits.
	   Q: What is your reaction to the calls for an end to Jamsostek's
monopoly in running social security schemes for workers?
	   A: Jamsostek does not object to the recent idea aired by
Minister of Manpower Fahmi Idris of allowing private companies to
run insurance programs for workers.
	   But first the government must revoke Law No. 3/1992 which
stipulates that only Jamsostek is entrusted to run an insurance
program for workers.
	   Second, Jamsostek must be allowed to compete against private
companies in giving better services to workers.
	   However, the government should exercise caution in this matter
because changes could create loopholes for employers to avoid
participating in such programs for their workers.
	   Workers should realize that the program is designed to provide
them protection at the expense of their employers.
	   Each worker actually only pays 2 percent of their monthly wage
while their employers contribute at least 6.7 percent of their
workers' wages per month to the company.
	   Third, Jamsostek does not object if the government wants it to
be managed by a tripartite management representing the government,
employers and workers. But first and foremost the law must be
amended.
	   Q: Can you briefly explain how the payment schemes work?
	   A: According to our data, the company has collected, since its
formation in 1976 to December, more than Rp 6.03 trillion from
77,772 companies and 13.3 million workers participating in the
social security program which comprises four insurance schemes.
	   It has paid a total of Rp 393 billion in compensation for
insurance claims in the four schemes since the company's
establishment in 1976.
	   Employers, from their own money, contribute monthly between 0.24
percent and 1.74 percent of each worker's wage to the occupational
accident program, 3.7 percent to pension funds, 0.3 percent to
health programs and between 3 percent and 6 percent for health care
insurance programs while workers contribute only 2 percent of their
wages for the pension program.
	   The payment schemes are as follows: After an occupational
accident, the company pays between Rp 100,000 and Rp 300,000 for
transportation fees. While recuperating the worker also gets one
month's salary and his medical fees are reimbursed up to Rp 3
million.
	   If an employee is handicapped and can no longer work, then the
worker will receive 70 percent of 60 times his salary.
	   In case of death, the worker's family will receive 60 percent of
60 months salary, an additional Rp 1 million compensation and Rp
200,000 to cover burial fees.
	   The pension plan applies for those retiring at the age of 55 or
prematurely, as long as the worker has participated in Jamsostek
for five years. They will receive a pension which amounts to their
total contribution to the company plus 10 percent interest.
	   Q: What is your vision for the company's future development?
	   A: My obsession is to make Jamsostek a strong company that plays
a pivotal role in the stock exchange.
	   As in other countries, we want Jamsostek to be a credible
financial institution whose strength lies in productive workers.
	   I want the company to become a more public one run by
professional fund managers.
	   The management will always be open to all criticism and
transparent in managing workers' money.

	   Since July 1997, a number of East and Southeast Asian countries
have been affected by the financial crisis which originated in
Thailand and spread quickly to Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and
Korea. A considerable amount of hindsight has been generated on the
causes of the Southeast Asia and Korean currency and financial
crises. A consensus is emerging on the following diagnosis. First,
macroeconomic fundamentals (inflation, budget deficit, savings
rates) were broadly right, with the possible exception of
significant current account deficits of the balance of payments,
coupled with fairly inflexible exchange rate regimes and overvalued
exchange rates. Second, levels of capital flows, many of which
short term and related to private sector activities, were high.
	   The combination of overvalued exchange rates and reliance on
short term capital inflows to offset current account deficits
created the preconditions for pressure on the exchange rate. Third,
the instability was accentuated by poorly regulated and
insufficiently supervised financial market. A very high level of
short-term foreign exchange borrowing took place to take advantage
of the considerably lower foreign interest rates. Lending was
channeled into assets whose prices became artificially inflated
(real estate, stock market) and business ventures whose
profitability was questionable. When domestic exchange rates
started depreciating and asset prices fell, the backing of loans
became insufficient, and the demand for foreign currency to repay
the short-term loans further exacerbated the currency depreciation,
creating a confidence crisis which fueled further depreciation.
	   The South Asian financial crisis does not reflect long-term
crisis of regional growth, rather it reflects short-term financial
considerations. The Southeast Asian countries pegged their
currencies to the US dollar during the 1990s, even though the
region's trade depends not just on the US but on the EEC and the
Asian markets with Japan playing the significant role. After the
mid-1995 the US dollar began to appreciate sharply vis-a-vis the
Japanese Yen and the currencies of major EEC countries. As a
result, the Southeast Asian currencies also appreciated sharply
against the Japanese yen, European currencies, and other national
currencies, such as the Chinese Yuan, that also depreciated
vis-a-vis the US dollar. With a overvalued currency, the Southeast
Asian countries were pricing themselves out of Japanese and the
European markets. They also faced stiff competition from China,
which had devalued their currency in 1994. The Southeast Asian
countries attracted considerable amount of foreign capital
investments in the l 990s.
	   Many of these investments enhanced export potential and thereby
contributed to the engine of long-term growth. In the mid-1990s,
however, a rising share of foreign capital flows appears to have
headed for speculative investments in the real estate markets.
Following financial market deregulation in many countries,
commercial banks got into the act by borrowing dollars abroad and
lending the funds domestically to real estate developers. When they
made these loans in local currency, the banks exposed themselves to
the risk of currency depreciation, since the value of such loans
would fall relative to the value of their dollar borrowing. Even
when the domestic real estate loans were in dollars, however, the
banks were at risk, since domestic property developers would be
unable to repay the dollar-denominated loans in the wake of a
domestic currency devaluation. The overvalued pegged exchange rate
gave the financial system a false security.
	   When the property market weakened in 1996 and the currency
depreciated in 1997, the banks were hit by non-performing loans and
coupled with weak capital base faced insolvency. East Asian
economic crisis continues to rage over much of Asia. The IMF in its
recent special interim assessment says that no part of the world
will emerge unscathed form the Asian crisis that is yet to play
itself out. Indeed, the magnitude as well as geographical spread of
the Asian crisis, particularly the South Korean crisis, is bound to
have significant impact on countries not just in the Asian region
but around the world. South Korea, which made it only recently to
the rich men's club, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), is now faced with socio-economic despair.
	   The progress is that the cure will be more painful than the
disease. Ironically, only a few months ago, the International
Monetary Fund, in its annual report, strongly commended South
Korea. It applauded South Korea's impressive economic performance
and praised its fiscal record. There was no hint in this report of
any concern about ``chaebols'', poor banking regulations,
overvalued won, etc. Why it is that the situation is now being
called a deep-rooted disease, the cure for which is being termed as
chemotherapeutic'? Critics emphasize that South Korea's problems in
particular, and Asia's in general, arose not from macro-economic
fundamentals but from self-fulfilling withdrawals of short- term
loans by private financiers in these countries. Till the crisis
struck, foreign investors were funneling in money to these
economies. When doubt arose, triggered by one event followed by
another, investors panicked and each got out faster than the rest.
	   The economy collapsed. Meanwhile, the LDCs, which are trying to
court private financiers, should be conscious as to how quickly
exchange and financial market pressures can cause ``South Korea
type'' catastrophe, notwithstanding sound macro-economic
fundamentals. There are several ways in which debt crisis such as
those of the East Asian can affect the rest of world. The trade
effects, as these countries are forced to import less and export
more, are the most obvious. A still more obvious danger is that
contagion from Asia could affect US and other equity markets, which
are already too high by many criteria. It will almost be impossible
to disentangle a healthy correction from the early stages of a
self-feeding downward spiral. Most worrying of all would be a more
general loss of confidence in the West. The maintenance of nominal
demand in the West is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition
for the smoother operation of world capitalism. Attention also
needs to be paid to the type of adjustment being urged on East
Asian countries.
	   Many of them operated pegged exchange rates for far too long.
When funds were coming in to feed an unsustainable boom, interest
rates could not be raised, for fear of currency appreciation. When
the boom was punctured they had to be raised excessively in a vain
effort to stop an outflow. An exchange rate in freefall in an open
emerging economy can do much harm. It squeezes already vulnerable
living standards. If domestic financial institutions have dollar
debts that exceed the foreign exchange reserves of the country
concerned, its own central bank is not able to prevent a collapse
of the financial system. Thus, even in floating exchange rate
world, there is need for an international lender of last resort.
The Asian crisis will exert a powerful disinflationary force in the
West. That is good news for investors in bonds, but the fallout
from Asian crisis may reduce corporate profit. Falling bond yields
will initiate a flight to equity investment in the west. The Asian
crisis may provide an opportunity for the policymakers to rethink
about high growth rates generated by foreign capital.
	   Controls on capital may be a defensive move that is essential to
the success of any alternative development strategy. The so-called
Tobin tax, a transaction tax imposed on all cross-border flows of
capital that are not earmarked as direct foreign investment, would
help slow down the frenzied and increasingly irrational movement of
financial capital. Another policy tool could be to require
portfolio investors make an interest-free deposit equal to a
certain percentage of their investment that they could not be able
to withdraw for one or more years. This would make them think twice
before pulling out at the scent of higher yields elsewhere. The aim
is not to discourage foreign direct investment but to create a
strong disincentive for speculation. It would not penalize direct
investors that are making more long-term commitments of their
capital. In a market-based system of finance, the risk of losing
one's money is a fundamental requirement.
	   If bank depositors are assured that their savings are safe no
matter what, they will exercise no care in choosing their bank, and
a crucial discipline over the prudence of bank lending is lost. If
the banks' loans are themselves protected by government backing,
the likewise have no incentive to require caution of managers. This
moral hazard is known to the central bankers. To promote safe
lending in the long-term, some risk must be left with depositors,
and far more with owners, but not so much as to make the system
vulnerable to short-term instability. The current rescue package is
just making another set of lenders feel safe, this time foreigners.
Indirectly, IMF is telling that there is a too big to fail country
doctrine in the international lending, and the IMF will eventually
underwrite both private and public debt. Perceptions and
expectations are an essential ingredient of any currency or
financial crisis. Some of the region's currencies have been so far
largely immune from major currency fluctuations because of the
perception in the financial community that there are adequate
reserves and political determination to defend their parity. Others
have experienced wide swings in response to announcements, which
boosted or undetermined investors' confidence.
	   At the time of the 1994/95 Mexican crisis the stock markets and
currencies of other Latin American countries were also affected,
though the countries themselves did not have any significant
imbalances which would justify declines of the magnitude which was
experienced. Countries can be affected by financial instability
simply as a consequence of associations, which are established in
the minds of investors or currency traders. There are two main
reasons why this type of contagion can take place. While board
generalizations may not be well founded, strong economic linkages
exist among countries and groups of countries. In some cases (as
Between Nepal or Bhutan and India) the exchange rate of a smaller
country is pegged to that of a larger country, so any currency
fluctuation in the latter does normally translate into the former.
In other cases, trade or investment linkages may be events in one
and inevitably affect the situation in the other. In these cases,
investors and traders are well justified to expect some degree of
contagion.
	   It becomes therefore important to identify what are the channels
through which instability in a country or group of countries can
translate into vulnerability of other countries, which have
economic ties with the former. Depending on the degree of
sophistication of the traders and investors, generalizations tend
to be made about groups of countries. A somewhat primitive (but
surprisingly common) approach would tend to lump all Asian (or
Southeast Asian) countries together. Therefore, if the earlier
perception that investment in Asian markets was a relatively safe
and the high yielding approach to portfolio diversification are
revised with the same level of generality, all Asian countries
would now come to be viewed as potential candidates for financial
failure. As a result, new capital inflows would become very
limited, and foreign investors would attempt to liquidate .their
positions.
	   The result would be a self-fulfilling pressure for exchange rate
depreciation. Not all countries would be vulnerable to these
pressures to the same degree: countries, which in the past have
received only modest capital inflows would be less ``different'',
would also receive more careful security before blanket
generalizations are applied. Singapore, for example, has been much
less affected by the current financial turmoil because of the
perception that macro-economic and financial management are run in
a tight manner. The same applied to Chile during the 1994/95
Mexican crisis. Clarifying and publicizing the extent of
differentiation between a given country's situation and the
regional panorama can be an important instrument for modifying
investors' and traders' perceptions.The writer is an Associate

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Some 10,000 trade unionists from all
over the country marched 15 kilometers (9 miles) through the
capital on Tuesday to protest a steep drop in living standards.
	   Blocking lunchtime traffic, their march set to the toll of a
funeral bell, protesters handed a letter with their demands to
Prime Minister Radu Vasile, who agreed to meet them for talks later
this week.
	   The Cartel Alfa union, which organized the protest, has 1.2
million members. One truck carried beds with men sleeping in them
to symbolize the indifference of the country's leaders to the
people.
	   Romanians say they cannot make ends meet with an average salary
of dlrs 100 (lei 850,000) and that their merits are not rewarded.
Inflation is running at 20 percent for the first five months of
1998.
	   Worker Gheorghe Antohi, 41, from the central city of Brasov, is
forced to work part-time because of his factory has a lack of
orders. He said he is raising five children with a salary of dlrs
100 per month.
	   ``This country is run by people who put their private interests
above the needs of nation,'' Antohi said.
	   Among other things, trade unionists demanded a law which would
give each employee a lei 15,000 (dlrs 2) daily food allowance.
	   The proposal recently was blocked in parliament after the
finance minister told the government there was no money in the
state budget for such a measure.
	   Bogdan Hossu, head of Cartel Alfa, claimed the prime minister
had said he would agree to the law.

	   By saying yes to greenhouse gas (GHG) trading between developed
countries, the Kyoto Protocol has set off another buzz of activity.
Even though the climate change secretariat indicates that trading
may not be here to stay, Japan is striking a deal with Russia, and
the giant oil multinational Shell is considering a dealership in
emissions trading. The World Bank, too, has set up a US $110
million fund as part of its ``global carbon initiative'' which will
facilitate trade between buyers and sellers. The bank has already
signed a memorandum of understanding with five governments and 11
companies. Another system is being worked out by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Though the details
are not yet available, two private firms, Costa Rica-based Earth
Council and the Chicago-based Centre Financial Products Ltd, are
working with UNCTAD on a pilot programme for greenhouse gas
trading. Will this trading work as it is without rights and
entitlements?
	   The Japanese trading house Sumitomo has recently announced that
it plans to help Unified Energy System, a Russian power generating
group that has stakes in 72 regional power generators in Russia,
reduce its emissions of GHGs. The hot air' deal could provide Japan
with credit towards its own targets for reducing GHG emissions. Hot
air' refers to the Russian proposal to allow non-European Union
(EU) industrialised countries to benefit from their low eimissions.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent decline in
the economy of Russia and the central and eastern European (CEE)
states, their current emissions are 31 per cent below 1990 levels,
according to the World Energy Council. CEE countries would have
excess emissions of more than 300 million tons per year during
2008-2012--the target period within which the agreed upon
reductions are to be made by industrialised countries.
	   Therefore, if Russia and the United States were to form a
bubble, they could together show a major reduction in their
emissions below 1990 levels by 2010, even if the US does increase
its emissions. The scheme, however, would have no recognisable
benefit in terms of reductions in global emissions. On the
contrary, Hot air' trading would lead to emissions being
significantly higher --2.3 per cent of 1990 ANNEX I CO2 emissions.
The US had strongly supported the proposal in Kyoto. It went
further by coming to a conceptual understanding on trading
emissions rights with several countries, including Australia,
Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and the Ukraine. This umbrella
group is to further reduce compliance costs for those with emission
reduction targets. At Kyoto, EU had argued that such a Hot air'
bubble could not be allowed as it would constitute a major
loophole' in the Kyoto Protocol. But the US retorted that EU is
also doing the same.
	   Meanwhile the oil giant Shell is reportedly considering a plan
to launch an international market in CO2 emission permits. In a
recent interview, Jim Dawson, head of Shell's new renewable energy
unit, said he was encouraged by the success of the national market
in sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions in the United States. However,
experience with permit trading in general has produced mixed
results in the US, where the system has been used as a
complimentary device in a predominantly command and control regime.
With the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990,
the focus of environmental policy in the US air legislation shifted
towards creating economic incentives for meeting emission reduction
goals. The US experience shows that cost savings achieved by
emissions trading under the 1990 Clean Air Act are considerable.
	   The new Clean Air Act aims at reducing SO2 emissions by creating
a market in SO2 permits. A market opened for SO2 allowances, in the
early 1990s, on the Chicago Board of Trade. The system treats SO2
as much as a tradable permit system in greenhouse gases (GHGs) as
it might treat CO2. Though the US programme is probably the only
genuine programme of emissions-trading to have materialised at the
national level, the experience shows a less than hoped-for level of
trading in the permit system. Much of the trading that took place
under the arrangement has been intra-corporation and the overall
market for genuine trades has been quite thin.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Beef may become a rarity soon due to a sharp
decline in imported cows and beef, the chairman of the Indonesian
Retail Merchants Association (Aprindo) said yesterday.
	   Steve Sondakh told members of the House of Representatives that
stock in supermarkets and other retail outlets was sufficient for
only one month.
	   He declined to give details of stocks in warehouses of Aprindo
members.
	   Steve said the 80 percent drop in the value of rupiah against
the U.S. dollar since July last year had made imported live cattle
exorbitantly expensive.
	   As the result, he said, the meat supply from cattle-rearing
farms, which mostly use live cattle from Australia, had fallen
sharply, he told the House's Commission III for agriculture,
forestry, transmigration and food affairs.
	   Indonesia imports both meat and live cattle from Australia to
meet local demand.
	   ``Without further help to import more cows, we will face a
scarcity of beef in the domestic market in the coming months,''
Steve said.
	   The cattle-rearing program needed both technical and financial
assistance, he added.
	   The Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with other agencies,
has been developing cattle-rearing farms in seven provinces of East
Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, Lampung, South and West Sumatra and
West Nusa Tenggara since 1996.
	   Last year, the ministry imported 350,586 live cows from
Australia, New Zealand and the United States for the project.
	   Steve said that it would be futile to rely on local meat
production because it had also been declining since early late last
year due to the soaring price of feedmeal.
	   ``We are also facing a crisis in poultry meat because the
soaring prices of feedmeal. Only big scale livestock and poultry
farms can survive in this situation,'' he added.
	   According to data from the ministry, Indonesia's production of
livestock meat reached 1.71 million tons last year, while
consumption stood at 1.75 million tons.
	   This year, meat production is expected to reach 1.92 million
tons, with consumption at 1.93 million tons.

	   JOHOR BARU, Fri. - Despite the economic slowdown, the retail
sector is doing well as reflected by the total daily transactions
by more than 40 money changers here.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman said the money changers
handled between RM1.7 million and RM1.9 million on weekdays and up
to RM9 million on weekends.
	   Most of the transactions are by daily-rated Malaysian workers in
Singapore who commute across the Causeway daily and who change
their Singapore dollars into ringgit at the money changers.
	   Some 200,000 Malaysians work in Singapore, of whom at least
50,000 are daily commuters.
	   A lot of the business at the money changers also comes from
Singapore day-trippers who flock here daily, especially on weekends
and public holidays, for shopping or leisure.
	   Ghani said the huge amount of money being handled by the money
changers clearly showed that the retail sector was aflush with
ready cash and retailers could do well to tap this rich money
source.
	   ``Johor Baru enjoys a comparative advantage by virtue of its
close proximity to Singapore which offers an additional customer
base of three million people.
	   ``We can effectively tap this market by providing different
retail choices for customers to meet their discerning tastes,'' he
told reporters after performing the ``topping out'' ceremony of the
City Square project here.
	   The RM350 million project in the heart of Johor Baru, is a joint
development between the Johor Baru City Council (MBJB) and the Kuok
Group of companies.
	   Also present was Johor Baru Datuk Bandar Datuk Hashim Yahaya and
Merit Properties Sdn Bhd (a member of the Kuok Group) managing
director and chief executive officer Frank S.K. Goon.
	   City Square is being built on a 2.2ha site fronting Jalan Tun
Abdul Razak and Jalan Wong Ah Fook. It was previously the site of
the Johor Baru Central Market.
	   The fully-integrated mixed-use development comprises a
six-storey retail podium offering over 120 units of speciality
shops, a five-screen cineplex, an amusement centre and a 30-storey
office tower with 640,000 sq ft of prime quality office space.
	   The shopping centre is due for opening late this year while the
office tower is scheduled to be ready by mid-1999.
	   Ghani said there was a dire need to further develop the retail
sector which is already being domninated by four major
hypermarkets, a range of supermarkets, mini-markets and retailers,
the pasar tani and pasar malam outlets.
	   He said there was still room for new players by virtue of the
large market size and the ready purchasing power of the people,
including visitors from Singapore.
	   Ghani said he was keen to learn from the Singapore experience,
particularly the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) which runs a
successful chain of ``Fair Price'' retail outlets throughout the
island.
	   ``I will lead a Johor delegation to Singapore on June 26 to see
if we can adopt this concept for Johor,'' he said, adding that the
Johor State Civil Service Staff Co-operative would spearhead this
initiative.
	   The co-operative society is already involved in the retail
business with its own chain of ``Kedai Ko-op'' here.
	   He noted that under the NTUC's Fair Price concept, union members
enjoyed not only quality foodstuff at low prices but also rebates
and dividends at the end of the year.
	   ``We plan to adopt the same concept... Consumers who are members
of the co-operative would not only enjoy good savings but also
discounts and dividends.
	   ``This is an effective way of encouraging retailing. It is also
the Johor Government's way of ensuring goods are available to the
masses at fair prices.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Federation of Private Domestic Banks
(Perbanas) called on the government yesterday to limit bank
ownership to no more than 20 percent.
	   The head of the association's advisory board, Thomas Suyatno,
told reporters the limitation would prevent banks from creating
policies merely to cater to their majority shareholders.
	   ``Any bank shareholder must not have more than a 20 percent
share so that there will be no more majority shareholders,'' Thomas
said after a hearing with the House of Representatives Commission
VIII for state budget and finance, research and technology.
	   The limit is seen as a means to eventually improve bank
management.
	   It would also prevent practices in which bank majority
shareholders pressured bank managements to adopt policies which
could harm its public funds.
	   Currently, most domestic banks are largely controlled by
business groups or families.
	   Thomas, who is also a member of the commission, said the same
rule must apply to state-run banks as well.
	   The transition limiting bank ownerships must be conducted within
the next two years, before the country enters the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 2003, he said.
	   The central bank would have to monitor the transitions to detect
any infractions by bank shareholders should the policy come into
effect.
	   Thomas said the phasing out of majority ownerships could be done
through mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, as well as public
share offerings.
	   Separately, banking magazine Infobank announced yesterday its
ratings of 215 commercial banks based on their 1997 financial
reports.
	   The 215 banks surveyed by include foreign and joint-venture
operations.
	   Best performers in 1997 include Hanil Tamara Bank, Bank Korea
Commercial Surya, Bank Harfa, Bank Global Internasional, Bank Index
Selindo, Bank Panin, Tokai Lippo Bank, Liman International Bank,
Bank Chinatrust Tamara and Bank Kesejahteraan.
	   Infobank managing editor Eko Budi Supriyanto said yesterday the
survey's only flaw was that it was based on the banks' 1997
financial reports.
	   Economist Sri Mulyani said that the financial reports would not
be enough to judge the banking industry, especially since
confidence in the sector was plunging and because of high
inflation.
	   ``During times of high inflation, financial ratios do not mean
much,'' she said, adding that she was skeptical over the banks'
financial information because the sector had a poor disclosure
quality in the past.
	   The magazine also named 32 banks as unhealthy.
	   The magazine, however, said it may raise the number to 53 since
another 21 banks, which had failed to disclose their 1997 financial
reports by the April deadline, were suspected to be unhealthy as
well.
	   Those categorized as unhealthy include Bank Papan Sejahtera,
Deutsche Bank (Jakarta), Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Rabobank Duta
Indonesia, Bank Nusa International, Bank Central Dagang, Bank Tata,
Bank Ficorinvest, Bank Dagang Negara, Bank Dagang dan Industri,
Bank Bumi Daya and Bank Sewu.
	   The banks which failed to disclose their 1997 financial results
include Bank BNP Lippo Indonesia, Bank Credit Lyonnais Indonesia,
Indosuez Indonesia Bank and Bank Societe Generale Indonesia.

Milosevic agrees to negotiate with moderate Kosovo Albanian leader

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
Tuesday to resume negotiations with a moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader, and insisted his decision had nothing to do with NATO
exercises in the region.
	   Milosevic said he would meet with Ibrahim Rugova, a political
leader of Kosovo's Albanians, and not with the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the main militant group fighting to sever the southern Serb
province from Yugoslavia.
	   ``I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists,''
Milosevic told reporters after meeting with Russian officials for
several hours.
	   Milosevic and Rugova met in May, but the Albanians canceled
further talks until Serb government troops halted a reported
offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Rugova has lately been losing support to the more militant
separatists in the troubled province, whose uprising Milosevic has
tried to crush.
	   Milosevic met Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin on
Tuesday morning, kicking off a series of negotiations that
continued through most of the day.
	   ``It's necessary that the whole world see what we agreed to, so
that there should be no steps back,'' Yeltsin said. Grim-faced,
Yeltsin told reporters that the negotiations were ``not simple.''
	   After their one-on-one meeting, Yeltsin and Milosevic were
joined by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the director of
the foreign intelligence service.
	   In a joint statement, Yeltsin and Milosevic also agreed that
Yugoslavia would:
	   _ carry out no ``repressive actions against civilians.''
	   _ guarantee ``complete freedom of movement on the territory of
Kosovo,'' ``unlimited access to humanitarian aid,'' ``unrestricted
return for all refugees'' and ``no restrictions on the work of
international monitors who are accredited in Yugoslavia.''
	   _ reduce the presence of security forces outside their permanent
bases, but only ``as terrorist activities stop.''
	   Russia had joined with the United States and six other countries
on Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
persuade Milosevic that the alliance could react quickly.
	   In a rare news conference after the talks, Milosevic maintained
a defiant attitude toward the alliance, saying his decision to
negotiate was based solely on a desire to find a peaceful solution
to the conflict.
	   ``I see no connection here to the NATO exercises,'' he said.
	   He also said he saw no need to withdraw Serbian forces from
Kosovo, and denied that Serbian forces had committed war crimes or
killed any civilians in Kosovo.
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Rugova has sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, although
his goal _ independence for Kosovo _ remains the same as that of
the more militant separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.
	   ``The Kosovo conflict can't be solved by force,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters at the
Foreign Ministry. ``Unilateral, provocative steps that could push
the sides to escalate the conflict should be avoided. A stable,
long-lasting settlement can only be achieved through talks.''
	   Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis calls to mind its similar
role in the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq earlier in
the year, when Yeltsin and Primakov argued insistently against the
use of force while trying to persuade Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give in to U.N. demands.

Norway's air traffic returns to normal, new strike looms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Airlines resumed flights in Norway Tuesday
after a crippling strike by air traffic controllers, while another
conflict that could ground planes loomed as mediators tried to
negotiate new contracts for aircraft mechanics.
	   The government on Monday ordered 235 air traffic controllers and
other members of the Academics Union to return to work, saying a
four-day strike that closed airports in southern Norway was causing
excessive disruption.
	   Airlines reported their schedules were near normal on Tuesday,
although some flights would not resume until Wednesday due to the
need to bring in aircraft and crews.
	   ``It has been a little chaotic at the ticket counters,'' said
Hanne Bugel, of the Scandinavian Airlines System in Oslo. ``We're
asking people to be patient.''
	   The strike grounded all domestic flights in southern Norway, and
had airlines struggling to serve international passengers by busing
them more than four hours to an airport in Goteborg, southwest
Sweden.
	   While traffic was returning to normal, contract talks were
approaching a Thursday deadline for 600 members of the Norwegian
Aircraft Technicians Organization. The union has warned that it
will order a small strike and then step up action if their demands
are not met.
	   Union leader Rolf Dybwad said he believed a deadlock with
employers could be broken in time to avert a strike because the
dispute was more to do with principles than wage demands.
	   ``There wouldn't be a total halt to air traffic on Thursday,
anyway,'' Dybwad was quoted as saying by the Norwegian news agency
NTB.
	   The union has members working for SAS, Braathens and Wideroe
airlines.

Turkey releases Maltese ship with missile parts for Egypt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign ministry quotes. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ A Maltese-flagged cargo ship set sail
Tuesday morning, 32 hours after Turkey stopped it on suspicion of
carrying Russian missile parts for Cyprus.
	   Turkish authorities uncovered seven mobile missile launching
pads aboard the Natasha-1 but allowed it to continue its course
after Cairo confirmed that the military equipment was for Egypt.
The ship, which came from Ukraine, had described its cargo as
tractors and cars for Egypt.
	   ``There was obviously a difference between the bill of loading
and the actual cargo in the ship, and this is why Turkish
authorities inspected the ship,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati
Utkan said.
	   Turkey increased surveillance in its waters after reports last
week that radar and control panels for five S-300 missile systems
had reached Cyprus by sea.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey sent in troops in 1974
after an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only
Turkey recognizes the Turkish Cypriot state.
	   Turkey has vowed to take military action if the missiles are
installed by the Greek Cypriots, claiming they are a threat to
Turkish Cypriots in the north and Turkey itself. Cyprus claims the
missiles are merely defensive.
	   ``We will not bargain on this issue,'' Utkan said at a Foreign
Ministry briefing. ``Every threat requires an adequate answer.
Turkey will not allow this.''

	   No one denies that education is the backbone of a nation - in
making every individual competent in all respects and thus helping
the humanity achieve the best. Everyone also confesses that a kind
of anarchy has overtaken education in our country. Administrative
malpractice, acceptance of unfair ways in the examinations, leakage
of question papers and like incidents about the education sector
are flooding the lead items of daily newspapers everyday. In view
of creating a convenient milieu, millions of pages are printed
every year in the name of education reform at public cost but never
we attain that result which can be termed as efficacious. Among all
the plans and projects the most vital one is related with teaching
English.
	   We have employed most for it and the truth is we have succeeded
least in it. Everyone believes that our students should learn
English but the question which hardly comes up is for how many
years, from when to what level, and how. Years ago it was taught as
a compulsory subject from class III upto class XII . Now our
chilren begin to read it at class I till the graduation level.
Irrespective of Science, Commerce or Humanities, Medical or
Engineering they are compelled to study it. The prescribed
Education Committee Report by the present government proposes to
make English compulsory from class III. English education
experiences such changes in policy very often and most of the times
not on timely and thoughful consideration. Another such instance is
going to be repeated at the higher secondary level in near future.
	   It is known that from the current year, that is the academic
session 1998-99, a new curriculum and syllabus are going to be
introduced in the higher secondary level in which the subject
English is also included. A report about this compiled by a
committee has been made public. The report emphasizes the four
language skills in English i.e. listening, speaking, reading and
writing. The curriculum is made in view to making a communicative
syllabus . It aims to make the language a practising one --
practice between the teacher and students, students and the teacher
and between students. The format of the HSC examination for English
will comprise two papers having marks one hundred each. But the
proposed distribution of marks possibly can-not ensure the
achievement of the afore-mentioned skills.
	   The books yet to be published are surely to be written basing
communicativ methodology having objectives to meet this competence
in all the four communication skills. But do the examinations give
stress on the foremost communicative skills i.e. speaking and
listening ? Examinations are taken for what? Are not they for
assessing the students' progress and making them compelled to study
the things that academics and educationists want them to learn? So
if speaking and listening are not incorporated in the public
examinations, how can we demand the expected benefit? Rather this
communicative method might result in wastge. The learners will
neither learn literature, as it is in the existing syllabus, nor
attain the communicative capacities. The failure of this method
will spring form other causes also. Most of the teachers, now
teaching in the colleges, are from literature background. But
teaching communicative English is a different discipline. Fluency
in speaking and capacity in listening might not be enough for it.
How to meet the procedural difficulties is very significant in this
relation.
	   Not that the authority will enrol new teachers, efficient in
that arena with the commencement of the new syllabus. What could
help overcome this problem is to arrange a training for those
teachers and prepare them with effective methods. But our general
feature is to begin to fill up preconditions after the
implementation of a system. Such instances are not rare . A
reliable source of the NCTB ( National Curriculum and Textbook
Board) informs that a project named ELTIP (Engilsh Language
Teaching Improvement Project) is in the pipeline to train up
English teachers. And only for delays in foreseeing necessary plans
all-out attempts to teach English well at all levels have failed in
the past. In addition to that a foreign language classroom demands
a limited number of students which should not be more than twenty .
But miserably, in most of our institutions the number is twice or
three times more.
	   If the teacher-student ratio supersedes 1: 60 or more, how come
that the teacher will show his ability to communicate with all the
students ! But a language class, especially when planned to be
conducted in acommunicative way of teaching, necessitate
participatory activity from each and every learner. The proposed
Education Committee Report 1997 recommends English for one hundred
marks from class IX through Xll . Discrepancies observed between
these two - the Curriculum and Syllabus (Higher Secondary level)
Report, 1996 (Published by NCTB in December 1996 and has Education
Committee Report proved correct the above mentioned statements
about our education scenario. Books on English that are going to be
published very shortly according to the stated report will
certainly throw our students in darkness for another term.
	   Shall we never be able to keep our children out of all these
unrealistic experiments and think of creating a beneficial and
delightful environment so that English learning becomes a pleasure
to them and consequently aims and objectives of teaching English
are achieved in real sense?

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri.- Ten non-Governmental organisations will
complement the Government's efforts to make Malaysia a drug-free
nation by the year 2023.
	   These NGOs also pledged to provide all necessary assistance,
including rehabilitation, to help addicts.
	   MCA Youth secretary-general Datuk Ong Tee Keat, who chaired a
two-hour meeting with leaders of the NGOs at the MCA headquarters,
said that two radio stations, Radio 5 and Radio 98.8 (Mandarin),
would also take part.
	   ``We want to convey to the people how some of these addicts
overcome their addiction,'' he said.
	   The NGOs which attended the meeting were House of Victory, Hong
Ying Rehabilitation Centre, Faith Centre, Care Rehabilitation
Centre, New Born Centre, New Creation Home, Disciple House, Morning
Glory, Charis Youth Centre and Ark Rehabilitation Centre.
	   Ong, who is also Dewan Rakyat Deputy Speaker and chairman of the
Government's affairs bureau, said the involvement of the NGOs was
the second phase of the movement's aggressive fight against drug
abuse. The first phase was a nationwide ``roadshow'' informing the
people on the dangers of dadah abuse, which was carried out two
years ago.
	   Ong said the second phase would provide counselling, highlight
how some dadah addicts overcome their problems and how they can
help others.
	   He said the success rate in rehabilitating over 600 dadah
addicts in centres run by the 10 NGOs was about 80 per cent.

U.N. commission agrees convention on basic labor rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Governments, employers and workers at a U.N. labor
meeting have voted for a declaration committing countries to try to
wipe out forced labor and other abuses, the International Labor
Organization said Tuesday.
	   It would mark the first time that the social effects of freeing
up global markets have been formally ``recognized as an issue of
global concern,'' according to International Labor Organization
spokesman Michel Barton.
	   The committee which has been discussing the declaration for the
last two weeks approved it late Monday night. The declaration is
expected to be approved by the full conference of the 174-nation
ILO Thursday.
	   Some remained skeptical of the declaration's merits after what
Barton called a ``very long, lively session.''
	   Governments from Pakistan, Lebanon and Egypt opposed the text
despite its promise to assist ``those members not yet in a position
to ratify all or some (ILO) conventions'' to promote basic rights.
	   The declaration ``stresses that labor standards should not be
used for protectionist trade purposes, and that nothing in this
declaration and its follow-up shall be invoked or otherwise used
for such purposes.''
	   ``It will underline that there are some universal values,''
Barton said.
	   Annual follow-up reports would examine progress in the four main
areas addressed by the convention.
	   Those key points are freedom of association including the right
to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory
labor, ``the effective abolition of child labor, and the
elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and
occupation.''
	   The agreement is seen as reaffirming the credibility of the ILO,
which has been singled out by the United States in its campaign to
reform the United Nations. The United States has argued strongly in
favor of the declaration.
	   The ILO is the oldest U.N. agency stemming from the 1919
creation of the former League of Nations.

	   JAKARTA (JP): National flag carrier Garuda Indonesia's newly
appointed president Robby Djohan announced yesterday a massive
restructuring plan to lift the ailing airline out of its financial
crisis.
	   Robby said he would downsize operations and asked foreign
creditors for a postponement of debt payments to boost efficiency
and reduce the airline's financial burden.
	   ``My priority is to restructure the organization,'' said the
former president of Bank Niaga.
	   The sharp depreciation of the rupiah against theU.S. dollar has
dealt a huge blow to the airline industry, in which about 80
percent of operational costs are in dollars.
	   Robby has yet to decide how many airplanes to shed, but
indicated that 30 might be sufficient in the current sluggish
market conditions.
	   ``What is important is to achieve efficency because we have to
be a market-oriented operation,'' he said.
	   Garuda currently operates 57 aircraft, and is planning to return
six of its leased planes.
	   ``Downsizing the company will be a difficult job,'' Robby said,
but added that there would be no layoffs, stressing that employees
would be transferred to Garuda's subsidiaries and other operations
which have links with the the airlines.
	   He also said that he would negotiate with foreign creditors to
postpone the debt repayment.
	   ``But we're committed to paying our debts,'' he said.
	   Garuda has debts of US$200 million, half of which are due to be
repaid this year.
	   State Minister of the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng said last week that Garuda was in a critical condition,
stressing the need for both management and financial restructuring.
	   In addition to a new president, Garuda also got three new
directors.
	   ``The new management team will try to rebuild the image of
Garuda as a very competitive airline, reliable and safe,'' Robby
said.
	   He said that he would rid the company of corruption and nepotism
including reviewing past contracts which were signed without being
based on business considerations.
	   ``You can't work in an organization branded with corruption and
nepotism,'' he said.
	   After being pressured by its employees, Garuda announced last
week that it would sever links with companies linked to the family
of former president Soeharto.
	   Robby said Garuda could no longer operate as it had in the past,
because the government could not afford to finance a bail out due
to the current economic crisis.
	   ``Garuda must now be managed with its own resources,'' he said,
pointing out that the management would motivate its staff to be
more disciplined.
	   He said that foreign strategic partners which have cash and
technology were welcome to invest in the airline.
	   Former Garuda president Soepandi he was confident that Robby
could turn around the airline from its current troubles.
	   Indonesia's five operating commercial airlines, including
Garuda, announced last week that they plan to combine their
resources and unite their domestic services to survive the
deepening economic crisis.

Snapping turtle on the loose
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Esmeralda may not move fast. But
apparently the 40-centimeter (15.7-inch), 7-kilogram (15.4-pound)
snapping turtle gets around fast enough to evade capture since
escaping a home terrarium last week.
	   It's the turtle's speed at snapping that worries owner Bernd
Buettner said Tuesday. Given the chance, Esmeralda could bite off a
finger in no time.
	   ``A cat or fox doesn't stand a chance against my snapping
turtle,'' he said.
	   No company would insure Esmerelda, and Buettner is offering a
reward of 500-700 marks (dlrs 280-390) to anyone who helps retrieve
the turtle.
	   ``I'll even go higher. I want the animal back,'' he said.

	   JAPANESE share prices closed 0.1 per cent higher yesterday on
bargain hunting and public fund buying following a sharp fall the
previous day, brokers said.
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange rose 8.29 points at 15,022.33 after dropping 2.1 per
cent on Thursday.
	   But the Topix index of all issues on the first section fell 1.56
to 1,177.25.
	   An estimated 820 million shares changed hands against 418.1
million the previous day, with activity boosted by the special
quotation for the close of trading in the June futures.
	   Buying by public funds emerged at around 14,800 points on the
Nikkei 225 index, preventing share prices from falling further.
Bargain-hunting then emerged, with buying centred on export-linked
issues, brokers said.
	   There was sustained buying interest in selected export-dependent
issues.
	   Banks firmed later on position-covering, but the stocks remained
pressured by concerns over the regional impact of the yen's fall,
brokers said.

Culture Minister gives letter over Elgin Marbles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Seeking to increase pressure on Britain to
return a famous section of the ancient Parthenon, Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos asked his British counterpart Tuesday to begin
a dialogue on ways to bring the Elgin Marbles back to Athens.
	   In a letter presented to Britain's ambassador, Sir Michael
Llewellyn Smith, Venizelos invited British Heritage Secretary Chris
Smith to a September meeting of Euro-Mediterranean culture
ministers on the Greek island of Rhodes.
	   The Rhodes meeting presents a chance for Greece to lobby
international support for the return of the 2,500-year-old Elgin
Marbles _ 17 figures and part of a frieze more than 160 meters
(yards) long. The relics have been housed in London's British
Museum since the early 19th century when Lord Elgin _ then
Britain's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire _ removed them.
	   British officials have so far refused to consider returning
them.
	   Venizelos and the ambassador also discussed possible future
sites for the Elgin Marbles. Greece is planning an Acropolis museum
to counter British claims that there is no suitable display site
for the marbles in Athens.
	   Last week, Greeks were in an uproar over the publication of
historian William St. Claire's third edition of ``Lord Elgin and
His Marbles,'' in which St. Claire says that during the cleaning of
the marbles in 1937-38 workers removed paint and chisel marks from
the sculptures mistakenly believing that the real surface lay
underneath. The work left irreparable changes to parts of the
marbles, St. Claire wrote.
	   ``We should not always judge the past with the criteria of the
present. Technology changes, not only in England, but all over the
world,'' said Llewellyn Smith after the meeting.

	   MALACCA, Fri. - The Drainage and Irrigation Department will
ensure that all buildings being built along waterways face the
rivers.
	   This is to protect the waterways from further pollution.
	   There are 98 rivers in Malacca but most of them are badly
polluted. They include certain stretches of Sungai Melaka.
	   DID director Azhari Ghazali said investors, individuals and
companies would be required to design their premises along the
concept where the buildings face the river.
	   ``Those who want to construct buildings near the rivers have to
submit their layout to us,'' he said, adding that the State
Government had agreed in principle the concept be given emphasis in
view of pollution and siltation problems which are getting serious.
	   Azhari added that the State's river management committee, at its
meeting yesterday, also agreed that the concept be promoted. DID is
the secretariat of the committee.
	   Azhari said there was a tendency for people having properties
along the rivers to treat the waterways as dumping grounds.
	   ``We hope with buildings fronting the rivers, this attitude will
change.''
	   He added that river development must be given due attention by
the authorities.

	   BLUE chips on Wall Street suffered their second largest drop
this year on Thursday in the wake of tumbling stock prices around
the globe and concern over the effect of Asia's economic problems.
	   The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips shed 159.93 points (1.78
per cent) to 8,811.76, the biggest drop since January 9, when the
market dropped 222 points (2.85 per cent). At its lowest point on
Thursday, it was down 163 points.
	   Analysts blamed most of the losses on computerised selling.
	   An estimated 607 million shares changed hands. Losers outpaced
gainers by a margin of 2,223 to 810 with 455 issues unchanged.
	   Yields on the bond market fell as traders took refuge there. The
average yield dropped to 5.647 per cent late Thursday down from
5.697 per cent on Wednesday. It dipped as low as 5.641 per cent
during the day.
	   High tech stocks, oil companies and mining issues were among the
losers.
	   The Nasdaq index, where high tech stocks are sold, shed 23.50
points (0.26 per cent) to 1,749.75.
	   Texas Instruments was down 2-7/16 to 49-3/4, Compaq 11/16 to

	   JAKARTA (JP): One hundred years ago this month, Emilio Aguinaldo
y Famy, leader of the Filipino forces fighting for freedom against
the Spanish colonial regime, unfurled what was to become the first
Philippine national flag from the balcony of his residence in
Kawit, Cavite, the Philippines, and declared the country's
independence to the crowd gathered below and to the rest of the
world.
	   The subdued commemoration of this event by the Filipino
community in Jakarta belies a grand fiesta, an extravaganza that
ranges from the sublime to the frivolous, with which this
independence is being celebrated in the Philippines and by Filipino
expatriate communities elsewhere. Nothing has been spared to
project this day as marking ``100 years of freedom''.
	   It does not add up, however, if you consider the time when the
American military authorities banned the display of the Philippine
flag and the more than three years of Japanese occupation. And
there will be those who raise the insistent question: What about
the years under the Marcos dictatorship? No, whatever Filipinos are
celebrating today, it cannot be ``100 years of freedom''.
	   But there was one defining, shining moment 100 years ago when a
revolution erupted in the Philippines and Filipinos declared
independence and formed a republic, ``the first crystallization of
democracy in all the east''. That moment cast a rousing light on
the colonized nations of Asia and, according to historians not
necessarily Filipino, prepared them for their own nationalist
struggles.
	   The revolution had a fascinating cast of characters. There was
Andres Bonifacio, the warehouseman who moonlighted as the organizer
of a secret society, the Katipunan. He was a genius at building a
revolutionary organization but on the battlefield he had two left
feet and in politics he was ill-fated.
	   Then there was Aguinaldo himself, brilliant with his guerrilla
tactics against the Spaniards but politically naive in dealing with
double-dealers like the American admiral, Dewey. There was Gen.
Antonio Luna, whose fiery temper led him to an untimely death, like
that of Bonifacio, at the hands of his compatriots.
	   Gen. Gregorio del Pilar, the boy general who held the Americans
at Tirad Pass the way Leonidas of Sparta held the Persians at
Thermopylae. And then there were the many barefoot revolutionaries
who could barely read or write but could get wonderful military
results with knives and bamboo spears.
	   Above them all towered the figure of Dr. Jose Protacio Rizal,
one of four Asian giants in that era, the others being Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Dr. Sun Yat Sen.
	   Without Rizal there could not have been a Philippine revolution.
The ideology of that revolution might have been elaborated by
Jacinto, the ideologue of the Katipunan, and Mabini, the foreign
minister of the first Philippine Republic, but the ideas and the
emotions that gave it substance and fire came from the crucible of
Rizal's writings, discourses and personal sacrifices.
	   During the American regime in the Philippines, a false image of
Rizal was foisted on the Filipino public: a Rizal who was a sworn
pacifist, who was proreform but against revolution and independence
from Spain. It was, of course, to the interest of the American
authorities that the Filipinos be made docile by giving them as a
national hero a man who absolutely abhorred shedding blood, except
his own. But nothing could be farther from the truth.
	   Today there is abundant evidence of a Rizal who held that if
reforms were not forthcoming from Spain, and he knew they were not,
then he was all for independence and revolution. He was, however,
against a premature irruption of that revolution as he did not want
his countrymen to sit like ducks in the gunsights of the Spanish
civil guards. He wanted a revolution equipped with guns that,
interestingly, could only have been procured from Japan.
	   That his influence reached across the seas to other Asian
nations is evidenced by the fact that leaders of nationalist
movements from Nehru to Sukarno often cited him, sometimes with
charming inaccuracy. A curious fact is that he is the only Filipino
who ever bore the name Jose Rizal, but there must be about a dozen
Jose Rizals in Indonesia; this writer having come across three of
them in Jakarta alone.
	   Today, it is impossible to imagine a Philippines that never had
a Jose Rizal. No Filipino can possibly understand the social
history of his country without reading Rizal's two novels: Noli Me
Tangere and El Filibusterismo. And no foreigner can say that he
knows the Filipinos if he has not read these two books.
	   If Rizal were to come back to life in the Philippines today, he
probably would not be too disappointed with what he sees. In 100
years, despite an eternity of American governors-general and the
two decades gobbled up by the Marcos regime, the Philippines has
had an even dozen presidents, with a 13th to assume office in a few
days.
	   In recent years, the luck of the Filipino has been holding out:
Cory Aquino restored democratic institutions, although she was too
busy surviving coups d'etat to do anything else, Fidel V. Ramos
instituted far-reaching economic reforms that have enabled the
country to cope well enough with the Asian financial crisis.
	   And now, President-elect Joseph Estrada, who once was labeled a
buffoon by business circles for his inability to pronounce the word
globalization, has been doing all the right things and saying all
the right things, as if he has been President all his life. Maybe
the Filipinos have something worth celebrating after all.
	   All because of one brief shining moment in history. It was so
brief. But it shone.
	   The writer, a Filipino, is a former journalist now doing
research on Southeast Asian history.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Tenaganita Sdn Bhd director Irene Fernandez
lost her appeal against a magistrate court's decision to reject her
application to summon Deputy Home Minister Datuk Ong Ka Ting to
produce two documents.
	   Judge Datuk Chin Fook Yen also dismissed Fernandez's motion to
include a certified copy of the Hansard containing Ong's statement
on her allegations of abuse in detention camps.
	   He said he did not wish to hear the appeal nor the motion in
view of the magistrate's ruling.
	   ``Having gone through the papers, I am satisfied that I should
not interfere with the ruling of the lower court that a proper
foundation had to be made before the documents could be produced,''
he said, after hearing submissions from M. Puravalen, for
Fernandez, and Deputy Public Prosecutor Shamsul Sulaiman.
	   The two did not deal with the merits of the appeal or motion
since Chin refused to hear the matter, saying it would delay the
hearing.
	   ``Let the case proper be completed ... maybe at the end of the
day, the accused might be acquitted and if, unfortunately, there is
a conviction, you can raise the matters in the appeal,'' Chin told
Puravalen.
	   When Puravalen said the court must make a ruling, Chin said: ``I
am not making any order.''
	   Fernandez, 50, is charged with maliciously publishing a
memoranduum entitled Abuse, Torture and Dehumanised Treatment of
Migrant Workers at Detention Camps containing 16 false news items.
	   She allegedly committed the offence at Tenaganita's premises in
Lorong Bunus Enam, off Jalan Masjid India here on Aug 25, 1995.
	   Fernandez is charged under section 8A(1) of the Printing Presses
and Publication Act which carries a maximum sentence of three
years' jail or a fine of up to RM20,000 or both.
	   The case is fixed for continuation on Monday.
	   On June 11, 1996, the magistrate's court dimissed her
application to summon Ong to produce post-mortem reports on the
death of migrants in detention camps and extracts from the Hansard
on her allegations of abuse at the camps.

Ukrainian government signs agreement with some striking miners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian government agreed Tuesday to
pay some of the back wages owned to striking miners, dozens of whom
blocked entrances earlier in the day to Cabinet headquarters.
	   The miners banged their helmets and plastic bottles on the
pavement and refused to let government officials into the building
for about one hour. About 100 other miners rallied near President
Leonid Kuchma's headquarters nearby.
	   Many of the miners arrived in Kiev last week after a
500-kilometer (310-mile) protest march from coal-producing areas of
eastern Ukraine. The march accompanied scattered strikes that began
in Ukraine in May and have idled dozens of mines.
	   Miners in Ukraine are owed an average of eight months in back
wages. The overall wage debt stands at 2.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.1
billion), according to the Coal Industry Ministry.
	   Most of the miners protesting in Kiev are from the state-run
Pavlohradugol holding company.
	   The government agreed Tuesday to transfer 47 million hryvna
(dlrs 23.5 million) to the company to pay wages throughout 1988,
and to come up with another 600 million hryvna (dlrs 300 million)
allocated by parliament to support the struggling coal industry.
	   Pavlohradugol strike leader Oleh Zimmer said the miners would
leave Kiev as soon as overdue wages reach their banks, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Although Tuesday's agreement did not cover all unpaid wages and
did not involve the largest union, the Coal Industry Workers'
Union, Coal Industry Minister Serhiy Tulub was optimistic.
	   ``I think common sense will prevail. The protocol signed today
refers to the ways of solving the problems of all miners and not
just Pavlohradugol,'' Tulub said, according to Interfax.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Eleven-year old Nik Mohd Tarmizi from Kota
Baru, Kelantan, had his right leg amputated above the knee five
months ago.
	   He was run over by a car while waiting to cross the road in
front of his house and needs RM9,300 for an artificial leg.
	   One-year-old Wan Nurhidayah from Kuantan, Pahang has never even
had the chance to walk.
	   She was born with a congenital defect, leaving her without a
lower left leg. She needs RM5,800 for an artificial leg.
	   Both families have had a difficult time trying to raise the
funds.
	   Tarmizi's mother Raja Rahmah Raja Hassan, 50, is a widow who
barely scrapes a living by selling sarongs.
	   And compensation from the accident will not be easy to obtain.
	   Although a police report on the accident has been lodged, the
driver has denied fault.
	   Nurhidayah comes from an equally needy family. Her father, Wan
Mohd Malikin, 27, is a lorry driver with an income of RM700 per
month.
	   Her mother, Jamayah Sulaiman, 28, is a housewife. There are two
other children in the family, aged five and three, to support.
	   Both children were at Balai Berita today accompanied by their
families who are appealing to the public for financial aid.
	   In place of Tarmizi's mother, who was unable to travel to Kuala
Lumpur, was his aunt, Tengku Zarina Tengku Iskandar who explained
that Tarmizi had not been attending school since the accident.
	   ``He has been extremely brave throughout these last months and
never complains even though he had to spend a month in hospital.
	   He was so determined to walk again and return to school that he
filled out the application form for the donation appeal himself,''
she said.
	   As for Nurhidayah, her doctor has advised that she be fitted
with an artificial leg as soon as possible because if left too
late, she may never learn to walk.
	   The leg will have to be changed periodically, each time at the
same cost, as she is still growing.
	   Donations for Tarmizi and Nurhidayah can be sent to the
Finance/Donations Department, The New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd,
31, Jalan Riong, 59100 Kuala Lumpur. The names of the recipients
should be written on the back of the cheques.

World Cup: Rufai expected to be on beach, not between posts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELINCOURT-STE. MARGUERITE, France (AP) _ If everything had gone
according to plan, Peter Rufai would be basking in the sun on a
Caribbean beach right now.
	   But the veteran finds himself in a different sort of hot spot
between the posts as Nigeria's World Cup 'keeper, without a lot of
preparation behind him or defense in front of him.
	   ``We will play our normal soccer against Bulgaria,'' Rufai said
Tuesday of the Super Eagles' next opponent. ``Our attacking style
has brought us here and we have to make the other team change, not
us. I'll be ready.''
	   He wasn't ready to be at this World Cup, though.
	   The 34-year-old, who moved from backup to starter for Nigeria at
the 1994 tournament, was called up to the national team less than
three weeks ago, after being out of the picture for about a year.
	   ``I was getting ready to go to the Caribbean on vacation when an
assistant coach called me,'' Rufai said, adding he was in a disco
when his cell phone rang.
	   ``I said, `Who? Me? Where? When?' It was like a shock. But of
course I had to go.''
	   Coach Bora Milutinovic turned to Rufai, whose last match was in
World Cup qualifying last summer, after first choice Ike Shorunmu
broke his right arm in a match with Swiss club FC Zurich on May 8.
	   A week after the call, Rufai was on the field for Nigeria's 5-1
debacle at the Netherlands in a tuneup match. He played the first
half and allowed two goals.
	   Nonetheless, he assumed the starting role. He was shaky against
Spain in Nigeria's Group D opener but helped the team pull off its
stunning 3-2 victory.
	   ``I have been working on my mental and physical concentration,''
Rufai said. ``I already feel a lot better.''
	   Next comes Bulgaria, on Friday at Paris. Rufai, who's played for
clubs in the Western African nation of Benin, Belgium, Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain, was guarding the net when Nigeria beat Bulgaria
3-0 four years ago.
	   ``We just caught them napping,'' said Rufai, who was a reserve
with Deportivo La Coruna in Spain last season. ``They will be
coming at us this time with more determination. They'll have that
feeling of revenge.''
	   Bulgaria drew 0-0 with Paraguay in its France 98 opener.
	   Nigeria held a light practice Tuesday morning, but Milutinovic
acknowledged the real work this week will be done in private
sessions.
	   ``We started to prepare yesterday for the Bulgarian team, behind
closed doors,'' Milutinovic said. ``Today will be more closed-door,
tomorrow closed-door. Not that we try anything secret, but it is
better.''

U.N. commission agrees convention on basic labor rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Governments, employers and workers at a United
Nations labor meeting have voted for a declaration committing
countries to try to wipe out forced labor and other abuses, the
International Labor Organization said Tuesday.
	   It would mark the first time that the social effects of freeing
up global markets have been formally ``recognized as an issue of
global concern,'' according to International Labor Organization
spokesman Michel Barton.
	   The committee, which has been discussing the declaration for the
last two weeks, approved it late Monday night. The declaration is
expected to be approved by the full conference of the 174-nation
ILO on Thursday.
	   Some remained skeptical of the declaration's merits after what
Barton called a ``very long, lively session.''
	   Governments from Pakistan, Lebanon and Egypt opposed the text
despite its promise to assist ``those members not yet in a position
to ratify all or some (ILO) conventions'' to promote basic rights.
	   The declaration ``stresses that labor standards should not be
used for protectionist trade purposes, and that nothing in this
declaration and its follow-up shall be invoked or otherwise used
for such purposes.''
	   ``It will underline that there are some universal values,''
Barton said.
	   Annual follow-up reports would examine progress in the four main
areas addressed by the convention.
	   Those key points are freedom of association including the right
to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory
labor, ``the effective abolition of child labor, and the
elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and
occupation.''
	   The agreement is seen as reaffirming the credibility of the ILO,
which has been singled out by the United States in its campaign to
reform the United Nations. The United States has argued strongly in
favor of the declaration.
	   The ILO is the oldest U.N. agency stemming from the 1919
creation of the former League of Nations.

	   With reference to Donna K Woodward's letter in The Jakarta Post
of Saturday, June 6, 1998, which was intended as a response to the
letter of the public relations head of the Directorate General of
Immigration (M.A. Gani) published on June 3, 1998 in the same
newspaper, we would like to bring the following to your notice:
	   1. Pursuant to the laws prevailing in Indonesia, every complaint
must be accompanied with authentic evidence. In the absence of such
evidence, a complaint will be considered an act of tarnishing
someone's reputation;
	   2. The response given by Mr. M.A. Gani in his capacity as public
relations head of the Directorate General of Immigration is in
keeping with point 1 referred to above;
	   3. To avoid a long-dragging polemic which will not settle any
problem, it is suggested that:
	   a. Evidence, i.e. the victim as a witness, written evidence, the
recipient officer and other information which may explain the
circumstances at the time in question, should be presented
immediately;
	   b. The said evidence should be presented directly to us so that
the examination may soon be followed up.
	   4. As a law-abiding state, the Indonesian government guarantees
that everyone domiciled in Indonesian territory will be entitled to
make a legal attempt against the apparatuses' acts which do not
conform to the prevailing stipulations. In this respect I guarantee
that there will be no retaliation to anybody making this legal
attempt.
	   Thank you for your attention.

German federal prosecutor investigating alleged Turkish terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Federal prosecutors announced Tuesday
that they are investigating an extreme left Turkish group for
suspected terrorist activity in Germany.
	   Prosecutors suspect that leaders of the Revolutionary People's
Liberation Front (DHKP-C) order members to attack and sometimes
kill members of a rival organization and Turks unwilling to
contribute money. They also blame the group for arson attacks
against Turkish businesses in Germany, home to some 2 million
Turks.
	   DHKP-C is one of two opposing groups formed in 1993 when the
Turkish leftist extremist group Devrimci Sol, or Revolutionary
Left, split.
	   The other, Yagan wing or THKP-C-Devrimci Sol, is also under
investigation by state prosecutors in Hamburg. The group was active
and claimed responsibility for attacks in Turkey in the 1970s,
where they are now thought no longer active.
	   An alleged DHKP-C member, identified only as 26-year-old Ali U.,
has been in investigative custody in Dortmund since his arrest May
1, federal prosecutors said in a statement.
	   He is suspected of attempting to blackmail a Turkish bar owner
in the Ruhr river valley area in February and March, demanding half
of his monthly income.
	   He returned to the bar with up to 12 others on April 22, where
the group beat up the owner, his brother and the bar's guests with
baseball bats and handguns, the statement said. The brother was
shot in the knee and had to be hospitalized as did the beaten
owner.
	   Devrimci Sol and its successor DHKP-C claimed responsibility for
numerous terrorist attacks and murders in Turkey, with the aim of
overthrowing the government to replace it with a Marxist regime.
	   The DHKP-C and Kurdish rebels in Turkey have also claimed to
have collaborated on some attacks.

	   THE tacky sculpture in the heart of Marang nearly sent me
scooting back in the direction of KL. The blue-white stone squid
and its underwater cousins were as high as a bus, leaving the
visitor in no doubt about the town's fishing nature.
	   But (big sigh of relief, here) the rest of this treasure is more
subtle.
	   While the tourist cliches are evident - you don't have to look
far for swaying palms and gentle breezes - they are tempered with a
quiet charm that creeps up on you like Marang's awesome sunrises.
	   I had stumbled upon the town located near Kuala Terengganu quite
by chance. It's a long story; suffice to say, I came, I saw and it
conquered.
	   It was off-peak season, so the town was almost devoid of
tourists. We had the roads, hotels and restaurants to ourselves;
even the snorkelling boats and river cruises. But the solitude drew
the real Marang out.
	   Villagers and tour operators had the time to stop and chat.
There was no jostle for space with screaming kids, or tourists
armed with Lonely Planets and backpacks large enough to sink a
boat. Just quiet, pretty Marang.
	   What I loved most about this town was its mornings. That's when
the fishermen return after a night at sea, the pink-orange sunrise
behind them.
	   It was just shy of 7am the day we headed off to the jetty. Not a
soul could be seen.
	   Then the first boat loomed in sight... slowly followed by
another, and another, until that strip of sea was speckled with
vessels. A more romantic setting I could not imagine.
	   Fish-market pandemonium had booted out the quiet by the time the
boats, loaded with fish and squid, lined up at the collection
centre by the jetty. By then, the pinks and vermillions of the
sunrise had made way for bright sunlight.
	   Their work done, some of the fishermen walked home. Others
headed for the warung nearby for nasi dagang with its rich tuna
curry, or nasi lemak.
	   We found ourselves tucking into a hearty warung breakfast too,
relieved that we had not given in to my cheapskate streak and opted
instead for the free bihun goreng and white bread that waited at
the hotel.
	   Surprisingly, the cholesterol orgy didn't knock us out. The
sunrise sojourn had been so exhilarating, we decided to make the
most of the morning. It was river cruise time! River Cruise Rule No
1: Set off early if you want the best view, because the birds and
animals don't like the afternoon heat. We had missed the scheduled
trip that morning, so we paid a little extra for a smaller boat
that would take just us upriver.
	   The boat service is run by Abdul and his wife Zaifa, a
business-savvy couple with big dreams (see accompanying story).
Because there was no guide and we couldn't rely on the mute boatman
to give us a rundown of the sights, Zaifa, a little sleepy because
their boat had run aground after a sotong-fishing trip the previous
night, offered to come along.
	   She's lived in Marang all her life, and has seen monkeys, kites,
otters, birds and iguanas along the river bank in the early
morning. But because we're late, we have to make do with a single
(but I must say, impressively large) iguana, a kingfisher and
languorous jellyfish that looked like they had swum right out of an
underwater horror flick.
	   Gliding on the river with nothing to do except look at birds and
reflections in the water, I felt almost grand. And you know what,
even ugly brick factories manage to look vaguely quaint when you're
cruising.
	   Close to an hour later, we docked at Kampung Jenang for a shot
of culture. If you grew up in a kampung, you'd probably sneer at
the thought of paying to see coconut trees, chickens and cow dung,
but hey, I was so relaxed I was game to play tourist to the hilt.
	   We came across a nenek weaving mengkuang roofs, and later, a
makcik who makes manisan (a gula melaka-like delicacy made from
nira, the juice of the coconut flower). The hut she works in is
cramped, and I marvel at how the rotund lady, who's probably
feasted on quite a bit of her manisan, can stir the vat eight hours
a day in the heat.
	   Her hut aside, the village is cool, protected from the heat that
had Marang town stewing. If it had not been for the stench of the
cow dung that littered the ground, I would have sought a longer
respite at the village.
	   Zaifa's tourist service was also our choice when it came to a
bit of snorkelling. We had come to Terengganu with an island
holiday on either Pulau Redang or Perhentian in mind but after
Marang cast its spell, we settled instead for Pulau Kapas which is
about 45 minutes by boat from the town.
	   This island has the requisite palm trees and bougainvillae, and
is ringed by white sand almost as fine as flour. The jewel in its
crown is the water. It's so clear you could imagine you were in a
swimming pool if not for the fish cavorting about you.
	   I'm terrified of water and can't swim, but I couldn't bear to
think of the ribbing I would get if I didn't snorkel just once. So,
after some practice in a metre of water, we were ready for the real
McCoy.
	   And it was wonderful! Regular divers/snorkellers are probably
sniggering at this gush session, but that underwater symphony I
witnessed was one that deserved much applause, and definitely, an
encore. My fear of water didn't stop me from taking in as much of
the coral and rainbow-hued fish as possible.
	   When I was back on the boat, I thought what a clumsy picture we
tourists in our ugly rubber tyres made, compared with those
stunning water creatures.
	   The trip was over by 3pm, with the sun beating down mercilessly.
But the high from the snorkelling trip wouldn't settle. We went in
search of some batik and drink and ended up at Rhu Rendang, a
village between Kuala Terengganu and Marang.
	   Ramli, the proprietor of the batik factory we traipsed into, had
a wry, sharp humour. The stories he told were as colourful as his
beautiful designs. He gave us a tour of the premises, and lamented
about the high cost of silk and wax, before sending us off with
directions on where villagers were catching geragau or shrimp.
	   There's a makan place by the main road near the factory called 1
Litre.
	   Its speciality is fruit juice, ranging from soursop to nangka to
lychee, served in half or one litre mugs - guaranteed to bowl over
the water- deficient city folk. If you have any room left after
your drink, you can tuck into the nasi dagang, noodles and the
ubiquitous keropok lekor.
	   This place was a good find, but our luck didn't hold. The ikan
bakar at a stall by the beach, further down the road, was smothered
with an unspectacular sauce.
	   Accommodation is abundant in this little town. They range from
tiny, budget-friendly hostels to resorts like the Marang Resorts
and Safaris. On the recommendation of a travel agent, we spent the
first night at the resort. Abdul, the tourist guide, told us it's
the most expensive accommodation in town but it's a wonderful,
nature-friendly outfit that everyone raves about, and rightly so.
	   The concept of building to blend in with the river and the sea
has won it awards. You walk along paraffin lamp-lit paths to your
wooden chalet where there is no television, radio or telephone (I
think this break-from- civilisation move is a gimmick to fool the
Mat Sallehs, but what the heck) and participate in all kinds of
outdoor activities.
	   Our chalet, though a little worn, was on the beach. Close to
midnight, when the waves crept close to the doorstep, we watched
the moon set over the sea from our verandah. The brush of silver
light across the dark blanket of water was amazing. Suddenly, those
schmaltzy songs about moonlight and roses didn't seem so stupid
after all.
	   Earlier, before the sun set, we had managed to fly a bright red
kite that we had bought from some children along the roadside. The
wind was strong, so the kite got a hearty lift.
	   Pleasant though the resort was, we had to settle for a cheaper
alternative for the rest of the stay. The Seri Malaysia, which
charged just RM65 (an off-peak promotional price) with one
breakfast per room, turned out to be great value for money.
	   It was clean, well-equipped (with air-conditioning, hot water,
tea and coffee-making facilities, to name but a few) and pleasant,
if not luxurious or pretty.
	   The hotel is well-located. It fringes a kampung area and just
across the road, there is a small fishing village that makes for a
pretty view at sunrise. Better yet, it is within walking distance
of the jetty which can link you to Pulau Kapas.
	   We said goodbye to Marang on the fourth morning, two days more
than we had planned.
	   If I had to choose one word to describe the place, it would be
molek; a word I heard natives use on everything from striking batik
designs to cute children.
	   A simple word that befits a simple town with simple pleasures.

	   The Chinese in Indonesia have been well served by the policies
of Indonesia's post-Independence governments, which have maintained
a discriminatory, emasculating regulatory scheme that deprives
Chinese-Indonesians of basic civil rights.
	   Now the Chinese live in fear of physical attack from run-amok
masses of pribumi (indigenous Indonesian) looters.
Chinese-Indonesians are a numerically very small ethnic minority in
Indonesia and doubly ``minoritized'' by the fact that they are
generally also adherents of one of the minority religions in a
country which highly values religious unity.
	   But Chinese-Indonesians are different from minority groups in
other countries in a very significant way. Their minority status
and the consequent denial of civil rights and privileges has not
led to economic oppression as it has for minority populations in
virtually every other nation.
	   Usually, political power and economic strength go hand in hand.
For minorities in many places, political power has not been so much
an end in itself as the means to secure the economic opportunities
they have been denied. For Chinese-Indonesians, however, economic
opportunities have not been denied. In fact, while privately
criticizing the system which has denied them civil rights unlike
other oppressed minority groups, Chinese-Indonesians have largely
demurred from taking concerted action in pursuit of political
rights.
	   Indonesia is atypical in that a minority group which has been
denied civil rights has been able to flourish economically, to the
point of holding the major share of the country's wealth. For this
reason, the terms minority and oppression as they are customarily
used, may not be the most helpful language to use in speaking
Indonesia's situation.
	   Chinese-Indonesians are not typical of oppressed minorities. In
many ways the pribumi are more oppressed though by economic
deprivation rather than by the absence of civil rights. Many
pribumi would, I venture to say, gladly trade their right to
government employment, their possession of an uncoded identity
card, their access to state universities for the freedom of
lifestyle that economic privilege can bring. The Chinese-Indonesian
minority might not be as interested in a corresponding trade-off of
economic opportunities for civil rights.
	   The reservoirs of resentment within both ethnic groups are
deepening. As long as individuals are preoccupied with blaming the
other group (''The Indonesians deny us our full rights''/''The
Chinese control all the wealth'') the profounder causes of
oppression and violence remain and are unaddressed.
	   The enemy is not each other. Chinese-Indonesians and the pribumi
need each other. The country needs the capital that the Chinese
have built up, their business expertise and the distribution
networks. Chinese-owned businesses need pribumi manpower and the
pribumi consumer market. If the pribumi are driven to mass violence
by unjustified price inflations and substandard wages, or if the
Chinese are driven away by large-scale violence, everyone suffers.
	   Violence. The person whose shop has been looted and burned, the
rape victim, they are obvious, tragic victims of dramatic violence.
The persons who labor in factories, mills and shrimp farms for
wages so low they cannot support a family in dignity, in a work
environment where there is no regard for workers' health and
safety, these are also victims of violence. So are those whose life
savings were wiped out in bank liquidations resulting from
white-collar crimes of corruption.
	   Who are the oppressed? Who are the victims? The enemy is not
each other. Ordinary Chinese and pribumi are both victims of the
collusive partnership between high-level pribumi officials and
Chinese owners of Indonesia's megabusinesses. These partnerships
and the corruption they spawned have victimized the country without
regard for ethnic identity. This collusive partnership system is
the oppressor. Ordinary middle-class and poor pribumi and Chinese
alike are its victims. Can the two communities now cooperate to
recover from violence and oppression together?

	   PENANG, Fri. - The country requires 2,500 more pharmacists to
meet the needs of the people, said Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society
president John Chang.
	   The ratio of pharmacists to the population was one to 10,000 at
present.
	   ``However, we need at least one to 4,000 to be able to meet the
needs of the people,'' he added.
	   The shortage had been noticeable over the last five to seven
years.
	   There was only one local institution, Universiti Sains Malaysia,
producing pharmacists until three years ago. Then, three more were
set up, at Universiti Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and a
private college.
	   ``The four local institutions produce about 300 pharmacists per
year while about 30-50 pharmacists graduate from institutions
abroad,'' Chang said, adding the country had about 970 pharmacies
and 2,500 pharmacists.
	   ``Moreover, the concentration in urban areas leaves rural and
suburban areas with fewer pharmacists or none at all,'' he added.
	   Chang said pharmacists were responsible for explaining to the
patients the side effects of drugs and help them understand their
health conditions better.
	   ``It is a common phenomenon among Malaysians to stop taking
their medication before the full course ends, including prescribed
medicine, when they experience any kind of changes to their health.
	   ``Thus, the advice of pharmacists will help reduce wastage and
enhance effective drug use,'' he added.
	   The Government could save on treatment costs, during the present
economic crisis, if the public was better educated about drugs.
	   ``However, self-medication should only be for ailments like
cough and colds where the patients can go to the pharmacy for
medicine,'' Chang added.

	   LANGKAWI, Fri. - ``Catch the Commonwealth Games Fever'' - this
is the message from Youth and Sports Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin
Mohd Yassin to all Malaysians.
	   With the World Cup soccer mania coming to an end in about a
month, Muhyiddin expects Malaysians to be gripped with Sukom fever.
	   ``Malaysians should should breathe, sleep, and dream
Commonwealth Games just like they are doing now for the World Cup
tournament in France as this is our show, he said at the official
launch of the Sukom '98 ``Gotong Royong Perdana'' here today.
	   He added the promotional blitz was aimed at generating
excitement among Malaysians irrespective of age or locality.
	   ``To ensure the success of the Games which is being held for the
first time in Asia, the support of the rakyat is crucial.
	   ``We want every Malaysian, from the city and village, old and
young to get the Games fever so that they will want to watch the
prestigious events live in Kuala Lumpur from Sept 11 to 21,'' he
said.
	   Muhyiddin said the extensive preparations would lose its
significance if Malaysians are not keen to play an active role.
	   He also reminded the people not to wait until the last minute to
buy the 1.28 million tickets available.
	   Bookings are now open though purchasing can only be done from
July 1.
	   For the official opening ceremony the tickets are priced between
RM30 and RM450 while the price for the closing event is between
RM45 and RM450.
	   He assured the spectators that all aspects of the transportation
to the venues have been looked into.
	   While Sukom Ninety Eight Sdn Bhd is making the arrangements for
the needs of the 6,000 athletes and officials, a separate committee
chaired by the head of the Road Tranpsort Department is overseeing
the requirements of the spectators.
	   Among the easiest mode of tranpsortation to the main venue of
Bukit Jalil Sports Complex is the Light Rail Transit which will be
fully operational from July 1. It can transport 24,000 passengers
an hour.
	   He advised the public to use the LRT to go to Bukit Jalil to
reduce traffic congestion.
	   Buses will be also be plying routes close to the venues.
	   For those adamant on driving their vehicles, some 15,000 parking
bays will be available near the complex. From there they will be
ferried via shuttle bus for a fee of one ringgit.
	   Some 13,000 taxis from the Klang Valley will also be made
available to meet transportation needs.
	   Muyhiddin said a guide on the transportation facilities
including the buses and routes will be distributed soon.
	   Later in the afternoon, Muhyiddin launched the district-level
Games promotion at Langkawi fair in Kuah.
	   Muyhiddin reminded the residents of the island that they were a
privileged lot as Langkawi would be hosting the Games shooting
competition - the only venue outside of Kuala Lumpur.
	   He urged the locals to attend the events at the Langkawi
International Shooting Range.

	   JAKARTA (JP): If we choose to be lyrical, we may compare
Indonesia to a giant garuda in a glass cage. Upon seeing the bounty
of freedom before it, it flaps its wings and tries to soar toward
it, only to bump its head on the diaphanous prison that contains it
and plunge back to earth.
	   What is this invisible barrier that bars its way? Soeharto's
regime has crumbled and the new president stands resplendent in his
star-spangled batik in front of a backdrop that appears to have
been painted by a frenzied, colorblind child and talks animatedly
of change.
	   He explains at considerable length the way forward, this
ebullient style lending sparkle to his carefully chosen words, but
like throwing a vitamin tablet in a glass of stagnant water, his
words effervesce momentarily and then revert to the murky substance
of old. Perhaps this is cynical, and unfair to a clearly
intelligent man in a very difficult position.
	   He wants so much to inject life into the empty shell that
Indonesia's political and economic system has become, he wants to
announce to the world that Indonesia is moving forward and that the
negative perceptions disseminated so widely by the world's media
are a thing of the past. He wants to engender synergy among
Indonesia's diverse population, a creative cooperation that will
build a new country equipped to take full advantage of its huge
natural resources.
	   So he is expounding on solution to very real problems, but he is
having to walk a tightrope in order to do so, for these are
problems that were to a large extent caused by the government of
which he was a part. And, indeed he still is a part, because the
structure of power has not changed enough for us to truly say that
Indonesia is under new leadership.
	   It is true that recent events have created an atmosphere of far
greater transparency and openness, a more critical environment that
has the potential to be constructive.
	   Constructive criticism, however, is not what we have seen up to
this point. We are still in the phase where many citizens believe
the old system must be destroyed to facilitate reform. We have
witnessed that destruction; the wanton demolition and burning of
property, the senseless harassment of non-pribumi (nonindigenous)
residents, the looting and rioting which has added billions to
Indonesia's considerable debt burden.
	   The burned out shells of buildings are the visible side of
destruction, but on a more subtle level, we have seen the peaceful
demonstrations which call for resignations, for investigations, for
probes into irregularities without offering concrete alternatives
to the system that they seek to bring down.
	   Obviously those who are demonstrating feel passionately about
their cause, but there is a marked tendency to focus on the evils
that reform can dispel as opposed to the fruits that it can bring.
	   So is this really reform? Without wishing to indulge in a
discussion of semantics, no definition of reform that I know of
includes the word destruction. If we seek to define reform, we may
come across the word improvement and alteration, both of which
suggest change as opposed to eradication.
	   It is like working with clay at a potter's wheel; if one forms a
pot that is not sufficiently pleasing either in shape or in
function, one can reshape it. We do not need to change the clay in
order to do so, but we do require the skill to be able to work it
into an appropriate design. And what about the old pot?
	   Some may rue its loss; they may have liked its shape if not its
function. There are Indonesians who are vocal in their criticism of
the functional aspects of government and the bureaucratic obstacles
that it creates, but when asked to change their lifestyles in
accordance with the remolding of these systems they will be
unwilling to comply.
	   If this is the case, will the current trend for reform go the
same way as the closed-door policy on the mikrolet public transport
vehicles?
	   If we cast our minds back, we will recall that this initiative
to improve the safety of public transportation was a novelty for a
few weeks. It was idealistically sound but the people did not
genuinely support it so it was phased out, forgotten about and
became just another relic in the wasteland of an undisciplined
society.
	   Resistance to change is commonplace and this is the glass cage
in which garuda must find a door. The key to the door is a truly
visionary leader, a man or woman with the ability to envisage the
benefits of change and communicate them with great potency to every
strata of society.
	   This does not mean indoctrination; that is a repressive road
that has already been traveled and has bred suspicion rather than
trust. What is required is a systematic process of reeducation and
this has to start at the top echelons of society, those who often
believe they have nothing left to learn, and then cascade through
every level of society in an undiluted, innovative and convincing
form.
	   Any fundamental changes in the structure of government and
leadership philosophy will bring about hardship, particularly when
the economy is already ailing. A new leader must have the courage
to ask the population to go hungry today in order that they may eat
well tomorrow.
	   Recent reports have shown that this has become more than a
metaphor, there are shortages which must be addressed, distribution
systems which must be restructured and a population which must be
girded against its biggest fear -- hunger.
	   The people must choose whether to work with a leadership that
seeks to implement measures to combat these problems, or to fight
against it. It is easy to be shortsighted when one is staring
hunger in the face, but the looters and the rioters have shown us
the costs of this fear. Their savagery has bitten off the hands
that feed them and this is now beginning to rebound, not only on
them, but also on millions of other decent people.
	   There is no leadership that can produce some magic balm to
instantaneously solve these problems, but the solutions can be
accelerated if the Indonesian people can minimize their resistance
to the changes necessary to restore confidence in their economy.
	   So as we approach a general election, will the Indonesian people
be blinded by their vengeance against an old system that they
tacitly supported, or will they seek out and place their trust in a
new leader who promotes change?
	   More importantly, can they truly commit themselves to values
that define the path of change, or will they allow the flower of
reform to be strangled by the weeds of their own intransigence?
	   The writer is a freelance training consultant.
	   Window: Constructive criticism, however, is not what we have
seen up to this point. We are still in the phase where many
citizens believe the old system must be destroyed to facilitate
reform.

Nigeria waits for word on prisoners ordered freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerians were waiting Tuesday for word on
the release of nine well-known political prisoners ordered freed
the day before.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigeria's new military ruler, on
Monday ordered the prisoners _ including the country's former
president Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo _ to be immediately released.
	   However none were known to be free by Tuesday afternoon and
their status was not completely clear as the eight men and one
woman were being held in prisons spread across the sprawling West
African country.
	   ``I haven't heard yet that he's been freed,'' said Nike
Ransome-Kuti, whose activist father, Beko, was among the nine
people ordered freed.
	   Mohammed Jarma, the controller of the Nigeria Prisons Service,
told The Guardian newspaper Monday evening that he had yet to
receive the order to free them.
	   He added, though, that once the order comes through, ``they will
not stay a second longer than necessary.''
	   Abubakar, ``ordered the immediate release of some detainees and
prisoners to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and
reconstruction,'' his press secretary, David Atta, said, announcing
the order.
	   The most prominent of the nine prisoners is Obasanjo, 62,
Nigeria's head of state from 1976-1979. Obasanjo, who was sentenced
to 15 years for treason in 1995 after an alleged coup attempt, had
voluntarily relinquished the presidency after an election and
became a formidable critic of Nigeria's former dictator, Gen. Sani
Abacha.
	   The other prisoners include labor leaders, opposition activists,
journalists and other Abacha foes.
	   Abacha died last week of a heart attack.

	   ZAIFA was discreetly taking 40 winks near the edge of our boat.
It was probably her first shuteye in more than 20 hours; the boat
which she and husband Abdul own had run into a sandbank the
previous night and she had refused to go home until the boat was
free.
	   We were cruising down the Marang river that humid morning.
Zaifa, who runs a tourist business with Abdul, came along to show
us the sights because we had missed the scheduled tour.
	   I had only met her the day before when she sold us tickets for
our snorkelling trip. But already, I could sense that she wasn't
the makcik- type content with just raising kids and cooking up a
mean rendang. No, she was that and more.
	   Zaifa has been by her husband's side, building up their business
from little more than a one-boat show. Before that, they had a
dressmaking business which was supplemented by a contract to supply
groceries to a hostel.
	   The little covered boat we were on was their first, bought for
RM9,500 in 1990 and refurbished for another RM5,000. She has
refused to sell it since and zealously keeps the white vessel in
good working condition.
	   ``It was Marang's first-ever tourist boat,'' she says.
	   Tourism in Marang, which is the gateway to beautiful Pulau
Kapas, started about 20 years ago. At that time, just four boats
plied the area, Zaifa says. Today, there are more than 20 boat
operators.
	   Zaifa and Abdul, who also have a larger 12-seater, operate trips
to Pulau Kapas, Redang and Tenggol island. You want to snorkel,
fish, catch sotong, go kayaking, trek in the jungle or camp? No
problem, this resourceful couple can arrange it.
	   They are now saving to buy a RM50,000 speedboat so they can
expand the business, Zaifa says.
	   Zaifa had been very generous with information before fatigue
claimed her. In between a commentary on the sights, she related the
milestones in her life.
	   She spoke in a firm, direct manner, befitting a woman who is
obviously in charge of her life.
	   ``It was difficult when we started. I had the children with me
at work but the Mat Salleh (Western) tourists were kind, helping me
carry or take them by the hand when we were around the boats.''
	   She's taught her brood of seven to be self-sufficient (''the
older ones take care of the little ones, because I have to work'',
she insists). When the boat business is a little slow (tourist
season is between March and September), she and Abdul take on
contracts to build small roads and bridges or erect signboards.
	   Zaifa, who has lived in Marang all her life, spent only three
years in a religious school. But she attended financial classes
while running her tailor shop so she would know how to operate a
business. The result: Theirs was the first boat business to issue
tickets in Marang. Her boatmen get EPF and Socso benefits. It's
only right, she says.
	   And she doesn't need a fancy business school to tell her how
important the customer is.
	   ``Pelanggan itu raja (The customer is king),'' Zaifa stresses.
	   I can vouch that she practises what she preaches. Abdul Tourist
Boat Services offers an efficient and pleasant service. And I'm
certain that when I return to Marang for a holiday, a gleaming new
speedboat bearing their name would be moored at the jetty.
	   Abdul Tourist Boat Services can be reached at Tel: 09-6182513 or
6182091 or 010-9844513.

	   With the dawn of Indonesia's current era of genuine openness,
many politicians are acting as if they have heard a divine voice
telling them to go forth and beget new mediums of political
expression.
	   Many have been invigorated by the fact that the country has
thrown away the yokes of authoritarianism seen through three
decades of president Soeharto's despotic rule. There is a sense of
relief after a long pain.
	   The creation of a slew of new political parties has also been
spurred by the belief that the country's currently recognized
political groups -- the dominant Golkar grouping, the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
-- have lost their legitimacy since their existence came about ``By
the Appointment of His Majesty''.
	   Elements of society that felt underrepresented during the
Soeharto regime are now asserting their voices. To date, the
formation of more than 30 new political parties has been announced.
What has alarmed us is that some of these parties are narrowly
sectarian in nature.
	   Such new parties include the Indonesian-Chinese Reform Party
(Parti) and Partai Syarikat Islam Indonesia (PSII), which was a
small Moslem party merged into PPP in 1971. Activists of Nahdlatul
Ulama, the country's largest Moslem organization, are also
considering the creation of a political party much like the one the
organization had before PPP emerged.
	   In line with the new fad, some politicians have argued that
Moslems, the majority religion of this nation, deserve their own
political party. They say Moslem interests were marginalized by the
Soeharto regime and that they should not fall victim once again in
the current tide of change. Moderate Moslem leaders, however,
reject the idea.
	   There is nothing wrong with certain elements of society wishing
to voice their views in the political arena, but the establishment
of sectarian parties would be a throwback to the politically
turbulent 1950s. It might be best for Chinese-Indonesians to set up
an open and modern party or join other nonsectarian parties in
order to ease ethnic tensions. Even the 1950s did not give birth to
a political party working by racial fiat.
	   Moslem leaders, representing the country's majority group, are
challenged to establish the best concepts for the nation's welfare.
We believe they should be free to set up a political entity, or
entities, as long as they are open to other religious groups. But
Moslems also have enough space outside the political domain to
struggle for their beliefs, such as the principle of amar ma'ruf
nahy munkar (to enjoin the doing of what is right and forbid what
is wrong and evil).
	   After witnessing the failures of the 1950s, we tend to think
that the new trend in political parties based on ethnic or
religious principles is a repeat of old and counterproductive ways.
Returning to this path looks to be a retrogressive move.
	   Sectarian political parties are seldom viable because their
agendas are usually limited to a religious or racial fanaticism.
	   The House of Representatives, which will soon revamp the
country's political laws, should take into consideration what
Indonesia needs today: open and viable political parties that are
free from sectarian interests and able to develop new ideas and
programs to face the tough years ahead.
	   These parties should be strongly independent and have the
capability to serve as a check and balance in our renewed political
system.

	   GIRLS, it's about time you stopped seeing red. Red nail polish
is passe.
	   Anything brighter than red may shock some of you, but in keeping
with the latest trends, women everywhere are taking glamour to
colourful new extremes with fingertips dipped in a myriad of hues -
even acid green! And you can blame it all on Vamp, the sexy,
mysterious tone that started it. Vamp, a shade of darkening bruise
that is closer to black than blood, was first sighted on the Chanel
runway in March 1994. It was specially created by make-up experts
for Karl Lagerfeld, the designer for the Parisian fashion house.
	   Later, everyone, from club kids to the tennis-bracelet set, just
had to have it to lend their manicure a modern edge.
	   Even the brand's competitors spawned their own versions and
Chanel concocted two new variations, Very Vamp and Metallic Vamp,
for Vamp addicts. Now, cutex colours have expanded into a whole new
colour category and it makes perfect sense to have irreverent nails
in a colour-clashing fashion season.
	   Buff and beige do not apply any more. Thumbs up for true colours
like peacock blue, grass green, sunny yellow, bold gold, orange,
white, black, navy, grey, lilac, silver and many more.
	   To add on to these cool colours, the future of nail polish is
clear - at Maybelline. This American cosmetics label recently
introduced Express Finish Waterpaints - the newest way to wear your
nails.
	   It's a transparent wash of colour that gives a wet, liquid tint
in seven shades that include blue, plum, orange, lemon, berry,
emerald and violet.
	   Time to make a splash on those tips and paint the town,
er,...red.

Milosevic agrees to negotiate with moderate Kosovo Albanian leader

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
Tuesday to resume negotiations with a moderate Kosovo Albanian
leader, and insisted his decision had nothing to do with NATO
exercises in the Balkans.
	   Milosevic said he would meet with Ibrahim Rugova, a political
leader of Kosovo's Albanians, and not with the Kosovo Liberation
Army, the main militant group fighting to sever the southern Serb
province from Yugoslavia.
	   ``I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists,''
Milosevic told reporters after meeting with Russian officials for
several hours.
	   Milosevic and Rugova met in May, but the Albanians canceled
further talks until Serb government troops halted a reported
offensive in western Kosovo.
	   Rugova has lately been losing support to the more militant
separatists in the troubled province, whose uprising Milosevic has
tried to crush.
	   Milosevic met Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin on
Tuesday morning, kicking off a series of negotiations that
continued through most of the day.
	   ``It's necessary that the whole world see what we agreed to, so
that there should be no steps back,'' Yeltsin said. Grim-faced,
Yeltsin told reporters that the negotiations were ``not simple.''
	   After their one-on-one meeting, Yeltsin and Milosevic were
joined by top Russian officials including Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
	   In a joint statement issued after the talks, Yeltsin and
Milosevic also agreed that Yugoslavia would:
	   _ carry out no ``repressive actions against civilians.''
	   _ guarantee ``complete freedom of movement on the territory of
Kosovo,'' ``unlimited access to humanitarian aid,'' ``unrestricted
return for all refugees'' and ``no restrictions on the work of
international monitors who are accredited in Yugoslavia.''
	   _ reduce the presence of security forces outside their permanent
bases, but only ``as terrorist activities stop.''
	   In Washington, the White House reacted coolly.
	   ``We are aware of the reports about the meeting and we want to
learn more,'' said presidential spokesman Mike McCurry.
	   Russia has a recent history, demonstrated earlier this year in
Iraq, of announcing agreements that ultimately fall through. And
there are inherent dangers in the agreement with Milosevic.
	   Both Milosevic and Rugova are losing support among their people.
	   Even Rugova's most senior aide, Fehmi Agani, admitted last week
that contacts with the Kosovo Liberation Army were essential for
meaningful negotiation.
	   Russia joined with the United States and six other countries on
Friday in insisting that Milosevic withdraw forces from Kosovo,
agree to a cease-fire, permit effective monitoring of the situation
and permit refugees to return. But it did not join in sanctions,
and has repeatedly demanded that NATO refrain from military
intervention.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic that the alliance could react quickly.
	   In a rare news conference after the talks, Milosevic maintained
a defiant attitude toward the alliance, saying his decision to
negotiate was based solely on a desire to find a peaceful solution
to the conflict.
	   ``I see no connection here to the NATO exercises,'' he said.
	   He also said he saw no need to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo,
and denied that Serb forces had committed war crimes or killed any
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. About 65,000
people have been forced to leave their homes.
	   Rugova has sought a peaceful solution to the crisis, although
his goal _ independence for Kosovo _ remains the same as that of
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Russia is in an odd position in the crisis, given its uneasy
relations with NATO. Russia strongly opposed NATO's eastward
expansion last year, and is openly worried about seeing NATO forces
close to its western frontier.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background. But Yeltsin has found
it impossible to support Milosevic's extreme nationalism and
violent campaigns, and only disagrees with NATO about how _ not
whether _ he should be stopped.

Jury deliberates fate of suspects in slain politician trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRAGUIGNAN, France (AP) _ After a six-week trial, a jury on
Tuesday was deciding the fate of the triggerman and six other
suspects in the 1994 slaying of a lawmaker who campaigned against
corruption on the French Riviera.
	   Yann Piat was shot three times on Feb. 25, 1994 as her chauffeur
drove her home in Mont des Oiseaux near the port city of Toulon.
	   Although local officials have been implicated in the case and
called to testify, no charges have been brought against them,
prompting criticism from the defense that the bigger fish in the
case got away.
	   During the trial, Lucien Ferri, 25, admitted to firing six
bullets from the back of a motorbike driven by 24-year-old Marco Di
Caro.
	   The other five men on trial are Gerard Finale, a 53-year-old
barman and alleged mastermind of the attack, and four alleged
accomplices.
	   But Jacques Verges, Finale's lawyer, said last week that local
officials ``had got through the net.''
	   Saying the crime had political and financial implications, he
said Piat ``had trodden on a serpent's tail. But whereas she died,
the serpent is still alive.''
	   Ferri expressed remorse for the killing Tuesday but refused to
identify who had ordered the killing, saying he feared for the
safety of his family.
	   ``I wanted to tell the state prosecutor that he has left the
wolves outside,'' he said.
	   The prosecution has requested a life sentence for Ferri and
Finale, and 20 years for Di Caro. The verdicts are expected later
Tuesday.
	   Di Caro, the driver, said Tuesday that ``an entire lifetime will
not be sufficient to express my regrets.''
	   As well as citing ``a culture of corruption,'' Piat probably
made enemies by switching from the far-right National Front to the
conservative Republican Party.
	   Her murder is the subject of two controversial books whose
authors have lost lawsuits this year.
	   One court ordered the authors and publisher of ``Yann Piat,
Assassins at the Heart of Power'' to pay about one million francs
(dlrs 167,000) for slandering former French Defense Minister
Francois Leotard and Marseille Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin, and remove
passages.
	   The book alleged Piat was killed because she was about to
disclose a plan to sell military land in southern France to the
mafia, and implicated both officials in the murder.
	   A court also ordered passages removed from ``Yann Piat, The
Secret Story of an Assassination'' since the book made public
details of the investigation.
	   In a 1992, letter, Piat said that ``in case of a fatal
accident,'' it would be opportune to question Maurice Arreckx,
former mayor of Toulon and president of the local General Council
until 1994.
	   Arreckx, 80, who testified in the case, is in jail while under
investigation for alleged embezzlement.

German coach Low signs with Fenerbahce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Joachim Low, former coach of German club
Stuttgart, signed with Istanbul's Fenerbahce on Tuesday, the
Anatolia news agency said.
	   The club did not say how much Low will be paid for a one-year
term.
	   Before Low, Fenerbahce was considering Carlo Ancelotti, former
coach of Italian club AC Parma. But Ancelotti reportedly refused a
dlrs 2 million offer for a two-year term.
	   Fenerbahce, which also signed up Bosnian striker Elvir Balic for
dlrs 3 million for a two-year contract in May, is hoping the new
arrivals will boost its results next season.
	   ``I know the measurement of Fenerbahce for success is the league
championship, but this does not scare me off,'' the agency quoted
Low as saying during the signing ceremony. ``I came here to be
successful.''
	   Fenerbahce finished second in the first division league
championship last season, under Croatian coach Otto Baric, while
the arch-rival Istanbul team Galatasaray won the title.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The rupiah sank 5 percent yesterday to close at
14,700 against the U.S. dollar as the Japanese yen touched its
lowest level since August 1990.
	   The stock market, battered by sinking turnover, slid 0.46
percent despite gains in dollar-valued stocks which were buoyant on
the rupiah's fall.
	   Stock analysts said that prevailing uncertainties about domestic
political and economic stability were also dragging the market
down.
	   ``It is so difficult to expect the market to recover in the near
future as everyone is in crisis now,'' Harita Kencana Securities
president Christina Lim said.
	   She added the market could well sag further because confidence
was absent in a time of crisis and the market still feared that
mass rioting could recur at any time in the future.
	   ``The market could go down further as there is nothing to look
forward to in the near future. People are still scared to invest
here. Even today, we heard people were rioting somewhere,'' she
said.
	   It was reported that hundreds of people continued rioting in the
town of Tegal in Central Java yesterday, damaging several homes,
offices and shops.
	   Currency dealers said the combination of domestic political and
economic uncertainty and a weak yen hit the rupiah, which was
already suffering from market illiquidity.
	   ``The yen which fell below 146 to the dollar today (yesterday)
was the main culprit behind the fall of the rupiah,'' a dealer with
a local private foreign bank said.
	   The rupiah hit 15,000 yesterday afternoon before closing at
14,700. It had closed at 14,000 on Friday.
	   The dealer added that demand for dollars remained high,
especially from local commercial banks as Bank Indonesia extended
the deadline for them to settle outstanding arrears in their
interbank and trade finance debt to June 30.
	   ``So, we can expect that the rupiah will not recover until June
30 as demand for dollars will remain,'' he said.
	   He added the sharp fall in the rupiah was aggravated by the very
thin trades, with the largest trade amounting to only about one
million dollars.
	   In the money market, dealers said the central bank set rupiah
interbank interest rates at 51 percent per annum for this week,
down from 53 percent last week.
	   ``We can expect that the central bank is actually moving toward
lowering interest rates. We should welcome this move. But the
problem is that the IMF might not be happy with that kind of
move,'' Manaek Robert Toruan, the head of Bank Niaga's fixed income
desk, said.
	   The International Monetary Fund has said that the government
should maintain tight money policy to prevent inflation from
soaring further.
	   On the stock market, share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
(JSX) lost 0.4 percent, with the JSX Composit Index closing 1.871
points lower at 406.501.
	   Total turnover on the JSX was a meager US$18 million yesterday
after averaging only $17 million a day last week.
	   Stockbrokers said a heavier fall in the index was prevented by
gains in stocks with dollar valuations, like telecommunications
stocks Telkom and Indosat and tin miner Tambang Timah, as the
rupiah sagged to near 15,000.
	   ``If you take Telkom and Indosat out of the market, the market
was actually a lot more depressed than you might think,'' an
analyst with a joint venture securities house said.

EU wants to be more people-friendly, but stuck in reform drive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with summit over; new comments
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders ended a summit
Tuesday with a pledge to ``bring the EU closer to the people'' and
a concession that talks about a key part of their reform drive _
overhauling the union's finances _ have stalled.
	   The leaders said they will make the EU more relevant to
Europeans, who will soon have a single currency but are said to
feel detached from the people who run the body.
	   But their two-day summit was dominated by persistent
disagreements over the EU's future funding.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden _ which pay more
into the union than they get back _ insisted membership fees must
be calculated differently for the sake of fairer burden-sharing.
But the other 11 governments fear any budget tinkering will end up
costing them dearly in agricultural and other funding.
	   ``This was a summit at which we agreed to disagree,'' Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok said.
	   Negotiations about a new financing formula began almost a year
ago and have made no headway. The leaders agreed here to come to a
deal by the spring of next year.
	   Financial reform is close to the heart of German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who faces Sept. 27 general elections.
	   Germany, the EU's biggest economy, pays 29 percent of the EU's
annual budget of around dlrs 85 billion. It pays dlrs 11.9 billion
more than it gets back and wants that reduced by a third.
	   Kohl told reporters after the summit, ``This is not a
declaration a war. We seek fair treatment. Nothing more, nothing
less.''
	   The leaders ordered the EU executive Commission to prepare a
report on a new financing formula.
	   The money squabble is part of a larger debate on how to revamp
EU finances and institutions before Cyprus and 10 East European
newcomers are admitted to the club in the years ahead.
	   That requires reallocating funds, with northern EU nations keen
on austerity and southern members fearing money for them will be
diverted to poorer newcomers from East Europe.
	   To make the EU more meaningful to the European-in-the-street,
the leaders said they will meet again at a special summit in
October in Vienna, after Austria has taken over the EU presidency
from Britain.
	   Officials said the aim here was to discuss how the union can
become more people-friendly, and also not take the place of
national, regional and local governments.
	   ``There is a need to bring the EU closer to the people and to
focus it on the issues that matter most to the European citizens,''
they said in a statement.
	   Kohl and Chirac have complained the EU commission issues too
many directives. Some, they say, are better left to other
organizations, such as a recent edict on animal welfare conditions
in zoos.
	   At their summit, the leaders committed to low deficits and job
creation, through tax breaks for employers, state-subsidized
training programs and changing welfare regulations to make taking
low-paid jobs more attractive than welfare.
	   They also hosted a farewell luncheon for South African President
Nelson Mandela, who is leaving office next year.

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) suspended trading
activities yesterday in property company PT Putra Surya Perkasa
(PSP) for failing to submit its 1997 financial reports and to pay a
Rp 10 million (US$680) fine.
	   The JSX, however, is still allowing the trading of 18 other
listed companies even though they have yet to submit their year-end
financial reports.
	   JSX president Cyrill D Noerhadi said the 18 companies had yet to
be suspended because they had paid the Rp 10 million fine.
	   He said they too would be suspended if they did not submit their
year-end reports by the end of the month.
	   ``If they do not submit their financial reports by June 30, we
will have to suspend their trading activities on July 1,'' he told
The Jakarta Post yesterday.
	   The 18 firms at risk of suspension are PT Argo Pantes, PT
Alumindo Perkasa, PT Anwar Sierad, PT Aster Dharma Industry, PT
Bank PDFCI, Bank Tiara Asia, Bank Umum Nasional (BUN), Bayu Buana,
Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia (BDNI), BDNI Capital Corp, PT
Kawasan Industri Jababeka, PT Miwon Indonesia, Modern Bank, PT
Pancawiratama Sakti, PT Putra Sejahtera Pioneerindo, PT Putra Surya
Multidana, PT Sierad Produce and PT Steady Safe.
	   Publicly listed companies are required to submit year-end
financial reports within four months of the end of their financial
year.
	   At least 40 companies missed the deadline and were fined Rp 10
million each.
	   The JSX management had extended the deadline until June 12 to
submit the financial reports and to pay the fine.

	   ANOTHER package of measures to increase jobs will be unveiled
next month as the jobless rate hit a 15-year high of 4.2 per cent
during the three-month period ending May.
	   The seasonally adjusted underemployment also climbed to a
15-year high of 2.6 per cent last month.
	   Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph Wong Wing-ping
warned of a further rise in unemployment and said that there was no
quick-fix to the rising jobless rate, which depended on a recovery
in the sagging economy.
	   ``The present unemployment problem arises from an economic
adjustment which Hong Kong is undergoing,'' he said.
	   Mr Wong said the government would be consulting various sectors,
including welfare groups and trade unions, over the next few days
before drafting new proposals to ease unemployment.
	   The proposals will be put forward to the task force on
employment headed by Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen
when it meets for the second time on 9 July.
	   During its first meeting on 3 June, the task force approved a
12-point package to generate 100,000 jobs over the next 18 months.
	   Government economist Elley Mao Yee-lai said the increase in
unemployment occurred mainly in the retail, restaurants and
transport sectors.
	   For the underemployment rate, the increase was concentrated in
the construction, manufacturing and transport sectors.
	   The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in April was 3.9 per
cent while underemployment was 2.2 per cent.
	   Unemployment for May was the highest since June 1983 when it
reached 4.4 per cent while the underemployment of 2.6 per cent was
last recorded in February 1983.
	   The number of job seekers who registered with the Labour
Department also rose last month to 23,533 from 16,843 in April.
	   Chief economist of the General Chamber of Commerce Ian Perkin
said he was not surprised with the rise in unemployment because of
the weak economy. He predicted that unemployment for June could
reach between 4.4 and 4.5 per cent.
	   Mr Perkin said he expected unemployment would continue to rise
until the last quarter.
	   Francis Lui Ting-ming, a task force member and head of the
centre for economic development at the University of Science and
Technology predicted unemployment would reach between 4.5 and five
per cent in June because of the entry of fresh graduates into the
labour market.

Yeltsin's envoy heads for Baghdad to discuss U.N. inspections,
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin sent an envoy to Iraq to
discuss ending United Nations sanctions and boosting economic ties,
the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Viktor Posuvalyuk, who left for Baghdad on Monday, was expected
to discuss Iraq's progress in destroying its weapons of mass
destruction _ the condition set down by the U.N. Security Council
for lifting the sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, said Monday
that his inspectors can finish their job in two months provided
Iraq fully cooperates.
	   ``Russia welcomes the businesslike and constructive approach
shown by both the U.N. special commission and Iraq,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said at a briefing
Tuesday.
	   Russia has pushed to have the sanctions lifted, and is among the
countries that would benefit most.
	   Russia signed a dlrs 10 billion agreement in 1996 to revitalize
Iraq's oil industry once the sanctions are lifted. The deal calls
for Iraq to start repaying its dlrs 7 billion debt to Moscow for
weapons purchases in the 1980s.
	   Russia has also taken advantage of Iraq's oil-for-food program,
an exception to the sanctions allowing Baghdad to sell oil to buy
food and humanitarian supplies to soften the impact on ordinary
Iraqis.
	   Russian oil companies have already signed contracts for the
next, expanded, stage of the oil-for-food program and Posuvalyuk
was expected to discuss that and other bilateral issues during his
trip, Rakhmanin said.
	   The weekly Iraqi magazine Al-Ittihad said Posuvalyuk would
deliver a message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein ``related to Russia's clear stand in backing
Iraq's position to have the unfair economic embargo lifted.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The 114-Megawatt (MW) hydropower plant in Kota
Panjang, Riau owned by state electricity firm PT PLN is to begin
operating fully in October, the company said yesterday.
	   The head of PLN's West Sumatra and Riau office for power
generation and transmission, Iswardi Yahya, said the plant had
three turbines but only two of the three generating units had come
on stream, to generate 76 MW of power.
	   ``The third unit is scheduled to begin operating in October this
year,'' he was quoted by Antara as saying in Bukittinggi, West
Sumatra.
	   Iswardi also said PLN's 175-MW hydropower plant in Singkarak,
West Sumatra, would become fully operational in August this year.
	   This plant has four turbines but only one has already come on
stream, to generate 43.75 MW of power. Two more turbines are to
start operating next month, and the fourth in August.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Hong Kong-based hotel chain Century International
Hotels will manage three more hotels in Indonesia, the hotel chain
announced yesterday.
	   Two of the three hotels, which are all owned by PT Usaha
Pariwisata Sukses, are located in Bali -- Hotel Bali Saphir in Kuta
and Hotel Mabisa in Legian -- while the other one is Hotel Yogya
International located in Yogyakarta.
	   Century's chief executive officer Brian Deeson said the names of
the hotels had been changed to Century Saphir Bali, Century Mabisa
Inn Bali and Century Saphir Yogyakarta.
	   Deeson told Antara news agency that though times were tough in
Indonesia, Century International took on the challenge because it
was confident that there would be an upturn in the country's
economy in the near future.
	   The move brings Century's hotels in Indonesia to a total of six,
with two more under development.
	   Century International currently manages three other hotels in
Indonesia, including Hotel Atlet Century Park and Imperial Century
Resort, both in Jakarta, and Hotel Century Menado in North
Sulawesi.
	   The group manages 27 hotels in seven Asian countries under its
corporate umbrella.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aiming to head off new soccer riots during the
World Cup, French authorities expelled or imprisoned English
hooligans Tuesday, rounded up Scottish fans in Bordeaux and braced
for an English match in Toulouse.
	   The crackdown came while authorities in Marseille faced
criticism they bungled efforts to control the three nights and two
days of violence by hundreds of drunken English fans and local
youths that left more than 50 injured.
	   ``It was predictable,'' the tabloid daily France-Soir headlined,
with a picture of English hooligans throwing beer cans. It called
police efforts ``a failure of prevention.''
	   ``Where were the police? Nowhere,'' the Marseille daily La
Provence said of one of the clashes. ``Police eventually took up
position. Timidly.''
	   It was the nightmare the French hoped to prevent during the
five-week World Cup that began last Wednesday. A few hundred
troublemakers tainted an event drawing 1 million foreign spectators
and billions of TV viewers.
	   Tear gas from the violence wafted over Marseille's stadium
during Monday's match in which England beat Tunisia 2-0.
	   Despite about 2,000 police deployed in Marseille, violence
trashed the picturesque Old Port, spread to other downtown areas
and erupted on Prado Beach. Drunken English fans fought pitched
battles with Tunisia supporters and local youths from North African
immigrant families.
	   Police detained nearly 80 people, and a court late Monday wasted
no time convicting the first three English suspects to three months
in prison. Four others faced a hearing Tuesday.
	   In Paris Monday, police arrested about 20 bottle- and
rock-throwing German fans outside Parc des Princes stadium before
Germany defeated the United States 2-0.
	   Spearheading a new hard line, Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement signed an order Tuesday to immediately expel five
English fans and a Tunisian. He threatened more expulsions if
soccer violence recurs.
	   ``It's a message of firmness toward the troublemakers,'' said
Chevenement, who defended how police handled the violence. ``No
excesses will be tolerated.''
	   In addition to the expulsions, five English and three French
suspects in Marseille faced trial July 17. Twenty-five others _ 18
French, six English and a Tunisian _ remained under detention for
questioning Tuesday.
	   Authorities worried about rowdiness at other matches in the 10
French cities hosting the Cup.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   Police Tuesday rounded up 58 ticketless Scottish fans in
Bordeaux before an afternoon Norway-Scotland match, authorities
said. They were kept in a hall to watch the match on TV, then were
to be loaded on their bus and escorted out of town.
	   Marseille's mayor, Jean-Claude Gaudin, demanded further
reinforcements ahead of other World Cup matches there and said
damaged businesses should be reimbursed.
	   Scattered clashes persisted until dawn Tuesday between Marseille
police and suburban toughs who attacked some lingering English
fans. Police protectively escorted hundreds of the fans to
Saint-Charles train station.
	   A top Marseille mayor's assistant urged Tuesday that the English
team be banned from the championship, but in Paris, FIFA soccer
officials had no plans for that.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding to host the soccer championships in 2006.

	   POLICE arrested a man on Monday after mounting a massive search
of hills, villages and estates around Tsuen Wan following the rape
of a local woman by an armed illegal immigrant.
	   Following searches by three platoons of Police Tactical Unit
officers, many wearing bullet-proof vests, the man, suspected of
being the rapist, was arrested at around 5.50 pm, in a deserted hut
in Ho Man Chuen in the lower hills of Tai Lam Country Park.
	   A man, believed to be carrying two guns, raped a 39-year-old
woman at knifepoint on Saturday afternoon in a hut in Ta Kiu
village not far from where yesterday's arrest was made.
	   The woman told police she saw the butt of a gun tucked into the
man's trousers, and made out the outline of another pistol in a bag
tied around his waist.
	   Police said a man matching the rapist's description robbed a
villager of $300 at gunpoint at Ha Fa Shan, a few miles south from
Ta Kiu village, around noon yesterday.
	   The search for the wanted man, believed to be a mainlander was
concentrated around the area between Ting Kau, on the coast, to
Tsuen Wai Estate, northwest of Tsuen Wan town as dozens of police
officers continued to sweep the hillsides, questioning hikers and
villagers.
	   Helicopters and sniffer dogs joined the hunt on Monday, as
police warned journalists covering the story that the wanted
migrant could be armed with two guns and urged them to keep a safe
distance.
	   Officers making house to house searches in Ho Man Estate came
across the man in a deserted hut.
	   They found a knife inside a rucksack the man was carrying.
	   Police said they did not find any trace of the guns in the hut.
	   The man was taken to Tsuen Wan police station last night where
he was questioned in connection with Saturday's rape case and
Monday's robbery.
	   The rape victim was visiting two huts she had recently bought in
Ta Kiu Tsuen to feed her guard dog on Saturday when she was
attacked.
	   Threatening her with a paper-cutter, he ordered her to cook him
food. ``Before she had finished, he grew impatient and led her to
another hut, which she also owned and raped her. He later ordered
her to wash herself,'' Chief Inspector Ting Kwok-hung of Tsuen Wan
police said on Monday.
	   The ordeal lasted two hours before the attacker left, heading
along a path towards Tsuen Wai Estate where he was later spotted by
a police officer.
	   On seeing the policeman, the man fled into the bushes and
escaped.

	   NGAWI, East Java (JP): State forestry firm Perum Perhutani will
develop a 251.2-hectare soybean plantation in Ngawi, East Java, the
company said recently.
	   The head of Perhutani's Ngawi forest district, Noerhadi Siswoyo,
said the soybean plantation was expected to yield 2.88 metric tons
of first-grade soybeans per hectare, or 722 tons.
	   ``The soybean production will supply tempeh-chip producers in
Ngawi and other cities in East Java,'' he said, adding that the
industry previously had to buy soybeans, the raw material for
tempeh, from other provinces and even from overseas.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aiming to head off new soccer riots during the
World Cup, French authorities expelled or imprisoned English
hooligans Tuesday, rounded up Scottish fans in Bordeaux and braced
for an English match in Toulouse.
	   The crackdown came while authorities in Marseille faced
criticism they bungled efforts to control the three nights and two
days of violence by hundreds of drunken English fans and local
youths that left more than 50 injured.
	   ``It was predictable,'' the tabloid daily France-Soir headlined,
with a picture of English hooligans throwing beer cans. It called
police efforts ``a failure of prevention.''
	   ``Where were the police? Nowhere,'' the Marseille daily La
Provence said of one of the clashes. ``Police eventually took up
position. Timidly.''
	   It was the nightmare the French hoped to prevent during the
five-week World Cup that began last Wednesday. A few hundred
troublemakers tainted an event drawing 1 million foreign spectators
and billions of TV viewers.
	   Tear gas from the violence wafted over Marseille's stadium
during Monday's match in which England beat Tunisia 2-0.
	   Despite about 2,000 police deployed in Marseille, violence
trashed the picturesque Old Port, spread to other downtown areas
and erupted on Prado Beach. Drunken English fans fought pitched
battles with Tunisia supporters and local youths from North African
immigrant families.
	   Police detained nearly 80 people, and a court late Monday wasted
no time convicting the first three English suspects to three months
in prison. Four others faced a hearing Tuesday.
	   In Paris Monday, police arrested about 20 bottle- and
rock-throwing German fans outside Parc des Princes stadium before
Germany defeated the United States 2-0.
	   Spearheading a new hard line, Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement signed an order Tuesday to immediately expel five
English fans and a Tunisian. He threatened more expulsions if
soccer violence recurs.
	   ``It's a message of firmness toward the troublemakers,'' said
Chevenement, who defended how police handled the violence. ``No
excesses will be tolerated.''
	   In addition to the expulsions, five English and three French
suspects in Marseille faced trial July 17. Twenty-five others _ 18
French, six English and a Tunisian _ remained under detention for
questioning Tuesday.
	   Authorities worried about rowdiness at other matches in the 10
French cities hosting the Cup.
	   The southwestern city of Toulouse was bracing for England's next
match, with Romania on Monday. About 1,000 English fans were
already reported in France's fourth-largest city, prompting
officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July 11.
	   Officials also considered closing bars early and forgoing large
TV screens like the one on a Marseille beach where ticketless
English fans and local youths fought Monday afternoon.
	   Police Tuesday rounded up 58 ticketless Scottish fans in
Bordeaux before an afternoon Norway-Scotland match, authorities
said. They were kept in a hall to watch the match on TV, then were
to be loaded on their bus and escorted out of town.
	   Marseille's mayor, Jean-Claude Gaudin, demanded further
reinforcements ahead of other World Cup matches there and said
damaged businesses should be reimbursed.
	   Scattered clashes persisted until dawn Tuesday between Marseille
police and suburban toughs who attacked some lingering English
fans. Police protectively escorted hundreds of the fans to
Saint-Charles train station.
	   A top Marseille mayor's assistant urged Tuesday that the English
team be banned from the championship, but in Paris, FIFA soccer
officials had no plans for that.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding to host the soccer championships in 2006.

	   WOMEN who stay at home alone after childbirth have twice the
chance of suffering from post-natal depression than those who have
companions, according to a survey.
	   The survey by Chinese University of Hong Kong involved 449
mothers.
	   Assistant professor Lee Tak-shing of the department of
psychiatry said of the 338 mothers who had practised the Chinese
tradition of pei yu (being accompanied for a month after
childbirth), 7 per cent suffered from post-natal depression.
	   The survey found that among the 95 women who did not have
companions, 15 per cent suffered post-natal emotional distress.
Others refused to answer the questions.
	   Prof Lee estimated one in every 10 mothers in Hong Kong suffered
from post-natal depression, half of them serious.
	   About 70,000 children are born in Hong Kong each year.
	   The psychiatrist said although the levels of post-natal
depression in other countries were about the same, fewer Hong Kong
women suffered from serious symptoms.
	   Professor Tony Chung Kwok-hung, associate professor of the
university's department of obstetrics and gynaecology, said the
causes of post-natal depression was not known.
	   The survey indicated most women chose their mothers (28.5 per
cent) and mothers-in-law (28.3 per cent) as companions.
	   Others chose their relatives (18.3 per cent), domestic helpers
(7.8 per cent), pui yu maid (3.6 per cent) and friends (1.1 per
cent).
	   The survey also showed many mothers in Hong Kong followed
traditions within a month following giving birth by not eating raw
and cold food (82.6 per cent), 88.3 per cent refused to have sex
and 65.3 per cent did not go out.
	   Meanwhile, the university and the Prince of Wales Hospital have
jointly organised the first post-natal depression screening and
care program in Southeast Asia.
	   Under the new program, which begins on 1 July, new mothers at
the Prince of Wales Hospital will be asked to fill out
questionnaires to help medical staff identify those at risk from
post-natal depression.
	   This will help doctors and psychiatrists provide early treatment
for patients to avoid family tragedies.
	   The new program will benefit about 6,000 mothers a year.
	   Prof Chung appealed to the Hospital Authority for more funding
for the program and called on more hospitals to take the initiative
to identify patients at risk.
	   Mrs Ho, who refused to give her full name, has recovered from
post-natal depression which she suffered after giving birth to her
first child last August.
	   The civil servant, 32, said she had felt very upset and
exhausted taking care of her child during the first month. ``In the
beginning both my friends and my husband simply ignored my
complaints. It was lucky that my doctor discovered the problem
early,'' Mrs Ho said.

Hooligan concerns move on to Toulouse; Iranians protest film
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new information throughout; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Now it's on to Toulouse for England and its soccer
fans, trailed closely by French police.
	   As the courts in the southern resort of Marseille dealt swiftly
and harshly Tuesday with hooligans detained after waves of violence
surrounding England's 2-0 victory over Tunisia, the city of
Toulouse _ about 400 kilometers (240 miles) to the west _ was
bracing for England's next match with Romania on Monday.
	   About 1,000 English fans were already reported in the city,
prompting officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July
11. They also considered closing bars early.
	   In Marseille, 25 suspects _ 18 French, six English and a
Tunisian _ remained held for questioning for the violence. A local
public official joined calls for England to be kicked out of the
World Cup, a suggestion rejected by FIFA.
	   Late Monday, a court convicted and sentenced three Englishmen to
three months in prison. Five English and three French suspects were
given a trial date of July 17, five days after the World Cup ends.
	   Officials were also dealing with fans in Bordeaux, where
Scotland played Norway on Tuesday afternoon. Police rounded up 58
ticketless Scots before the game. They were fed and placed in a
hall to watch the match on TV, then were to be loaded on their bus
and escorted out of town.
	   Should Scotland lose, they would probably want to leave, anyway.
A defeat to Norway would make Scotland the first country to be
mathematically eliminated from making the second round.
	   Conversely, Brazil had a chance to become the first team to
clinch a second-round berth as it faced Morocco in Nantes in a
Tuesday night game.
	   An entirely different kind of controversy was brewing in the
Iranian team's camp, where officials are incensed over the showing
of an unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV.
	   ``Not Without My Daughter,'' which stars Sally Field and
portrays Iranians as dirty, boorish, cruel and obsessed with their
Islamic religion and its attitudes toward women, was screened on
France's privately owned channel M6 late Monday.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' Safaei
Farahani, head of Iran's soccer federation, told The Associated
Press. ``We hold the French government responsible for allowing the
screening of the film, and will register our severe protest.''
	   Farahani scheduled a meeting with French soccer officials to
complain.
	   More than 50 people were injured in the Marseille violence,
including an Englishman whose neck artery was cut by a bottle and
another who was stabbed in the back.
	   Police detained nearly 80 people, but they were under fire in
local and national press who accused them of failing to control the
violence by hundreds of locals and drunken English fans.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who defended the
police actions, signed an order Tuesday to immediately expel five
English fans and a Tunisian, and he threatened other expulsions if
soccer violence recurs.
	   Renaud Muselier, Marseille's deputy mayor, urged that the
English team be banned from the championship. ``The World Cup's
image ... requires that the team be disqualified or excluded,'' he
said in a statement.
	   In London, The Independent newspaper urged the England team to
pull out of the World Cup so the tournament could return to being
``a festival of football.''
	   The English Football Association has already scoffed at such
suggestions. In Paris, FIFA soccer officials had no plans to send
the English home.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding for the 2006 games.

World Cup: More attack, tighter defense needed against Denmark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Tighten up in back and attack more, South
African coaches said in describing a twin strategy for Thursday's
crucial World Cup match against Denmark.
	   ``I expect a change of attitude, an aggressive approach,'' coach
Philippe Troussier said Tuesday. ``For us, its a World Cup final.''
	   South Africa must defeat Denmark to have a realistic chance of
advancing to the second round of its inaugural World Cup. The
tournament began badly, with a 3-0 loss to host France in
Marseilles while Denmark opened by defeating Saudi Arabia 1-0.
	   Star striker Benni McCarthy of Ajax Amsterdam is ready after
injuring an ankle against France, but fellow starter Phil Masinga,
also hobbled by an ankle sprain, missed training Monday and Tuesday
and may sit out.
	   If he does, Shaun Bartlett of local club Cape Town Spurs is
likely to start in his place.
	   Against France, Bafana Bafana showed little spark or attack in
the second half and never managed a true shot on goal. The players
blame the pressure of their first World Cup opener, a strong wind
in their faces the first half and the quality of the French side
for the poor performance.
	   ``As players, we sat down and talked about it among ourselves,''
defender Mark Fish of Bolton Wanderers said. ``We said we've got to
play our own style, what got us here.''
	   But assistant coach Trott Moloto warned South Africa also must
worry about defending against the taller, physical Danes.
	   ``We will have to change our tactical play around ... our goal
because the Danes are tall players and we will need close
man-marking to blot them out,'' Moloto said.
	   He said defenders Fish, Pierre Issa and captain Lucas Radebe
would share responsibility for picking up brothers Michael and
Brian Laudrup and defender Marc Rieper of Glasgow Celtics, who
scored the goal against Saudi Arabia.
	   ``It does not mean we will be playing defensive, but it is
important to contain these players,'' Moloto said. ``We have to
express ourselves freely and I am confident we can beat them. All
we need is a positive approach.''
	   Also Tuesday, South Africa announced it would fly reserve
goalkeeper Simon Gopane to France to replace Paul Evans, who
injured a knee in training Monday and will undergo surgery. Evans
arrived in France last week to replace Andre Arendse, the Fulham
F.C. player who was knocked out of the tournament with a knee
injury also sustained in training.
	   Gopane will back up Hans Vonk of Heerenveen F.C. and Brian
Baloyi of local club Kaizer Chiefs.

	   GOVERNMENT efforts to seize a heroin trafficker's illegal
fortune of $659,000 failed on Monday because of a prosecution
oversight.
	   Justice Thomas Gall refused to grant a confiscation order ``with
some regret'' because of the legal technicality.
	   It means Woo Wai-kuen can keep his ill-gotten gains and save
them until he completes his 14-year jail sentence.
	   Woo, 25, pleaded guilty in April to trafficking in 1.3 kilograms
of heroin.
	   Yesterday the Department of Justice asked the Court of First
Instance to order Woo to hand over the fruits of his crime.
	   But defence counsel John McNamara opposed the move, saying
prosecutors had missed their chance.
	   He said trial counsel Edward Brook had failed to formally apply
for the confiscation order before sentence _ as required by law.
	   Mr Justice Gall said Mr Brook had indicated he would seek to
seize Woo's proceeds.
	   ``It was an unhappy wording by counsel for the prosecution,''
the judge said.
	   ``I cannot on the words used by counsel construe them as an
application.
	   ``With some regret the application made (by the prosecution) has
failed.'' Woo, a chef, was caught carrying drugs in a black plastic
bag after customs officers intercepted him in Tuen Mun on 27
September last year.
	   When his flat was searched, blenders and tools for packing drugs
were found with traces of heroin on them.
	   Woo has a six-month-old son whom he cuddled in the dock before
beginning his jail term in April.

Chernobyl reactor stopped following generator malfunction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only functioning reactor at the
Chernobyl nuclear plant was shut down Tuesday because of a
malfunction in one of its turbine generators, plant officials said.
	   No radiation leaks were reported, the officials said in a
statement. Repairs would take until Monday, the statement said.
	   One Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident. Another was shut down
after being badly damaged by a 1991 fire, and a third is not
operational.
	   Reactor No. 3, which has been undergoing repairs since last
July, was restarted in mid-May. Plant officials did not elaborate
on the nature of its malfunctions.
	   Ukraine has pledged to close Chernobyl by 2000, but wants dlrs
1.2 in international aid first to build two new reactors to
compensate for Chernobyl's lost energy and find new jobs for its
workers.

	   JAKARTA (JP): Former president Soeharto's daughter Siti
Hardijanti Rukmana, popularly known as Tutut, has resigned as a
commissioner of Bank Central Asia (BCA), the bank said yesterday.
	   BCA director A. Soebowo was quoted by Antara as saying that
Tutut had reported on her retirement to the central bank, but he
did not know if she had also sold her stake in the institution.
	   Reports said that Tutut and her brother Sigit Hardjojudanto, who
owned 15 percent stake each at BCA, had sold their stakes to a
third party, possibly the Sultan of Brunei.
	   Sudono Salim, who together with his sons owns a 70 percent stake
in BCA, said earlier he wanted to buy out Tutut and Sigit's stake
in the bank.
	   The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) recently took
over BCA's management after injecting huge liquidity into the bank
to help it face a run on deposits.

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with more reaction; NEW to some point &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Au Pair &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ ``Absolutely fantastic,'' Susan Woodward
said Tuesday after hearing news that her daughter Louise is free to
come home after an appeal court upheld a reduction in her sentence
for the death of a child in her care.
	   Mrs. Woodward had nothing else to say to reporters. But others
in the Cheshire village were delighted.
	   ``We can hardly believe it, everyone as you can imagine is
absolutely over the moon,'' said Roy McCabe, a family friend.
	   ``The main thing is that she is coming home, but I don't think
the fight is over. We still have to find the honest truth in all of
this.''
	   The highest appeal court in Massachusetts upheld a ruling by the
trial judge, Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that Louise
Woodward's sentence for second-degree murder should be reduced to
the time she had already served.
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the trustees of the appeal fund,
said he was relieved that the court had finally made its decision.
	   ``I am obviously very pleased that the appeal has been upheld
and that she will at last be able to come back.
	   ``We have still not got to lose sight of the fact that there is
a dead baby at the end of it and we still feel for the Eappen
family and their pain must be increased because of this verdict,''
Davey said.
	   ``I am sure Louise will be very pleased with the verdict and she
will be longing to get back and get her life back to normal, or as
normal as possible.
	   ``I do not know what the family are planning, I have no idea
what the community or anybody will do now _ we were all just
waiting for the verdict.
	   ``After the last few weeks of speculation and rumor it is good
to put the facts back where they should have been. They have been
sidelined for far too long.''
	   At the Rigger pub, which had served as headquarters for local
supporters of Louise Woodward, Jean Antrobus said the court's
ruling was ``brilliant news.''
	   ``I don't think the conviction should stand but at least it
means she's coming home,'' Mrs. Antrobus said.
	   ``She's only a girl herself. It doesn't alter the fact that
Matthew died and I feel very sorry for his parents, but it's time
that she came home and to put everything behind us.''
	   Ann Bradshaw of Elton said she was ``so glad it's all over'' for
the Woodwards.
	   ``In recent weeks it's got totally out of hand because it
dragged on so long,'' Mrs. Bradshaw said. ``Now everyone knows
where they stand and can get on with their lives.''

	   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian Tourism Promotion Board (BPPI)
predicts tourist arrivals may drop 50 percent from the 5.2 million
visitors reported in 1997 if the current political and social
situation persists.
	   The board's new chairman Pontjo Sutowo said yesterday that
political instability remained the biggest worry for tourists
considering a visit to the country.
	   ``Many tours, including some for much later this year, have been
canceled because people are still not confident about security
here,'' Pontjo said in a written report for the House of
Representatives.
	   Occupancy rates in Jakarta's four and five-star hotels has sunk
to an average of around 10 percent, way below the point at which
they break even, he said, adding that many conferences and
conventions had also been canceled.
	   Even in Bali, the country's most popular tourist destination,
occupancy rates did not currently exceed 30 percent, he said.
	   The board said Bali would lose about 10,000 tourists every month
over the next several months.
	   The number of tourists dropped by 16.1 percent between Jan. and
Apr. on figures for the same period last year, the board said
without quoting a specific number.
	   Riots from May 14 to 17 caused a further drastic slump, the
report said.
	   The directorate general of tourism in the Ministry of Tourism,
Arts and Culture showed that the number of incoming tourists had
fallen by 12.1 percent in January and February.
	   The Association of Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies (Asita)
reported yesterday that tour operators' incomes had fallen by
between 50 percent and 80 percent, except for those in Bali and
Yogyakarta, who had on average suffered a 30 percent decrease.
	   The Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association said yesterday
that foreign exchange revenues from tourism had dropped by 40
percent this year.
	   Last year, revenues generated through tourism reached US$6.6
billion.
	   Pontjo said that it would be difficult for the tourism sector in
the country to benefit from the 80 percent depreciation in the
value of the rupiah against the dollar while industry operators
continue to quote prices in U.S. dollars.
	   Operators in other countries such as Malaysia and Thailand
offered comparatively cheaper prices because they were willing to
charge in their own national currencies, he said.
	   Tourism in Indonesia had been further damaged by the political
crisis which has received extremely adverse publicity around the
world, he said.
	   ``When a country officially warns their nationals not to visit
Indonesia then insurance companies will not issue cover for any
such trips,'' he said.
	   Tourism here has been rocked by blow after blow since last year,
when severe forest fires caused a choking smog to spread across
large areas of the country.
	   The Southeast Asian monetary crisis and its attendant woes then
caused tourist numbers from neighboring countries, the largest
single group of visitors to Indonesia, to drop sharply.

	   BOTTLED water is not that much better than tap water, according
to a test of 30 brands by the Consumer Council.
	   According to a report in Monday's edition of Choice Magazine,
most bottled water does not possess any greater health properties
and may even contain more impurities.
	   Some bottled water contained higher levels of undesirable
chemicals such as arsenic and lead, than samples of tap water taken
from various sources in Hong Kong.
	   Harmful chemicals were found in 23 samples, but the levels
complied with Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination)
Regulations in Hong Kong.
	   ``If a consumer is looking for mineral content, they can
definitely consume tap water instead of paying for bottled water,''
said Dr Lo Chi-kin, Publicity and Community Relations Committee
Chairperson for the council.
	   ``If the consumer is after style, image or labels, then it is
their choice to buy bottled water,'' said Dr Lo.
	   He added that the best approach to absorb minerals was through a
balanced diet.
	   Ten of the samples were found to be slightly too acidic (less
than pH 6) and not suitable for people suffering from kidney
disease.
	   ``People with kidney problems should consider the fact that they
might be worsening their health with these brands,'' said Dr Lo.
	   ``These brands are not suitable because patients may be more
susceptible to kidney stones, caused by an increase in urea in the
body fluids.'' Dr Lo stressed that only consumption of mass
quantities of the acidic water would cause serious health problems.
	   He added that the pH levels were slightly over international
standards but were within the limits set in Hong Kong.
	   Two brands were found to have inaccurate labelling.
	   One claimed to be free of bacteria but was detected with a total
bacteria count of 2,300 colony forming units, albeit likely
harmless ones.
	   None were detected of any bacteria of Coliform, E. Coli or Fecal
Streptococci, indicating they were free from fecal contamination.
	   It is currently not required for bottled water companies to
label the acidity of their products but Dr Lo stresses that ``the
more information given by the products to the public, the better''.

Authorities investigate claim of cease-fire by arson group
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Anti-terrorist police on Tuesday
investigated apparent claims by a prolific terrorist group that it
would stop its firebomb attacks and reconsider its activities.
	   ``The war campaign we have waged over the last year is being
temporarily suspended, in order for us to redefine our positions in
the trenches of class struggle,'' said a letter signed by
Conscientious Arsonists and published Monday by Athinaiki, a small
Athens daily newspaper.
	   The arson spree _ which has targeted cars and offices _ forced
extra police patrols and increased fears of harm to Greece's vital
tourism industry. Officials have been unable so far to halt the
firebombings, carried out with make-shift explosive devices using
petrol or propane gas canisters.
	   While it is unclear what direction the arsonists will take,
authorities are reportedly concerned that the group could return
with harsher tactics.
	   In the letter, Conscientious Arsonists claims responsibility for
62 firebombings since June 1997, mostly against cars belonging to
government officials, diplomats, journalists and foreign companies.
The attacks resulted in only one injury.
	   The group has also bombed the political office of the press
minister and the retired army officers' union. No Conscientious
Arsonists member has ever been arrested.
	   A number of other groups also claim responsibility for arson
attacks. On average, about 300 cars are firebombed in Greece every
year.
	   Quoting extensively from the Italian terrorist group Red
Brigades, the three-page computer-printed letter criticized the
Socialist government's effort to trim its public sector and meet
criteria for joining the European Union's single currency club.
	   ``The state's recent attacks in various labor sectors ...
positively prove that the price of ... monetary union is the
exclusion and marginalization of the proletarian layers,'' the
letter said.
	   ``Progressive academics, leftist sociologists and viruses of
journalism, repentant anarchists and leftists, all of them
supporters of the existing order of things, ... are attempting
through every means to persuade us that uprising is unfeasible,''
the letter complained. ``Their detection is particularly easy.''
	   The text stressed that ``the only alternative form of
entertainment is revolutionary class violence.''
	   Greece is also home to November 17, one of Europe's most deadly
militant terrorist organizations, which has killed 22 people since

	   JAKARTA (JP): Publicly listed timber firm PT Sumalindo Lestari
Jaya, a subsidiary of the country's largest automaker Astra
International, expects an increase in earnings this year despite
the economic crisis.
	   Company president Adi Resanata Somadi Halim said that rupiah's
sharp fall against the American dollar was a windfall for the firm,
which exported 70 percent of its products overseas last year.
	   The rupiah is currently hovering around 14,000 to the American
dollar, compared to its precrisis level of 2,450 in July last year.
	   ``We expect bright prospects this year because the rupiah's fall
against the dollar will make earnings in rupiah much higher.''
	   He declined to divulge projected sales and net profit targets
this year.
	   The company's net sales reached a total of Rp 133 billion in the
first quarter of this year, compared to net sales of Rp 349 billion
for all of last year, he added.
	   He said that net profit totaled Rp 10 billion in the first three
months over a substantial loss in the same period last year.
	   ``With the rupiah remaining weak against the dollar, we will see
better earnings this year.''
	   He said the company marketed around 111,110 cubic meters of logs
in 1997, 163,200 cubic meters of plywood, 7,700 cubic meters of
blockboard and 120,000 cubic meters of medium density board (MDF)
overseas, including to Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, the United
States and Europe.
	   Adi said the company -- currently 82.06 percent owned by Astra
International, 9.53 percent by timber firm PT Barito Pacific Timber
controlled by Prajogo Pangestu, 0.14 percent by a cooperative and
8.27 percent by the public -- would boost its export market to
offset the decline in the domestic market due to dire economic
situation.
	   He stated the firm's total foreign debt was US$30 million, which
would mature in the next three years.
	   But he refuted reports on the firm's forest concession in
Kalimantan, which was alleged to have breached forestry
regulations.
	   ``We have not received any warnings yet from the forestry
ministry,'' he said.

	   RICE traders have been urged to find alternative sources of
supply in the wake of a Consumer Council study that found the price
of Thai rice in the shops did not reflect the falling baht.
	   The study was prompted by consumers' complaints about price
increases that followed the baht's devaluation last July.
	   According to the rice importers in Hong Kong, the Rice Exporters
Association of Thailand sets the price floor for rice exports.
	   ``Thai farmers have also been holding their rice stock and are
reluctant to sell because of Thailand's rapid inflation and
economic downturn,'' Dr Lo Chi-kin, publicity and community
relations committee chairman for the importers, said. ``This, along
with the Asian financial turmoil and natural disasters in the
Philippines and Indonesia, has led to great demand for Thai rice.''
But vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Registered Rice Wholesalers
Association Paddy Chan Wai-man said the price of Thai rice should
not rise again.
	   ``The Consumer Council is basing its results on the retail price
of rice, but that cost is set by the markets and wholesalers who
include advertising in the costs,'' Mr Chan said.
	   Dr Lo said it would take some time for importers to find new
rice sources.
	   A spokesman for the Trade Department said sales of Thai rice had
fallen as consumers switched to other less expensive brands.
	   ``People are not rigid in their choice of rice according to
these figures,'' the spokesman said.
	   ``Sales of Thai rice have fallen 4 per cent in the past year and
other rice has increased by about 3 per cent.'' Thai rice, which is
favoured by the population, comprises 70 per cent of the market
share of staple food in Hong Kong.
	   Since January last year to last March, 263,190 tonnes of rice
have been imported from Thailand.

	   THE demand for executives in Hong Kong dropped 26 per cent last
month compared with April as economic conditions worsened, a
leading consultancy says.
	   On a year-on-year basis, the demand for executives fell 22 per
cent, according to the Executive Leasing Consulting.
	   Principal Alfred Chown warned yesterday that demand may drop
even further with signs of recovery starting to show in October or
November.
	   ``We have seen worse monthly declines for executives but the
overall economic outlook is as bad as it has been in the past five
to 10 years,'' Mr Chown said.
	   ``A lot of negative forces are at work but it is hoped Hong
Kong's economy will be stronger when it emerges from this period.''
The information technology sector was the hardest hit and recorded
a 32 per cent fall in demand last month compared with April _
although the overall picture is not necessarily so gloomy.
	   ``Although demand will rise and fall, it is anticipated a
reasonable stability in executive demand should prevail,'' Mr Chown
said.
	   The government had previously identified the IT sector as a
potential growth area.
	   Demand for executives in engineering fell 28 per cent last month
and 49 per cent compared with last year.
	   Recruitment prospects for the sector were hindered by the Asian
economic turmoil with a local recovery largely dependent on
opportunities arising from Mass Transit Railway and Kowloon Canton
Railway contracts.
	   Mr Chown said the engineering sector would be helped if the
government speeded-up some of its infrastructure projects.
	   ``As regional economies stabilise in the next 12 months,
governments are likely to push infrastructure projects to stimulate
economies,'' he said.
	   In the short term, only the mainland offered any hope on major
projects but Mr Chown said even so there was no guarantee that
engineering executives in Hong Kong would benefit from
developments.
	   Demand for finance executives fell 27 per cent last month
because of the financial turmoil while demand for management
executives dropped 22 per cent.
	   Mr Chown said the marketing sector was the most resilient with
vacancies falling only 12 per cent.
	   ``One strategy to increase sales is to take the opposite view of
the direction of the economy and use the period to try and expand
business,'' he said.

	   THE number of job seekers registered with the Labour
Department's placement service rose from 16,843 in April to 23,522
last month.
	   But the department said the increase could have been down to
summer job seekers, or students, entering the market. In April and
May last year 12,323 and 17,458 people were registered
respectively.
	   Acting Deputy Labour Commissioner Chor Chan Chui-yuk said summer
job applicants accounted for at least 30 per cent of the increase.
	   Mrs Chor was speaking at the opening of a photo exhibition by
the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Unions Council on Monday.
	   She said there were 15,728 vacancies last month, compared with
12,145 in April. Successful placements totalled 2,540 in April and
2,948 last month.
	   ``Many job seekers will be able to find jobs successfully after
taking the retraining courses provided by us,'' Mrs Chor said.
	   Unions council chairman Lee Kwok-keung, however, was more
pessimistic. ``The unemployment rate will climb up to 4.5 per cent
and even 5 per cent. The problem will become more and more
severe,'' he said.
	   ``I think the government is not doing enough to tackle the
problem. It should ensure that it is using the appropriate
policy,'' Mr Lee said.

	   A PROPOSAL to compel infrastructure contractors to employ only
local workers has been described by the Financial Secretary as
protectionism.
	   Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen was quoted as saying this in a
pre-Budget meeting with five legislators-elect from the labour
sector and eight independents.
	   Leung Yiu-chung of the Neighbourhood and Workers' Service
Centre, was one of those who made the proposal on compulsory
employment of locals.
	   Mr Leung said they asked the government to make laws stipulating
that all contracts of infrastructural works should carry a clause
stipulating the employer ``must employ local workers''.
	   He said it was a way to guarantee jobs for local people when the
unemployment rate continued to soar.
	   But the proposal was not accepted by Sir Donald, according to
the legislators.
	   Another legislator-elect, who declined to be named, quoted Sir
Donald as saying the idea was a type of ``protectionism''. Hong
Kong was an open city and it would be difficult to order
businessmen to employ local people compulsorily.
	   The was also contention between the three legislators from the
Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and one from the industrial
sector over the issue of developing manufacturing industries to
adjust the unbalanced economic structure.
	   Chan Yuen-han of the federation said Sir Donald slammed their
suggestion for a bureau to oversee the development of the industry
as a ``planned economy''.
	   Ms Chan criticised Sir Donald's style as just following the
``old beaten path'', and that such an attitude could not help solve
the economic crisis.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A French businessman who was kidnapped by
the shadowy Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, testified
Tuesday that he was convinced his captors intended to kill him.
	   Speaking during the Supreme Court trial of a former minister and
11 others charged with the kidnapping, Segundo Marey recounted how
he was dragged screaming from his home in southern France on
December 4, 1983.
	   Marey, who had been mistaken for a hitman from the Basque
separatist group ETA, was held in a hide-out in northern Spain for
10 days before being released.
	   The adduction of Marey was the first action claimed by the GAL.
Over the next four years the group killed 27 suspected members and
sympathizers of ETA in southern France in an alleged
government-backed dirty war against the separatists.
	   On his way to the witness stand, the Spanish-born French citizen
stared long and hard at the two policemen who have admitted
watching over him in the hideout, the national news agency EFE
reported.
	   After listening to the testimony of their former hooded hostage,
the two defendants approached Marey to apologize, EFE said.
	   ``Now I feel more relaxed, more calm and I have a great
confidence in the Spanish Supreme court'' Marey told reporters
after his four-hour testimony.
	   During the trial, that began May 25, most of the dozen accused
have admitted their part in the GAL kidnapping, and accused former
Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo and ex-Chief of Security Rafael
Vera of setting up the clandestine paramilitary unit.
	   Allegations that the Interior Ministry founded and funded the
GAL contributed to the 1996 electoral defeat of former Socialist
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez after 13 years in office.
	   Gonzalez, who is due to testify in the trial at an as yet
unspecified date, has denied that his administrations did anything
illegal in their struggle to squash ETA.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its armed
campaign for the creation of an independent Basque state in
northern Spain in 1968, and was particularly active in the early
1980s.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera face jail sentences of up to 23 years if
convicted of charges of kidnapping, belonging to an armed group and
misuse of public funds. The other 10 defendants face lesser
sentences.
	   Prosecutors are also seeking a compensation payment of 36
million pesetas (dlrs 240,000) for Marey who says his health was
permanently damaged by his ordeal.
	   The Supreme Court hearing is expected to last until the end of
the month.

	   PEOPLE should hold onto their cash instead of investing it in
the renewed bout of currency speculation, an economist warned.
	   Associate professor Andy Kwan Cheuk-chi of the Economics
Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the recent
surge in interbank interest rates indicated that speculators had
again started to sell Hong Kong dollars.
	   He warned that this might push up local interest rates,
including mortgage interest, which could hit the property market
and eventually the stock market.
	   If property prices continued to fall, the banking system might
be jeopardised, he said.
	   ``Speculators are beginning to sell Hong Kong dollar futures but
they eventually need to buy current Hong Kong dollars from banks to
settle their future accounts.
	   ``During this buying process, which takes up to two days to
complete, the interbank interest rates will be pushed up quickly if
the amount involved is large,'' Prof Kwan said.
	   There was reportedly a negative balance in the interbank loan
market after someone sold more than $5 billion in Hong Kong dollar
futures.
	   Prof Kwan advised the public to hold on to their cash during the
present period of economic and financial uncertainty.
	   ``Holding cash is the way to protect your savings,'' he advised.
``Prices might continue to fall.'' It is hard to predict when the
property and stock markets would halt their decline.
	   But Prof Kwan was optimistic that when the Japanese yen
stabilised, the currency crisis would subside and the local economy
would recover.

	   But Lai Ip-cheung, chief housing manager (commercial properties)
of the Housing Department, said the department did not intend to
terminate the tenancies immediately.
	   More than 100 commercial tenants have threatened to close their
shops and stalls on 7 July unless the Housing Authority agrees to a
30 per cent rent reduction across the board.
	   This goes further than the package earlier announced by the
Housing Authority under which the rent reduction would be
determined by reassessment on individual shops and stalls.
	   ``We will consider some measures to be taken if they (the
tenants) cause inconvenience to our estate residents and affect the
business atmosphere of our shopping centres,'' Derek Yim Ka-yan,
chief estate surveyor (commercial properties) said on Monday.
	   ``If they fail to comply with the terms in the tenancy, we will
consider terminating the lease.'' Mr Lai said the agreement stated
that business owners had a duty to provide services to the estate
residents.
	   ``We will not be so strict as to terminate their tenancy once
they join the one-day closure. Nor will their action affect their
applications for our rent reassessment,'' he said.
	   But Mr Lai described the closure of shops as an irresponsible
action that would also cause losses for the owners.
	   Meanwhile, the cost of rent reassessments for tenants will range
between $350 and $3,000.
	   The amount will depend on the size of shops and stalls as well
as the complexity of the assessment processes.
	   Application forms will be available from Tuesday until the end
of September.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Colleagues showered a Turkish
correspondent for a French daily with hugs, kisses and flowers
Tuesday before he started serving a seven-month prison term after
being convicted of making Kurdish propaganda.
	   Ragip Duran walked into the prison near Tekirdag, a city 130
kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Istanbul.
	   Duran was accompanied by Ocak Isik Yurtcu, a Turkish editor who
served time in the same prison for his writings. Yurtcu was freed
after an amnesty last August.
	   As Duran turned himself in, scores of journalists cheered and
applauded him, chanting the slogan: ``Free press cannot be
silenced!'' A similar rally was staged in Istanbul earlier in the
day.

World Cup: Win or lose, Morocco has not disappointed fans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAREK EL-TABLAWY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ If Morocco's Atlas Lions were worried
about the outcome of Tuesday's match against powerhouse Brazil,
they don't need to be. In the eyes of their fans, they've
accomplished what they came to France to do.
	   ``I don't really expect the team to win the Cup,'' said fan
Sameh Benidriss. ``But I also didn't expect the kind of performance
they put on against Norway. They were everything they should have
been _ aggressive and fast.''
	   ``If they play the same way, or better, and still lose, we will
be proud of them,'' said Benidriss.
	   Morocco came to this World Cup expecting to surprise and save
face after its humiliating elimination in the African Nations Cup
this year. Few seriously expected that Morocco would advance past
the first round.
	   But last week's astonishing 2-2 draw against Norway proved that
Morocco was not a pushover. Moreover, Deportivo la Coruna
midfielder Moustafa Hadji emerged as one of the stars of the
tournament so far.
	   Shortly after the match, Morocco's King Hassan II sent a message
of congratulations to the players. And sports minister Ahmed Moussa
arrived in Nantes to give the team additional support.
	   Moroccan fans mingled with their Brazilian counterparts in
downtown Nantes Tuesday, waving red and green flags and bouncing
soccer balls in the street, responding to every cheer for Brazil
with one of their own.
	   But unlike the England-Tunisia match, the only beatings were on
drums the Moroccans brought to increase the decibel level of their
celebrations.
	   ``I have a good feeling about this match,'' said Atlas Lions
supporter Mahmoud Tamer.
	   It will take a lot more than confidence, however, to overcome a
team which coach Henri Michel has described as the ``Himalayas of
football.''
	   Although they failed to excite in their first Group A match
against Scotland, scratching out a 2-1 win, Brazil is still the
strong favorite, and the Moroccans are all to aware of who they are
going up against.
	   ``We've begun well in this World Cup, but it's always difficult
to seal it,'' said midfielder Hadji. ``Whatever happens, the meet
will be spectacular and all Moroccans will have their eyes riveted
on us.''

	   MORE workers are now willing to take up part-time jobs because
of the high unemployment rate.
	   The Census and Statistics Department announced on Monday a rapid
rise in the seasonally adjusted under-employment for the
three-month period ending May to 2.6 per cent from 2.2 per cent or
72,400 workers in the previous month.
	   The last time that Hong Kong experienced a 2.6 per cent
under-employment was between December 1982 to February 1983.
	   The department considers a person to be under-employed if he
involuntarily works for less than 35 hours a week.
	   Working short hours is considered as involuntary if it is due to
economic reasons such as slack work, material shortage, mechanical
breakdown and inability to find a full-time job, the department
explained.
	   A staff member of the Sara Beattie Appointments employment
agency said the number of their clients rose at least 30 per cent
in the past two months.
	   ``Because of the economic situation and closure of many
companies it is getting more difficult for our clients to land the
right job,'' she said.
	   She said the company advised clients to try to settle for
temporary jobs while waiting for better opportunities.
	   ``Our clients appear to be willing to listen to our advice
because they know that it is really very difficult to find a job
when the economy is down,'' she said.
	   Almost half of the under-employed in April, 36,600, were from
the construction industry. The transport, storage and communication
sector accounted for 10,000; manufacturing, 9,400 while community,
social and personal services accounted for 6,300.

Turkish premier signs early election deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Parliament rejects motion to investigate corruption
allegations about Yilmaz

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and an
opposition leader have formalized a deal reached earlier this month
to hold early elections in April, the opposition chief said
Tuesday.
	   Deniz Baykal, the leader of the Republican People's Party, a
social democrat party, told his deputies that he and Yilmaz signed
the agreement that calls for Yilmaz to resign by the end of the
year.
	   A caretaker government would then lead the country to elections,
which should be held either on April 18 or April 25, according to
the agreement.
	   Baykal did not say when the agreement was signed. Turkish
newspapers said it was signed Monday.
	   Baykal had been pushing for early elections in return for his
party's continued support to Yilmaz's minority government,
especially on issues of tax reform and a bill aimed at curbing
radical Islam.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year in a coalition of his
center-right Motherland Party, the Democratic Left Party and the
Democratic Turkey Party after the military forced the previous,
Islamic-led government out of power.
	   No single party has gathered enough votes to have an absolute
majority in parliament since 1991, and three governing coalitions
have collapsed since 1995.
	   Meanwhile on Tuesday, Parliament rejected a motion to open an
investigation into allegations that Yilmaz interfered in the
allocation of forest lands newly opened up for tourism development.
	   Yilmaz is already being investigated on two corruption charges,
for allegedly trying to conceal some of his personal wealth and
costing the state money by awarding consulting work to private
firms.
	   Although the two previous inquiries were supported by Baykal,
this time the social democrats voted against the investigation,
apparently in a show of solidarity.
	   All motions were pushed by the center-right True Path Party, led
by Yilmaz's bitter rival, ex-premier Tansu Ciller.

	   AN all-Hong Kong workforce will build the West Rail project,
with demand for more than 12,000 construction workers peaking by
the turn of 2000.
	   West Rail supremo Ian Thoms made the pledge on Monday.
	   The project will begin in the last quarter of this year if the
Executive Council authorises the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp to
kick off in September.
	   It is estimated that about 11,000 to 12,000 construction workers
will be needed during the peak construction period between 2000 and
2001. The KCRC and its consultancy will each also need an
additional 500 technicians.
	   When the West Rail operates in 2003, it will demand another
1,000 to 1,500 operational staff.
	   West Rail director Ian Thoms predicted that no foreign labour
would fill these vacancies.
	   ``It would absorb all available workers in Hong Kong . . . I
would say they would be 100 per cent local and there is little need
to go abroad for labour.'' He guaranteed that contractors would not
be allowed to import labour without strong justification.
	   Meanwhile, Mr Thoms declined to comment on whether the present
financial turmoil and property slump would affect its borrowing
plans.
	   ``It is too early to say what the impact (of higher interest
rates) would be.
	   ``But we are addressing the problems of borrowing money in the
market and we will continue to look at the market situation.'' He
added that the economic time span until 2003 was long enough for
any changes.
	   West Rail will cost $64 billion.

World Bank mission reviews programs in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Representatives of the World Bank reviewed
their projects Tuesday for reforming Ukraine's financial and energy
industries and improving its farms and environment, a news agency
reported.
	   Paul Siegelbaum, director of the bank's Ukraine and Belarus
department, met with Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tihipko, Interfax
said.
	   It quoted World Bank officials as saying they would try to
assess the prospects for further cooperation with Ukraine, which
they said depended on the resumption of International Monetary Fund
aid to the former Soviet republic.
	   Ukraine and the World Bank have either agreed on or started
preparing more than 30 projects worth dlrs 2.2 billion, of which
Ukraine has already received about dlrs 1.1 billion, Interfax said.
	   But the World Bank suspended work earlier this year on approving
further projects after the IMF refused to release an installment on
a dlrs 542 million loan.
	   In 1997, the IMF rejected a larger dlrs 2.5 billion loan, citing
Ukraine's stalled reforms. An IMF mission arrived in Kiev on Monday
to assess the country's progress toward implementing the conditions
for that loan.
	   The World bank delegation was expected to stay in Ukraine for
about two weeks, meeting with the president, prime minister,
National Bank chairman and other top officials and visiting the
cities of Boryspil, Yalta, Sevastopol, Odessa and Dnipropetrovsk.

Accord near on development of oil field in southern Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian and a British company are close to a deal
with authorities in southern Italy to develop an oil field expected
to yield up to 622 million barrels of crude oil in the next 24
years, a government source said Tuesday.
	   Italy's state-owned energy company ENI and Brtain's Enterprise
Oil have been involved in lengthy negotiations with the region of
Basilicata in the instep of the Italian boot-shaped peninsula.
	   Basilicata, Italy's most underdeveloped region, wants ENI to
invest at least three trillion Italian lire (dlrs 1.7 billion) in
non-oil projects in exchange for the right to expand drilling and
development operations in the area. But ENI has offered to pay only
a small fraction of the sum.
	   The managing director of Enterprise's Italian subsidiary, Simon
Oddie, said Tuesday a preliminary agreement had been signed.
	   ENI officials declined to comment.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Politicians, celebrities and academics
devoted Tuesday to celebrating James Joyce's masterwork,
``Ulysses,'' with a series of readings that filled Dublin literary
pubs and reached across the globe on the Internet.
	   The annual ``Bloomsday'' festivities chart the course of the
epic novel's protagonist, Leopold Bloom, as he wanders among the
streets and public houses of the Irish capital.
	   This year's festivities featured readings far beyond Irish
shores, which were conveyed by audio worldwide on the Irish Times
newspaper's website.
	   Starting in Melbourne, Australia, then moving next to Tokyo,
Joyce aficionados read their favorite passages from the book, which
was widely scorned by his conservative countrymen when it was
published.
	   In Dublin the readers included President Mary McAleese and
novelist Edna O'Brien, and in London the actress Sinead Cusack. In
Capetown, South Africa the contribution came from Kader Asmal, a
government minister and former Dublin resident.
	   In New York City, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Frank McCourt
was among the final readers scheduled to contribute.
	   Organizers said their decision to conduct readings from time
zone to time zone was inspired by the opening words of ``Ulysses,''
which read: ``Early morning, set off at dawn. Travel round in front
of the Sun, steal a day's march on him. Keep it up for ever, never
grow a day older technically.''
	   ``Ulysses,'' published in Paris in 1922, was long banned from
publication in Ireland because of its irreverence towards
Catholicism and its sexual content. Today Joyce's life and work has
been embraced in Dublin with a cultural center and an international
summer school.

New gun-running route opens to Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   KOMAN, Albania (AP) _ Adjusting the lapels of his brown
polyester suit, the tall gangly man took off his reflective
sunglasses and reached under his red and yellow beach shirt.
	   The pop-pop of the Chinese-made pistol echoed off the cliffs
overhanging the Komanlt river. His audience duly impressed, the man
smiled, exposing teeth rotted by years of bad nutrition.
	   Hefting the pistol, another Albanian worked the action.
	   ``Look at them, they don't even bother to hide it anymore even
this deep inside Albania,'' said Sulejman Broji, a passenger on a
river ferry headed for the border town of Bajram Curri.
	   Albanian authorities, seeking to maintain the moral highground
in the escalating conflict between ethnic Albanians and Serb
authorities in neighboring Kosovo, officially frown on gunrunning.
	   But the impromptu trade show aboard the ferry demonstrated the
degree to which gunrunners can count on official complacency.
	   Driving mini-vans with Swiss license plates, the customer and
his dozen friends looked out of place aboard the rusting ferry.
Their clothes looked straight off the shelves of a camping goods
store, their boots unsullied by the mud and dust that are the bane
of everyone living here.
	   Albanian emigres from Switzerland and Germany are thought to be
supplying much of the funding for the weapons being smuggled into
Kosovo on mule trains, often following the same trails used in the
other direction by more than 10,000 Kosovo Albanians who have fled
the fighting and taken refuge in wild northeastern Albania.
	   Less than one hour before, in the small town of Koman, men
sweated in the hot midday sun loading heavy machine guns,
Kalashnikov automatic rifles and potato sacks full of ammunition
aboard the river ferry.
	   The Komanlt river, now a large artificial lake, runs from the
dam at Koman up 40 kilometers (25 miles) to a small port near
Bajram Curri, a frontier town where guns are as much a part of life
as food.
	   The river provides the easiest route through the mountains and
deep ravines that separate Shkodra, northern Albania's biggest
town, from the rugged border with Kosovo some 60 kilometers (40
miles) to the east.
	   Weapons slowly find their way to Kosovo. On Tuesday, a tractor
was seen pulling more than two dozen crates of shoulder-held
anti-tank missiles towards the border. Nearby, a KLA guerrilla
trained seven young men on automatic rifles.
	   Gun running has been a lucrative business for locals along
border towns, who supply and sell guns to separatist Albanians and
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is seeking independence for the
Albanian-dominated Serb province.
	   Border towns like Tropoja, south of Bajram Curri, are flush with
weapons, but the recent frequency of gun traffic up the Komanlt
river indicates that demand is steadily outpacing local supplies.
	   Most of the weapons given or sold to Kosovo Albanians were
looted from armories around the country when it degenerated into a
state of chaos following the collapse of get-rich schemes last
year.armories during an uprising here last year.
	   ``This is different, these guns are new,'' said Broji. Others
standing around on the sun deck of the ferry agreed.
	   Many of the bigger weapons, including tripod mounted heavy
machine guns usually found on top of main battle tanks, glinted
with the sheen of packing oil.
	   As a popular Greek song about lost love wailed out of a dusty
coffee shop dockside, men in a rubber dinghy unloaded automatic
rifles at the front end of the ferry. Police nearby directed
traffic, seemingly oblivious.
	   The larger guns were manhandled aboard and dumped at the front
of the boat.
	   Large quantities of money wrapped in newspaper were exchanged at

EU says goodbye to Mandela _ amid plaudits and trade prods

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Singing with kids, receiving plaudits from
city leaders and giving the presidents and prime ministers a prod
about trade, South African President Nelson Mandela said goodbye
Tuesday to the European Union.
	   At the end of a two-day meeting in the Welsh capital, EU leaders
threw a farewell lunch for the 79-year-old Mandela, who steps down
next year. And they pledged in a communique to complete a virtual
free trade pact with South Africa by the autumn.
	   ``What South Africa requires is not just warm words _ it
requires an open Europe which is trading with South Africa,''
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, while noting there had been
difficulties on both sides.
	   The EU has balked at lifting tariffs on South African wines,
fruit, cut flowers and vegetables, and South Africa tried to
protect its industries by exempting a range of manufactured
products from a reciprocal opening of its own market.
	   The Welsh, proud of organizing small local boycotts when Britain
and the rest of the EU refused to impose punitive trade embargos on
apartheid South Africa, gave Mandela the freedom, or key, of their
capital.
	   In brilliant sunshine at Cardiff Castle, a choir sang the South
African anthem ``Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika,'' or ``God Bless Africa,''
and Wales' ``Land of Our Fathers.''
	   Mandela dotted the ceremony with touches of informality.
	   ``I'll sing for you _ if you sing for me,'' he told a class of
7-year-olds in the castle grounds as he left the official party. He
broke into ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,'' and the kids sang
along, too.
	   He swung to the rhythm of a Welsh choir, Ardwyn, and during the
ceremony beckoned to 6-year-old Emma Williams, the granddaughter of
a local dignitary. Emma, wearing the Welsh national dress, climbed
on his lap and stayed there until it was his turn to make a speech.
	   ``The knowledge that local authorities all over Wales were
banning apartheid products from canteens and schools, and that the
universities, the Welsh Rugby Union and the choirs had cut their
links, was a great inspiration to us in our struggle,'' he said.
	   ``Democracy has brought new and even greater challenges,'' he
added. ``I will be able to tell my people that in the people of
Wales we have friends indeed, ready to join hands with us in
building a better life for all.''
	   Mandela met individuallly with several leaders, including the
Greek, Belgian and Portuguese prime ministers, and was meeting
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the summit host, later Tuesday.
	   British officials said the trade deal would cover 90 percent of
South African exports to the EU _ now running at more than dlrs 9
billion a year. The outstanding issues are over canned fruit and
vegetables, the aides said.
	   A 19th round of EU-South Africa trade negotiations ended last
week in Brussels with hopes of a breakthrough, but no final deal.
	   Mandela, in an interview with APTV, recalled that the
International Monetary Fund has said the big industrialized
countries have a duty to help poorer nations, particularly with
speedier lowering of tariffs.
	   ``It seems to me one of the most powerful points ... the fact
that we have the backing of such an organization,'' he said.

IMF sending special mission to Russia next week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with IMF quote, market rebounding
to close higher. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is sending a team
to Moscow next week to discuss new loans to help Russia stabilize
its shaky financial markets, government and IMF officials confirmed
Tuesday.
	   The IMF's chief representative in Russia, Martin Gilman, said an
``extensive dialogue'' is planned when the team arrives Monday, but
refused to say what kind of assistance may be offered.
	   ``We believe that what they are doing is appropriate, but the
current market situation and circumstances are not normal,'' Gilman
said. ``So we are looking at additional measures.''
	   Some officials and market analysts hope the IMF will provide a
bailout package, even though the fund and Russian government
officials have said repeatedly that the country is capable of
overcoming the crisis on its own.
	   The market rebounded on the news, with the Russian Trading
System closing 4.2 percent higher after seven straight days of
declines.
	   The market collapse late last month prompted fears of a
devaluation of the national currency, the ruble, which would lead
to a sharp rise in prices. Russian officials worry that inflation,
combined with the government's continuing inability to pay state
workers their wages on time, could lead to social unrest.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin as saying Russia had still not officially requested funds
beyond its current dlrs 10 billion lending program.
	   However, Vyugin confirmed that his trip to meet the IMF's top
officials in Washington, D.C., last week was aimed at securing
additional assistance to Russia.
	   ``It was these preliminary negotiations that I was involved in
last week in Washington,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Vyugin said the Russian government is aware that the IMF will
impose stringent conditions for additional aid.
	   The IMF has been pressing the government to boost tax
collections and rein in spending.
	   ``We do ourselves understand that the time for decisive and
tough measures has come, particularly in the sphere of budget
revenues,'' Vyugin said, according to Interfax.
	   A group of Russia's most powerful business leaders, commonly
called the ``oligarchs'' planned to meet late Tuesday to discuss
the financial crisis, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

	   NEWLY elected legislators will organise a presidential debate to
decide who will be president of the first Legislative Council of
the Special Administrative Region.
	   There are only two candidates for the post so far and both are
``old faces'' _ President Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai of the Provisional
Legislative Council and Andrew Wong Wang-fat of the pre-handover
body.
	   The suggestion for a debate was made by two pro-democrats, Lee
Wing-tat of the Democratic Party and Emily Lau Wai-hing of The
Frontier at Monday's informal meeting of legislators-elect to
discuss matters relating to its first session.
	   Twelve of the lawmakers, mainly from the two parties, voted for
the debate out of a total attendance of 30. There was only one nay
vote while others abstained.
	   The legislators-elect also decided the debate should be held on
29 June, three days before the election of the president during the
first meeting of the Legislative Council on 2 July.
	   When Monday's meeting came to the item on electing the
president, Mr Lee and Ms Lau proposed either a debate or question
time to choose the candidates.
	   There was consensus on holding the debate in which each
candidate would be given five minutes to introduce themselves and
then answer questions from fellow lawmakers. It will be the first
time in Hong Kong's representative politics that such a debate is
held.
	   Before 1993, the governor was automatically president under the
Letters Patent.
	   The legal clause was amended in 1993 to allow legislators to
elect the president from among themselves, in line with the
development of representative politics in Hong Kong.
	   The first elected president was Sir John Swaine. He was followed
by Andrew Wong Wang-fat who was uncontested in 1995.
	   Being an independent candidate in the May election, Mr Wong said
he would only mention how he would behave as president but would
decline to touch on his political position during the debate to
uphold the neutrality.
	   ``If you talk about your political opinion, you will be
questioned on your impartiality when you preside over the Legco
meetings once you are elected.'' The main duties of the president
are to preside over meetings and maintain rules and orders.

	   INDEPENDENT members of the Provisional Urban Council want more
powers if they are to form one body with their regional
counterparts.
	   They are opposed to government proposals to strip the councils
of their responsibilities for food safety and environmental
hygiene.
	   Their proposal will be presented to the Deputy Secretary for
Constitutional Affairs Maureen Chan Leung Mong-lin at the council's
standing committee session on Tuesday morning.
	   Under the proposal, the urban and regional councils will be
merged into a city council that will continue to look after food
safety and environmental hygiene. It will also be responsible for
arts and recreation.
	   One of the proposers, Jennifer Chow Kit-bing, said the new body
had won the support of six other independents on the council.
	   Ms Chow said if successful, the city council could also perform
functions currently undertaken by government departments and
statutory bodies.
	   There would be only one government department implementing the
council's policies _ the city management department to replace the
existing urban services and regional services departments.
	   The council would monitor the work of the city management
department, including its three separate service divisions of
hygiene, culture and recreation.
	   The city council, according to Ms Chow, would have 60 to 80
members, all directly elected by the public.

Lackluster Rios loses in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Barely going through the motions in
the third set, Marcelo Rios lost to Italy's Gianluca Pozzi on
Tuesday in the first round of the Wimbledon warmup tournament in
Nottingham.
	   Rios, the Chilean who is ranked No. 2 in the world and seeded
No. 2 for Wimbledon, appeared disinterested in the final set as he
lost 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 at the Nottingham Open.
	   Rios comfortably won the first set and was coasting in the
second before conceding a service break to Pozzi in the ninth game.
After Pozzi held serve to take the second set, Rios dropped the
final set at love, without even running after some shots.
	   Rios denied that he ``tanked'' the match, complaining that he
had only had 25 minutes of practice on grass and was not mentally
prepared.
	   ``If I have good practice and improve mentally, I can win
Wimbledon,'' he claimed. ``I wasn't feeling very good on the grass.
I always want to win but maybe it doesn't look like that.''
	   Rios said he could not remember the last time he lost a set 6-0.
	   Pozzi, ranked No. 59, said he was not surprised at the result of
the third set.
	   ``Maybe he (Rios) lost concentration,'' the Italian said. ``He
was playing one good shot and two bad shots. It's not too easy to
keep playing when someone's doing that because you know he's not
playing at his best.''
	   Pozzi, who turns 33 Wednesday, said he considered the victory as
an early birthday present.
	   ``It's not every day you beat the world No. 2,'' he said. ``This
is maybe not his best surface but he's one of the top guys.''
	   In other matches, second-seeded Jonas Bjorkman defeated Marc
Kevin Goellner of Germany 6-4, 6-4, and No. 4 Cedric Pioline of
France had a 6-4, 6-4 win over Sweden's Tomas Nydahl.
	   It was Pioline's first grass-court match since losing to Pete
Sampras in last year's Wimbledon final.
	   ``I think my game is going well on this surface,'' Pioline said.
``I played OK. You don't need much on grass, just one break. I
didn't have to save a break point, so I wasn't in danger.''
	   Fifth-seeded Todd Woodbridge of Australia was ousted 7-6 (7-2),
7-6 (7-3) by Wayne Black.

	   SMOKED, poached, steamed, fried or grilled, the exotic flavour
and taste of salmon come through.
	   Sandy Bay Paradise Penang executive chef Norbert Bell says the
secret of preparing salmon lies in the cooking time.
	   Overcooking will cause the fish to lose its flavour while its
flesh will become coarse.
	   ``The seasoning must also be light in order not to overwhelm the
salmon's natural taste and flavour,'' he explains.
	   It is best to grill or poach the fish before minimal seasoning.
	   A simple dish is salmon ragout, which can be made by cutting
poached salmon into cubes and mixing with fresh cream, fish stock,
white wine (optional) and mixed vegetables. Season lightly.
	   Bell recommends Norwegian, Tasmanian and Canadian salmon as they
are of good quality. However, frozen salmon should not be kept for
more than two months.
	   ``As for smoked salmon, one must keep it at about 5 degrees
Celsius to maintain its freshness,'' he adds.
	   Asked about how to choose salmon, Bell says the flesh must be
pink and firm to the touch.
	   He says salmon gained popularity, particularly among
weight-watchers and the health conscious, when research found it to
be effective in lowering cholesterol levels and an outstanding
source of Omega-three polyunsaturated fatty acids.
	   The Austrian chef, who graduated with a certificate of cooking
from the Vocational School for the Hotel and Restaurant Industry in
Austria, is adept at numerous types of cuisine - Filipino,
Australian, Swiss, German, Mexican and Austrian.

Ariane 5 launch slated for October; Eutelsat switched to Ariane 4
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Arianespace 1997 results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The European Space Agency has announced a
mid-October launch for its new Ariane 5 rocket, whose past troubles
and delays have forced officials to switch a Eutelsat satellite to
the older Ariane 4.
	   The Ariane 503 will instead carry a mockup of Eutelsat's W2
satellite and an Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator already delivered
to the launch site on the South American territory of French
Guiana, ESA said in a statement Monday.
	   It would be the first commercial launching of the new, larger
rocket ESA hopes will maintain the European consortium's global
lead in the commercial launch market.
	   In February, Arianespace admitted that the second launch of the
rocket last Oct. 30 experienced problems, after the first Ariane 5
launch from Guiana Space Center crashed in June 1996.
	   Officials reported at the time that the second rocket had a
``higher-than-expected roll'' after separating from its booster,
and that additional tests would be needed.
	   On Monday, ESA said that ``taking into account the time to
develop, test and integrate the mockup'' of the W2, ``the Ariane
launch is now scheduled for mid-October.''
	   As a result of the delay, a W2 communications satellite that was
to ride on the Ariane 503 will be placed on an Ariane 4 rocket, ESA
said. No launch date was given.
	   ESA had set a June launch for the 109th Ariane commercial
mission, but the plans were put off for a later undisclosed date
due to delays in satellite delivery, a spokeswoman said.
	   Arianespace announced Tuesday its 1997 net profit fell to 77.4
million francs (dlrs 12.9 million) from 135 million francs dlrs
22.5 million) a year ago, coinciding with the company's
preparations to introduce a new generation satellite launcher.
	   The company had sales of 6.56 billion (dlrs 1.09 billion) in
1997, compared with 6.29 billion (dlrs 1.048 billion) a year
earlier. Revenues are generated by 17 satellites launched from 11
Ariane 4 launchers.

	   DIAOYU activists hope the mainland and Taiwan will provide
emergency backup if accidents occur when they head for the islands
on Sunday.
	   The Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands made its
requests on Monday to the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry and Chung Hwa Travel Services.
	   Members expect resistance from the Japanese defence force, but
say they will act peacefully, non-violently and reasonably.
	   Chairman Albert Ho Chun-yan said safety would be of paramount
consideration.
	   ``We are not asking for a military escort. We are unarmed and
just going to demonstrate our sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands.
	   ``We just ask for assistance from the mainland and Taiwan
administrations in cases of emergency,'' Mr Ho said.
	   He hoped both sides would put political disputes aside.
	   Members said they were disappointed that neither side had done
anything substantial on the islands' sovereignty issue.
	   The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry
refused to comment.
	   But a spokesman for the Chung Hwa Travel Services, who gave his
name as Mr Zhang, said Taiwan appreciated their courage and
passion.
	   Asked whether Taiwan would deploy warships as escort, Mr Zhang
just said: ``We will offer help pragmatically.'' Thirty activists
will set sail on Sunday and reach the Diaoyu Islands a week
tomorrow.

Thousands flee as shelling continues in Guinea-Bissau capital

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops and rebel soldiers
holed up in a military garrison in the capital of Guinea-Bissau
pounded each other's positions with artillery fire Tuesday in what
reportedly was the heaviest fighting since an army revolt 10 days
ago.
	   Bissau was rocked by about 90 minutes of shelling and clouds of
smoke billowed from the garrison in a suburb of the city, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Michael Kleiner of the International Red Cross said by telephone
from Geneva that Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was
deserted.
	   ``It was extremely heavy shelling,'' said Kleiner, who was in
touch with Bissau aid workers.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported more than
150,000 refugees in the area.
	   Kleiner said some 15,000 people were fleeing Bissau along the
road to Prabis, 18 kilometers southwest of the capital.
	   ``The big problem is the lack of drinking water and food for the
people on the road,'' Kleiner said.
	   Portugal made plans Tuesday to send 30 tons of medical and food
aid to its former colony in West Africa. Some 500 foreign residents
were to be evacuated by the Portuguese Navy frigate Vasco da Gama,
which was carrying marines, the Defense Ministry said.
	   The French Embassy was among the buildings damaged by shell
fire, and although no injuries were reported, the Foreign Ministry
in Paris said French nationals would be evacuated aboard the
Portuguese frigate.
	   Heavy rain swept across the country Tuesday, raising fears about
the spread of disease, especially cholera, with the onset of the
rainy season.
	   The deputy chief of the country's armed forces claimed Tuesday
that his troops, supported by soldiers from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea, were gaining the upper-hand.
	   ``They're on the retreat,'' Lt. Col. Afonso Te said in an
interview broadcast on Portuguese radio station RDP-Africa. There
was no independent verification of his claim.
	   He said the shelling created panic in the city, but said he
could not estimate the number of casualties.
	   Meanwhile, the rebels were entrenched at the complex where they
reportedly laid mines and booby traps.
	   Government forces took up positions in several other towns,
apparently to halt any spread of the revolt, Lusa reported.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva denied
rumors that President Joao Bernardo Vieira, who has not appeared in
public since the rebellion erupted, had fled the country.
	   ``I spoke to him twice'' on Monday, Delfim da Silva said in an
interview in Lisbon, where he was stuck due to flight
cancellations. Vieira was in Bissau, he said.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, have demanded that Vieira step down. Mane, a famed guerilla
fighter from the colonial war between 1961 and 1974, has accused
him of corruption and abuse of power.
	   An Africa analyst at Lisbon's Institute for International and
Strategic Studies said Vieira had apparently lost the support of
influential colonial war veterans and was relying on regional
alliances to keep him in power.
	   Vieira ``appears to be a hostage of the Senegalese troops, since
he had to rely on them to resolve an internal conflict. His silence
is also a sign of weakness,'' Fernando Jorge Cardoso said in an
interview.

	   PRESIDENT Jiang Zemin will officially open the new international
airport at Chek Lap Kok at a ceremony on 2 July, the government
announced on Monday.
	   A dancing dragon, formed by more than 500 people, will greet the
main guests arriving at the passenger terminal building about 10.30
am on the morning of the official opening.
	   A video show, lion dance, a performance by the Hong Kong
Children's Choir and a Kaleidoscope of String musical show will be
held before President Jiang unveils a plaque commemorating the
opening of the airport.
	   More than 3,000 guests have been invited to attend the ceremony,
including Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, Chief Secretary for
Administration Anson Chan Fang On-sang, Financial Secretary Sir
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen and chairman of the Airport Authority Wong
Po-yan.
	   Community leaders, members of the Executive Council,
legislators, members of the civil aviation and travel industries
and representatives of airport operators and contractors will also
attend.
	   Guests from overseas include representatives of governments with
close ties with Hong Kong and chairmen of other airport
authorities.
	   Foreign government figures at ministerial and director general
level have also been invited, a New Airport Projects Co-ordination
Office (Napco) spokesman said.
	   No formal announcement of the overseas guest list will be made.
	   Former governor Chris Patten is not among those invited, airport
sources revealed.

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Esmeralda may not move fast. But
apparently the 40-centimeter (15.7-inch), 7-kilogram (15.4-pound)
snapping turtle gets around fast enough to evade capture since
escaping a home terrarium last week.
	   It's the turtle's speed at snapping that worries owner Bernd
Buettner. Given the chance, Esmeralda could bite off a finger in no
time.
	   ``A cat or fox doesn't stand a chance against my snapping
turtle,'' Buettner said Tuesday.
	   No company would insure Esmerelda, and Buettner is offering a
reward of 500-700 marks (dlrs 280-390) to anyone who helps retrieve
the turtle.
	   ``I'll even go higher. I want the animal back,'' he said.

	   CHIEF Executive Tung Chee-hwa said on Monday he believed racism
would not take hold in Australia.
	   Mr Tung said he imagined Australia would remain a tolerant and
multicultural society even though Pauline Hanson's One Nation party
had won up to a dozen seats in the Queensland election.
	   ``But I will say that Australia has been a very successful,
tolerant society which practises multiculturalism.
	   ``And I can't imagine Australia deviating from this very
successful practice of the past,'' he told a business luncheon in
Sydney on the third day of his week-long tour of Australia and New
Zealand.
	   ``So far as this One Nation Party issue is concerned, I have
every confidence in the Australian people wanting to maintain the
multiculturalism that has made Australians so successful in the
past,'' he said.
	   Mr Tung said Hong Kong and Australia had always enjoyed a very
close relationship and this would be further enhanced in the
future.
	   ``That is the main point of my visit here, I know there's a lot
of debate at the moment about who you are and what you are, but
from Hong Kong's point of view, Australia is a very important
member in the Asia-Pacific region,'' he said.
	   On Sunday, he met Australian Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock, described as an ``old friend of Hong Kong'', to appeal for
a decision on electronic visa processing to be stepped up to enable
easier entry for visitors.
	   Meanwhile, Hong Kong businesses said they did not think trade
with Australia would suffer because of the emergence of One Nation.
	   Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong chairman Matthew
Cheng Chiu-man said: ``I doubt there will be any real impact on
businesses as businessmen are very pragmatic, and if they see a
good opportunity they are not going to let politics get in their
way.
	   ``But Australia, which is a multicultural and tolerant society,
will suffer from people's perceptions that it is racist even though
it is not.'' Officials from the Australian Education Centre, which
helps secure visas for Hong Kong students to study in Australia,
said their business would not be affected.
	   Spokesman Ivy Ngan Kit-fan said: ``In terms of the student
market there won't be any negative impact, because Hong Kong
parents are more concerned with the quality of their children's
education than the race issue.''

Pisa tower's suspenders should be up by fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ The Leaning Tower should be wearing its
supporting ``suspenders'' by October, experts said Tuesday, but it
is too early to say when it will be safe to make the dizzying climb
up the monument.
	   Trying to keep the 12-century, 55-meter-high (180 foot) tower
from leaning farther, experts have already girdled the monument in
steel.
	   Now preliminary work to attach a pair of skinny steel braces to
help straighten the tower has just begun, and the ``suspenders''
should be in place by the end of October, said Michele
Jamiolkowski, head of the international committee of experts in
charge of the works.
	   Once the 103-meter-long (340 foot) cables are stretched from the
tower to anchors behind buildings on the north side of the tower
square, excavation under the monument can begin as part of another
plan to shift the tower by digging in the subsoil.
	   Jamiolkowski said it was premature to say when the tower might
be reopened to the public. The tower was closed to tourists in 1990
for fear it might topple over. It leans some four meters (13 feet)
off the perpendicular to its south side.

	   HOUSING Department staff are urging the Chief Executive to think
twice about privatising the department which they said would
jeopardise the quality of housing management.
	   An alliance comprising 26 of the department's unions will
petition Tung Chee-hwa's office this morning, according to a
statement issued on Monday.
	   A feasibility study of privatising the department has been
carried out over the past year without consulting the unions, the
statement alleges.
	   ``In face of the economic downturn, the alliance has strong
reservations as to the benefits the plan would bring either to
staff members or to members of the public,'' the statement said.
	   The crux of the privatisation dispute between the department and
the unions centres on possible staff cuts.
	   Privatisation would also result in less monitoring by the
government which is vital for good quality housing management,
according to the alliance.

World Cup: Kostadinov looks forward to return to Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LE COUDRAY, France (AP) _ Emil Kostadinov is hoping this game at
the Parc des Princes will be as successful as his last trip there
with Bulgaria.
	   In 1993, Bulgaria beat France 2-1 on two Kostadinov goals,
including the winner with 10 seconds left, to clinch a spot at the
last World Cup finals _ and knock the French out.
	   That was the last round of qualifying from Europe and Bulgaria
profited by going on to reach the World Cup semifinal in '94, its
best ever finish.
	   ``I have my best memory from this stadium,'' Kostadinov said
Tuesday at the team's training headquarters. ``This is something I
will remember all my life, so I have a lot of self-confidence right
now.''
	   Bulgaria will face Group D leader Nigeria Friday at the Paris
stadium in the second World Cup game for each.
	   ``Our team has to come 100 percent in focus,'' the striker said,
``and I think we'll show our strength.''
	   The team ran through one practice Tuesday, cutting down on the
twice-a-day sessions coach Hristo Bonev had been holding.
	   ``It will be important to get control at midfield,'' Bonev said
of Friday's match. ``Nigeria has its strengths and their
weaknesses. Their weak spot is their last line of defense, because
they are heading forward in some situations and there are empty
zones which we can use.''
	   Kostadinov is fighting for a spot in the starting lineup. He
came off the bench with 20 minutes to go in Bulgaria's 0-0 draw
with Paraguay last week.
	   ``It would have been better to play with three attackers against
Paraguay,'' the 30-year-old said. ``But any tactics would be great
if we win Friday.''

World Cup: Romania has four players injured after Colombia game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) - Romania has four players injured after its
game against Colombia and the doctor is ``busy over his head''
trying to get them back to play next week, coach Anghel Iordanescu
said Tuesday.
	   Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi has a bruised right leg with an open
wound and is in pain, and another midfielder, Dorinel Munteanu, has
a bruised left leg, less serious than Hagi's injury, Iordanescu
said.
	   Constantin Galca, a World Cup debutant, has a hematoma on his
right leg and striker Adrian Ilie, who scored Romania's goal for
the 1-0 victory against Colombia in their Group G opener, pulled a
muscle on his left leg.
	   The Valencia striker's goal gave the Romanians a solid chance to
qualify for the second round.
	   ``These are serious problems but our doctor hopes to make (the
players) fit to play against England,'' on June 22, said
Iordanescu.
	   Hagi, one of the stars of the '94 World Cup in the United
States, was a far cry from his glorious days. He missed many passes
and seemed to have lost the ability to place lethal left-footed
shots from afar that earned him comparisons with Diego Maradona. He
was replaced in the second half.
	   The 33-year-old Hagi said he will retire after France from the
national team, but will continue to play for Galatasaray in the
Turkish first division.
	   Visibly satisfied with the victory, Iordanescu hailed Romania's
defense, ``that gave us so many headaches'' in the warmup games
prior to the World Cup.
	   ``The younger players that we used in defense were a pleasant
surprise, given their little international experience,'' the
Romanian coach said.
	   He said he expected more physical pressure from the English,
which ``we'll have to counteract with our tactical possibilities
and technical solutions.''
	   ``They have good players, like Alan Shearer, and we'll have to
be careful how to deal with them,'' Iordanescu said.
	   Romania has scheduled a warmup game on Wednesday against a local
team.

Two border policemen shot dead by illegal aliens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Two policemen have been killed on
Croatia's easternmost border crossing in a shootout with a group of
illegal aliens from Yugoslavia, a police statement reported
Tuesday.
	   The two unidentified officers were killed when they approached
the group stealing a police boat that was anchored on the Croat
side of Danube River border late Monday night.
	   Four of the assailants were also wounded in the ensuing
shootout.
	   According to preliminary investigations and contacts with
Yugoslav police, the wounded men made their way to a nearby
hospital in Yugoslavia where they received treatment.
	   Their identity is yet unknown.

	   A CHAMBER hearing will be held on Thursday to decide whether
margin investors of collapsed CA Pacific Securities can have their
shares returned to them from banks.
	   Investors claim they did not authorise the brokerage to carry
out margin transactions or guarantee their shares to banks.
	   The Official Receiver's Office agreed to a chamber hearing after
a meeting with representatives of CA Pacific.
	   Legislator-elect and solicitor Albert Ho Chun-yan was confident
investors would get their shares back.
	   ``Investors' shares being guaranteed to banks without consent
are problematic transactions and there is legal basis for margin
accounts to have their stocks back.'' Mr Ho estimates that the
value of guaranteed shares at almost $1 billion.
	   Meanwhile, investors expressed concerns over the huge cost of
liquidation.
	   They said the hourly pay had skyrocketed from about $400 to
$4,500 and $4 million would have to be spent.
	   Investors fear that no money would be left for compensation if
expenses kept soaring.
	   The Official Receiver's Office promised investors they would be
monitoring expenses closely.

Finnish driver Mika Salo loses cool, could face record fine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish Formula One driver Mika Salo is
not only fast on the track, he apparently has a quick temper.
	   After spending a night in a restaurant, he kicked in the door of
a taxi that failed to give him a ride, and possibly faces a record
fine of 64,700 markkaa (dlrs 12,000), reports said Tuesday.
	   The incident, in the early hours of Saturday, was witnessed by
several people, including foreign tourists who recognized the irate
racing driver, the Ilta-Sanomat daily reported.
	   The taxi driver, who refused to give Salo and his companions a
ride, said they had pushed in the line, the paper reported.
	   ``Of course, I didn't take him as he and his group were in the
middle of the queue,'' taxi driver Teuvo Piipponen told
Ilta-Sanomat.
	   But Salo jumped into the cab, shouting insults at the driver,
Piipponen said.
	   ``He threatened to smash the taxi meter data system,'' Piipponen
was quoted as saying. ``I was really amazed at the behavior of
Salo, who himself is a former taxi driver.''
	   Piipponen called the police, who questioned the racing driver.
Salo promised to pay for the damage estimated at 20,000 markkaa
(dlrs 3,700).
	   However, he could also face charges of causing damage to
property and if found guilty would have to pay a fine calculated on
his income, police told the newspaper.
	   With estimated annual earnings of more than 7 million markkaa
(dlrs 1.3 million), the fine would be 64,700 markkaa, the most ever
paid for such an offense in Finland, Ilta-Sanomat said.

	   DHL Worldwide Express has enhanced its portfolio of ``export
made easy''
	   service with the launch of ``USA First'', an improved air
express service to the US, across Asia-Pacific yesterday.
	   The company introduced ``USA First'' in response to changing
trade flows and shipping practices, as Asian exporters increasingly
target the US market and seek a more direct, fast and
cost-effective way to deliver than traditional shipping methods
offer.
	   ``USA First'' incorporates DHL's fully inclusive express
pick-up, streamlined Customs clearance and secure delivery service,
all for one low inclusive fee.
	   Mr Doug Lewis, DHL's commercial director for Asia Pacific/West
Asia, said the US market is of critical importance to the success
of exporters across the region.
	   ``As a trade facilitator and barometer of export trends, DHL has
recognised Asian exporters' increasing need for more direct, fast
and flexible deliveries to the market.
	   ``That is why we have introduced `USA First', to give exporters
every possible advantage in the competitive race to deliver their
products to the US as fast and as cost-effectively as possible,''
he said in a statement released in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   DHL's first class service to the US also extends to offering the
latest shipment pick-up times across Asia.
	   DHL's flexibility in using commercial airlines to ship to the US
allows exporters more time to prepare their shipments before
pick-up, ``as we are not hindered by having an aircraft waiting on
the tarmac with a set departure time.
	   ``Using DHL gives Asian exporters more time to prepare their
shipments and still have them delivered next day across the US,''
he added.

	   CA Pacific Group director Jason Wong But-sit and his wife will
have to wait another three months to see how the prosecutor
proceeds with their case.
	   Wong, 40, and wife Elizabeth Kong Suk-yee, 31, appeared in
Eastern Magistracy on Monday to face one count of false accounting.
	   As the prosecution needed more time for more interviews and to
finalise the charge, Magistrate Garry Tallentine allowed the case
to be adjourned until 7 September.
	   Justice Tallentine also allowed the couple to reduce their cash
bail from $2 million each to $1.5 million each.
	   They were also allowed to report to police once every fortnight.
	   The couple are accused of falsifying a $373 million loan
agreement between China Star Consultants and CA Pacific Finance
between 1 November 1997 and 19 January 1998.
	   The court also adjourned the case of listing company chairman
Simon Chan Ying-ming, 43, to 22 June.
	   The sole owner of Billion Finance was charged with one count of
operating an unlawful deposit-taking business.
	   His bail terms remained at $500,000 cash and $500,000 surety.

Plane piloted by Argentine man lands in Falklands Islands

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A plane piloted by an Argentine
man made an unexpected landing in the Falkland Islands, the
Argentine Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The pilot, identified as Ernesto Lucio Barcella, left Comodoro
Rivadavia, 1711 kms (1061 miles) south of Buenos Aires on Monday,
en route to the southern coastal city of Puerto Deseado.
	   For unknown reasons, Barcella apparently had to change his
flight plan, forcing him to landing at the Mount Pleasant military
base in the Falklands.
	   Argentines have not been able to travel to the Falklands since
the end of the 1982 Falkland Islands war. Great Britain maintains
sovereignty over the islands.
	   According to the foreign ministry statement, Barcella is
expected to return to Argentina without any problems.

	   THREE firemen who received bravery medals on Monday claimed the
true hero should be Lee Ying-kwong who died rescuing two brothers
from a Quarry Bay nullah during last Tuesday's rainstorm.
	   ``I feel so sad at Lee's death _ his ultimate sacrifice should
be highly praised. He is the true hero,'' said fireman Ho
Wing-keung who has been with the Fire Services Department for 16
years.
	   He said the rescue was conducted under conditions so dangerous
that their own lives were at risk.
	   ``But we were well prepared for the rescue mission,'' Mr Ho
recalled.
	   He cautioned people to be more careful during adverse weather
conditions.
	   Another hero, firemen Ho Fuk-ming recalled the unforgettable
moments during the rescue.
	   ``The power of the water current was so great that I nearly got
trapped in the water gate and could not move at all.'' He said it
took a long time to fight against the raging torrent to get to the
two boys.
	   ``There is no doubt Lee Ying-kwong (whose body was found off
Tsim Sha Tsui) should be highly praised for his bravery.'' Director
of Fire Services Henry Tang Siu who presented the awards said that

War crimes tribunal negotiators here the voice of experience

	   ROME (AP) - The memory is still vivid: The judgment at
Nuremberg; a tense young prosecutor listening to the verdicts ring
out.
	   ``Death by hanging. Death by hanging. Death by hanging,''
recalled Benjamin Ferencz, who tried 22 Nazi war criminals half a
century ago. ``I felt no excitement, no jubilation. It was a somber
moment.''
	   Envoys haggling over the world's first international court to
try war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity heard a
powerful sound on Tuesday: The voice of experience.
	   The most venerable was that of 78-year-old Ferencz, now a
retired law professor and a tireless campaigner for an
international criminal court.
	   ``I have come to Rome to speak for those who cannot speak _ the
silent victims of monstrous deeds,'' he said in his speech to the
delegates.
	   Ferencz as well as judges from the ad hoc tribunals on Rwanda
and the former Yugoslavia all spoke at the second day of the
five-week U.N. treaty conference.
	   The Nuremberg tribunal gave birth to the idea of a world
criminal court; the horrors of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia
revived it. Now delegates from 153 countries are trying to surmount
huge differences and give it life.
	   ``If we care enough and dare enough, an international criminal
court _ the missing link in the world legal order _ is within our
grasp,'' Ferencz said in his speech. ''The place to act is here and
the time to act is now.''
	   Later, in an interview, he recalled his days as a war crimes
prosecutor.
	   Ferencz says he'd ``peered into Hell'' as a soldier witnessing
the liberation of Nazi death camps. As a young lawyer, he jumped at
the chance to become a Nuremberg prosecutor.
	   He prosecuted 22 Gestapo officers accused of murdering more than
1 million people. They were the commanding officers of special
``elimination'' units: the infamous massacre at Babi Yar was part
of their handiwork.
	   ``There was no doubt in my mind that they were mass murderers on
a grand scale,'' said Ferencz.
	   All were convicted; 13 were sentenced to hang.
	   Fifty years later, the country they served, Germany, is one of
the most forceful advocates of the world court that drew Ferencz to
Rome. He's persuaded other ex-Nuremberg prosecutors to attend the
conference as well.
	   ``We're trying to be a presence, to say: Look here. We're
watching you. Don't say you can't do it,'' he said with a smile.
``We did.''
	   Hopes are that at the end of the Rome conference, the delegates
will agree on a treaty setting up a court to try individuals for
war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The treaty would
then have to be ratified by participating nations.
	   Wide differences exist on exactly how the court would function,
especially on who or what would trigger prosecutions and what the
role of the U.N. Security Council would be.
	   Representatives from Nuremberg's progeny, the ad hoc tribunals
for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia tribunals, also spoke to the
assembly Tuesday, giving advice based on hard-won experience.
	   They said there has to be a mechanism to allow investigators and
prosecutors to gather evidence unhindered and a way to protect
witnesses.
	   The United States finds itself relatively isolated at the
conference by its insistence that the Security Council have what
amounts to ultimate control. Others want a court independent of the
council with a prosecutor who has the power to initiate cases on
his or her own.

World Cup: Scotland-Norway 0-0 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Scotland, needing a win or a draw to
keep its World Cup hopes alive, was tied 0-0 with Norway at
halftime of their Group A match Tuesday.
	   The Scots, who lost to Brazil in their opening match last week,
controlled most of the half, with Christian Dailly working
especially well moving the ball down the left side.
	   But while Norwegian goalkeeper Frode Grodas was kept busy
catching headers and punching away corners, he didn't have to make
a tough save. Dailly had the best scoring chance at the far post in
the fourth minute, but he headed the ball across the face of the
goal.
	   Norway's one quality shot came in the 28th minute on Roar
Strand's close-range effort from the right, but Scotland keeper Jim
Leighton made the sliding save.
	   The Norwegians scored both their goals off set plays in a 2-2
draw with Morocco last week, but Scottish defender Colin Hendry was
winning the aerial battle with tall striker Tore Andre Flo, keeping
the Scandinavians' scoring chances at bay.

	   ONE of the first Chinese nationals to compete in the most
gruelling marathon in the world described the experience as ``going
to hell and back''.
	   Mabel Au-Yeung Wai-man, marketing and fund manager for the
Society for the Promotion of Hospice Care, joined the Marathon des
Sables to raise funds.
	   ``The proceeds are for developing services at the Bereavement
Counselling Centre in Lai Kok Estate in Mong Kok,'' said Ms
Au-Yeung.
	   She has raised $1.2 million in donations since she began
training for the race last December.
	   The marathon ``of the sands'' is the most strenuous and
punishing international competition in the world, requiring seven
days to complete the 229 kilometre course through the Sahara
Desert.
	   ``I've run in 13 other marathons in the world and they were only
42 km each,'' said Ms Au-Yeung.
	   ``I had to carry a rucksack weighing 11 kilos for a week and was
given nine litres of water to carry a day.'' Ms Au-Yeung and four
other Hong Kong residents started the race on 29 March and carried
the SAR flag through the finish line on 4 April.

	   VS INDUSTRY Bhd, a plastic injection moulder and manufacturer of
electronic parts and compoanents, said its new manufacturing
facility at Shenzhen, China, will contribute between a 5 and 10 per
cent increase in the group's turnover by the end of this year,
director Mohd Nadzmi Mohd Salleh said.
	   He said this will be realised when the Shenzhen facility goes
into full production over the next few months, from the current 65
per cent.
	   Subsidiary VS Corp (Hong Kong) Co Ltd is investing US$10 million
(US$1 &QC;  RM4.08) in the seven-month-old plant and equipment and
machinery.
	   VS Industry posted a turnover of RM200.71 million for the year
ended July 31 1997. For the first six months ended January 31 1998,
it achieved a turnover of RM95.74 million at company level and
RM98.61 million at group level.
	   ``We are getting new contracts and hope to fulfil the orders
within the next few months,'' Nadzmi told reporters after the
listing of VS Industry shares on the main board of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange yesterday.
	   Among the new multinational customers of VS Industry are Samsung
and Philips.
	   ``We are fortunate that the electronics industry is not much
affected by the economic slowdown. The demand for products,
especially household goods, is still buoyant and growing,'' he
said.
	   He added that the Shenzhen facility, which allows easy market
access to MNCs based in China, Hong Kong and Japan, will match VS
Industry's plant in Senai, Johor, which contributes RM200 million
to sales turnover.
	   Nadzmi said the company exports 100 per cent of its production.
More than 50 per cent of plastic moulds produced by the group are
for making audio components while the rest are used for secondary
assembly processes such as silk-screening and spray painting.
	   VS Industry shares opened at a 15-sen premium over the offer
price of RM1.90 with six lots changing hands. It was traded to a
high of RM2.13 and a low of RM1.51 before closing at RM1.88 for a
two-sen discount.

	   TOBACCO bosses were invited by a High Court judge on Monday to
answer claims they sold cigarettes worth billions of dollars
knowing they would be smuggled to the mainland.
	   Justice Wally Yeung called on representatives of British
American Tobacco (HK) and BAT subsidiary Brown and Williamson to
address him on the issue.
	   The judge has to decide whether Jerry Lui Kin-hong, who took $23
million in cash bribes while an employee of both firms, should hand
over his gains to his former employers.
	   The law only allows restitution to be paid to Lui's employer,
either BAT (HK) or Brown and Williamson, but not the government.
	   Mr Justice Yeung said he had power to award either firm just $1
or the full $23 million but wanted to assess the attitude of the
companies first.
	   Lui, 42, was found guilty last week of conspiring with former
directors of Giant Island Ltd to accept advantages between August
1988 and May 1993.
	   For 16 months of that time Lui was director of exports for BAT
(HK) Ltd and took the cash to ensure the supply of duty-not-paid
cigarettes to Giant Island.
	   Mr Justice Yeung said: ``The evidence as adduced by the
prosecution seemed to suggest that at all material times BAT was
aware, and management of the company was aware that large
quantities of cigarettes worth billions of dollars would ultimately
end up in the mainland.
	   Inviting both firms to address him, the judge said: ``I do not
wish to be seen to condemn a party without giving it the chance to
be heard first.'' Prosecutor John Reading said: ``The evidence
indicates that not only were B&AMP;W and BAT aware that smuggling was
going on but as a consequence of smuggling large companies have
derived a huge return from the sales.'' He said a decision on
restitution should not involve the cigarette companies at all.
	   Costs running into millions of dollars incurred in extraditing
Lui from the US and putting him on trial are also being sought by
the Department of Justice.
	   Mr Justice Yeung said there were competing interests between
that and the possible restitution order.
	   ``It may well be if Lui pays one sum he cannot pay the other.
The prosecution is in conflict with BAT and B&AMP;W,'' the judge said.
	   Prosecutors valued Lui's assets at $23.5 million in 1996, but
that included $9 million for a flat in Redhill and other property
which may have gone down in value amid the slump.
	   The tobacco firms will be invited to address the court on 25
June.

	   AKN Technology Bhd, en route to a listing on the second board of
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), has projected group sales
of RM55 million for the year ending March 31 1999.
	   For the year ended March 31 1998, the technology-based group
raked in RM46 million in sales. This was disclosed by group
managing director Ong Hean Kooi at a press conference after AKN's
underwriting signing ceremony in Penang yesterday.
	   The AKN group, a fully-integrated interconnect solutions
supplier, is mainly involved in the electroplating and stamping of
leadframes for the semiconductor industry.
	   It is reportedly the only company in Malaysia, foreign or local,
to offer front-end and back-end electroplating for the industry.
	   The group, Ong said, has a market share of 20 per cent in Penang
- where most of its clients are based - and a 5 per cent market
share nationally for leadframes.
	   ``We hope to grow another 10 per cent in the Penang area in the
next one to one-and-a-half years and 10 per cent in Malaysia,'' Ong
said, adding, however, that the group is only a small player
internationally with less than 1 per cent market share.
	   The global leadframe market is worth about US$4 billion (US$1  &QC; 
RM4.08) with the Malaysian market alone worth US$1 billion.	   The group exports 40 per cent of its total production to
Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong, China
and Japan. The rest of the sales are to multinational companies
operating in industrial zones in Penang and throughout the country.
	   Ong said AKN has a 70 per cent market share in solder plating
for the northern region which is worth some RM15 million.
	   He said the group is able to be more competitive now due to the
depreciated ringgit as its sales are mainly US dollar denominated.
	   Asked whether it is the appropriate time to be listed due to the
dismal market conditions, Ong said: ``We are a long-term player and
getting listed adds credibility to the company.''
	   Expected to be listed at the end of August, AKN's flotation
involves an issue of 3.95 million new ordinary RM1 shares each to
the Malaysian public.
	   Out of the amount, 3.07 million shares will be available for
subscription by the public, out of which 30 per cent or about
900,000 shares are Bumiputera participation. Another 885,000 shares
have been reserved for eligible employees and directors of the AKN
group.
	   AKN will have 25 million shares representing its entire issued
and paid- up share capital upon listing. Arab-Malaysian Merchant
Bank Bhd is the adviser and managing underwriter for the flotation.

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with more reaction; edits throughout &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Au Pair &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ ``Absolutely fantastic,'' Susan Woodward
said Tuesday after hearing that her daughter Louise is free to come
home after an appeal court upheld a reduction in her sentence for
the death of a child in her care.
	   Mrs. Woodward had nothing more to say to reporters, and closed
the door of her home. Others in the Cheshire village were delighted
but the reaction was much more subdued than at other key moments in
the case.
	   The highest appeal court in Massachusetts upheld a ruling by the
trial judge, Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that Louise
Woodward's sentence for second-degree murder should be reduced to
manslaughter and the sentence to the time she had already served.
	   ``I'm really pleased with the news, but I'm surprised, I thought
people would have been here in their thousands,'' said Thomas
Maddocks, 78, who found just a few drinkers at the Rigger pub,
which has served as headquarters for local supporters.
	   It had been packed on the day Miss Woodward was convicted of
killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, and again on the day her
sentence was reduced.
	   ``I can't understand it, everyone was here for the verdict and
for everything else. I suppose it's been going on for so long and
the final came and people had had enough,'' Maddocks said.
	   Julie Smith, the landlady at the Rigger, said she was ``pleased
she's coming home and we'll take it from there.
	   ``We've not forgotten that a baby was killed. We've all got
children or grandchildren. I'm scared to say anything in case it
might get misconstrued,'' Mrs. Smith said.
	   ``We can hardly believe it, everyone as you can imagine is
absolutely over the moon,'' said Roy McCabe, a family friend.
	   ``The main thing is that she is coming home, but I don't think
the fight is over. We still have to find the honest truth in all of
this.''
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the trustees of the appeal fund,
said he was relieved that the court had finally made its decision.
	   ``I am obviously very pleased that the appeal has been upheld
and that she will at last be able to come back.
	   ``We have still not got to lose sight of the fact that there is
a dead baby at the end of it and we still feel for the Eappen
family and their pain must be increased because of this verdict,''
Davey said.
	   ``I am sure Louise will be very pleased with the verdict and she
will be longing to get back and get her life back to normal, or as
normal as possible.''
	   Jean Antrobus, who stopped by at the Rigger, said the court's
ruling was ``brilliant news.''
	   ``I don't think the conviction should stand but at least it
means she's coming home,'' Mrs. Antrobus said.
	   ``She's only a girl herself. It doesn't alter the fact that
Matthew died and I feel very sorry for his parents, but it's time
that she came home and to put everything behind us.''
	   Ann Bradshaw of Elton said she was ``so glad it's all over'' for
the Woodwards.
	   ``In recent weeks it's got totally out of hand because it
dragged on so long,'' Mrs. Bradshaw said. ``Now everyone knows
where they stand and can get on with their lives.''

 &UR; Report: Alleged U.S. violations of START I threaten START II's
ratification &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian military alleges the United States has
violated some provisions of the START I arms reduction treaty, a
news agency reported Tuesday. But the Foreign Ministry said it was
not aware of any complaints.
	   Even the report of such concerns, however, could further delay
the long-stalled ratification of the next nuclear arms-cutting
agreement, START II, by the Communist-dominated Russian parliament.
	   Russian military leaders raised their concerns at a meeting in
Moscow on Monday with Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Interfax said, quoting an unidentified
senior Defense Ministry official.
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the report,
and Foreign Ministry spokesman Igor Nesterushkin told The
Associated Press he was not aware of any complaints.
	   Interfax said the Russian military complained that Britain is
testing Trident ballistic missiles to see whether they could carry
10 to 12 warheads, more than the eight allowed by START I.
	   It said Britain is conducting the tests at a U.S. testing range
with American assistance, raising fears the two countries are
cooperating to circumvent the treaty.
	   Russia also alleges the United States has changed the coating on
landing gear parts of B-1B strategic bombers, Interfax said. It
said that would make it easier for the United States to restore the
bombers' capability to carry cruise missiles.
	   Finally, Interfax said the Russian military objects to
uncontrolled scrapping of American MX missiles.
	   ``Such an approach arouses uncertainty that all stages of all MX
missiles will be destroyed,'' Interfax said.
	   The START I treaty, signed by U.S. President George Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, slashed the two
countries' nuclear arsenals by one-third. After the Soviet
collapse, former Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan
shipped nuclear weapons left on their soil to Russia for
destruction.
	   In 1993, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin signed the
START II agreement, which would halve the remaining Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to 3,500 warheads each.
	   The treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, but the
Russian parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has balked,
saying it would damage Russia's security and be too expensive for
the cash-strapped nation.
	   The Duma's deputy speaker, Vladimir Ryzhkov, also warned Tuesday
that any NATO strike against Serb-led troops in Kosovo would likely
ruin hopes for the START II ratification.

	   A ``MOONLIGHTING'' customs official was bribed by a merchant and
his clerk to prepare false permits for a container load of
counterfeit Marlboro cigarettes bound for Singapore, the District
Court heard on Monday.
	   Yeung Kam-fai, 47, himself a former customs official, and Hung
Ting-ting, 39, a clerk, were found guilty after trial of conspiring
to offer advantages to a Customs and Excise official, Hsu Kam-wing.
	   In 1991 Yeung became proprietor of Rainbow Ltd, and in mid-1997
assisted by Hung, asked Hsu to personally prepare applications for
import and export permits for a consignment of counterfeit Marlboro
cigarettes from Zhuhai, destined for Singapore.
	   Hsu was given immunity by the Independent Commission Against
Corruption to give evidence.

	   FOR years, developers have argued that the RM25,000 price cap on
each low- cost unit was no longer tenable, that it had become a big
burden on their small shoulders. The Government last week announced
that the ceiling will be increased to a maximum RM42,000, depending
on the location, environment, design and building materials used.
In addition, it is also expected to relax the ruling that requires
developers to allocate 30 per cent of a project to low-cost
housing. These is extremely good news for the industry, especially
now that everybody is facing economic problems.
	   Developers will now have more room to manoeuvre, either to cut
losses or improve profits.
	   The developers were not being unreasonable when they asked for
the ceiling price for low-cost houses to be raised. Prices of
building materials have gone up considerably since the ceiling was
introduced about 20 years ago. Also, the price of land has also
gone up, in some areas more ridiculously than others. Even the
National Economic Action Council, the body set up by the Government
earlier this year to find solutions to problems brought about by
the regional downturn, was supportive of the moves to raise the
price of low-cost houses and reduce the 30 per cent quota imposed
on private developers. The Housing and Local Government Ministry
conducted an in-depth study and found that in places like Kuala
Lumpur, Penang and Johor Baru, the price of low-cost houses should
not be that low.
	   The question now is could there have been other ways of dealing
with the issue without raising the ceiling price. Land earmarked
for low-cost housing projects, for example, can be sold at more
attractive rates as an incentive to developers. According to some
estimates, the cost of building a low-cost unit can range from
RM35,000 to RM50,000, depending on the land premium. If state
governments can provide very generous subsidies for the development
of low-cost housing projects, half the problem would have been
solved. The other half of the problem might have been solved by
using cheaper, locally-produced building materials, as suggested by
Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat Junid
Megat Ayob last week.
	   But now that the ceiling price for low-cost houses will be
increased, it is hoped that the authorities and the developers will
start looking at other aspects of housing which are no less
important. For years, house buyers have complained about the rapid
increase in prices for the so- called medium-cost houses. These are
houses meant for those who are not eligible for the low-cost homes
but are earning only a few hundred dollars more than the ones
entitled to the cheaper units. A medium-cost unit in a new estate
on the fringes of Kuala Lumpur, for example, could cost well over
RM200,000 just before the start of the economic slowdown. Such
units used to be priced at just below RM100,000 five years ago,
which was not that long ago. And despite the slowdown, there has
not been a marked reduction in the prices of such houses. Or, even
if a the prospective buyer is willing to invest that much, the
banks are no longer willing to give out loans to this unproductive
sector.
	   A price monitoring unit within the ministry or the NEAC,
perhaps, should be introduced to prevent price speculation in
future. There is also need to be more mindful of comfort and the
environment when creating a housing project anywhere. Parks and the
size of a medium-cost home's garden have become way too modest
these days as developers try to compress the dimensions of the
houses they build into boxes not much bigger - at times smaller -
than low-cost units. To ease the ``burden'' of banks under pressure
to lend to house-buyers, the Employees Provident Fund should really
try and introduce a much-friendlier scheme. It does not have to
look further than beyond the Causeway to find an interesting model.
The aim is to make buying a house less of a burden for the wage
earner and being able to live in one comfortable enough to call
home. The Government has heard the developers; it's high time they
both now listen to the house buyers.

	   AN industrial-sized bottle of wine is not what one would expect
to find in a Christie's auction of fine vintages, but that is
exactly what's on offer at an auction of ``legendary'' wines on
Thursday.
	   The jeroboam of rare Le Pin 1982, worth up to $300,000, will go
under the auctioneer's hammer at the Hong Kong V &AMP; S de Vinexpo,
the first international wine and spirits exhibition for the
Asia-Pacific region at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Centre on 18 June. ``The size of the bottle, being five litres,
alone is enough to merit comment, as there are only very few left
in existence,'' a spokesman for Christie's said.
	   The auction is expected to realise more than $6 million. More
than 300 lots, including vintages from Spain, Italy, Australia and
California will be auctioned.
	   The three-day Vinexpo is organised by the management of France's
Vinexpo, the world's largest wines and spirits exhibition held
every two years in Bordeaux.
	   Some 704 exhibitors from 31 wine-producing countries are to
attend the Hong Kong expo, the first time the organisers have held
one outside Bordeaux.

Thousands flee as shelling continues in Guinea-Bissau capital

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government troops and rebel soldiers
pounded each other with artillery fire Tuesday in what reportedly
was the heaviest fighting since an army revolt 10 days ago in the
capital of Guinea-Bissau.
	   Bissau was rocked by about 90 minutes of shelling, and clouds of
smoke billowed from the garrison in a suburb of the city, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Also Tuesday, heavy rain swept across the country, raising fears
about the spread of disease, especially cholera, with the onset of
the rainy season.
	   Michael Kleiner of the International Red Cross said by telephone
from Geneva that Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was
deserted.
	   ``It was extremely heavy shelling,'' said Kleiner, who was in
touch with Bissau aid workers.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported more than
150,000 refugees in the area.
	   Kleiner said some 15,000 people were fleeing Bissau along the
road to Prabis, 18 kilometers southwest of the capital.
	   ``The big problem is the lack of drinking water and food for the
people on the road,'' Kleiner said.
	   Portugal made plans Tuesday to send 30 tons of medical and food
aid to its former colony in West Africa. Some 500 foreign residents
were to be evacuated by the Portuguese Navy frigate Vasco da Gama,
which was carrying marines, the Defense Ministry said.
	   The French Embassy was among the buildings damaged by shell
fire. No injuries were reported. The Foreign Ministry in Paris said
French nationals would be evacuated aboard the Portuguese frigate.
	   The deputy chief of the country's armed forces claimed Tuesday
that his troops, supported by soldiers from neighboring Senegal and
the Republic of Guinea, were gaining the upper-hand.
	   ``They're on the retreat,'' Lt. Col. Afonso Te told Portuguese
radio station RDP-Africa. There was no independent verification of
his claim.
	   He said the shelling created panic in the city, but said he
could not estimate the number of casualties.
	   Meanwhile, the rebels were entrenched in a military garrision at
the complex where they reportedly laid mines and booby traps.
	   Government forces took up positions in several other towns,
apparently to halt any spread of the revolt, Lusa reported.
	   Guinea-Bissau Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva denied
rumors that President Joao Bernardo Vieira, who has not appeared in
public since the rebellion erupted, had fled the country.
	   ``I spoke to him twice'' on Monday, Delfim da Silva said in an
interview in Lisbon, where he was stuck due to flight
cancellations. Vieira was in Bissau, he said.
	   The rebels, led by former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane
Mane, have demanded that Vieira step down. Mane, a famed guerilla
fighter from the colonial war between 1961 and 1974, has accused
Vieira of corruption and abuse of power.
	   An Africa analyst at Lisbon's Institute for International and
Strategic Studies said Vieira apparently lost the support of
influential colonial war veterans and was relying on regional
alliances to keep him in power.
	   Vieira ``appears to be a hostage of the Senegalese troops, since
he had to rely on them to resolve an internal conflict,'' Fernando
Jorge Cardoso said. ``His silence is also a sign of weakness.''

Yeltsin-Milosevic meeting; Adds comment from defense minister,

 &UR; With BC-Russia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain reacted cautiously to reports of Tuesday's
meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic, saying it was waiting to hear whether Milosevic
had agreed to an immediate cease-fire in Kosovo.
	   The world's major industrialized powers including Britain and
Russia demanded Friday that Milosevic withdraw security units used
for civilian repression, allow unrestricted international
monitoring, facilitate the return of over 50,000 refugees, and
``make rapid progress'' in a dialogue with Kosovo's Albanian
leadership.
	   After meeting with Yeltsin and Russian officials for several
hours, Milosevic agreed to resume negotiations with Ibrahim Rugova,
a moderate political leader of Kosovo's majority Albanian
population.
	   ``It's not clear if this amounts to anything new or just a
continuation of the dialogue which he had with Dr. Rugova in May,''
a Foreign Office spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   ``And we're waiting to see what Milosevic has said about the
much more specific requirements on dialogue'' _ that it resume
quickly, be continuous, and produce ``meaningful early results,''
the spokesman said.
	   Milosevic and Rugova met in May but the Albanian leader canceled
further talks until Serb government troops halt a reported
offensive in western Kosovo. Since March, more than 300 people have
been killed as Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on
Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.
	   In a joint statement, Yeltsin and Milosevic agreed that
Yugoslavia would not carry out ``repressive actions against
civilians'' and would reduce the presence of security forces
outside their permanent bases, but only ``as terrorist activities
stop.''
	   It appeared that this would fall short of the demand by foreign
ministers of eight nations _ the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan and Canada _ for an immediate
withdrawal of military units.
	   In the joint statement, Milosevic also guaranteed ``complete
freedom of movement'' in Kosovo, ``unlimited access to humanitarian
aid,'' ``unrestricted return for all refugees'' and ``no
restrictions on the work of international monitors who are
accredited in Yugoslavia.''
	   While the major powers are hoping for a diplomatic solution in
Kosovo, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said NATO air exercises over
Macedonia and Albania on Monday ``demonstrated that we have the
military capacity to intervene if we have to.''
	   At his news conference in Moscow, Milosevic maintained a defiant
attitude towards NATO, saying his agreement to negotiate was based
solely on his desire to find a peaceful solution.

Suspect arrested in attack on senior tax official in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have detained a
suspect in a grisly attack on a top regional tax official, the tax
service said Tuesday.
	   Two assailants armed with hammers badly injured Olexander
Manushin, chief tax inspector for the eastern city of Pavlohrad,
smashing his hands and breaking his skull.
	   Manushin had been checking the records of several coal and metal
companies and had exposed tax violations amounting to more than 1
million hryvna (dlrs 500,000), according to the State Tax Service.
	   The suspect, who worked for one of the companies, paid dlrs
3,000 to the two attackers for ``warning'' Manushin earlier this
month, the tax service said in a statement cited by the Interfax
news agency.
	   The tax service says 225 crimes have been committed against its
workers over the past several years, including six murders and
numerous beatings and arson attacks.

	   BUMIPUTERA entrepreneurs have made considerable progress in
Penang's manufacturing sector, Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu
Koon said yesterday.
	   Citing survey figures, Koh said out of 443 factories in Penang
Development Corp (PDC) industrial parks in the state, almost half
or 48.5 per cent now have Bumiputera equity participation.
	   Out of these, 48 are with majority or 100 per cent Bumiputera
equity holding, while the remaining 167 are with significant
minority equity, many with 30 per cent or more, he said.
	   ``This is an increase of 85 per cent since 1990 from 26 firms to
48 firms with majority or 100 per cent Bumiputera participation and
an increase of 67 per cent from 100 firms to 167 with minority
Bumiputera equities,'' Koh said in a speech at the underwriting
signing ceremony for Penang-based Bumiputera company AKN Technology
Bhd.
	   Describing it as a challenge to develop even more local
``technopreneurs'', both Bumiputera and non-Bumiputera, Koh said it
may be more effective to draw from the pool of Malaysian engineers
and professionals serving in multinational or local large
corporations.
	   ``This is because they already have the exposure, experience and
expertise in the technological, managerial and marketing aspects of
the manufacturing sector,'' he said.
	   The pool of Bumiputera expertise in PDC's industrial parks, he
said, had tripled to 1,211 at the end of 1997 from only 384 in
1990. ``The increase in the category of technical and supervisory
staff meanwhile quadrupled to 9,949 from 2,688 previously.''
	   Koh said the emphasis now is to encourage more Bumiputera
professionals to set up their own firms and in smart partnership
with non-Bumiputera Malaysians and even foreign multinational
corporations.
	   He asked local small- and medium-sized industries and those
interested to contact the SMI centre and the Bumiputera
Entrepreneur Development Unit of the PDC as well as the Bumiputera
Participation Unit of the Prime Minister's Office which has an

	   A DELIVERY worker's shortcut in bringing bread and cakes down a
basement supermarket ended with an elderly customer tumbling down
stairs, according to a writ.
	   Pau Ho Sau-king, who turns 79 on 1 August, complained of
``depression, feelings of worthlessness and occasional suicidal
ideas'' as a result of the 11 September 1995 incident.
	   She stayed in hospital for eight months when she underwent
various operations, including the removal of a pelvic bone to fix
her fractured elbow.
	   The woman also suffered fractured vertebrae, according to the
document filed to the High Court.
	   She had since developed complications of osteoporosis _ the
abnormal loss of bony tissue, causing fragile bones which fracture
easily.
	   Mrs Pau was walking up the stairs as she was leaving Wellcome
supermarket in Johnston Road, Wan Chai.
	   Rushing down the stairs was Man Chi-ki with eight plastic racks
of cakes and bread. It was alleged in the court document that the
racks suddenly slipped out of the worker's grasp.
	   The goods landed on Mrs Pau who lost her balance and fell.
	   Lawyers for Mrs Pau named the supermarket, Mr Man and his
employer _ Garden Co Ltd _ as defendants.
	   The plaintiff alleged that delivery should have been made
through the goods delivery chute on the other side of Johnston Road
instead of the stairs leading to the supermarket.
	   No specific amount of damages was mentioned in the writ and no
date has been fixed for a hearing.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The Williams sisters could collide in
the fourth round at Wimbledon _ but only if their teen-age rivals
don't knock them out first.
	   By the luck of Tuesday's draw, Venus and Serena Williams were
grouped in the same section with 17-year-old stars Anna Kournikova
of Russia and 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic of Croatia.
	   The sixth-seeded Venus, who turns 18 Wednesday, will face Jana
Nejedly of Canada in the first round, while Serena plays Laura
Golarsa.
	   Serena, 16, would probably face Lucic in the second round and,
if she advances, meet Kournikova in the third.
	   Venus, the U.S. Open runner-up last year, has an easier path and
is a better bet than her sister to reach the fourth round.
	   If the sisters do meet each other, it would be the third
all-Williams singles match this year. They played each other in the
second round of the Australian Open and the quarterfinals of the
Italian Open, with Venus winning both matches.
	   Serena, who won her first grass-court match Tuesday, beating
Naoko Sawamatsu 6-4, 7-5 in Eastbourne, called the draw ``cool.''
	   Kournikova, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals last year, was
philosophical.
	   ``A draw's a draw,'' she said. ``It's luck, and I'm going to
take it a match at a time. I'm not looking forward to playing the
third or whatever round.''
	   Another teen-ager, 17-year-old defending champion and top seed
Martina Hingis, drew a tricky first-round opponent in American Lisa
Raymond. No. 2 Lindsay Davenport will play Florencia Labat.
	   Hingis could face No. 3 Jana Novotna, the woman she beat in last
year's final, in the semis. Davenport would meet No. 4 Steffi Graf
in the other semifinal.
	   The 29-year-old Graf is continuing her comeback after a long
injury layoff. She opens against Gala Leon Garcia. No. 6 Monica
Seles, in Graf's half of the draw, opens with another Spaniard _
Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo.
	   The women's draw overshadowed the men's, where defending
champion and No. 1 Pete Sampras is slumping and looks nothing like
a sure thing to win his fifth title in six years.
	   Sampras was paired in the first round against Dominic Hrbary, a
Slovakian ranked 47th who led Sampras 4-2 in the fifth set before
losing at the 1997 Australia Open.
	   In the midst of a poor season, Sampras is in the top half of a
draw loaded with dangerous players _ including Yevegeny Kafelnikov,
Petr Korda, Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi.
	   Sampras could meet fellow American MaliVai Washington, the
Wimbledon runner-up in 1996, in the second round. Talented Swede
Thomas Enqvist could loom in the third and Australia's Scott
Draper, winner last weekend on grass at Queen's, in the fourth.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed, or Rafter,
the 1997 U.S. Open champion and No. 4 seed, could face Sampras in
the semis.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion who fashioning a comeback, is seeded
No. 13 and opens against 77th-ranked Spaniard Alex Calatrava. Next
he could meet rising German star Tommy Haas and then get Korda in
the fourth round.
	   The bottom half of the draw is much weaker with No. 2 Marcelo
Rios of Chile and No. 4 Greg Rusedski of Britain the highest seeds.
	   Rios is not a grass-court player. Rusedski is 50-50 for
Wimbledon after suffering a sprained left ankle last week. Rios
opens against Francisco Clavet and Rusedski faces a qualifier.
	   The prospective quarterfinals in the bottom half have Rios vs.
France's Cedric Pioline, the 1997 Wimbledon runner-up and No. 8
seed, and Rusedski vs. Carlos Moya of Spain, the French Open
champion and No. 5 seed.
	   The most compelling first-round match is Kafelnikov vs.
Australia's Mark Philippoussis, one of the hardest servers in the
game. However, the Australian has played poorly in recent months
and even considered withdrawing from Wimbledon.

Syrian president, Saudi foreign minister discuss Arab summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad and Saudi
Arabia's foreign minister held talks Tuesday on moves to convene an
Arab summit on the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   Little emerged from their meeting, suggesting Arab leaders were
still divided over the form and content of such a conference.
	   Presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said Assad and Prince Saud
al-Faisal discussed ``the developing situation in both the Arab and
regional arenas, as well as current contacts and consultations
among Arab sides.''
	   Prince Saud, who arrived in Damascus Monday, had told reporters
that the convening of a summit would top his agenda.
	   But Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said Monday the
summit should be well prepared, ``otherwise it will send a wrong
message to the Israeli government, a matter that will stiffen its
stubborn stands toward the peace process and the Arab rights in
general.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat proposed the summit, saying it
should blame Israel for the stalemate in the peace negotiations.
	   Jordan's King Hussein told reporters earlier this month that
Arab leaders could not agree on a summit's agenda, venue or
invitation list.
	   Some states, such as Syria, are known to be pushing for a summit
that would call for Arab states to break relations with Israel
because of its perceived intransigence on the peace process. Such a
move would be opposed by Egypt and Jordan, which have diplomatic
ties with Israel.
	   Israel-Palestinian talks have not advanced since March 1997 when
Israel began building a Jewish housing project in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.

	   WHAT is the third most printed book in English? Not many
Malaysians will be able to answer this question or figure out what
a herb ``boutique'' in the Legend Hotel has to do with the reply.
	   And the answer is (drumroll please), ``The English Physician''
by Nicholas Culpeper, published in 1652, a guide on how to treat
oneself using herbs from one's own garden.
	   Culpeper is also the name of a chain of herb stores started in
1927 by Mrs Carl Frederick Leyel, a practising herbalist and a
prominent member of the English upper class who achieved a certain
notoriety when she raised STG300,000 (STG1  &QC;  RM6.65) through
something called the Golden Ballot for
ex-servicemen after the World War I.	   Culpeper Ltd chairman Ian Thomas who relates the story, says,
Leyel was prosecuted for the Golden Ballot, fought her case and won
the right to raise money for charitable causes.
	   She set up Culpeper in 1927 when she was already 47, which was
rather an advanced age to venture into a business. But she was no
ordinary woman.
	   ``In 1927, nobody was really interested in herbs as they thought
it was very old-fashioned and herbs were associated with dirty
little shops. Mrs Leyel revived the total interest in herbs and
kept it going.
	   ``Her first shop was in Baker Street and from there she moved to
21 Bruton Street, just off Berkeley Square (all exclusive
addresses).
	   ``She set up this business, really, to give people a taste for
the wholesome and natural things of the earth. There were a lot of
herbal remedies of which we've still got some - and there were
herbal cosmetics.
	   She supplied a full range of about 200 medicinal herbs.
	   ``And she had very influential friends, having been on the stage
and also because of the Golden Ballot, through which she had
amassed an amazing list of supporters.
	   ``It was a success from the start and she built the business up
before the World War II to about 10 shops in what she calls the
spas and watering places of Great Britain, like Harrogate or
Bath,'' Thomas said.
	   He said Leyel continued to work well into her old age, and have
consultations throughout the war. ``Basically, she exhausted
herself and she died in 1957.''
	   Leyel also set up the Herb Society, the first of its kind in the
world, which was a meeting of interested amateurs, who meet and
discuss herbs.
	   When she died, the Herb Society took over Culpeper and ran it by
committee, basically, running it down slowly.
	   ``Looking back, they gave up some wonderful shops. They had
shops in High Street, Kensington, Knightsbridge and in the 1950s
and the 1960s they might have got 50-year leases with no reviews.
They were very well-meaning but the company just wasn't well-run.
	   ``Very often when you have a strong person like Mrs Leyel
running something, she leaves a vacuum when she dies,'' he said.
	   Then in 1972, when the company which had been consistently
losing money year-on-year had been reduced nearly to the point of
extinction, Thomas came in with a partner, Sir James Goldsmith, and
bought it over.
	   At that point, Culpeper was making losses of about STG10,000 a
year on a turnover of about STG60,000. The society had gradually
given up the shops Leyel had set up and finally to finance its
accumulating losses, it started to sell the herb books she had
amassed.
	   ``Mrs Leyel had built up this amazing library described as the
finest botanical library in private hands and they sold it to
finance their losses,'' Thomas said with a sigh of regret.
	   ``When we took over in 1972, the company still had the second
original shop in Bruton Street and it was just closing off a shop
in Ebury Street.
	   It began from there and we built it up basically on the same
principles as Mrs Leyel,'' he said.
	   And what kind of changes did Thomas make? ``Well firstly I put
up the prices. I thought everything was very nice but inflation was
just starting to take off, and the society had been terrified of
putting up the prices because they thought nothing would sell.
	   ``Then I tried to revive the products,'' he added.
	   Thomas described Culpeper as a ``sweet'' business. ``We had a
Mrs Fowler running it as managing director. I came in one day and
said, `Dorothy, we don't seem to have got any more pillows' (we
sold these herb filled pillows) and she said there are some coming
tomorrow.
	   ``When she came in the next morning, she looked tired and she
had black eye rings and so I asked her what she had been doing with
herself and she said, `nothing, nothing'.
	   ``It turned out later that she had made 12 pillows overnight,
you know, sat and sewed them because I needed some pillows and she
hadn't ordered any. That was the sort of business it was,'' he
said, laughing.
	   He bought out his partner in 1978 and has been running the
business ever since.
	   ``I basically run it as a hands-on business, which is the only
way I think you can build up a business. You may delegate things
like account and administrative functions but you can't delegate
the essential job of running the business.
	   ``The other thing you can't delegate is having control over
finance. I'm afraid I still sign every check and approve every
order because if you don't do this, the business unravels itself.
People absolutely adore spending other people's money.
	   ``Yes, I run the business on prudent lines, or puritanical
lines, whichever you'd like to call it. And it has been built up
fairly slowly.
	   We've never had outside finance in the company at all apart from
bank loans at strategic times.
	   ``Practically all of the business has been built up out of its
own resources and cash flow and I think that is the way businesses
should grow,'' he said.
	   Not that it has not seen its fair share of hard times. ``We had
a bad time in the 1980s when we over-extended in terms of the
number of shops we were opening and there was a downturn at that
time in the economy.
	   ``And I stopped buying everything, even papers. It was amazing,
because everybody then understood. I mean, the person who is
packing parcels for you does not necessarily understand about
interest rates, but if you tell him he can't have any notebooks
because money is short and why not take all that stuff he is
chucking into the waste-paper bin and, tear it in half, staple it
together and use the back as a notebook, he understands that.
	   ``And once they understand, they are contributing and helping
the prosperity of the business.
	   ``We still don't have any notebooks and we still collect all the
papers,''
	   he added as an afterthought.
	   Today, the business turns over just about STG4 million and makes
a profit of about STG250,000. It has 19 shops in the UK, four in
Japan and two in Malaysia, one at the Legend Hotel.
	   ``The four in Japan are unusual in the sense that there are not
any British retailers that actually have stand-alone shops in
Japan. We've had tremendous support from the Department of Trade
and Industry and our embassy over there.
	   ``We're also in New Zealand. We don't have a shop there but we
are the second leading brand in aromatherapy in New Zealand. Going
into that market was a sort of historical accident. Somebody went
out to New Zealand and sort of developed it at the right time. It
was not a planned thing.
	   ``The Japan thing was a planned thing because it was supposed to
be notoriously difficult to get into. But once you're into Japan,
it is to some extent the key to the rest of Asia.
	   ``This is because everybody recognises the Japanese are very
difficult in terms of quality and so to some extent your
positioning is more established by being in Japan than it would be
if say, we went into Hong Kong first,'' he said.
	   On whether he intends to go into the rest of Asia he said: ``I
would like to, we have talked to people in Korea, although it may
not be the best time to talk to people in Korea. And China is
obviously of interest,'' he added.
	   Thomas does not seem that keen on going into the US, however.
``My daughter used to work there and was always very keen on me
going into America. But with America, you are either flavour of the
month or you're dead on the sidewalk.
	   ``In Asia although it takes longer to establish and get in, I
think once you're here, once you're accepted, you're going to stay.
So it's a much better investment of my time to come out to Asia and
attempt this thing then it is to other countries,'' he said.

	   TWO first-time drug dealers were sentenced on Monday to 15 and
20 years in jail for distributing more than 38,000 ecstasy tablets.
	   Chui Chi-wai, 41, and Yip Kwan-on, 37, were convicted in April
for trafficking 18,797 tablets and some fragments, weighing 2,122
grams.
	   Yip was found guilty of a separate count of dealing with 19,892
tablets and some fragments, weighing 2,302 grams.
	   The long jail sentences handed down by Justice Mohammed Saied of
the Court of First Instance came only weeks after the Court of
Appeal sentencing guidelines on the rave drug.
	   MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, was found by the Court of
Appeal to be non-addictive or deadly and a term of at least eight
years was recommended for handling 800 grams or more.
	   The sentencing of Chui and Yip had been adjourned to allow for
the Court of Appeal guidelines.
	   Mr Justice Saied said the ``arithmetic progression'' for larger
amounts than 800 grams should be avoided.
	   However, as Yip was the local agent, a sentence of 20 years was
appropriate.
	   Chui had been described by his counsel William Lee, as ``not the
prime mover but a small fry''.
	   ``To say he was a small fry does not sway away his role as a
courier,'' Mr Justice Saied said.
	   After all, Chui was a willing participant in the crime for which
he must be jailed for 15 years, he said.
	   Chui returned to Hong Kong after living in Holland since 1989
and was the father to a son and a daughter.
	   In mitigation, Mr Lee pleaded that there was no evidence to show
that Chui had imported the haul into Hong Kong.
	   Chui and Yip were caught red-handed with the 18,797 pills inside
a travelling bag on 19 March last year.
	   Yip had just handed the bag to Chui in Granville Road, Tsim Sha
Tsui, when police swooped on them. The other tablets were
discovered in Yip's room in Cameron Road.
	   Duncan Percy, counsel for Yip, said the defendant ``played a
very minor role'' and ``was merely there to pass on the drugs to
others'' for a $6,000 reward.
	   Yip was desperate for money because he owed one of the drug
dealers $14,000 in gambling debts, the court heard.

Appeals court makes new ruling in case of British soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Supreme Court postponed a ruling
Tuesday on whether to hear new testimony that may settle an appeal
by three British soldiers convicted of killing a Danish tour guide.
	   The court did not say when it would decide the issue. The
prosecution and lawyers for two of the soldiers want the evidence
admitted. The lawyer for the third fears it could hurt his client.
	   The three soldiers were found guilty of kidnapping Louise
Jensen, a 23-year-old tour guide, outside a night spot in the
tourist resort of Ayia Napa. They then raped her, bludgeoned her to
death with a shovel and buried her in a shallow grave in a field.
	   They admitted kidnapping her but claimed they were too drunk to
remember what happened and tried to blame each for the rape and the
killing. The men were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison.
	   The new evidence concerns testimony of a former British police
officer, Michael Flack, who befriended the three soldiers while
serving time for burglary and theft in the same Nicosia prison.
	   Flack, 53, from Bexley in Kent, told British newspapers last
year that Alan Ford, of Birmingham, and Geoffrey Pernell, of
Oldbury, West Midlands, told him that the rape and killing was
carried out by the third soldier, Justin Fowler, 30, of Falmouth.
	   State prosecutor Petros Clerides claims the new evidence
``reinforces the guilt of the accused'' and could assist the
Supreme Court in rejecting their appeal.
	   The lawyers for Ford, 30, and Pernell, 27, believe the evidence
also could clear their clients.
	   Fowler's lawyer, Christos Pourgrourides, argued against
admitting the testimony, saying the former police officer was an
untrustworthy convicted criminal who was seeking publicity.
	   ``I have been informed that this man (Flack) has sold his story
for hundreds of thousands of pounds to the British press and this
could influence the case,'' Pourgrourides said.

Finnish driver Mika Salo loses cool, could face record fine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finnish Formula One driver Mika Salo is
not only fast on the track, he apparently has a quick temper.
	   After spending a night in a restaurant, he kicked in the door of
a taxi that failed to give him a ride, and possibly faces a record
fine of 64,700 markkaa (dlrs 12,000), reports said Tuesday.
	   The incident, in the early hours of Saturday, was witnessed by
several people, including foreign tourists who recognized the irate
racing driver, the Ilta-Sanomat daily reported.
	   The taxi driver, who refused to give Salo and his companions a
ride, said they had pushed in the line, the paper reported.
	   ``Of course, I didn't take him as he and his group were in the
middle of the queue,'' taxi driver Teuvo Piipponen told
Ilta-Sanomat.
	   But Salo jumped into the cab, shouting insults at the driver,
Piipponen said.
	   ``He threatened to smash the taxi meter data system,'' Piipponen
was quoted as saying. ``I was really amazed at the behavior of
Salo, who himself is a former taxi driver.''
	   Piipponen called the police, who questioned the racing driver.
Salo promised to pay for the damage estimated at 20,000 markkaa
(dlrs 3,700).
	   However, he could also face charges of causing damage to
property and if found guilty would have to pay a fine calculated on
his income, police told the newspaper.
	   With estimated annual earnings of more than 7 million markkaa
(dlrs 1.3 million), the fine would be 64,700 markkaa, the most ever
paid for such an offense in Finland, Ilta-Sanomat said.

	   THE Malaysian National Smallholders Association (PKPKM) has
requested for an additional RM300 million from the Treasury for the
replanting of rubber.
	   Its president, Datuk Ahmad Arshad, said the additional
allocation can be used to finance the re-planting of rubber which
is expected to cover 40,000ha to 45,000ha a year under the Seventh
Malaysia Plan (1996-2000).
	   ``Simultaneously, the fund can help 100,000 smallholders which
are categorised in the lower-income group and 500,000 others which
are affected as their rubber estates can no longer provide
income,'' he said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   The association, he said, had send a letter to Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on the
matter.
	   At present, Ahmad said the Government allocates RM112 million a
year to the the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority
(Risda) for the replanting of rubber. With such an allocation,
Risda can only replant 15,000ha of rubber trees every year.
	   If the additional allocation is approved, Ahmad said it could
develop 300,000ha of rubber smallholdings in the country and, at
the same time, create jobs.
	   Replanting of rubber, he added, is taking place at a slower pace
due to the lack of financial assistance.
	   ``The Government has granted RM500 million to help small
Bumiputera entrepreneurs ...we are asking for an additional RM300
million to help the rubber smallholders,'' he said.
	   Ahmad said accelerating the replanting of rubber will boost the
exports of the commodity, which is expected at between RM15 billion
and RM20 billion by the year 2010.
	   The association is also calling for Risda to be under the
purview of the Primary Industries Ministry.
	   It has sent a letter to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad on the matter.
	   Ahmad denied that the request is ``politically-motivated'',
saying that it is aimed at protecting the interests of the
smallholders. Furthermore, he added, the ministry has more research
and development activities which can further increase and improve
rubber products.
	   Meanwhile, PKPKM has also called upon the Federal and State
Governments to ensure Felda Palm Industries (FPI) Sdn Bhd offers
fair prices for fresh fruit bunches (FFB) to Felda oil palm
planters.
	   Ahmad said the price of FFB the FPI offers is said to be lower
than what is offered by private factories and not in accordance
with the standard price fixed by the Palm Oil Registration and
Licensing Authority (Porla).
	   ``Certain FPI factories offer about half that which is offered
by private factories.''
	   He claimed that at the moment although the price of palm oil is
high on the international market, Felda settlers still do not
obtain good prices as what FPI offers is much lower.
	   The FFB price offered by the FPI for FFB which is picked in the
same year also differs from the price offered for FFB which is
picked on the same day, he pointed out.
	   Apart from that, he claimed, FFB grading standards at FPI
factories are also not in line with professional standards.
	   Ahmad urged FPI to be fair, offer competitive prices and adhere
to the prices set by Porla, so that Felda oil palm settlers will
sell their FFB to them.
	   He called on FPI to standardise the price rates for FFB at all
its factories.
	   He also urged the local press especially companies which publish
Malay newspapers to quote daily cocoa prices.
	   He said this will be a timely move as the price of the cocoa has
risen recently to RM5 per kg.
	   He explained that the publishing of cocoa prices in Malay
newspapers will be helpful to smallholders who are mostly
Bumiputeras and who will thus be aware of the going rates for
cocoa.

	   FOUR teenagers accused of detaining and molesting two girls were
on Monday denied bail to sit their Hong Kong Certificate of
Education Examination.
	   The four were accused of teaming up with two cleaners, Hui
Ching-ngai, 17, Tai Chun-lin, 17, and a 14-year-old girl to detain
two teenage girls in two hotel rooms in Wan Chai on 10 June.
	   They faced two counts of false imprisonment, one count of
criminal intimidation and one count each of burglary, indecent
assault and common assault.
	   The Secondary Five students _ Cheng Gee-leung, 17, Yu Ka-ki, 16,
and schoolgirl Hsu Chi-yin, 17 and a 15-year-old boy _ asked
Magistrate Garry Tallentine for bail so that they could finish the
public examination.
	   But Mr Tallentine said the offences were serious and rejected
their request.
	   The prosecution alleges the four intimidated one of the victims
by threatening to injure her and strip off her clothes.
	   The other victim was taken to the other room and allegedly
assaulted by the 15-year-old accused.
	   The schoolboys and the others were also accused of ransacking a
bar in the same area that night and taking away a bottle of red
wine, three cans of beer and $60 cash.

	   A MILLION-DOLLAR reward was put up on Monday to help catch two
armed robbers who tied up staff in a jewellery shop and snatched
$10 million worth of jewels and gold ornaments.
	   Two men armed with a black pistol and a knife posed as customers
in the shop before they fled with $10 million of loot, including
diamonds and jade.
	   Police say a third man acted as a lookout outside the store in
Pei Ho Street, Sham Shui Po, during the robbery at about 9am on 30
November 1996.
	   A police spokesman said: ``The insurers are offering a reward of
not less than 10 per cent of the value of the stolen property
recovered for information on the crime.'' The two armed robbers had
moustaches, spoke English and some Cantonese and were wearing white
caps, sunglasses and dark leather jackets.
	   One was fat with a dark complexion, around 1.67 metres tall and
aged 28 to 30. The other, also with a dark complexion, was about
1.7 metres tall and aged 25 to 28.
	   The lookout was described as being aged about 25 to 28, thin,
with a dark complexion and about 1.67 metres tall.
	   He was wearing a long-sleeved yellow jacket.

	   WASHINGTON State's Chinese American governor Gary Locke has said
there was much America could learn from Hong Kong's aggressive
economic policies.
	   Mr Locke said Hong Kong's ability to thrive on global trade
interdependence was the key to its success.
	   ``Here in the United States, there is still a large element of
fear about interdependence,'' Mr Locke said.
	   He was speaking at a conference on Hong Kong with Administrative
Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang.
	   Mr Locke said the difference between fear and confidence makes
the difference between economic progress and stagnation.
	   ``Where people in Hong Kong see opportunity, a lot of Americans
see a threat to our national sovereignty,'' Mr Locke said. He said
many Americans saw world trade as frightening and foreign.
	   He was to later meet Mrs Chan, who is expected to brief the
governor on Hong Kong's progress since the handover, including the
results of the recent elections.

World Cup: Mexico, healthy and rested, feeling better than it has
</HEADLINE>
in weeks &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONTENAILLES, France (AP) _ Mexico, seemingly rudderless just a
couple of weeks ago, finds itself in an unexpected position as
World Cup group leader, healthy and confident its ``cunning'' can
get it into the second round.
	   Even goalkeeper Jorge Campos has promised to go back to wearing
his colorful uniforms, after donning a decidedly bland jersey for
Mexico's 3-1 debut win against South Korea.
	   Mexican team doctor Jose Luis Cantu said Tuesday all the players
are healthy and fully recovered from Saturday's come-from-behind
win against the Koreans.
	   ``The team is working well together and they're all in good
shape,'' Cantu said.
	   Only one player required his care after the match. Midfielder
Ricardo Pelaez, who started the Mexican comeback with a score in
the 50th minute, took a glancing kick on the right cheek when
teammate Luis Hernandez tallied the second of his two goals late in
the game.
	   ``I had some marks from his cleats on my face, but it's no big
deal,'' Pelaez said. Most of his teammates came out unscathed.
	   ``Some of the other players have only minor injuries that are
not even worth mentioning. They're all training at full capacity,''
Cantu said.
	   The victory offered a measure of vindication for Mexico, which
had come under criticism for its unimpressive results leading up to
the World Cup and now hopes to ride the win into the second round.
	   But first it must play two tough teams, Belgium on Saturday in
Bordeaux and Group E favorite Netherlands a week from Thursday, in
Saint-Etienne.
	   Mexico would advance with a win against the Belgians, who held
the Dutch to a scoreless tie on Saturday.
	   ``They're very strong but they tend to be predictable,'' said
striker Jesus Arellano. ``I think we can beat them with superior
ball-handling. I think a dose of Mexican cunning can make the
difference.''
	   Arellano, who was not expected to play much in France, replaced
Braulio Luna to start the second half against South Korea and
created several scoring chances.
	   ``We have the talent to break the Belgians' system. We have to
press them and contain them in their half of the field. We have to
be relentless from the very start,'' he said.
	   ``We've come to this tournament with the hopes of becoming
champions,'' said Pelaez.
	   Even Campos will be feeling more himself next time he takes the
field.
	   Campos, who plays for the Chicago Fire of the MLS, will go back
to wearing his colorful uniforms, after showing up in a simple
white ``replacement'' jersey against the Koreans.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A truck and a commuter train collided near St.
Petersburg on Tuesday, killing the truck driver and two passengers,
the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
	   Viktor Beltsov, a spokesman for the ministry, said that the
collision occurred near a railway station in Antropshino, 32
kilometers (20 miles) south of St. Petersburg when the truck failed
to stop at a railroad crossing.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the train dragged the truck for
300 meters (yards). None of the train passengers were reported
injured.

	   CAUSEWAY Bay hit the highest levels of roadside pollution
recorded in Hong Kong on Monday, according to a new environmental
monitoring device.
	   The government's street-level air pollution index, which was
launched on Friday, records fumes from cars and lorries on busy
urban roads.
	   The Environmental Protection Department said the new system adds
to their general air pollution index, which recorded the highest
readings at Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan on Monday.
	   They said on Friday that three roadside air pollution monitors
had been installed at Mong Kok, Central and Causeway Bay.

	   THE Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry will work with
the Agriculture Ministry to find ways to determine the price of
local rice if rice wholesalers, retailers and millers fail to do
so.
	   Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Megat
Junid Megat Ayob said rice wholesalers have been asked to reduce
the price of local rice which have increased by 21 per cent since
May.
	   Megat Junid was speaking to reporters after receiving a mock
cheque for RM100,000 on behalf of the Kuala Lumpur Football
Association (KLFA) at the ministry yesterday. Megat is also KLFA
president.
	   He said rice millers, wholesalers and retailers had, in a
meeting last week, agreed to try to fix a reasonable price and find
ways to come up with a ``formula so that the price of rice can be
reduced''.
	   ``We have given them an opportunity... for market forces to
determine the price but if market forces cannot do so, then the two
ministries will find ways and means (to do so),'' he said.
	   He added that if such a situation were to arise, then the price
of rice may be determined like that of chicken where the ministry
determines profits for retailers and wholesalers.
	   ``It is hoped that all private companies including the
subsidiary of Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) will think of their
social obligation to sell rice at reasonable prices,'' he said.
	   To date he said, no response has been received by the rice
wholesalers on the situation. He added that the ministry has not
imposed a deadline for wholesalers to reduce prices.
	   The situation, will be monitored by the Agriculture Ministry's
Padi and Rice Price Control and Monitoring division.
	   Effective September 1, however, the division will be placed
under the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs.

More influence for Montenegro reformists in Yugoslav parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a blow to federal President
Slobodan Milosevic, lawmakers in Montenegro passed a law Tuesday
enabling Milosevic opponents only to represent the small republic
in Yugoslavia's federal parliament.
	   The Montenegrin chamber, convened following an election victory
In Montenegro by a pro-Western, anti-Milosevic coalition, decided
to amend the rule on sending its deputies to the crucial upper
chamber of the Yugoslav federal parliament.
	   The group of 20 deputies will no longer be a selection from all
parties present in the Montenegrin parliament - a mix of allies and
opponents of Milosevic.
	   In future, they will be chosen exclusively by the now ruling
majority: supporters of Montenegrin pro-Western President Milo
Djukanovic, a bitter Milosevic foe.
	   A decision on who the 20 new representatives will be is expected
Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslav parliament consists of two chambers. While much
larger Serbia has more deputies in the lower chamber, both
republics have an equal number of deputies, 20 each, in the upper
chamber, whose approval is needed for all decision in the federal
parliament.
	   Montenegro's reformists are expected to try to make good on
their earlier pledge to unseat, or at least try to limit,
Milosevic's influence in the federation.
	   As federal president, Milosevic was voted into office - and also
can be voted out of it - by federal legislature. However, the lower
chamber is currently controlled by his neo-communist-nationalist
coalition as is the Serbian half of the upper chamber.
	   But the group of Montenengrin reformers, who the new law also
obliges to vote unanimously when representing the republic in the
upper chamber, will have the power to block proposals coming from
Milosevic's hard-liners in the federal assembly.

	   BANK Pembangunan Malaysia is expected to disburse only RM470
million in loans this year compared with RM800 million last year,
Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa Mohamed said
yesterday.
	   He said the decrease in loans available for 1998 is due to the
current economic problems where the budget set aside has also been
reduced.
	   The number of loan applications, however, has increased rather
significantly.
	   ``From January to April this year, loan applications have
increased by 20 per cent,'' Mustapa said.
	   He was speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur after opening a
10-day training course on ``Credit Analysis and Finance for the
Financial Sector in Africa''.
	   Mustapa said for the January-April period, some RM142 million
worth of loans were approved for 80 entrepreneurs.
	   Currently, 21 small- and medium-scale companies have received
RM40 million under the SMI Fund. The RM1.5 billion SMI Fund was
introduced under the 1998 Budget.
	   The training course held in Kuala Lumpur is aimed at sharing
experiences and lessons learnt in Asia with African countries and
to promote development cooperation between Asia and Africa.
	   The course intends to assist the African financial sector in its
pursuit of a sound financial condition by emphasising the need to
establish credit appraisal technique and practices and adopt sound
development financial policy.
	   The course is executed with the support and assistance of the
Japan Development Bank and funded by the United Nations Development
Programme.
	   In his speech, Japan's Minister in the Japanese Embassy Mr
Masafumi Kuroki said poverty remains a major problem in many of the
sub-Saharan countries.
	   The marginalisation of these countries in the global economy is
a great concern.
	   ``When we look at the flow of official development assistance
(ODA), Africa is the biggest recipient.
	   ``From 1980 to 1995, Africa received US$129 billion (US$1  &QC; 
RM4.08) in
the form of bilateral ODA, while Asia received US$119 billion
during the same period,'' Kuroki said.	   He added that Japan believes in sub-Saharan African countries'
potential and capability and continues to commit itself to
supporting them fully.
	   ``This commitment is clearly demonstrated by Japan's ODA to
sub-Saharan Africa which has drastically grown from US$223 million
in 1980 to US$1.3 billion in 1995.
	   ``In our assistance to Africa, we try to concentrate our efforts
to create necessary and conducive environment for development. We
try to assist institution-building, infrastructure development and
capacity- building for both the people and the governments, so that
African people can fully exercise their ownership and self-help for
their nation- building,'' he said.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ Black warriors shot pistols into the
air Tuesday during an otherwise peaceful political march that
commemorated the Soweto uprising 22 years ago.
	   Earlier in the day, white youths of apartheid's former ruling
party laid a wreath at the memorial for Hector Peterson, a school
boy who died from police fire as he demonstrated against the
National Party's forced imposition of Afrikaans in the schools. The
language was closely associated with the white oppressor.
	   The photograph of a terrified student carrying Peterson's body
mobilized the anti-apartheid struggle abroad. Nine children were
killed that day, which is commemorated as national Youth Day.
Hundreds of people died in ensuing protests.
	   ``We honor them. We are all living the vision they shared on
June 16, 1976,'' National Party Youth action spokesman Max van der
Wath said.
	   After President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won
1994's first all-race elections, the spot where Peterson was killed
became a memorial that now draws thousands from abroad, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton during a recent trip to Africa.
	   At Orlando Stadium, Bantu Holomisa, leader of the United
Democratic Movement, a party launched last year by disillusioned
white and black members of the NP and ANC, urged the 3,000 people
gathered to help their country in its difficult transformation from
white minority rule.
	   ``We must guard that the struggle will not be hijacked by fat
cats,'' Holomisa told reporters afterward.
	   Looking to the 1999 elections, Holomisa said his party is
calling for a national referendum on two emotional issues _ the
abolition of the death penalty and legalization of abortion, both
put through by the ANC government.
	   About 100 shots were fired afterward as the crowd marched
through the streets. Most of the men were armed with spears and
``churps,'' small sharp axes mounted on long sticks. Women wore
turbans and emboidered clothing and had their faces painted.
	   In Port Elizabeth, an appearance by Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, Mandela's likely successor next year, drew a crowd of 10,000
in his home town.
	   In Cape Town, NP leader Martinus van Schalkwyk berated former NP
officials for trying to hide instead of owning up to their crimes.
	   Referring to revelations last week that apartheid government
physicians brewed up fatal poisons to kill black opponents, Van
Schalkwyk said: ``Something is lacking in this country and our
young people must bring it back.''
	   The date for next year's elections has not yet been set.

	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA may employe modern technology in the future to
determine whether a ball has gone over the goal line or not, FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said Tuesday.
	   FIFA is not considering television to help referees in their
calls, Cooper said. However, the world soccer federation is
exploring technology to help referees rule on disputed goals.
	   ``It's a long, long way away from a definitive system,'' Cooper
said. ``Until we have a definitive system, we will not think about
it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Michel Platini, the organizing committee president
and former World Cup star, said Tuesday he is pleased with the
matches in the World Cup so far.
	   ``It's a very interesting competition because it's very open,''
Platini said. He reproached some of the teams for ``underestimating
their opponents''
	   ``A lot of so called little teams will show that they are not
less talented than the others. I think they'll cause some surprises
in the second round,'' Platini said at a press conference.
	   Platini described what a good player should do.
	   ``A good player is the one that gives the right pass at the
right moment, especially the last pass.'' Platini said, adding that
most teams have problems with the final pass.
	   He singled out Bulgaria's Hristo Stoitchkov who, in his
otherwise dull game against Paraguay, ``never lost the ball and
always gave the good pass.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer could lose a 50-million-pound (dlrs
82 million) sponsorship deal and fall out of contention to host the
2006 World Cup due to the actions of soccer hooligans, a top
Football Association official says.
	   With Green Flag's sponsorship expiring after the World Cup, the
FA had been negotiating to extend the deal up to 2002 and was
planning to make an announcement within weeks. But the deal could
now be in doubt.
	   FA commercial director Phil Carling said English soccer might
pay the price for the actions of hooligans in France.
	   ``If England supporters have caused these problems without
provocation it would be very damaging to the commercial interests
of the FA,'' Carling was quoted by the British Press Association as
saying in France.
	   ``Put it this way _ if you were a marketing director considering
the main English sponsorship and had watched the news reports you'd
have second thoughts.''
	   Carling said if the FA could not mount a credible bid for the
2006 World Cup due to the actions of hooligans it would lose
millions of pounds.
	   ``It could be devastating to the bid, and we've staked a lot of
money on that,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Nike is withdrawing part of its ad campaign for the
World Cup in France because of complaints over its ``totalitarian
ideology'', French newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The ads feature posters in the style of political campaign
posters from the 1930s. One of the slogans used was: ``Young
people! Soccer calls you. Join us.''
	   One of the Nike posters featured soccer star Eric Cantona next
to a remarkably similar poster from 1932 promoting a political
rally with Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini.
	   The French anti-racist organization Mrap complained to Nike
about the campaign. The organization was quoted in the newspaper
Liberation on Tuesday as saying they were ``shocked and upset that
Nike has chosen images that evoke, because of their totalitarian
esthetics, a certain ideology, that of Vichy France.''
	   Vichy France is the part of France that collaborated with the
German Nazi occupation of France in World War II.
	   Liberation said Nike is pulled the ads and apologized to anyone
offended.
	   ``We wanted to do a parody on peoples republics. But it was
never our intention to shock anybody,'' a Nike spokesman was quoted
by Liberation.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Even though there where no special security
measures in place for the Yugoslavia-Iran match Sunday in
Saint-Etinne, stadium guards were instructed to check for banners
opposing the Iranian government, the French sports L'Equipe
reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper said officials acknowledged that the spectator
tribunes and the surrounding area were scrutinized. Police and
stadium personnel were also instructed to look for anti-Teheran
banners, aside from the normal searches.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ To boost its campaign to host the 2006
World Cup, South Africa has produced a 65-page, full color magazine
extolling the merit of its bid.
	   The magazine includes three photos of President Nelson Mandela,
who wrote in the forward that his government fully endorsed the bid
by the South African Football Association.
	   ``We promise a warm African welcome to the international
football family in 2006,'' President Nelson Mandela wrote in the
publication
	   The magazine lists more than two dozen stadiums where World Cup
matches could be played, and notes South Africa has successfully
hosted other major events, including the 1995 rugby World Cup and
the 1996 African Nations Cup soccer tournament.
	   New FIFA president Sepp Blatter promised support for an African
bid to host the 2006 World Cup in return for support from African
nations when he was elected on June 8.
	   SAFA chief executive Danny Jordaan said this week that Blatter's
election gave South Africa a ``good chance'' to host the 2006
tournament. South Korea and Japan are joint hosts of the next World
Cup, in 2002.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA says it plans no action in the case of the
referee's dinner.
	   Masayoshi Okada refereed Monday's England-Tunisia match a day
after dining with a top official of England's Football Association,
Ken Ridden.
	   Keith Cooper, a FIFA spokesman, said Tuesday that Ridden was
there as an official of the international soccer federation and was
within the rules. Ridden said he was asked to the dinner by another
FIFA official, Volker Rolt of the German soccer federation.

	   IN response to the current economic crisis in Asia, the US
Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) said that it will lift
temporarily certain employment restrictions on F-1 student visa
holders from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and
Thailand.
	   Under a special relief programme which went into effect on June
10, eligible students are allowed to work more than 20 hours a
week, either on or off campus, when school is in session.
	   INS is also lifting the requirement that students must be in F-1
status for one full academic year prior to seeking off-campus
employment.
	   The US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, in a statement released in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, said students must demonstrate to school
officials that their means of financial support come from one of
the five countries covered under the programme and that employment
is necessary to avoid severe hardship caused by the current
economic crisis.
	   The currencies of the five countries have recently plummeted in
value relative to the US dollar, causing severe economic hardship
for many of the estimated 80,000 students currently enrolled in US
colleges and universities.
	   Additionally, INS will allow the students to take less than a
full-time course load, if the school approves, and still maintain
their student visa status for the duration of the programme.
	   Undergraduates, however, must register for a minimum of six
hours per semester and graduate students must register for three
credit hours.
	   The programme, the statement said, will remain in effect until
it is no longer warranted by economic circumstances.
	   The statement said only F-1 student visa holders are covered by
the special relief programme.
	   INS will also expedite the processing of employment
authorisation applications submitted by J-2 visa holders (spouses
and children of cultural exchange students) whose means of
financial support come from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, South
Korea or the Philippines.

	   HONG Kong's short-term interest rate soared to a six-month high
on Monday in response to renewed speculation on the Hong Kong
dollar in New York markets on Friday.
	   The bellwether three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate
(Hibor) jumped to 16.17857 per cent yesterday, its highest level
since 12 January.
	   The overnight Hibor level, however, was softer at 12-15 per cent
late yesterday compared with 15 to 17 per cent in early trade but
still firmer than 10-11 at Friday's close.
	   Traders said Hong Kong short-term interbank rates spiked higher
yesterday in response to a ``capital outflow wedge'' that started
on Friday when the Hong Kong dollar touched 7.75 to the US dollar.
	   ``Someone has shorted the Hong Kong dollar, either because of
capital outflow or to finance speculation,'' said Andrew Fung, head
of capital markets at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
	   The sharp rise in Hibor effectively kept the Hong Kong-dollar
stable at $7.7410 to the greenback throughout the day yesterday.
	   The Hong Kong dollar touched a high of $7.7365/85 at the open
because of higher rates, triggering sales of the US dollar for the
Hong Kong dollar. But it quickly eased off to $7.7420/40 per US
dollar in mid-morning as interbank rates came off their earlier
highs, dealers said.
	   Standard Chartered Bank regional treasurer Stanley Wong said he
expects interest rates to ease in the week, with signs of inflow to
the local currency and reduced pressure on the exchange rate.
	   Mr Wong said Monday's interbank rate situation had been better
than expected with the one-month rate standing at about 20 per
cent, which was lower than the projected rate of up to 30 per cent.
	   Liquidity returned slowly on Monday as interbank interest rates
softened.
	   The HKMA revised seven times its forecast change in the
aggregate balance attributable to its forex transactions in the
Hong Kong-dollar to take into account Hong Kong-dollar inflows made
during the day.
	   The forecast of the aggregate balance was posted at an opening
level of negative $7.262 billion growing smaller to its closing
level of negative $1.457 billion. This indicates a steady inflow of
funds into Hong Kong dollars.

	   KLSE Composite Index futures traded on The Kuala Lumpur Options
and Financial Futures Exchange (KLoffe) closed lower yesterday in
line with the underlying cash market.
	   The plunge in the yen caused the market to slide, and indicated
more trouble ahead for the Asian economies. HLG Futures said rolls
trading was very volatile as the market sentiment changed from
rebound expectation to bearish.
	   Spot-month June ended 27.5 points lower to close at 446.0 with
2,267 lots traded. Its high was 474.0 with a low of 445.4. Open

traded.
	   Its high for the day was 469.0 and a low of 445.5. Open interest
was 3,029.
	   HLG Futures said for traders to sell on strength if there are no
signs of recovery in the regional markets.

	   THE Stock Exchange of Hong Kong has mapped out an ambitious
development plan that could see the SAR become China's central
stock exchange.
	   The stock exchange on Monday said plans are being drawn up to
pump market capitalisation to $6 trillion in five years, a 50 per
cent jump from the $2.9 trillion at the moment by capturing the
market growth of the mainland.
	   The chief executive of the exchange, Alec Tsui Yiu-wa, said the
recent economic turmoil in the region had meant more urgency was
needed to develop the exchange.
	   ``In an ever increasing difficult situation like this, we
believe there is an even more urgent need for the exchange and the
Hong Kong securities market to change, so as to enhance
competitiveness and restore investor confidence,'' he said.
	   The exchange hopes to net some 250 mainland-related listings by
the year 2001. This compares with only 100 mainland-related
enterprises now listed in the stock exchange, and which include 41
H-share companies.
	   The strategy report, titled Positioning for a New Era, places
emphasis on the exchange becoming the leading centre in Asia and a
major global centre for offshore listing and trading of regional
and international securities.
	   At present, the exchange lists very few non-domestic companies
but with continued economic reform on the mainland, the SEHK could
become China's central exchange, officials said.
	   ``We do foresee a day when the exchange will list more Chinese
than non-Chinese companies,'' said an exchange spokesman.
	   ``We do not just look for business, as long as Chinese companies
comply to international regulation standards, why shouldn't we list
them? ``After all, mainland China is where the markets are.'' Mr
Tsui said the environment had become more challenging for the
exchange, with the Hang Seng Index down 50 per cent from its peak
and was now 12th, down from the sixth largest exchange in the world
in terms of capitalisation.
	   ``At the same time, the overall economic environment in Asia and
specifically in Hong Kong has become much less favourable,'' he
said.
	   The chairman of the exchange, Lee Hon-chiu, said the
organisation had a long-term vision that Hong Kong could become the
Manhattan of China by serving the international needs of the
mainland.
	   The exchange is to strengthen its regulatory role but denied
this was in response to the recent run of high profile company
collapses.
	   ``There is a greater need than ever before for regulators,
market institutions and market practitioners to work together
within the framework set by government,'' said Mr Lee.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) sank to a
nine-year low yesterday as worries on currencies of Asian countries
pushed the stock market to close broadly down.
	   Analysts said the plunge of the Japanese yen to its eight year
low against the dollar and concerns over the stability of the
currencies in the region caused investors to flee the market.
	   Weakening ringgit caused foreign borrowings by Malaysian
companies to be expensive and thus hurt profits of companies.
	   The KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) finished 20.13 points or 4.26
per cent lower to close at 452.24.
	   The broader based Emas Index dropped 4.18 points to 117.84 while
the Second Board Index shed 2.20 points to close at 104.16.
	   Trading was lacklustre yesterday and saw a total of 108.088
million shares worth RM232.711 million changing hands as compared
to a total of 119.684 million shares worth RM268.279 million
changing hands last Friday.
	   The scoreboard showed losers outpacing gainers 549 to 80 while
124 counters were unchanged.
	   Across the Causeway, the blue-chip Straits Times Industrials
Index closed 38.65 points lower to close at 1,052.84.
	   On the home front, the broad-based BT Ordinaries eased 4.11
points to 111.68 while the BT Composite Index was down 5.07 points
to 200.16.
	   The 30-share New Straits Times Industrials Index plunged 108.64
points to close at 2,766.41.
	   On the KLSE main board yesterday, turnover totalled 93.501
million shares worth RM222.549 million while trade on the Second
Board amounted to 5.790 million shares worth RM7.789 million.
	   Malayan Banking was the most active counter with 12.660 million
shares traded, followed by Magnum with 6.871 million shares and RHB
Capital with 5.863 million shares.

	   SUBUR Tiasa Holdings Bhd achieved a group pre-tax profit of

	   Group after-tax profit stood at RM30.29 million while earnings
per share for the year was 26.20 sen.
	   Despite the encouraging results, Subur Tiasa said, the economic

	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court ruled Tuesday
that a lawmaker from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party can say a
political rival collaborated with former East Germany's secret
police even though it has not been proven.
	   The ruling overturns a decision by a lower court ordering the
Berlin lawmaker to stop labeling Brandenburg state governor Manfred
Stolpe as an informer for the Ministry for State Security, known as
the Stasi.
	   The court said the statements by Christian Democratic Union
lawmaker Uwe Lehmann-Brauns were protected under freedom of
thought, a basic right guaranteed by Germany's constitution.
	   Stolpe, a Social Democrat and once the top Lutheran bishop in
East Germany, called on his party colleague, former Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt, and five former East German Lutheran bishops as
character witnesses in his defense.
	   Lehmann-Brauns had accused Stolpe of working as the Stasi's
unofficial agent for more than 20 years under the code name
Sekretaer, or secretary.
	   Lehmann-Brauns made the allegation in a ZDF television interview
in 1996, when Berlin and neighboring Brandenburg state held a vote
to determine if the two should merge into one state.
Lehmann-Brauns, who was against the merger, said the prospect of
Stolpe becoming governor of Berlin ``gives me a bad headache.''
	   The proposed merger was widely defeated in the vote.
	   A state appeals court had granted Stolpe a restraining order to
bar Lehmann-Brauns' statements linking the governor to the Stasi.
	   Lehmann-Brauns then filed with the Federal Consitutional Court
in Karlsruhe to get the restraining order lifted, arguing that as a
member of the legislature he should be allowed to express a
political difference of opinion.

More influence for Montenegro reformists in Yugoslav parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a blow to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, lawmakers in Montenegro passed a law Tuesday
enabling only Milosevic opponents to represent the small republic
in federal parliament.
	   The Montenegrin chamber, convened following an election victory
in Montenegro by a pro-Western, anti-Milosevic coalition, decided
to amend the rule on sending its deputies to the crucial upper
chamber of the Yugoslav federal parliament.
	   The group of 20 deputies will no longer be a selection from all
parties present in the Montenegrin parliament _ a mix of allies and
opponents of Milosevic.
	   In future, they will be chosen exclusively by the now ruling
majority: supporters of Montenegrin pro-Western President Milo
Djukanovic, a bitter Milosevic foe.
	   A decision on who the 20 new representatives will be is expected
Wednesday.
	   The Yugoslav parliament consists of two chambers. While much
larger Serbia has more deputies in the lower chamber, each republic
has 20 in the upper chamber, whose approval is needed for all
decision in the federal parliament.
	   Montenegro's reformists are expected to try to make good on
their earlier pledge to unseat, or at least try to limit,
Milosevic's influence in the federation.
	   As federal president, Milosevic was voted into office _ and also
can be voted out _ by federal legislature. However, the lower
chamber is currently controlled by his neo-communist-nationalist
coalition as is the Serbian half of the upper chamber.
	   But the group of Montenengrin reformers, who the new law also
obliges to vote unanimously when representing the republic in the
upper chamber, will have the power to block proposals coming from
Milosevic's hard-liners in the federal assembly.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia leaned on its longtime ally Tuesday,
extracting a promise from Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic to resume
negotiations with the moderate leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   But while NATO _ which sent warplanes over the region on Monday
_ may be grateful for any apparent progress, it was not clear
whether talks between Milosevic and Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
could quell the volatile conflict.
	   For one thing, Rugova doesn't speak for the Albanian militants
who are leading the uprising. For another, Milosevic's own standing
in Yugoslavia has eroded to the point that he may not be able to
command support at home.
	   And finally, there is little indication that Rugova would agree
to meet again with Milosevic, whom he accuses of reneging on
earlier commitments.
	   Even the Russians were equivocal about the success of their
diplomacy, with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov calling the
pledge only a ``real opportunity to regulate the conflict.''
	   Since March, more than 300 people have been killed as
Milosevic's army and police have cracked down on Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 want to establish an
independent state.
	   International pressure has been brought to bear on Milosevic,
who has already agreed to stop military actions against civilians
and permit the return of about 65,000 refugees.
	   He repeated those promises Tuesday, issuing a joint statement
with Yeltsin that included the resumption of negotiations and free
access to international monitors and aid groups.
	   However, such pledges in the past have changed little on the
ground, where clashes continue daily.
	   Milosevic and Rugova have met once already, in May. But the
Albanians canceled further talks until Serb government troops
halted a reported offensive in western Kosovo. And his spokesman
said Tuesday that more talks were unlikely unless that condition
was met.
	   ``I repeat once more _ our readiness for a dialogue was never in
doubt,'' spokesman Dzemail Mustafa told The Associated Press in
Kosovo. ``But this dialogue cannot be held by ignoring the cruel
reality we have in Kosovo today.''
	   Both Milosevic and Rugova have lost influence in recent weeks.
	   Rugova has clung to principles of non-violence even as the
crackdown has radicalized Kosovo's Albanians, swelling support for
the province's more militant separatists, the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Milosevic insisted Tuesday that he would ever agree to talk to
the KLA.
	   ``I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists,'' he
said.
	   For his part, Milosevic is no longer revered at home. This
weekend, the Serbian Orthodox Church condemned his regime as
incapable of reaching a peaceful solution and urged the formation
of a ``council of national salvation'' to rule in his stead.
	   The church's withdrawal of support is telling considering that
the main reason Serbs want to retain control of Kosovo is because
it is home to the Serb's holiest religious and cultural sites.
	   Russia also has instinctive reasons to support Milosevic and his
Serbs, given their common Slavic background.
	   But Yeltsin has found it impossible to support Milosevic's
extreme nationalism and violent campaigns, and only disagrees with
NATO about how _ not whether _ he should be stopped.
	   NATO aircraft began conducting maneuvers Monday over Albania and
Macedonia, both of which border on Kosovo, in an attempt to
convince Milosevic of the alliance's ability to react quickly.
	   But Milosevic insisted that the show of force had no effect on
his latest pledge.
	   ``The main factor behind our statement is our adherence to a
peaceful resolution,'' he told reporters after the Kremlin
meetings. ``I see no connection here to the NATO exercises.''
	   NATO countries reacted cautiously to the outcome of the Russian
meetings. White House spokesman Mike McCurry said ``We want to
learn more,'' and a spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office said
``it's not clear if this amounts to anything new.''
	   Yeltsin spoke by telephone with U.S. President Bill Clinton
later in the day, Russian news agencies reported, citing the
president's press service as saying Clinton was pleased with the
results.

	   STANDARD Chartered Bank has invested more than $70 million in
opening one of Asia's largest dealing rooms to boost its already
profitable global-treasury operations.
	   Standard Chartered Group chairman Patrick Gillam said the bank's
treasury operations in Hong Kong posted 45 per cent rise in profit
last year.
	   ``We have invested in the best technology available, which will
see us comfortably into the new millennium,'' Mr Gillam said.
	   ``This also strengthens Hong Kong's position as a global
financial centre,'' he said.
	   The new dealing room has space for 100 dealer-workstations.
	   The main feature of the new treasury dealing facility is its 300
state-of-the-art flat-screen displays that are linked to 100
personal computers on another floor in the building.
	   Mr Gillam said the main benefits are flexibility and speed _
dealers can operate fully from any dealing position in the room and
can react at a moment's notice to changing market conditions.
	   In other similar facilities, dealers are tied to one personal
computer, he said.
	   ``The integrated system will make it easy for use to increase
the number of dealers,'' said Stanley Wong, the banks' regional
treasurer for Northeast Asia.

	   MAINLAND-based eel feeds manufacturer Corasia Group is raising
$43 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering to
repay bank loans and improve its production capacity.
	   The company is selling shares at 80 cents each.
	   This is 3.5 times earnings per share, and 3.9 times on a pro
forma fully diluted basis.
	   The company said it is spending about $20 million on repayment
of existing bank loans.
	   The company is also shelling out $16 million for various
production facilities, office and staffs quarters. The remaining $7
million has been reserved as working capital.
	   In addition, it expects about $56 million net profit for this
year, representing about 28 per cent growth over the 1997 figure.
	   Its net profit and turnover for the year ended 31 December
reached $43.83 million and $155.06 million, respectively.
	   Corasia produces nutrition for eel farmers to rear their eels,
most of which are roasted and exported, mainly to Japan.
	   Chairman Kwok Man-yu said Chinese eel farmers enjoy competitive
advantages such as abundant supplies of land, unpolluted water and
cheap labour, compared with their Taiwanese and Japanese rivals.

Serena Williams wins first grass-court match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EASTBOURNE, England (AP) _ Serena Williams, tuning up for her
Wimbledon debut, won her first grass-court match Tuesday, beating
Naoko Sawamatsu 6-4, 7-5 in the opening round of the Eastbourne
Championships.
	   Watched by sister Venus and mother Oracene, Williams struggled
with her footing on the unfamiliar surface and overcame a series of
unforced errors and mis-hits.
	   ``It was kind of slippery out there, and I really don't like
falling at all,'' she said. ``I don't like that sensation. It was a
little awkward for me today. After I slipped the first time I
wasn't moving well at all. ... But I came to the net more in the
first set than I have this whole year.''
	   Despite coming to the net at every opportunity, Williams failed
to serve and volley as much as she'd planned.
	   ``It's kind of hard between wanting to and doing it,'' she said.
``I'm going to have to work on that, mentally rather than
physically.''
	   Serena's mother was on crutches after breaking her left ankle in
a fall at the house the Williams family is renting at Wimbledon.
Serena's father and coach, Richard, is back in the United States.
	   ``Right now he's playing a very important role taking care of my
dogs,'' Serena said. ``It's really important to me, because I
wouldn't want to put them in an area (pound) where they would have
to stay for five weeks. I call every day to see how they're doing.
But he might come to Wimbledon.''
	   Venus Williams is scheduled to face Natasha Zvereva on
Wednesday. Top-seeded Jana Novotna plays Wednesday against Nathalie
Dechy, while Steffi Graf opens against Samantha Smith.
	   Also advancing Tuesday were sixth-seeded Anna Kournikova and No.
8 Ai Sugiyama of Japan. Kournikova rallied to beat Alexandra Fusai
of France 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, and Sugiyama overcame Magdalena Grzybowska
of Poland 6-4, 6-4.
	   Kournikova was overrun by Fusai in the first set. But she
quickly found her rhythm in the second, breaking to lead 2-1 with a
crosscourt winner.
	   Striking the ball freely with her forehand and often passing
Fusai at the net, Kournikova was undisturbed by a rain break in the
final set.
	   ``It was my first match on grass since last year so I had to
adjust,'' said 17-year-old Kournikova, a semifinalist at Wimbledon
last year.

	   THE amount of claims made by clients against the collapsed
Forluxe Securities and Forluxe Finance has reached $56.3 million.
	   The amount exceeded by $36.8 million the value of available
shares still held by the company.
	   The provisional liquidator of the two companies, Nelson Wheeler
Corporate Reconstruction and Insolvency, yesterday ruled out full
compensation for clients.
	   ``Some clients will have their shares back, some will have their
money back, while some will be unable to get anything back,'' said
Chee Suween, Nelson Wheeler accountant.
	   In their first report to creditors, Nelson Wheeler said
compensation claims reached $56.3 million, while the value of
shares held by both Forluxe Securities and Forluxe Finance stood at
only $19.5 million.
	   The provisional liquidator said it would propose to the court a
method of share exchange or the sale of the shares in return for
cash.
	   ``It seems to me that most people want to have a system whereby
they get those shares back. The problem with that is some people
will lose out. But the alternative is to sell off all the shares
and share out the money,'' said Nick Hill of Nelson Wheeler.
	   A hearing has been scheduled on 21 July for the court to
determine how to distribute the shares, if at all.
	   Compensation will be made in August, at the earliest.
	   ``Clients who haven't lodged their claims are strongly advised
to make it to the stock exchange as soon as possible,'' the
provisional liquidator said.
	   Nelson Wheeler has received 323 claims from depositors and
another 175 claims are expected. The companies had 527 depositors,
of which 29 were net debtors.
	   The stock exchange is still undecided over the compensation
package for Forluxe clients, said Anthony Neoh, chairman of the
Securities and Future Commission.
	   He added that the power for enacting compensation packages was
with the stock exchange, not the SFC.
	   Mr Neoh believes this arrangement should be reviewed.

	   REGAL Hotels International Holdings is considering various
financial alternatives to beef up its hotel assets and management
company operations in North America.
	   The Hong Kong-listed company, which announced a $491.4 million
profit attributable to shareholders in its final results in April,
said it was considering a number of options open to it.
	   ``Financial alternatives may include investments, acquisitions,
financial restructurings, public or private financings that include
the offering of securities, joint ventures, mergers or the sale of
stock or assets of Regal's subsidiaries,'' said a company
announcement.
	   Given the size of the potential transactions and quality of the
assets, Regal and Goldman Sachs, which is acting as legal adviser,
have identified a select group of prospective transaction
participants with whom they intend to have discussions in the near
future.
	   ``Regal will, after reviewing all the proposals, strategic
alternatives and recommendations from Goldman Sachs, decide on the
appropriate course of action regarding its holdings in North
America,'' said the company.
	   The hotel ownership and management company has 28 properties in
the US with the combined occupancy rate for 1997 remaining at the
1996 level.

	   KUCHING, Mon. - A karaoke disc jockey told a magistrate's court
today that he saw probationary Inspector Hasmizan Hussin shout and
then slap a reporter who was resting his head on a counter of a
karaoke pub last year.
	   Kakoh Kiles said Hasmizan then pulled reporter Jonathan Bullet
anak Henry Empaya to the floor and started kicking him.
	   ``He was then joined by the other accused in kicking and
punching Bullet,'' Kakoh said at the trial of Hasmizan and four
other policemen, Lance Corporals Zaini Abdullah, Joblen Atan, Irwan
Abdullah and Constable Yusni Mohd Kamarudin, all from Simpang Tiga
police headquarters here.
	   They are charged under Section 323 of the Penal Code with
causing hurt to Bullet, 29, a photo-journalist with the Sarawak
Tribune, on Oct 16, 1997 at 11.30pm at Cheers Pub in Taman Sri
Sarawak here.
	   They also face a second charge of causing hurt to a sports
stringer with the New Straits Times, Martin Yee Man Teng, 41, at
the same date, time and place.
	   Section 323 provides for a maximum jail of one year or fine of
RM2,000 or both upon conviction.
	   The trial is before magistrate Dean Wayne Daly.
	   Questioned by Senior Federal Counsel Tun Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah,
Kakoh, who is attached to Cheers Pub, said one of the accused, whom
he identified as Irwan Abdullah, had earlier approached Bullet on
entering the pub and uttered something which he could not hear.
	   ``But I remember hearing Bullet saying `I am an ex-policeman' to
Irwan.
	   Then suddenly Hasmizan shouted and slapped Bullet,'' he said.
	   He said he also saw Hasmizan slapping Yee who had inquired why
they kicked and punched Bullet.
	   ``He (Hasmizan) asked Yee not to interfere before slapping and
punching him. Yee fell to the floor,'' he added.
	   ``Another person, whom I could not identify, also tried to kick
me, but he was restrained by the others,'' he said.
	   He also told the court that Bullet and Yee did not put up a
fight when they were assaulted.
	   Cross-examined by Charles Kanavathi, counsel for the five, Kakoh
said that he could not remember whether stools fell on Bullet when
he was on the floor.
	   ``But I heard sounds of them kicking and beating him,'' he said,
adding that he could not remember which part of Bullet's body were
being kicked and punched.
	   Kakoh said about 20 minutes after the incident, two members of
the group took down his particulars and those of three other
persons inside the pub.
	   ``I asked the two persons whether they knew that Bullet and Yee
were journalists. I then suggested that it would be better to
report the matter to the police.
	   ``Then one of the two said `report for what.' So, I just kept
quiet because Anthony Nais, the owner of the pub, asked me to keep
quiet,'' he said, adding that he did not know that the five accused
were policemen.
	   A houseman with the Sarawak General Hospital Dr Mohammed Aziz
Salawi said he treated Bullet and Yee at the casualty department.
	   ``I saw them and obtained their medical history. I did a
physical examination of them,'' he said.
	   Bullet, Dr Aziz said, had a lacerated wound on the left side of
his forehead and restricted movement of the right shoulder, right
elbow and wrist.
	   ``He told me that he had been kicked and punched by the
police,'' he said, adding that he prescribed painkillers to ease
the patient's pain.
	   Yee had an injured right ear-lobe.
	   ``In my opinion, the injuries they suffered were caused by blunt
objects,'' he said.
	   Hearing continues.

	   KARCE International Holdings on Monday said it is confident its
margin and net profit growth this year will be as good as in 1997.
	   Chairman Tong Shek-lun expects net profit this year to match the
127 per cent growth achieved last year.
	   The company said its raw materials costs have been substantially
slashed due to the fall in the value of the Japanese yen.
	   While clients have asked for cuts in the selling price of Karce
products, its chairman Mr Tong said the group would still be able
to maintain the same profit margin level as last year.
	   He said the company has been able to slash purchasing prices for
raw materials and components.
	   ``Part of our components are bought from Japan and our
purchasing costs have dropped given the devalued yen, which can
compensate for the decrease in selling prices,'' he said.
	   The electronic product manufacturer said the company is
unaffected by the crisis since its client base is focused on the US
and Europe and not troubled Southeast Asian economies.
	   ``Currently, we have ample orders from the US and Europe, which
can compensate for the loss of orders from the Southeast Asian
region,'' said Mr Tong.
	   Orders from Southeast Asia represent about 10 per cent of the
total number.
	   ``We don't have direct investment in Southeast Asia and we use
US dollars to settle all export transactions, so devaluation in
regional currencies has no effect on our export business,'' he
claims.
	   The group continues to expand its production facilities for
rubber keypads in Dongguan, China.
	   Production commenced in June and Mr Tong expects full capacity
in one to two months.
	   In addition, construction of another factory at Humen Town,
Dongguan, for the production of electronic organisers and
electronic calculators is presently in process. The first phase
development is expected to be completed by the first quarter of
1999.
	   With the new factories, monthly production of rubber keypads
will double to about 100 tonnes while production of electronic
organisers and electronic calculators will increase 40 per cent to
two million units.

	   LATEST EQUIPMENT ... Cargo handling is an important airport
service and revenue earner.
	   Recognising this, the RM9 billion Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Sepang will have one of the most advanced cargo handling
services in the region when it opens for full commercial operations
on June 30.
	   The Malaysia Airlines' Advance Cargo Centre will be capable of
handling about 650,000 tonnes of cargo per annum and will be
upgraded later to handle cargo totalling 1.2 million tonnes per
annum.
	   With sophisticated equipment such as the Elevated Transfer
Vehicle (picture), the centre is set to become one of the world's
major cargo handling centres.
	   The centre has five ETVs to move containers and cargo pallets
from the centre's storage areas to the landside bays before being
placed on the aircraft.
	   Maskargo cargo projects and planning manager Mohd Noordin
Jalaludin said the ETVs were capable of moving cargo up to 30
metres high and had a weight capacity of seven tonnes each unit.
	   ``The ETV will also allow us to move cargo quickly onto aircraft
and cut down processing time.''
	   The RM350 million complex is located on a 43.2 hectare site near
KLIA's Southern Support Zone. Construction on the complex started
in July 1995 and took about 95 weeks to complete.

	   S&AMP;P Food Industries (M) Bhd is confident that its financial
position will return to the black in 1998 given the strong earnings
from its core business of coconut products.
	   This was disclosed yesterday by the company's general manager
Tang Koon Fook after S&AMP;P Food's annual general meeting in Petaling
Jaya.
	   S&AMP;P Food is mainly involved in the manufacture of instant
coconut milk powder, defatted desiccated coconut and related
products.
	   S&AMP;P Food posted a consolidated pre-tax loss of RM13.24 million
for the year ended December 31 1997 compared to a pre-tax profit of
RM154,165 in 1996.
	   Tang said exports has risen to 58 per cent of its turnover from
40 per cent previously.
	   ``Improved price competitiveness of our coconut products and the
company's drive to increase exports have resulted in higher
exports,'' Tang said.
	   According to him, the company has plans to import coconuts from
Indonesia as well as sourcing coconuts from East Malaysia to meet
the strong demand of its coconut products.
	   He said S&AMP;P Food currently holds the number one position in the
local coconut milk market with about 70 per share market share.
	   On other developments, Tang said S&AMP;P Food expects to launch
several new food products in the next one year.
	   Tang added S&AMP;P Food is no longer in food franchising business
and has no plans to re-enter the business at the moment.
	   Meanwhile, Tang said the company has aborted its plans to
purchase a residential project in Penang.

	   CLOSE SHAVE ... the driver of this car can thank his lucky star
that he managed to escape from his vehicle seconds before it burst
into flames yesterday.
	   The driver was reportedly heading towards Puchong when the
incident occurred about 1.50pm while he was approaching the Sungai
Buloh-Puchong flyover near Batu Tiga, Shah Alam.
	   A team of firemen from the Shah Alam Fire and Rescue Department,
which arrived at the scene about five minutes later, put out the
blaze within five minutes.
	   Traffic flow on the flyover was brought to almost a standstill
as motorists slowed their vehicles to have a closer look at the
blazing wreck.

	   DNP Holdings Bhd anticipates its garment business to make a
major contribution to the group's profit and turnover for the
financial year ending December 31 1998.
	   With this, the group expects to post a higher pre-tax profit and
turnover for the current year compared to RM21.1 million in pre-tax
profit and RM279.6 million in turnover achieved in the previous
financial year.
	   DNP Holdings general manager treasury and accounts Lee Kong Beng
told reporters after the company's annual general meeting in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday that sales have been very good in the first
quarter of the year and its order book is full.
	   However, he declined to reveal the value of the garment
division's book order for the current year.
	   Lee said the situation in Indonesia and Thailand has enabled the
company to obtain more contracts from international garment
producers such as Polo and Ralph Lauren.
	   The group's garment division, which is a subcontractor for such
brands, is aiming to cater for high-end market due to higher labour
costs in Malaysia compared to Thailand and Indonesia.
	   Lee said DNP Holdings' garment division expects to achieve sales
turnover of RM250 million this year, compared with turnover of
RM239 million last year, due to growth in demand. Almost 95 per
cent of the group's garment sales come from overseas markets,
mostly the US and Europe, he added.
	   Lee said DNP Holdings' property division had to defer several of
its projects due to the current economic environment. Among them
are the high- end housing development in Ulu Klang, Wisma DNP, and
the Super Condo project in Penang.
	   He said the project in Ulu Klang was deferred as the company
planned to price the houses at RM300,000 to RM400,000 each and it
believed that it would be difficult for potential buyers to get
financing from local financial institutions given the economic
climate.
	   In view of this, Lee said, DNP Holdings will be focusing on low-
and medium-cost houses below RM150,000 as the funding cost for this
type of projects is much lower and it will be easier for house
buyers to get bank loans.

	   WATCH maker and distributor Egana International is forging ahead
with the flotation of its subsidiary, Egana Jewellery, accompanied
by a rights issue, despite widespread bearish sentiment.
	   The company had postponed the spin-off and fund-raising exercise
in January because of the depressed market condition.
	   But on Monday, the group was upbeat about the initiative, saying
its jewellery orders increased by 40 per cent and 60 per cent in
Germany and Switzerland, respectively.
	   The flotation and rights issue announced last Thursday entitles
shareholders to buy two shares for every five shares they hold at a
price of 35 cents per share.
	   In return, they will receive five bonus shares in the parent
company and two bonus shares in the jewellery business.
	   ``We have relatively low gearing ratio of 74 per cent. The deal
is actually designed in favour of our shareholders,'' said David
Wong, non-executive director of Egana International.
	   Egana closed at 34 cents, one cent below the proposed issue
price.
	   While awaiting final approval from the stock exchange, Egana
Jewellery is expected to start trading on 23 July.
	   The proposal is seen as a bid to raise cash in the wake of the
liquidity crunch due to the economic slump.
	   But Mr Wong said that by listing the jewellery subsidiary, Egana
could enhance its corporate appeal to customers and reinforce
timepiece sales in the European and American markets.

	   District deputy police chief Superintendent Hussin Ismail said
since the renewal of firearms started on June 1, the response had
not been encouraging.
	   ``Owners who have yet to renew their licences should do so at
the district police headquarters by the end of this month.''
	   He said more than 5,000 firearms licences had to be renewed in
the district.

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Tony Blair wanted a summit where the
European Union reached out to its citizens, but Helmut Kohl made
sure the 15 EU leaders kept their hands firmly on their
pocketbooks.
	   An unsightly quarrel over how much Germany and others pay into
the EU's collective kitty dulled the Cardiff summit's grand words
on forging a euro-bloc with a human face and welcoming poor eastern
neighbors into Western Europe's prosperity zone.
	   ``It was a more difficult summit than we expected, an extremely
tough political debate, '' Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said Tuesday at the end of the two-day meeting.
	   At the center of the squabble was Germany's Chancellor Kohl, who
has taken up the ``I want my money back'' battle cry once wielded
successfully by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
her crusades against the EU.
	   ``This is not a declaration of war. We seek fair treatment.
Nothing more, nothing less,'' Kohl told reporters.
	   Facing an uphill battle to secure re-election in September's
German elections, Kohl insists Germany's contribution to the EU
coffers is oversized and must be trimmed.
	   Germany currently provides almost one-third of the EU's dlrs 86
billion annual budget. Kohl says that's too much compared with what
Germany gets back by way of aid to its farmers and poor regions.
	   He wants the whole system changed before the EU pushes ahead
with plans to bring in Cyprus and up to five former East bloc
nations as new members by 2004.
	   The Dutch, Swedish and Austrians _ who also claim they pay too
much _ back Kohl. But poorer EU nations, led by Spain, are bitterly
opposed. They worry that what Kohl calls burden-sharing will mean a
flight of EU funds from the so-called ``Club-Med'' nations to the
rust-belt cities of the old East Germany and the candidate nations
further east.
	   Other relatively rich nations also are opposed, fearing
Germany's gain will mean more pain for them.
	   ``Naturally, I'm not in favor of a reduction of the German
contribution,'' said French President Jacques Chirac. ``Because it
would mean an increase in the French contribution.''
	   Summit Chairman Blair, the British prime minister, had hoped to
skim over the cash conflict and focus on promoting his image of a
``people's Europe'' in tune with the needs and concerns of the
union's 370 million citizens.
	   ``It is important we don't end up with a centralized European
superstate, poking its nose into every nook and cranny,'' Blair
said.
	   But although the leaders postponed any substantive debate on the
budget battle until after the German elections, even agreeing to
disagree proved difficult.
	   While the leaders adjourned for a leisurely lunch to honor
visiting South African President Nelson Mandela, EU foreign
ministers had to sweat over the wording of a end-of-summit
statement that wound up declaring: ``Some member states have
expressed their view that burden-sharing should be more equitable
and have called for the creation of a mechanism for correcting
budget imbalances, but some member states have opposed this.''
	   Although no major decisions were made, the leaders at least set
out a timetable for solving some of the EU's pressing problems,
with a series of at least four summits planned over the next year
in Austria and Germany.
	   On other issues, the leaders failed to get Greece to drop its
veto on closer relations with Turkey; hailed their soon-to-be-born
single currency as a bulwark protecting Europe from the aftershocks
of Asia's financial crisis, and restated the threat of Western
military action to deter Serbia's military campaign in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A heatwave caused 114 Muscovites to suffer strokes
in 24 hours, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Tuesday, quoting the
city government's health committee.
	   That's more than double the usual 50 to 60 people taken to
Moscow hospitals daily with strokes, the news agency said.
	   Temperatures in Moscow from Thursday to Monday were among the
highest for these dates in 100 years. On Sunday, the temperature in
central Moscow rose to 34.7 degrees C (95 F).

World Bank mission reviews programs in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to ADD details on talks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Representatives of the World Bank reviewed
their projects Tuesday for reforming Ukraine's financial and energy
industries and improving its farms and environment, a news agency
reported.
	   Paul Siegelbaum, director of the bank's Ukraine and Belarus
department, met with Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tihipko, Interfax
said.
	   It quoted World Bank officials as saying they would try to
assess the prospects for further cooperation with Ukraine, which
they said depended on the resumption of International Monetary Fund
aid to the former Soviet republic.
	   Ukraine and the World Bank have either agreed on or started
preparing more than 30 projects worth dlrs 2.2 billion, of which
Ukraine has already received about dlrs 1.1 billion, Interfax said.
	   The head of international relations for the National Bank, Oleh
Rybachuk, said Tuesday's talks focused on two future projects _ a
dlrs 300 million credit for restructuring Ukraine's financial
sector and a dlrs 200 million to dlrs 250 million credit to develop
financial services.
	   The World Bank suspended work earlier this year on approving
further projects after the IMF refused to release an installment on
a dlrs 542 million loan.
	   In 1997, the IMF rejected a larger dlrs 2.5 billion loan, citing
Ukraine's stalled reforms. An IMF mission arrived in Kiev on Monday
to assess the country's progress toward implementing the conditions
for that loan.
	   The World bank delegation was expected to stay in Ukraine for
about two weeks, meeting with the president, prime minister,
National Bank chairman and other top officials and visiting the
cities of Boryspil, Yalta, Sevastopol, Odessa and Dnipropetrovsk.

Clinton phone call fails to lift EU-Turkey ties from deep freeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-EU Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ An appeal by U.S. President Bill Clinton
for Greece to be more conciliatory toward Turkey failed to
strengthen the European Union's rocky relations with Ankara.
	   In a phone call to Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who
attended the two-day EU summit that ended Tuesday, Smitis said
Clinton urged Greece to lift a veto on EU aid for Turkey of more
than dlrs 400 million to reduce tensions in the southern Balkans.
	   Simitis told Greek reporters he rejected the appeal, blaming
Turkey for freezing ties with the union after it was snubbed as
candidate member at an EU summit in Luxembourg last December.
	   The EU leaders ended their summit by declaring their bid to
bring 11 nations into their ranks on track, but acknowledging ties
with Turkey remain in a deep freeze.
	   They welcomed ``substantial progress'' to date in talks to bring
Cyprus and 10 East European into the EU over the next decade and
reiterated Turkey can join only if it meets the same membership
criteria as other candidates.
	   The EU has snubbed Turkey over its poor human rights record,
territorial disputes with Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose country is ending a
six-month stint in the EU presidency, has tried to pull Turkey
closer to the EU, but Simitis vetoed that.
	   Greece takes a hard-line on Turkey. Last month, it prevented the
holding of an EU-Turkey foreign ministers meeting. insisting the
Europeans spell out, ahead of the event, all of Turkey's failings.
	   Greece maintains a veto on EU aid of 375 million European
currency units (dlrs 409 million).
	   Officials said that, given Athens' opposition to allocating that
money, the EU head office would pursue ways of releasing the funds
to Turkey in some other fashion, but conceded it would be difficult
to do that legally.

Ethiopia deports 500 Eritreans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Buses packed with about 500
Eritreans rounded up in the Ethiopian capital for deportation
headed Tuesday on an arduous journey to the countries' disputed
border.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea, one-time allies who less than a decade ago
were part of the same country, have battled since early May over
several stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds
of lives.
	   No major skirmishes have been reported since Thursday, but both
sides are reinforcing three front lines.
	   Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said the
deportees were mostly leaders of the Eritrean community or the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front political party who had been
arrested for raising money for the Eritrean war effort or for
spying.
	   About 550,000 Eritreans live in Ethiopia, mostly in the capital
and the northern provinces.
	   Relatives of the deported Eritreans reported the overcrowded
buses and trucks had reached the western town of Gondar, 550
kilometers (340 miles) northwest of Addis Ababa, after a two-day
journey.
	   ``They're not getting enough food and water,'' said Eritrean
presidential adviser Yemane Gebremeskel. The government has
protested the deportations, he said.
	   The deported Eritreans were expected to reach the western
Eritrean border town of Humera on Wednesday, he said.
	   Also Tuesday, a bus packed with people and guarded by Ethiopian
soldiers departed from the northern border town of Adigrat,
apparently also heading for Asmara.
	   Armed soldiers prevented journalists and civilians from speaking
to the passengers, whom local residents said included prominent
Eritrean businessmen and other Eritreans who had been accused of
spying.
	   In a further crackdown, the Ethiopian government revoked the gun
licenses of all Eritreans. Failure to hand in their weapons by
Tuesday was punishable by five to 25 years imprisonment and, in
exceptional cases, death, the Security, Immigration and Refugee
Affairs Authority said.
	   The Ethiopian government has accused Eritrea of expelling
thousands of its citizens, but Eritrea has denied the charge. In
repeated radio and TV broadcasts, the Eritrean government has
insisted that the 100,000 Ethiopians living within its boundaries
be treated fairly, despite the conflict.
	   A team of five African leaders representing the Organization of
African Unity was expected in Addis Ababa and Asmara later in the
week.
	   Under U.S. pressure, the two countries agreed Sunday to stop
using air strikes against each other.
	   The ground war continues, however, and direct peace talks have
not begun because Ethiopia insists that Eritrea first withdraw from
disputed land. Eritrea has refused.
	   Eritrean rebels were instrumental in helping the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front overthrow a 17-year
military regime in July 1991. Eritrea gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ European Union leaders added their voices
Tuesday to the growing international campaign to secure the release
of East Timor independence leader Xanana Gusmao and other political
prisoners in Indonesia.
	   In a statement released after a two-day EU summit, the 15 EU
leaders urged Indonesia ``to respect human rights and fundamental
freedoms (and) release all political prisoners, including those
from East Timor.''
	   The statement welcomed new Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's
pledge to hold elections next year and implement further economic
and political reforms. It said the EU would continue to support
Indonesia with the assistance of in international financial
institutions, ``provided a credible economic reform program is
followed.''
	   British officials, whose country currently holds the EU
presidency, said a European mission would likely leave soon for
East Timor.

Volkswagen says it's not responsible for paying slave workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen says 30 Hungarian Jews who
are seeking back wages for their time as Nazi slave laborers at its
plants should claim the payments from the government instead.
	   In a letter to their lawyer Monday, the German automaker said it
is not legally bound to make such payments
	   Lawyer Klaus von Muenchhausen said Friday he would file a
lawsuit seeking back wages for the Hungarian Jews, who are now in
their 70s. As teen-agers in 1944-45, they had been sent from the
Auschwitz concentration camp to Volkswagen's factory in Wolfsburg
to produce armaments, Muenchhausen said.
	   Volkswagen said the Nazi government was responsible for the
forced labor and that the Hungarians should place their claims with
the regime's successor, the current German government.
	   The company also noted that Germany has over the years paid more
than 100 billion marks (dlrs 55.6 billion) in restitution to
survivors of the Holocaust.
	   Volkswagen also said that since 1988 it has paid out more than
25 million marks (dlrs 13.9 million) to support historical,
political and charity work to meet its responsibility for what
happened under the Nazi dictatorship.
	   Some large German firms, including Siemens and Mercedes-Benz,
voluntarily paid reparations to former slave laborers after the
war, but those living behind the Iron Curtain were unable to apply
for the money.
	   Most firms have resisted calls to make new payments to eastern
Europeans, claiming it is the federal government's responsibility.
	   After the war, Bonn compensated many of the former slave
laborers for health damage and for the time they spent in
concentration camps. But the workers had to apply for the
restitution by 1965.
	   The Bonn government has refused to accept individual wage claims
by slave workers, saying they were technically working for private
companies.
	   A German court opened a loophole in the reparations law last
year, to allow East Europeans to apply for imprisonment and health
compensation even if they missed the 1965 deadline.

World Cup: Scotland stays alive with 1-1 draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Craig Burley kept his nation's World Cup
hopes alive with a goal in the 66th minute Tuesday to give Scotland
a 1-1 draw with Norway.
	   Burley, scoring for only the second time in 25 appearances for
Scotland, chased down substitute David Weir's 25-meter lofted pass
and volleyed it on one hop over advancing goalkeeper Frode Grodas.
	   A loss wound have made the Scotland, which lost 2-1 last week to
Brazil, the first team to be mathematically eliminated from any
chance of advancing to the second round. Still, the Scots will need
to beat Morocco next week and get some help from others in the
group to advance for the first time in eight World Cup appearances.
	   Burley's goal was the first sign of life in the second half from
the Scots, who seemed doomed for another three-and-out World Cup
after Havard Flo's header scored 30 seconds after the break.
	   Flo, also scoring his second international goal, got past
Christian Dailly at the far post to head Vidar Riseth's left wing
cross.
	   But Burley's score energized his team, and he nearly netted
again eight minutes later when Grodas was forced to make a
fingertip save over the crossbar on a 20-meter blast by the Celtic
midfielder.
	   The Scots controlled most of the half, with Dailly working
especially well moving the ball down the left side. But while
Grodas was kept busy catching headers and punching away corners, he
didn't have to make a tough save.
	   Norway's one quality shot in the first half came in the 28th
minute on Roar Strand's close-range effort from the right, but
Scotland keeper Jim Leighton made the sliding stop.
	   The Norwegians scored both their goals off set plays in a 2-2
draw with Morocco last week, but Scottish defender Colin Hendry won
the aerial battle with tall striker Tore Andre Flo, keeping the
Scandinavians' scoring chances at bay.

Former head of Italian railroad indicted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The former head of Italy's railroads,
Lorenzo Necci, was indicted Tuesday on corruption charges, news
reports said.
	   Necci was arrested nearly two years ago in connection with an
investigation by Milan prosecutors into alleged payoffs by
businesses seeking contracts with the railroad.
	   He, who has insisted he is innocent, resigned from his post
shortly after the arrest.
	   Dozens of others, including several top businessmen, have been
arrested in the probe.
	   Necci, a lawyer, joined the state railroad in 1990 with a
mandate to modernize and cut costs in the money-losing system.
	   Trial was ordered to begin Sept. 25.

Stolpe as an informer for the Ministry for State Security, known as
the Stasi.
	   The court said the statements by Christian Democratic Union
lawmaker Uwe Lehmann-Brauns were protected under freedom of
thought, a basic right guaranteed by Germany's constitution.
	   Stolpe, a Social Democrat and once the top Lutheran bishop in
East Germany, said the ruling infringed on ``human dignity.''
	   Stolpe has never denied that, as a top religious official, he
often communicated with East Germany's communist establishment. But
he denies he collaborated with the Stasi.
	   ``Under the conditions of a dictatorship other ways must be
taken in the interest of the people than in a free democracy,''
Stolpe said Tuesday.
	   Stolpe had called on his party colleague, former Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt, and five former East German Lutheran bishops as
character witnesses in his defense.
	   Lehmann-Brauns had accused Stolpe of working as the Stasi's
unofficial agent for more than 20 years under the code name
Sekretaer, or secretary.
	   Lehmann-Brauns made the allegation in a ZDF television interview
in 1996, when Berlin and neighboring Brandenburg state held a vote
to determine if the two should merge. Lehmann-Brauns, who was
against the merger, said the prospect of Stolpe becoming governor
of Berlin ``gives me a bad headache.''
	   The proposed merger was widely defeated in the vote.
	   A state appeals court had issued a restraining order to bar
Lehmann-Brauns' statements linking the governor to the Stasi, after
the Potsdam state court in Brandenburg had earlier ruled against
Stolpe.
	   Lehmann-Brauns then filed with the Federal Constitutional Court
in Karlsruhe to get the restraining order lifted, arguing that as a
lawmaker he should be allowed to express a political difference of
opinion.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish Police on Tuesday arrested over 70
members of a criminal gang they believed to be from embattled
Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Most of the suspects arrested on suspicion of drug-smuggling,
money laundering and robbery carried false identity documents but
were known to be from Kosovo, police spokesman Jose Maria Seara
said.
	   The alleged mob leader, identified as Alessandro Passino from
Pristina, was arrested in Madrid along with his No. 2 Marco Fatmir,
the spokesman reported.
	   Another suspected leader, identified as Gani Potero, was
detained in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
	   Since it began its Spanish operations in early 1997, the gang
had robbed over 1,000 houses and industrial estates and maintained
close ties with Berlin, Seara said.
	   German police took part in Tuesday's multi-pronged operation in
Spain and several gang members were also arrested in Berlin, he
said.
	   Police seized some eight million pesetas (about dlrs 50,000) in
cash and large sums of German marcs and Italian Lira. No firearms
were found.
	   More arrests were expected in the operation that was mounted
before dawn and due to continue into the night.

Family of dead Palestinian man blames Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian farmer died at a Hebron
hospital Tuesday from a blow to the head which family members said
was caused by Jewish settlers.
	   Mahmoud Majid Turki said he and his cousin Abdel were walking
home from their fields along a West Bank highway near Hebron used
by Jewish settlers when a vehicle carrying four men wearing the
same skullcaps traditionally worn by observant Jews, slowed down
next to them. Mahmoud said one man reached out and struck Abdel on
the back of the head with what he described as a ``heavy stick.''
	   Abdel collapsed immediately and Mahmoud said he saw the settler
vehicle enter the nearby settlement of Beit Hagay moments after the
incident. The Abu Turkis were taken to a Hebron hospital by a group
of Palestinians passing by.
	   Dr. Ziad al Ashak said Abdel's death was caused by a blow to the
back of the head. The Israeli police and military authorities did
not have any immediate information on the incident.
	   Abdel's father however said he was convinced settlers were
behind the killing and vowed revenge.
	   ``There is no peace for me and we will take revenge on my son's
death,'' Mohammed Abu Turki said, weeping over his son's body.
	   Abdel's body was transferred to a second Hebron hospital for
autopsy and his funeral was planned for Wednesday.

Netanyahu: Israel, Palestinians may not achieve final settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new Netanyahu, Erekat
quotes, recast. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that Israel and the Palestinians would never achieve a final peace
settlement if the Palestinians did not give up their demands for
Jerusalem and the return of refugees.
	   Netanyahu said completing an interim deal on a West Bank troop
pullout was proving so difficult because it could be the last
agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians for a long time.
	   ``It is possible that we will have to live for some time,
perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that (interim)
agreement,'' he told Israel's Army Radio.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States _ and also
reportedly from his own defense minister _ to respond to a U.S.
proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Unofficial deadline after deadline has passed with no decision
from Israel _ and no action from the United States. The plan, first
introduced in January, has been accepted by the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu insisted Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a
decision, and criticized Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai for
pushing him to reach a decision soon.
	   ``We don't point a pistol at our own forehead,'' he said on the
radio. ``That is not the way to conduct negotiations.''
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the two obstacles to
wrapping up an agreement were how to verify whether the
Palestinians were keeping their promises to improve security
measures, and yet another promised West Bank pullout.
	   Israel's Haaretz newspaper said Israel was trying to get
assurances from the United States that Washington would oppose any
unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood.
	   In the past, Netanyahu has proposed that once an agreement on a
pullout is reached, Israel and the Palestinians move directly to
talks on a final peace settlement, which is supposed to be
negotiated by next May.
	   But Netanyahu said Tuesday that the Palestinians would have to
give up their demand for the return of Palestinian refugees from
the 1948 and 1967 Mideast wars and for the division of Jerusalem.
Otherwise, he said, ``There will be no agreement.''
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
1967 war, as a future capital. The status of the city _ along with
the refugee question and other fundamental issues such as
Palestinian statehood _ are supposed to be part of the final status
talks.
	   ``They must compromise with their absolute demands to return
Israel to the 1967 boundaries, or to carve the city in two, or have
the asphyxiation of Israel with Palestinian refugees become a
reality,'' Netanyahu said in a speech to United Israel Appeal
supporters from around the world Tuesday night.
	   ``None of that will become a reality,'' he said. ``It is for the
Palestinians to make this historic compromise.''
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu was
trying to preempt the outcome of the final settlement talks before
they even started.
	   ``If he's saying he will not negotiate Jerusalem and refugees
... what is left for the permanent status agenda?,'' he asked.
``These are the real issues on the agenda.
	   ``This uncovers the real face of Mr. Netanyahu,'' Erekat added.
``While he's in office, there will never be a peace agreement, and
now he's admitting it.''
	   Israel demolished two houses in Arab neighborhoods of east
Jerusalem on Tuesday, despite criticism from the United States
after demolishing three others on Monday. Israel says the houses
were built illegally.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the demolitions
sent the ``wrong signals'' at a time when the Mideast peace process
is in crisis.
	   Also Tuesday, Israel's settler council said settlers would camp
out in tent cities across from Netanyahu's house starting next
week, in a new campaign against any West Bank pullout.

West Indies to host 2007 cricket World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Cricket Council (ICC) Tuesday
awarded the 2007 World Cup to the West Indies with the possibility
of playing some matches in Bermuda, Canada and the United States.
	   The ICC president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, said sharing of the World
Cup by the West Indies will help spread the game.
	   ``The West Indies Cricket Board has been extremely considerate
and we are hoping that several games could be played in these
countries,'' Dalmiya said.
	   England, host of the seventh World Cup in 1999, has allocated
some matches to Scotland and the Netherlands.
	   The premier limited-over competition will move to South Africa
in 2003 and the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) is
also considering giving some matches to Zimbabwe and Kenya.
	   Canada was granted the right to host the 2001 ICC Trophy for
non-Test playing nations, which is also the qualifying competiton
for the World Cup.
	   The ICC deferred a final decision on creating a world
championship for Test cricket but reduced the frequency of the
under-19 limited-over World Cup to every two years.
	   A decision on the viability of a Test cricket world championship
will now be made at the end of the year, ICC's chief executive
David Richards said.
	   Richards said the idea remained under consideration but a
stand-alone Test cricket world championship, held every four years
over two months, could be staged alongside an official Test ladder.
	   The Test ladder would, in effect, be a constantly updated league
table.
	   ``The concept of a stand-alone Test cricket world championship
remains under consideration, but there are issues of timing and
avoidance of commercial conflict which require resolution,''
Richards said.
	   He said the Test ladder is another option but this would require
an equitable program of Test tours between all countries.
	   ``It may appear that we are going a bit slow, but something like
this needs a lot of work,'' Richards said. ``We have to be certain
we have a concept which is viable.''

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ Tony Blair wanted a summit where the
European Union reached out to its citizens, but Helmut Kohl made
sure the 15 EU leaders kept their hands firmly on their
pocketbooks.
	   An unsightly quarrel over how much Germany and others pay into
the EU's collective kitty dulled the Cardiff summit's grand words
on forging a euro-bloc with a human face and welcoming poor eastern
neighbors into Western Europe's prosperity zone.
	   ``It was a more difficult summit than we expected, an extremely
tough political debate, '' Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said Tuesday at the end of the two-day meeting.
	   At the center of the squabble was Germany's Chancellor Kohl, who
has taken up the ``I want my money back'' battle cry once wielded
successfully by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
her crusades against the EU.
	   ``This is not a declaration of war. We seek fair treatment.
Nothing more, nothing less,'' Kohl told reporters.
	   Facing an uphill battle to secure re-election in September's
German elections, Kohl insists Germany's contribution to the EU
coffers is oversized and must be trimmed.
	   Germany currently provides almost one-third of the EU's dlrs 86
billion annual budget. Kohl says that's too much compared with what
Germany gets back by way of aid to its farmers and poor regions.
	   He wants the whole system changed before the EU pushes ahead
with plans to bring in Cyprus and up to five former East bloc
nations as new members by 2004.
	   The Dutch, Swedish and Austrians _ who also claim they pay too
much _ back Kohl. But poorer EU nations, led by Spain, are bitterly
opposed. They worry that what Kohl calls burden-sharing will mean a
flight of EU funds from the so-called ``Club-Med'' nations to the
rust-belt cities of the old East Germany and the candidate nations
further east.
	   Other relatively rich nations also are opposed, fearing
Germany's gain will mean more pain for them.
	   ``Naturally, I'm not in favor of a reduction of the German
contribution,'' said French President Jacques Chirac. ``Because it
would mean an increase in the French contribution.''
	   Summit Chairman Blair, the British prime minister, had hoped to
skim over the cash conflict and focus on promoting his image of a
``people's Europe'' in tune with the needs and concerns of the
union's 370 million citizens.
	   ``It is important we don't end up with a centralized European
superstate, poking its nose into every nook and cranny,'' Blair
said.
	   But although the leaders postponed any substantive debate on the
budget battle until after the German elections, even agreeing to
disagree proved difficult.
	   While the leaders adjourned for a leisurely lunch to honor
visiting South African President Nelson Mandela, EU foreign
ministers had to sweat over the wording of a end-of-summit
statement that wound up declaring: ``Some member states have
expressed their view that burden-sharing should be more equitable
and have called for the creation of a mechanism for correcting
budget imbalances, but some member states have opposed this.''
	   Although no major decisions were made, the leaders at least set
out a timetable for solving some of the EU's pressing problems,
with a series of at least four summits planned over the next year
in Austria and Germany.
	   On other issues, the leaders failed to get Greece to drop its
veto on closer relations with Turkey; hailed their soon-to-be-born
single currency as a bulwark protecting Europe from the aftershocks
of Asia's financial crisis, and restated the threat of Western
military action to deter Serbia's military campaign in Kosovo.

For 2nd time in two weeks, Stones cancel Milan concert

 &UR; EDs:UPDATES with consumer advocate group demanding to see medical
certificate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian fans can't get no satisfaction.
	   For the second time in two weeks, the Rolling Stones have
canceled a concert in Milan, this time upsetting some 45,000 fans
who had bought tickets for Tuesday's night event.
	   This time the band's leader Mick Jagger got laryngitis. The May
30 date was canceled after Keith Richards broke a rib by falling
off a chair while reaching for a book.
	   ``We were looking forward to playing in Italy and we're very
sorry we're not able to,'' Jagger was quoted as saying in a
statement. ``But we can't start a concert at the risk of suspending
it after two songs.''
	   An Italian consumer advocate group demanded that Jagger produce
a medical certificate proving his condition.
	   ``The ripped-off ticket-holders have serious doubts on the
singer's medical condition,'' said the Condacons group.
	   Organizers said they are trying to re-schedule the concert for
September. Tickets bought for Tuesday's event will be reimbursed.

Study: Israeli women underrepresented in politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The voice of Israeli women is no more
than a whisper when it comes to politics, a study said Tuesday.
	   Israel ranks in the bottom fifth in the world in women's
political representation, with nine female members in the 120-seat
parliament and one woman serving among 17 men in the Cabinet.
	   A study by Craig Charney, a former polling analyst for U.S.
President Bill Clinton, found that male politicians in Israel would
do well to pay more attention to issues of concern to women, such
as child care, discrimination on the job and crime.
	   ``It's a missed opportunity by Israeli politicians,'' Charney
told a news conference. ``More attention to women's issue can
increase a politician's chance to get elected.''
	   A phone survey of 800 men and women found a gender gap in voting
patterns, with women generally more critical of the performance of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The study was commissioned by the Israel Women's Network which
has 3,000 members and lobbies for women's rights in parliament.
	   A member of the group, Dafna Israeli, said a key reason for
women's underrepresentation in politics was the traditional
emphasis on a military background as a condition for advancement.
	   She noted that a disproportionate number of legislators are men
with military careers. While women do serve in the army for two
years, they are barred from combat and are usually confined to
subservient roles.
	   She also said the during Israel's struggle for survival, issues
such as child care and equal pay were often dismissed as
insignificant by male politicians. As a result, women felt ignored
by the country's leaders and lost interest in politics.

Pacific tournament to be expanded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Pacific Rim rugby union tournament is
set to be expanded next season, the International Rugby Board said
Tuesday.
	   The IRB, which sanctions the Five Nations Championships and the
powerful southern hemisphere Tri-Nations tournament, has proposed
the Pacific Rim Championship be expanded to seven teams from the
current four-team format.
	   Under the proposal, Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa will join the
original Pacific Rim unions _ Canada, Japan, United States and Hong
Kong _ in the 1999 tournament.
	   IRB chairman Vernon Pugh said preliminary details of the
expanded tournament were agreed at a Pacific Rim meeting in San
Francisco on Monnday.
	   A final decision will be made by the IRB executive council in
October.
	   Pugh said the Pacific Rim championship was initially designed to
ensure regular international competition for the four competing
unions and the concept would benefit the three Pacific Islands as
well.
	   The IRB proposal favors a format where each country plays three
home and three away matches each year for the next three years.

Fire extinguisher sparks commotion in Kremlin subway station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rewrites and UPDATES throughout with device determined to be a
fire extinguisher, new details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Something exploded Tuesday on a subway car
traveling to a Kremlin station. But what was it?
	   Police first said it was fireworks. Terrorism experts suggested
it was a signal flare or a smoke bomb. Other law enforcement agents
decided it was a flying, sparking can of deodorant.
	   The mystery wasn't solved until a few hours later when a man
clutching a faulty fire extinguisher walked into the headquarters
of the former KGB.
	   According to Russian media, the man had just bought the
six-kilogram (12-pound) fire extinguisher through a classified ad
and was clutching it close to his chest in the steamy, crowded
subway car when it began to spurt and spit foam.
	   It flew out of the man's hands, striking and injuring two
passengers, according to news agencies and TV reports. Some
witnesses said it was spewing sparks. Others said it flew about the
cabin like a rocket.
	   The man, frightened, grabbed the trouble-making device and
jumped off the train at the next station, Teatralnaya, one of three
serving the Kremlin area.
	   A few hours later, he heard a news report that police were
searching for a ``terrorist'' who set off a subway blast. He
decided to turn himself in before he was tracked down, walked into
the KGB's forbidding former headquarters on Lubyanka Square. The
building is now used by one of the KGB's successor agencies, the
Federal Security Service.
	   The two injured passengers were treated for slight injuries and
released, a police spokesman said. Subway service was not affected.

Hooligan concerns move on to Toulouse; Iranians protest film
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Norway-Scotland; WILL be UPDATED with
Brazil-Morocco &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ England and its fans are headed for Toulouse,
trailed closely by French police. Scotland moves on to
Saint-Etienne, thankful to Craig Burley that it can go there with a
purpose.
	   Burley, scoring only his second goal in 25 international
appearances, chased down substitute David Weir's 25-meter lob pass
and volleyed it on one hop over advancing goalkeeper Frode Grodas
in the 66th minute to give Scotland a 1-1 draw with Norway on
Tuesday.
	   A loss wound have made Scotland, which lost 2-1 last week to
Brazil, the first team to be mathematically eliminated from any
chance of advancing to the World Cup's second round. Still, the
Scots will need to beat Morocco at Saint-Etienne next week and get
some help from others in the group to advance for the first time in
eight Cup appearances.
	   Meanwhile, courts in the southern resort of Marseille dealt
swiftly and harshly with hooligans detained after waves of violence
surrounding England's 2-0 victory over Tunisia. Now, Toulouse,
about 400 kilometers (240 miles) to the west, was bracing for
England's next match with Romania on Monday.
	   About 1,000 English fans were already reported in the city,
prompting officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July
11. They also considered closing bars early.
	   In Marseille, 25 suspects _ 18 French, six English and a
Tunisian _ remained held for questioning for the violence. A local
public official joined calls for England to be kicked out of the
World Cup, a suggestion rejected by FIFA.
	   Late Monday, a court convicted and sentenced three Englishmen to
three months in prison. Five English and three French suspects were
given a trial date of July 17, five days after the World Cup ends.
	   Officials were also dealing with fans in Bordeaux, where
Scotland played Norway. Police rounded up 58 ticketless Scots
before the game. They were fed and placed in a hall to watch the
match on TV, then were to be loaded on their bus and escorted out
of town.
	   They no doubt had mixed reactions to Scotland's effort,
especially after Norway's Havard Flo scored on a header 30 seconds
into the second half. But Scotland coach Craig Brown made a
tactical move to bring Burley ahead to a central midfield position,
and it paid off.
	   Later Tuesday, Brazil had a chance to become the first team to
clinch a second-round berth as it faced Morocco in Nantes.
	   An entirely different kind of controversy was brewing in the
Iranian team's camp, where officials are incensed over the showing
of an unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV.
	   ``Not Without My Daughter,'' which stars Sally Field and
portrays Iranians as dirty, boorish, cruel and obsessed with their
Islamic religion and its attitudes toward women, was screened on
France's privately owned channel M6 late Monday.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' Safaei
Farahani, head of Iran's soccer federation, told The Associated
Press. ``We hold the French government responsible for allowing the
screening of the film, and will register our severe protest.''
	   Farahani scheduled a meeting with French soccer officials to
complain.
	   More than 50 people were injured in the Marseille violence,
including an Englishman whose neck artery was cut by a bottle and
another who was stabbed in the back.
	   Police detained nearly 80 people, but they were under fire in
local and national press who accused them of failing to control the
violence by hundreds of locals and drunken English fans.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who defended the
police actions, signed an order Tuesday to immediately expel five
English fans and a Tunisian, and he threatened other expulsions if
soccer violence recurs.
	   Renaud Muselier, Marseille's deputy mayor, urged that the
English team be banned from the championship. ``The World Cup's
image ... requires that the team be disqualified or excluded,'' he
said in a statement.
	   In London, The Independent newspaper urged the England team to
pull out of the World Cup so the tournament could return to being
``a festival of football.''
	   The English Football Association has already scoffed at such
suggestions. In Paris, FIFA soccer officials had no plans to send
the English home.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding for the 2006 games.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In the fiercest display of its
determination to stamp out radical Islam, the military on Tuesday
sacked a record number of personnel suspected of having ties with
the religious groups.
	   The move was apparently intended to force the government to be
as hard against Islamic radicalism, which the military sees as a
challenge to the country's secular traditions.
	   The decision was taken by the top brass and Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz during a high military council meeting called Tuesday to
discuss radical Islamic activities.
	   Private NTV television said 109 officers and 58 non-commissioned
officers were fired. A statement released by the council said
``disciplinary decisions'' were taken against some military
personnel without citing a number.
	   The council's decision is final and the courts have no
jurisdiction.
	   Fearing that Islamic radicalism is gaining ground in this
secular society, the military is unhappy with what it considers the
government's failure to deliver on promises to battle radical
groups, which want an Islamic state.
	   It is however, difficult for civilian governments to adopt
anti-religious measures for fear of losing popularity among devout
Muslims. The country's first Islamic government, led by the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party, was forced out of power last year after
irking the military with a series of policies increasing Islam's
profile in daily life.
	   Recai Kutan, leader of the Virtue Party, which replaced the
Welfare Party, denounced the military's practice.
	   ``Our conception of secularism is a democratic secularism,'' he
said.
	   More than 300 officers were dismissed for having ties with
radical Islamic groups over the past two years, but Tuesday's
sacking was the highest number ever to be ousted at one time.
	   The high number came as a surprise, since the army is considered
strictly pro-secular, devoid of such religious tendencies. Cadets
get a very strict pro-western education based on the teachings of
modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who abolished the
Caliphat after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and separated
state and religion.
	   Islamic groups have been challenging the secular traditions by
wearing head scarves at the universities despite a ban.
	   Pro-Islamic politicians on Tuesday denounced as human rights
violations the harrassment of students wearing head scarves who
have barred them from sitting exams.
	   ``The children of our citizens are being kept at universities
gates away from their classes,'' Deputy Tevhid Karakaya told
Parliament.

Iran's World Cup team upset over U.S. film on French TV

	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Angered by the showing of an
unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV, Iran's World Cup
team said Tuesday that the broadcast was a politically motivated
insult that had hurt morale.
	   The screening of ``Not Without My Daughter,'' a film based on a
book by Betty Mahmoudi, could turn into a diplomatic spat between
the two countries.
	   France's privately owned channel M6 aired the film late Monday.
It's based on the true story of an American woman who escapes from
Iran with her daughter against the wishes of her Iranian husband.
	   Sally Field plays the lead role in a film that portrays Iranians
as dirty, boorish and cruel, obsessed with their Islamic religion
and its attitudes toward women.
	   Speaking to reporters, Iran's star striker Khodadad Azizi took
off the yellow cap given by the French Organizing Committee, and
pointed to its ``Fair Play'' logo.
	   ``Is the showing of this movie, which is an insult to our
people, fair play,'' asked Azizi, who plays in the German
Bundesliga.
	   ``Fair play is not limited to the field. The French organizers
must ensure fair play off the field as well,'' said Azizi. ``I'm
not going to wear this cap again,'' he said.
	   The head of Iran's soccer federation, Safaei Farahani, told The
Associated Press he had submitted a written protest to the World
Cup organizing committee and FIFA. ``I'm waiting for an answer,''
he said.
	   In its first World Cup match, Iran lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia on
Sunday. But the Iranians, who were expected to crumble against the
highly rated Yugoslavs, saw the result as a victory of sorts.
	   Iran's next game is against the United States on Sunday in Lyon.
With 20 years of enmity between the two countries, it will be the
most politically charged game of the tournament. Iran's last game
in the first round will be against Germany. The United States lost
2-0 to Germany on Monday in its first Group F match.
	   Azizi, and mid-fielders Mohammad Khakpour and Alireza
Mansourian, speaking on behalf of their team, said the film was an
insult to Iranian players and fans who had come to France with
goodwill.
	   The Iranians have been trying to portray their good face to the
world at the World Cup.
	   The quiet little town of Yssingeaux in the French heartland that
is Iran's World Cup base has been transformed by the coming of the
Iranian team.
	   The town hall features exhibits of photos and Persian carpets,
Iranian movies are shown regularly, and a cultural night is
scheduled for Wednesday featuring Iranian food, music and poetry.
	   A female Iranian journalist spoke about women in Iran, and shops
in town are selling videos of ``Iran's Remarkable Women.''
	   At the start of the match with Yugoslavia the players handed out
roses to the Yugoslav team and were at pains to be courteous during
the match.
	   Iranian players and soccer officials said the French government
should have stopped the showing of the film, which had been
advertised for several days.
	   Azizi questioned the timing of the film, and French hospitality.
	   ``Out of 365 days in a year, why was this film shown now,'' said
Azizi. ``I think that the showing was not without reason, and it
has hurt morale. But this does not mean we will not play our soccer
against the United States and Germany.''
	   He said he was so upset with the film that he couldn't watch
Monday's match between Germany and the United States, teams the
Iranians will have to play against.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' said
Farahani.
	   ``In Iran, people laugh when they see this film and how it
portrays Iranians,'' said Mansourian. ``They consider it a
comedy,'' he said.
	   Officials of channel M6 were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Iran's hard-line Resalat daily claimed the film was broadcast to
put pressure on Iranian players, and to embarrass Iranians in
general.
	   ``One aim of the propaganda exercise was to put psychological
pressure on the Iranian football players and fans who are gathering
in France to encourage the team,'' the Farsi-language paper said
Tuesday.

World Cup: Reporter too close to breaking news
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An English newspaper journalist unwittingly became
the victim of an event he was covering in Marseille.
	   Evening Standard reporter Alex Renton was caught up in the
violence in Marseille following England's World Cup win over
Tunisia on Monday.
	   Renton, who was knocked unconscious and spent the night in a
Marseille hospital, described his ordeal in an article in Tuesday's
Evening Standard.
	   Renton said he had filed a story after the game and was going
for a soft drink when he was attacked. He didn't specify who the
assailants were or whether they were English.
	   ``Somewhere between the riot police and a knot of Tunisian fans
I got into one of those conversations you try to exit from as fast
as possible,'' he wrote.
	   ``I got a bang on the head and a nasty kick in the stomach,'' he
wrote. ``Very soon I found myself on the ground under the eyes of
half a dozen still and television cameras, not a pleasnt reversal
of roles.''
	   Renton said he only got away from the ``lads'' who were kicking
him because three young local women shouted at them to stop and
then directed another man to drag him across to a group of English
journalists.
	   Renton was taken to hospital by ambulance and spent the night in
a ward with other victims of the violence.

Arafat postpones talks with Hamas leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IMAD MUSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Yasser Arafat surprised leaders of
the militant group Hamas Tuesday by postponing talks between the
two aimed at formulating a new Palestinian government.
	   Arafat has nine days to reshuffle his Cabinet or face a
no-confidence motion in the Palestinian Legislative Council. In the
hopes of appeasing political rivals, Arafat had asked groups such
as Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, to participate in
consultations for a new Cabinet and possibly join the government.
	   But the talks never took place as scheduled Tuesday.
	   ``They informed us that the meeting was delayed indefinitely
without giving any reasons,'' said Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar,
who along with other leaders of the movement had been invited to
meet with Arafat Tuesday in Gaza.
	   Arafat's spokesmen would not comment on the postponement but an
aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Arafat had
``preferred to meet first with his own Fatah party before seeing
Hamas leaders,'' and planned to reschedule talks with Hamas.
	   Under pressure from the Palestinian council to present a new
Cabinet by June 25, Arafat was scheduled to meet with all
Palestinian factions this week to discern their input.
	   ``(Arafat) wants to bring several opponents of the peace
agreement into the Cabinet in hopes of strengthening the
Palestinian negotiating position,'' said the Arafat aide. The aide
said that Arafat wanted to match Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's excuse not to compromise in the peace talks because of
the presence of hardliners in his government.
	   But opposition leaders, were quick to reject the offers this
week and said the peace process would not be a reason to join
Arafat's Cabinet. ``What we need is a real dialogue on national
unity, not for him to use us for his immediate purposes,'' said
Rabah Muhanna of the small Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
	   Last year, the Palestinian legislative council issued a report
citing widespread corruption in Arafat's Palestinian Authority and
demanding the resignation of several ministers. But the report went
largely ignored, as most legislative acts do, and last month the
council threatened a no-confidence vote against Arafat if he didn't
clean up his Cabinet.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled. Two ministers
passed away this year, four resigned, and the appointment of one
current minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Muhanna said Arafat needed to meet the demands of the council
and stamp out corruption within his ranks before the PFLP would
lend its hand to the Cabinet.
	   Hamas leaders agreed.
	   ``There is a crisis in this government. If there was not, the
Cabinet would not be on the verge of collapsing and they would not
want to consult with us,'' said Zahar.

 &UR; Volkswagen says it's not responsible for paying slave workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen says 30 Hungarian Jews who
are seeking back wages for their time as Nazi slave laborers at its
plants should claim the payments from the government instead.
	   In a letter to their lawyer Monday, the German automaker said it
is not legally bound to make such payments
	   Lawyer Klaus von Muenchhausen said Friday he would file a
lawsuit seeking back wages for the Hungarian Jews, who are now in
their 70s. As teen-agers in 1944-45, they had been sent from the
Auschwitz concentration camp to Volkswagen's factory in Wolfsburg
to produce armaments, Muenchhausen said.
	   Volkswagen said the Nazi government was responsible for the
forced labor and that the Hungarians should place their claims with
the regime's successor, the current German government.
	   The company also noted that Germany has over the years paid more
than 100 billion marks (dlrs 55.6 billion) in restitution to
survivors of the Holocaust.
	   Volkswagen also said that since 1988 it has paid out more than
25 million marks (dlrs 13.9 million) to support historical,
political and charity work to meet its responsibility for what
happened under the Nazi dictatorship.
	   Some large German firms, including Siemens and Mercedes-Benz,
voluntarily paid reparations to former slave laborers after the
war, but those living behind the Iron Curtain were unable to apply
for the money.
	   Most firms have resisted calls to make new payments to eastern
Europeans, claiming it is the federal government's responsibility.
	   After the war, Bonn compensated many of the former slave
laborers for health damage and for the time they spent in
concentration camps. But the workers had to apply for the
restitution by 1965.
	   The Bonn government has refused to accept individual wage claims
by slave workers, saying they were technically working for private
companies.
	   A German court opened a loophole in the reparations law last
year, to allow East Europeans to apply for imprisonment and health
compensation even if they missed the 1965 deadline.

Ukrainian police detain counterfeiters

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police have arrested three youths accused
of using a home computer to counterfeit money, police said Tuesday.
	   The youths, led by a 20-year-old resident of the eastern town of
Poltava, used knowledge gained from TV documentaries to produce
10-hryvna notes, worth about dlrs 5 at the current exchange rate.
	   The gang began printing fake money in early May and used the
notes to purchase goods in kiosks and from street vendors, the
Poltava Interior Ministry department said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The report did not say when the youths were arrested.
	   Another gang of counterfeiters which also used a computer to
produce fake notes was recently arrested in the eastern region of
Luhansk, the Interior Ministry said.

Russia launches six communication satellites, some fail to find

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with satellites not yet in proper orbit. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least three, and possibly all six, of the
communications satellites launched by Russia's Strategic Missile
Forces on Tuesday have so far failed to find their proper orbit,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The Kosmos satellites were put into orbit by a Tsiklon-3
booster, which blasted off from the Plesetsk launch pad at 2:58
a.m. (2258 Monday), the Interfax news agency reported, quoting
Russia's Strategic Missile Forces.
	   ITAR-Tass said ``either three or all six'' of the satellites had
not reached their orbit by Tuesday night. It did not say what might
have caused the problem. Space experts planned to continue
monitoring them, it said.
	   The satellites will to be used ``in the interests of the Defense
Ministry,'' Interfax said, without elaboration.
	   The Plesetsk cosmodrome, about 500 kilometers (312 miles) below
the Arctic Circle in northwestern Russia, is used mostly for
military satellite launches.
	   Russia also uses the better-positioned Baikonur cosmodrome,
leased from Kazakstan, for international satellite launches and
manned space flights. Baikonur is closer to the equator, allowing
launches of satellites to higher orbits using less powerful
boosters.
	   Deprived of the ample funding and prestige it enjoyed during the
Soviet era, Russia's ailing space agency has pinned its hopes for
survival on commercial satellite launches and other international
satellite programs.

Researchers say many cancer patients suffer needless pain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL A. DRISCOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Despite the availability of potent painkillers,
doctors do a poor job relieving the agony of many cancer patients,
particularly older people and minorities, researchers say.
	   In a study of 13,625 cancer patients in nursing homes, up to 40
percent were in pain every day, and a quarter of them received no
painkiller whatsoever.
	   This ``is no longer acceptable and should be considered a
first-line indicator of poor quality of medical care,'' the
researchers wrote in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
	   Older patients and minorities were even less likely to receive
painkillers, in part because they are less likely to reveal their
suffering, the researchers found.
	   The study said blacks were 63 percent more likely than whites to
be untreated for pain. Among patients 65 to 74 years old, more than
20 percent received no painkiller. The number rose to 30 percent
for patients 85 and older.
	   The researchers pointed to other studies that found that fear of
side effects and addiction as well as less knowledge about
medicines could account for reduced use of painkillers among these
patients.
	   The ability to pay for the medication was not an issue because
all the patients were covered by Medicare.
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Roberto Bernabei, a visiting
professor at Brown University, said there is a range of
explanations for poor pain control, including doctors poorly
trained in pain management and an unwillingness of many nursing
homes to stock opiates.
	   In an accompanying editorial, a cancer pain specialist said
doctors get almost no training in pain management. However, even
with improved training, total success will be difficult, wrote
Charles S. Cleeland of the Pain Research Group at the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston.
	   ``The best pain management requires an informed patient who is
willing to report pain and to voice complaints if pain is not
controlled,'' he said.
	   Until recently, Cleeland said, people have expected cancer to be
painful and have not insisted on drugs to control the suffering.
But, he said, this is changing and ``patients, their families and
the public are becoming less tolerant of poor pain management.
	   ``That intolerance may prove to be the ultimate driving force
behind improving care of patients with pain,'' he said.
	   The study was done among patients 65 and older at nursing homes
in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New York and South Dakota between
1992 and 1995.

World Cup: Scotland stays alive with 1-1 draw

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Craig Burley kept his nation's World Cup
hopes alive with a goal in the 66th minute Tuesday to give Scotland
a 1-1 draw with Norway.
	   Burley, scoring for only the second time in 25 appearances for
Scotland, chased down substitute David Weir's 25-meter lofted pass
and volleyed it on one hop over advancing goalkeeper Frode Grodas.
	   It came only minutes after a Scotland coach Craig Brown made two
substitutions, bringing on Weir for Colin Calderwood and Jackie
McNamara for Darren Jackson. That allowed Burley to assume a more
central role in midfield, and it paid off.
	   ``When we went behind, there was no option,'' Brown said. ``We
had to gamble and move forward. It's OK the substitution was
successful, but sometimes they're successful and sometimes they're
not. I'm not going to take huge credit because, quite honestly, we
shouldn't have needed that goal to get back in the game. We
should've been ahead.''
	   A loss wound have made the Scotland, which lost 2-1 last week to
Brazil, the first team to be mathematically eliminated from any
chance of advancing to the second round. Still, the Scots will need
to beat Morocco next week and get some help from others in the
group to advance for the first time in eight World Cup appearances.
	   Burley's goal was the first sign of life in the second half from
the Scots, who seemed doomed for another three-and-out World Cup
after Havard Flo's header scored 30 seconds after the break.
	   Flo, also scoring his second international goal, got past
Christian Dailly at the far post to head Vidar Riseth's left wing
cross.
	   But Burley's score energized his team, and he nearly netted
again eight minutes later when Grodas was forced to make a
fingertip save over the crossbar on a 20-meter blast by the Celtic
midfielder.
	   The Scots controlled most of the half, with Dailly working
especially well moving the ball down the left side. But while
Grodas was kept busy catching headers and punching away corners, he
didn't have to make a tough save.
	   Norway's one quality shot in the first half came in the 28th
minute on Roar Strand's close-range effort from the right, but
Scotland keeper Jim Leighton made the sliding stop.
	   The Norwegians scored both their goals off set plays in a 2-2
draw with Morocco last week, but Scottish defender Colin Hendry won
the aerial battle with tall striker Tore Andre Flo, keeping the
Scandinavians' scoring chances at bay.

Taliban shuts down privately run schools for girls

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army on Tuesday
shut down more than 100 private schools that have been quietly
educating thousands of girls in defiance of bans aimed at creating
a hard-line religious state.
	   Included in the closure edict are scores of small home-based
vocational training programs, many of them run by international aid
groups, that teach girls and young women to weave carpets and sew.
The classes are vital to rebuilding the country from years of civil
war.
	   Under the new rules, the Taliban will issue licenses to schools,
but only after scrutinizing their objectives. Schools will not be
allowed to instruct girls older than the age of eight but will be
limited to teaching the Koran, the Muslim holy book. The schools on
the closure list violated those rules, the government said Tuesday.
	   ``These schools weren't just for children. They also included
14- and 15-year-old girls,'' Religious Affairs Minister Haji
Khulimuddin said at a news conference Tuesday.
	   The home-based schools have been run by thousands of women
teachers who were forced out of work by the Taliban after it took
control of Kabul in 1996 and imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law.
Without officially recognizing the schools, the Taliban has allowed
them to operate until now.
	   ``Right now, we have no control over these schools,''
Khulimuddin said. ``If they get permission then we can control
them.''
	   Tuesday's announcement is sure to fan fears that the Taliban's
desire for a strict Muslim government will create a repressive and
closed society in Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban's proscriptions on women have raised international
concern. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited the
country earlier this year and called the edicts on women
``despicable.'' U.N. aid officials have made similar comments.
	   In meetings with Western officials, Taliban leaders have
expressed a willingness to discuss the restrictions, but say the
push to keep women out of public life is driven primarily by
entrenched Afghan tribal traditions. The Taliban consists of former
tribesmen who until the takeover in 1996 had been students in rural
religious schools.
	   A survey conducted by aid groups in January found at least 107
``home schools'' in the capital, teaching some 6,500 children, half
of them girls. The schools teach religion, language, math and other
basic subjects.
	   Many consist of a single room with a cement floor where children
sit cross-legged while nearby a teacher draws pictures and words on
a piece of paper. Many of the schools have no blackboards,
notebooks or other supplies.
	   The aid groups have tried to help, providing basic materials to
some of the schools _ discreetly so as not to antagonize Taliban
rulers.
	   It wasn't immediately clear why the Taliban chose to announce
the crackdown now. At his press conference Tuesday, Khulimuddin
accused foreign aid workers associated with these home schools of
propagating anti-Taliban propaganda.
	   Aside for its prohibitions on women, the Taliban bans music and
most forms of light entertainment and requires men to grow beards,
wear a head covering and attend a mosque.
	   While the Afghan capital has been relatively peaceful in recent
days, the Taliban is waging fierce battles on three different front
lines, all in northern Afghanistan, to consolidate its rule. It
currently rules over about 85 percent of the country.
	   Its opponents, led by former president Burhanuddin Rabbani and
his military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, say the Taliban's brand of
Islamic interpretation is rooted more in tribal tradition than the
Koran.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Yugoslav army helicopters
allegedly opened fire on refugee camps on a mountain near Kosovo's
frontier with Albania, killing two people, and an unidentified man
was killed Tuesday on Albanian soil by firing Yugoslav troops.
	   The two incidents were reported as Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed in Moscow to meet again with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova to discuss the bloody conflict in Kosovo,
where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   For the first time, Kosovo's militant Albanian separatists
stated their conditions for a dialogue with the Serbian
authorities, saying a ceasefire depends on withdrawal of all
security forces and foreign mediation.
	   One of the helicopters firing on refugees was said to have borne
Red Cross markings. The accounts of the incident could not be
independently verified.
	   ``As soon as the first camp was burned, we left immediately,''
said Hilmi Ziberi of the attack late Monday, explaining that
Yugoslav troops on the ground chased away the refugees before
setting the camps on fire. He and other 50 refugees arrived at the
Padesh border post early Tuesday.
	   Both helicopters used heavy machine guns and also dropped hand
grenades as they buzzed the camps, Ziberi claimed.
	   Meanwhile, Ambassador Dan Everts, the head of the mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Albania confirmed in Tirana a report that an unidentified man was
shot and killed at Padesh border checkpoint by the Yugoslavs firing
across the border.
	   Everts also said that the Yugoslavs fired again when police
tried to recover the body of the man. No other details were
available Tuesday night.
	   Also in Albania's impoverished north, a U.N. aid agency convoy
of eleven trucks carrying plastic sheeting for windows and roofs,
shoes for women and children as well as mattresses and blankets,
arrived in the border town of Bajram Curri.
	   ``We made contingencies for more than 20,000 people,'' said
Laura Boldrini, an agency spokeswoman. Some 13,000 Kosovo refugees
have arrived in Albania so far.
	   Late Monday night, Jakup Krasniqi, the newly appointed spokesman
for the Kosovo Liberation Army, appeared on television in full
uniform emblazoned with the insignia of the KLA.
	   In the Albanian television interview received by satellite in
Kosovo, he said that dialogue would need thorough preparation.
	   Krasniqi stated what he said were three conditions for dialogue
with the Serbian authorities: urgent withdrawal of ``all enemy
forces from Kosovo territory'' before dialogue could begin;
mediation of ``one influential international factor,'' and
``thorough preparations.''
	   More than 300 people have since been killed in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians seek independence for the province.
	   The Serb Media Center, close to Kosovo's authorities, reported
the body of a Serbian police reservist was found early Tuesday in
his home in a village 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, that has been under militant attack.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's Albanian
leadership, cites local Albanian sources as saying the area close
to border outpost Cafa Prusit has been mined.
	   Quoting an activist from Rugova's political party in Decani,
Osman Cacaj, the Center said 17 villages in the area where a
population of 30,000 lived according to a 1991 census, are now
completely deserted, with 80 per cent of houses totally ruined or
uninhabitable.
	   Cacaj said 58 people were killed in the clashes in that western
region in Kosovo, about 100 were wounded, 300 are missing _ 200 of
whom are believed to be held by the Serbs.

Government tightens criteria for possession of firearms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The government on Tuesday approved tighter
criteria for private possession of firearms, following a series of
killings by psychologically unstable gun owners.
	   The project, which the government recommended for parliament's
approval, calls for increasing the age limit for applicants from 18
to 21. An applicant will have to undergo psychiatric and
psychological tests and show he knows how to safely handle guns.
	   Illegal possession of guns will entail a 10-year prison term.
	   The project also calls for regular checks every five years of
the firearms owner's psychological state.
	   The health ministry is to provide a list of illness that do not
allow for possession of arms.
	   It was not immediately known when the parliament will debate the
draft.
	   ``The new bill is dictated by the recent accidents with arms,''
Interior Minister Janusz Tomaszewski said.
	   Last week, a hunter in the southwestern city of Opole flew into
rage and killed his wife, his daughter, two neighbors and seriously
injured his grandson and five other people before committing
suicide at a party at his home.
	   Three months ago, an elderly army fan shot at gunpoint a friend
as the friend's son was driving them home.
	   On Monday, a 14-year-old boy shot and killed his 11-year-old
friend as they were were shooting ducks with his father's gun.

 &UR; With BC-EU Summit
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ An appeal by U.S. President Bill Clinton
for Greece to be more conciliatory toward Turkey failed to
strengthen the European Union's rocky relations with Ankara.
	   In a phone call to Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who
attended the two-day EU summit that ended Tuesday, Simitis said
Clinton urged Greece to lift a veto on EU aid for Turkey of more
than dlrs 400 million to reduce tensions in the southern Balkans.
	   Simitis rejected that, blaming Turkey for freezing ties with the
union after it was snubbed as candidate at a summit in Luxembourg
last December.
	   He said Clinton ``asked me to change our position regarding
Turkey ... using as a main argument that if this occurred, the
United States would be able to pressure Turkey to make some
concessions.''
	   Simitis said he told Clinton ``this is not feasible'' and that
while Turkey has no immediate chance of membership it is free to
accept an EU offer to forge a special relationship with the West
Europeans.
	   The EU leaders ended their summit here by declaring their bid to
bring 11 nations into their ranks on track, but acknowledging ties
with Turkey remain in a deep freeze.
	   They welcomed ``substantial progress'' to date in talks to bring
Cyprus and 10 East European into the EU over the next decade and
reiterated Turkey can join only if it meets the same membership
criteria as other candidates.
	   The EU has snubbed Turkey over its poor human rights record,
territorial disputes with Greece and occupation of northern Cyprus.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose country is ending a
six-month stint in the EU presidency, tried to pull Turkey closer
to the EU, but Simitis vetoed that.
	   Greece takes a hard-line on Turkey. Last month, it prevented the
holding of an EU-Turkey foreign ministers meeting, insisting the
Europeans spell out, ahead of the event, all of Turkey's failings.
	   Greece maintains a veto on EU aid of 375 million European
currency units (dlrs 409 million).
	   Officials said that, given Athens' opposition to allocating that
money, the EU head office would pursue ways of releasing the funds
to Turkey in some other fashion. But they conceded it would be
difficult to do that legally.

	   YSSINGEAUX, France (AP) _ Angered by the showing of an
unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV, Iran's World Cup
team said Tuesday that the broadcast was a politically motivated
insult that had hurt morale.
	   The screening of ``Not Without My Daughter,'' a film based on a
book by Betty Mahmoudi, could turn into a diplomatic spat between
the two countries.
	   France's privately owned channel M6 aired the film late Monday.
It's based on the true story of an American woman who escapes from
Iran with her daughter against the wishes of her Iranian husband.
	   Sally Field plays the lead role in a film that portrays Iranians
as dirty, boorish and cruel, obsessed with their Islamic religion
and its attitudes toward women.
	   Speaking to reporters, Iran's star striker Khodadad Azizi took
off the yellow cap given by the French Organizing Committee, and
pointed to its ``Fair Play'' logo.
	   ``Is the showing of this movie, which is an insult to our
people, fair play,'' asked Azizi, who plays in the German
Bundesliga.
	   ``Fair play is not limited to the field. The French organizers
must ensure fair play off the field as well,'' said Azizi. ``I'm
not going to wear this cap again,'' he said.
	   The head of Iran's soccer federation, Safaei Farahani, told The
Associated Press he had submitted a written protest to the World
Cup organizing committee and FIFA. ``I'm waiting for an answer,''
he said.
	   In its first World Cup match, Iran lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia on
Sunday. But the Iranians, who were expected to crumble against the
highly rated Yugoslavs, saw the result as a victory of sorts.
	   Iran's next game is against the United States on Sunday in Lyon.
With 20 years of enmity between the two countries, it will be the
most politically charged game of the tournament. Iran's last game
in the first round will be against Germany. The United States lost
2-0 to Germany on Monday in its first Group F match.
	   Azizi, and mid-fielders Mohammad Khakpour and Alireza
Mansourian, speaking on behalf of their team, said the film was an
insult to Iranian players and fans who had come to France with
goodwill.
	   The Iranians have been trying to portray their good face to the
world at the World Cup.
	   The quiet little town of Yssingeaux in the French heartland that
is Iran's World Cup base has been transformed by the coming of the
Iranian team.
	   The town hall features exhibits of photos and Persian carpets,
Iranian movies are shown regularly, and a cultural night is
scheduled for Wednesday featuring Iranian food, music and poetry.
	   A female Iranian journalist spoke about women in Iran, and shops
in town are selling videos of ``Iran's Remarkable Women.''
	   At the start of the match with Yugoslavia the players handed out
roses to the Yugoslav team and were at pains to be courteous during
the match.
	   Iranian players and soccer officials said the French government
should have stopped the showing of the film, which had been
advertised for several days.
	   Azizi questioned the timing of the film, and French hospitality.
	   ``Out of 365 days in a year, why was this film shown now,'' said
Azizi. ``I think that the showing was not without reason, and it
has hurt morale. But this does not mean we will not play our soccer
against the United States and Germany.''
	   He said he was so upset with the film that he couldn't watch
Monday's match between Germany and the United States, teams the
Iranians will have to play against.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' said
Farahani.
	   ``In Iran, people laugh when they see this film and how it
portrays Iranians,'' said Mansourian. ``They consider it a
comedy,'' he said.
	   Officials of channel M6 were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Iran's hard-line Resalat daily claimed the film was broadcast to
put pressure on Iranian players, and to embarrass Iranians in
general.
	   ``One aim of the propaganda exercise was to put psychological
pressure on the Iranian football players and fans who are gathering
in France to encourage the team,'' the Farsi-language paper said
Tuesday.

German doctor sentenced to 34 years for killing his two children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Spain (AP) _ A German doctor was sentenced to
34 years on Tuesday for murdering his two children while
vacationing on the Spanish resort island of Mallorca in September
1996.
	   Judge Margarita Beltran also ordered Dr. Ruedeger Oyntzen to pay
his estranged wife and mother of the dead children 25 million
pesetas (dlrs 170,000), the national news agency EFE reported.
	   Oyntzen admitted to injecting his 8-year-old daughter Katherina
and 6-year-old son Mathias with a lethal mix of drugs when he was
arrested, shortly after the children's' dead bodies were found in
their hotel beds.
	   A jury found the doctor guilty of murder last week, ignoring the
defense's argument that he suffered from a personality disorder
that diminished his responsibility for the deaths.
	   Oyntzen had taken his children for a two-week vacation to the
sunny Mediterranean island off the northeastern Spanish coast in
the aftermath of losing a custody battle in the German courts.
	   After his arrest the 40-year-old radiologist from Breisach,
Germany, said the loss of custody had prompted him to kill his
children.
	   About midnight of September 4, 1996, Oyntzen had told his
children he was going to give them injections to protect them from
mosquito bites, but his intention was always murder, the judge's
sentence read according to EFE.

Two suspects get life in prison for murder of French lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with verdicts &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRAGUIGNAN, France (AP) _ Two men accused of plotting and
carrying out the 1994 slaying of a lawmaker who fought corruption
on the French Riviera were sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday.
	   After five hours of deliberation, a jury decided that Gerard
Finale, a 53-year-old barman, planned the attack on Yann Piat who
was shot three times as her chauffeur drove her home in Mont des
Oiseaux near the port city of Toulon.
	   Lucien Ferri, 25, already had admitted to being the triggerman,
shooting six bullets from a motorbike. Lawyers for both men said
they would appeal. The case lasted six weeks.
	   The driver of the motorbike, 24-year-old Marco Di Caro, was
sentenced to 20 years. Three other men were convicted for being
accomplices and jailed for between six and 15 years. Another was
acquitted.
	   Although local officials have been implicated in the case and
called to testify, no charges have been brought against them,
prompting criticism from the defense that the bigger fish in the
case got away.
	   Jacques Verges, Finale's lawyer, said last week that local
officials ``had got through the net.''
	   Saying the crime had political and financial implications, he
said Piat ``had trodden on a serpent's tail. But whereas she died,
the serpent is still alive.''
	   Ferri expressed remorse for the killing earlier Tuesday but
refused to identify who had ordered the killing, saying he feared
for the safety of his family.
	   ``I wanted to tell the state prosecutor that he has left the
wolves outside,'' he said.
	   Di Caro, the driver, said that ``an entire lifetime will not be
sufficient to express my regrets.''
	   As well as citing ``a culture of corruption,'' Piat probably
made enemies by switching from the far-right National Front to the
conservative Republican Party.
	   Her murder is the subject of two controversial books whose
authors have lost lawsuits this year.
	   One court ordered the authors and publisher of ``Yann Piat,
Assassins at the Heart of Power'' to pay about one million francs
(dlrs 167,000) for slandering former French Defense Minister
Francois Leotard and Marseille Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin, and remove
passages.
	   The book alleged Piat was killed because she was about to
disclose a plan to sell military land in southern France to the
mafia, and implicated both officials in the murder.
	   A court also ordered passages removed from ``Yann Piat, The
Secret Story of an Assassination'' since the book made public
details of the investigation.
	   In a 1992, letter, Piat said that ``in case of a fatal
accident,'' it would be opportune to question Maurice Arreckx,
former mayor of Toulon.
	   Arreckx, 80, who testified in the case, is in jail while under
investigation for alleged embezzlement.

	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ Heavy artillery crashed
across the border Tuesday into neighboring Guinea-Bissau, where the
aftermath of an army mutiny has left the capital in chaos with
thousands of people fleeing.
	   Senegal launched the cross-border attack to push back their own
separatist rebels who had taken safe haven in the area and have
reportedly aligned themselves with Guinea-Bissau's coup leader
Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   Shorts bursts of machine gun fire echoed across the dusty, red
countryside just kilometers (miles) from the border. Heavier
weapons fire crashed in the distance, while a Senegalese
prop-engine spotter plane buzzed overhead.
	   Fighting near the border _ not uncommon in this
rebellion-wracked region _ this time seemed to indicate an
escalation of the conflict that began in Guinea-Bissau's capital of
Bissau 10 days earlier, Senegalese military officers said.
	   The Senegalese rebels have reported ties with Guinea-Bissau army
renegades who have been holed up in a garrison since beginning the
uprising about a week ago.
	   ``We had been expecting the rebels to step up their fighting
here to coincide with the war in Guinea-Bissau,'' said a senior
commander speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A United Nations refugee agency official expressed fears that
innocent refugees would get caught in the cross-fire.
	   UNHCR Khassim Diagne said about 5,000 Senegalese refugees who
fled the 15-year-old civil war in Senegal's southern Casamance
province were vulnerable to border attacks aimed at rebels.
	   ``In the past, there have been attempts to move the refugees
further inland (into Guinea-Bissau) but these have failed,'' Diagne
said in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   In Bissau, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the
border fighting, loyalist government troops and rebels continued to
trade mortar fire, while the onset of the rainy season increased
fears of disease for the tens of thousands of people fleeing the
capital of the former Portuguese colony.
	   Loyalist forces maintained their siege of a military garrison in
a suburb of Bissau where mutineers have been holed up since June 7.
	   ``The shelling is still serious,'' Michael Kleiner of the
International Red Cross said in Geneva.
	   Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was deserted, Kleiner
said.
	   The Senegalese commander said his country sent several truck
convoys with troops into Guinea-Bissau in support of President Joao
Bernardo Vieira.
	   The Republic of Guinea, south Guinea-Bissau, was also sending
troops to support the beleagured government in Bissau, although
unconfirmed reports from refugees and Senegal's military said some
Guinean soldiers had taken sides with the renegades.
	   If accurate, the reports indicate an escalation of the attempted
conflict to involve three West African countries fueled by years of
simmering enmities.
	   Mane, who was fired from Guinea-Bissau's military in January for
allegedly running guns to Senegal's separatist forces, has suffered
poor relations with Senegal's government forces. Guinea-Bissau and
Senegal fought brief clashes in 1990 over offshore oil exploration
rights.
	   Fighting in Bissau triggered a mass exodus of refugees leaving
by ship and on foot.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau, reported more than 150,000 refugees in the
area.
	   Shelling and small arms fire at the border Tuesday halted the
flow of more than 100 refugees per hour fleeing into Senegal.
Thousands were stranded just across the frontier in Guinea-Bissau,
said some who had made it across.
	   ``The people are afraid to even move,'' said Lamin Mane, who sat
with a group of other refugees under a mango tree just beyond the
border fighting.Gunfire popped and whistled in the background as he
spoke.
	   A Senegalese truck driver who normally hauls goods between the
two countries said several of his friends had been trapped inside
Guinea-Bissau when the fighting broke out.
	   ``Nobody's able to get out now,'' he said. ``We don't what is
going to happen.''
	   The deputy chief of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces said Tuesday
that his troops, supported by soldiers from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea, were gaining the upper-hand.
	   ``They're on the retreat,'' Lt. Col. Afonso Pe told Portuguese
radio station RDP-Africa.
	   He said the shelling created panic in the city, but could not
estimate the number of casualties.
	   ``We're in a war situation. No one knows when this will end,''
he said.
	   Mane's rebels have demanded that Vieira step down. They accuse
him of corruption and abuse of power.

Britain reacts cautiously to Yeltsin-Milosevic meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS, UPDATES with further reax from Britain &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Tuesday gave a cautious welcome to
pledges by Slobodan Milosevic to resume talks with moderate leaders
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, but said it worried that the
Yugoslav leader had not agreed to scale down its military presence
in the volatile province.
	   Milosevic issued a joint statement with Russian leader Boris
Yeltsin on Tuesday in Moscow agreeing to the resumption of
negotiations with Ibrahim Rugova, political leader of Kosovo's
Albanians, a promise to stop military action against civilians, and
free access to international monitors and aid groups.
	   ``We welcome the ending of repressive action against the Kosovo
Albanians, but we are concerned that Milosevic does not appear to
have agreed to withdraw the security units used in civilian
repression,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said, speaking on terms of
customary anonymity.
	   ``The most important thing is not what Milosevic says, but what
he does. It is important that all the actions he has agreed to are
carried out immediately,'' the spokesman said.
	   Milosevic and Rugova met in May but the Albanian leader canceled
further talks until Serb government troops halt a reported
offensive in western Kosovo. Since March, more than 300 people have
been killed as Milosevic's army and police have cracked down in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.
	   The world's major industrialized powers, including Britain and
Russia, demanded Friday that Milosevic withdraw security units,
allow unrestricted international monitoring, facilitate the return
of over 50,000 refugees, and ``make rapid progress'' in a dialogue
with Kosovo's Albanian leadership.
	   In a warning to Milosevic, NATO sent warplanes over Kosovo and
Macedonia on Monday.
	   The Foreign Office said European Union foreign ministers agreed
Tuesday to increase the number of observers in Yugoslavia, and
would examine how best to aid the return of refugees to their
homes.
	   In their joint statement, Yeltsin and Milosevic agreed that
Yugoslavia would not carry out ``repressive actions against
civilians'' and would reduce the presence of security forces
outside their permanent bases, but only ``as terrorist activities
stop.''
	   It appeared that this would fall short of the demand by foreign
ministers of eight nations _ the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan and Canada _ for an immediate
withdrawal of military units.
	   While the major powers are hoping for a diplomatic solution in
Kosovo, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said NATO air exercises
``demonstrated that we have the military capacity to intervene if
we have to.''

Krajicek advances between the showers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ After long rain delays Tuesday
Dutch No.4 seed Richard Krajicek emerged to oust Australian Richard
Fromberg, 7-6 (7-0), 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) in the Heineken Trophy grass
court tennis tourney.
	   Krajicek was joined in the second round by compatriot John van
Lottum, who upset German fifth seed Nicolas Kiefer, 7-5, 6-4. And
Czech Martin Damm downed American Vincent Spadeau, 6-4, 7-5
	   Play could not start until 4.15 p.m. local time (14.15 GMT) and
began with completion of two first-round ladies singles held over
from a rain-hit Monday.
	   Belgian fourth seed Sabine Appelmans converted a two-game
advantage in the first set over Spain's Cristina Torrens Valero,
into a straight sets win 6-2, 6-1.
	   And American Tara Snyder, starting at set-all and a game up in
the third, ran out a 6-0, 4-6, 6-1 winner against Czech Sandra
Kleinova.
	   And in an all-Czech clash Adriana Gersi ousted Ksvetlana
Hrdlickova 6-1, 6-4.
	   A handful of spectators still waited in hope of further play
after the showers returned.
	   Despite the persistent heavy rain, organizers have rejected an
option to move singles matches to a sports hall in the nearby town
of Vught.
	   ``That kind of running away could not benefit Rosmalen's

Ukrainian president signs decree to support Sevastopol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a decree
Tuesday aimed at combating Russia's influence in the Black Sea port
of Sevastopol.
	   Sevastopol and the Crimean Peninsula on which it is located were
given to then-Soviet Ukraine in 1954 and became part of an
independent Ukraine in 1991.
	   But Crimea is mostly populated by ethnic Russians, and
separatist trends there are strong.
	   Kuchma's decree is aimed at facilitating the social and economic
development of Sevastopol by allowing it to retain most of its
municipal taxes and other income.
	   He also ordered the Ukrainian Cabinet to provide for subsidies
to Sevastopol in national budget amendments it plans to introduce.
	   And, he instructed the government to look into the possibility
of making Sevastopol a ``special economic zone'' and introducing
measures favorable to investment.
	   The decree was clearly aimed at combating Russia's influence in
the Black Sea city and attempts by many Russian politicians to
appease nationalist sentiments.
	   Sevastopol is home to the Russian portion of the former Soviet
Black Sea fleet and is widely called ``the city of the Russian
glory'' in Russia.
	   The Russian parliament, dominated by hard-liners and
nationalists, has balked at ratifying a friendship treaty with
Ukraine, because of the dispute over Sevastopol and Crimea.
	   Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has repeatedly angered
Ukrainian authorities by visiting the city and saying that it
should belong to Russia. Moscow also has provided money to build
housing for naval personnel in Sevastopol.
	   Competing with Luzhkov, Mayor Olexander Omelchenko of the
Ukrainian capital, Kiev, has funded construction of homes for
retired officers in Sevastopol. Ukraine's government, along with
Kuchma, has been looking for ways to improve their standing in the
city.

Speaker turns down questioning of an interior minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's parliament speaker turned down a request
to question the interior minister Tuesday in a dispute that had
prompted a political crisis in the Gulf state.
	   Hussein al-Gallaf, a Muslim fundamentalist lawmaker, had
demanded that Interior Minister Sheik Mohammed al-Khaled al-Sabah
be questioned before parliament. He accused the minister, a member
of the royal family, of failing to fight drugs and crime.
	   But parliament voted to support a government request to hold the
questioning behind closed doors. That move prompted al-Gallaf to
withdraw from the meeting. Speaker Ahmed al-Saadoun then decided to
drop the request for questioning because of al-Gallaf's absence.
	   Al-Gallaf, a Shiite cleric, called the request to hold the
meeting behind closed doors unconstitutional.
	   The request for questioning had triggered a political crisis
between the government and the legislature, raising speculation
that either the parliament or the government would be dissolved.
	   Kuwait's parliament is the only one in the Gulf to be elected,
and criticism of the government is tolerated somewhat. Still, the
government dissolved Kuwaiti parliaments in 1976 and 1986 after
lawmakers severely criticized it.
	   Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah has complained
that his Cabinet can no longer cooperate with the 50-member
legislature, which he has accused of blocking his economic reforms
and showing disrespect for ministers.
	   Al-Gallaf also had criticized what he called police ``brutality
and barbarity,'' saying suspects in custody are often tortured,
armed robberies have increased and prostitution has become
widespread in this conservative Muslim society.

<TEXT>
	   GELIBOLU, Turkey (AP) _ A Maltese-flagged cargo ship resumed its
journey early Tuesday, 32 hours after it was stopped by Turkey on
suspicion of carrying Russian missile parts for Cyprus.
	   Turkish authorities uncovered seven mobile missile launching
pads aboard the Natasha-1 but allowed it to continue on after Cairo
confirmed that the military equipment was for Egypt. The ship,
which came from Ukraine, described its cargo as tractors and cars
for Egypt.
	   ``There was obviously a difference between the bill of loading
and the actual cargo in the ship, and this is why Turkish
authorities inspected the ship,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati
Utkan said.
	   Also Tuesday, Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
denounced the use of a Greek Cypriot airbase by Greek jets as a
``provocative'' act that threatened security on the island.
	   The Turkish foreign ministry said four Greek F-16 jets as well
as a C-130 cargo plane had landed at the base in the southwestern
town of Paphos.
	   ``We want to emphasize that all measures warranted by this
development will be taken,'' the ministry said.
	   The Greek warplanes began to use the base under a joint defense
pact with Greece. The Greek Cypriots plan to deploy missiles to
protect Paphos.
	   Turkey increased surveillance, 4th graf pvs

Iraq calls deal with U.N. inspectors a breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Butler saying inspections could be wrapped up in
weeks in grafs 5-6. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's agreement with U.N. weapons monitors
for ending disarmament activities in two months is a
``breakthrough'' that will lead to lifting of sanctions, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   He said the deal met a longstanding Iraqi demand that the arms
inspectors write down specifically what they wanted Iraq to do ``to
close the files (and) prepare the ground for the lifting of the
economic embargo.''
	   ``It is in essence a breakthrough,'' Aziz told reporters in
Iraq's first comment on the deal he reached with chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, on Sunday.
	   The comments, mirroring similar statements by Butler on Monday,
are the best sign yet that Iraq could soon be free from the
sanctions, which have devastated the country's once prosperous
economy by banning free sale of oil.
	   In Kuwait, Butler said he was optimistic.
	   ``If they were to do it, put their shoulder to the wheel, they
could step forward and give us what we need in a matter of weeks,''
Butler said after meeting Kuwaiti leaders.

New gun-running route opens to Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Komanlt to Drini river throughout &QL;

 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOMAN, Albania (AP) _ Adjusting the lapels of his brown
polyester suit, the tall gangly man took off his reflective
sunglasses and reached under his red and yellow beach shirt.
	   The pop-pop of the Chinese-made pistol echoed off the cliffs
overhanging the Drini river. His audience duly impressed, the man
smiled, exposing teeth rotted by years of bad nutrition.
	   Hefting the pistol, another Albanian worked the action.
	   ``Look at them, they don't even bother to hide it anymore even
this deep inside Albania,'' said Sulejman Broji, a passenger on a
river ferry headed for the border town of Bajram Curri.
	   Albanian authorities, seeking to maintain the moral highground
in the escalating conflict between ethnic Albanians and Serb
authorities in neighboring Kosovo, officially frown on gunrunning.
	   But the impromptu trade show aboard the ferry demonstrated the
degree to which gunrunners can count on official complacency.
	   Driving mini-vans with Swiss license plates, the customer and
his dozen friends looked out of place aboard the rusting ferry.
Their clothes looked straight off the shelves of a camping goods
store, their boots unsullied by the mud and dust that are the bane
of everyone living here.
	   Albanian emigres from Switzerland and Germany are thought to be
supplying much of the funding for the weapons being smuggled into
Kosovo on mule trains, often following the same trails used in the
other direction by more than 10,000 Kosovo Albanians who have fled
the fighting and taken refuge in wild northeastern Albania.
	   Less than one hour before, in the small town of Koman, men
sweated in the hot midday sun loading heavy machine guns,
Kalashnikov automatic rifles and potato sacks full of ammunition
aboard the river ferry.
	   The Drini river, now a large artificial lake, runs from the dam
at Koman up 40 kilometers (25 miles) to a small port near Bajram
Curri, a frontier town where guns are as much a part of life as
food.
	   The river provides the easiest route through the mountains and
deep ravines that separate Shkodra, northern Albania's biggest
town, from the rugged border with Kosovo some 60 kilometers (40
miles) to the east.
	   Weapons slowly find their way to Kosovo. On Tuesday, a tractor
was seen pulling more than two dozen crates of shoulder-held
anti-tank missiles towards the border. Nearby, a KLA guerrilla
trained seven young men on automatic rifles.
	   Gun running has been a lucrative business for locals along
border towns, who supply and sell guns to separatist Albanians and
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is seeking independence for the
Albanian-dominated Serb province.
	   Border towns like Tropoja, south of Bajram Curri, are flush with
weapons, but the recent frequency of gun traffic up the Drini river
indicates that demand is steadily outpacing local supplies.
	   Most of the weapons given or sold to Kosovo Albanians were
looted from armories around the country when it degenerated into a
state of chaos following the collapse of get-rich schemes last
year.armories during an uprising here last year.
	   ``This is different, these guns are new,'' said Broji. Others
standing around on the sun deck of the ferry agreed.
	   Many of the bigger weapons, including tripod mounted heavy
machine guns usually found on top of main battle tanks, glinted
with the sheen of packing oil.
	   As a popular Greek song about lost love wailed out of a dusty
coffee shop dockside, men in a rubber dinghy unloaded automatic
rifles at the front end of the ferry. Police nearby directed
traffic, seemingly oblivious.
	   The larger guns were manhandled aboard and dumped at the front
of the boat.
	   Large quantities of money wrapped in newspaper were exchanged at
the port.
	   Some of the men, their faces red from fresh exposure to the
summer sun, used brand new hand-held video cameras to film
themselves aboard the ferry. One man emptied another magazine of
bullets into the cliffs.

Hope amid the rubble of a disintegrating Nigerian city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Every morning, battered tankers rumble
into quiet walled compounds in the wealthy neighborhoods of this
seaside city, dispensing thousands of gallons of water for rich
businessmen, diplomats and members of the ruling junta.
	   In a city where the water supply can be even less predictable
than the haphazard electricity, it's the only way to ensure a bath.
	   Lagos is beyond breakdown. Electricity stays off in some
neighborhoods for weeks at a time, universities are besieged by
violent, well-armed student groups. Small mountains of garbage bury
entire street corners and gasoline is desperately scarce _ even
though Nigeria is one of the world's top oil producers. The police
are better known for demanding bribes than for stopping the city's
rampant crime.
	   But suddenly, there's reason to hope. The five-year dictatorship
of Gen. Sani Abacha ended last week with his death and the new
military leader has ordered some of Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoners freed. It may not mean the power will be
switched on any time soon, but at least there are signs of change.
	   ``I'm on the moon without riding on Sputnik,'' raved Gani
Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and activist, after the nine prisoners
were ordered released Monday.
	   Fawehinmi _ normally given to scathing criticism of the new
junta leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar _ quickly backed off from
his exaltation. He noted that dozens of political prisoners remain
in jail, including Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993's
annulled presidential elections.
	   Still, many people across this city of 10 million are hoping
Abubakar will bring change. He has a reputation for honesty, for
wanting to bring honor back to Nigeria's military.
	   ``We are expecting (Abubakar) to do well,'' said Ahmed Hakeem.
He makes a living hand-pushing a rusting, six-seat ferris wheel at
Lagos' Lekki Beach, where a rusting shipwreck hulks above people
playing in polluted surf.
	   Lagos is a crowded, tumble-down city full of modern office
buildings and rancid slums, but a place where even in the worst of
times people know how to enjoy themselves.
	   ``Lagos is everything _ positive and negative,'' laughed Taiwo
Adedaji, a law student standing under a shade tree at Lagos State
University.
	   The only people who manage to live easily are those who can
afford generators, black-market gasoline and guards. They live
behind walls, shop at stores packed with imported goods and eat at
fine restaurants.
	   Nigeria, which once swam to prosperity on a sea of oil profits,
has been drowning for years, pulled down by corruption and
mismanagement.
	   Abubakar has sent contradictory signals so far. Authorities
quashed pro-democracy demonstrations last week and he has vowed to
forge ahead with the highly flawed democratic transition program
begun under Abacha.
	   Some also fear the prisoner releases may be a smokescreen.
	   ``I'm obviously very happy,'' said Nike Ransome-Kuti, whose
father, activist Beko Ransome-Kuti, was among those ordered
released. ``But I'm taking the news with caution because I'd hate
to see something where he only releases a few people as a publicity
gimmick.''
	   Such skepticism is understandable in Lagos, a city often so
unlivable its residents quickly run out of adjectives trying to
describe it.
	   ``It's really bad,'' said Tokumbo Ogonlesi, a 46-year-old
caterer. She shakes her head: ``It's really bad, it's really bad.''
	   She is most terrified of the city's crime.
	   ``A chicken is more likely to go out and come home than a human
being,'' she said.
	   And yet perhaps the most surprising thing about Lagos is that
despite its mountain of difficulties, it still has fun. Nigerians
are crazy for music, voracious readers and avid movie-goers, and
Lagos is the cultural center of Africa's most populous country.
	   Publishers pump out hundreds of titles and gossipy newspapers
are filled with the loves of TV and movie stars. Nightclubs swell
with music lovers.

Czar's remains to be taken to St. Petersburg from Yekaterinburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The funeral procession for Russia's last czar, his
family and servants will began at the police morgue in the central
city where their remains have been kept under a plastic dome for
much of the past seven years.
	   The ``modest'' procession will set out from the Yekaterinburg
Forensic Medicine Bureau on July 15, local Gov. Eduard Rossel told
Russian news agencies.
	   It will head for the Church of the Ascension, built on the site
of the house where Czar Nicholas II and his family were kept
captive and then shot by Bolsheviks in July 1918, Rossel said.
	   Church services will be held there until midday on July 16, when
the nine sets of remains will be flown to St. Petersburg for burial
on July 17, the 80th anniversary of the executions.
	   Rossel said he will attend the funeral in the Peter and Paul
Cathedral, the traditional burial site of Romanov czars. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Patriarch Alexy II of the Russian
Orthodox Church have said they will not attend.
	   The church says it continues to doubt the identity of the
remains, which have undergone sophisticated forensic tests in
Russia, Britain and the United States.
	   The remains, found in a pit in the Ural Mountains city of
Yekaterinburg in 1991, have been identified as those Nicholas, his
wife, three children and four servants.
	   A member of a St. Petersburg committee planning the funeral said
there is room for only 150 people inside the cathedral, so only
descendants and senior officials will be allowed to attend the
actual service.
	   Ivan Artsishevsky said the committee rejected a proposal to show
the service on an outdoor TV screen ``because we really do want to
avoid the event becoming a gigantic mass show.''
	   He told the Interfax news agency the service would be broadcast
on radio.
	   Artsishevsky refused to say how much the funeral was expected to
cost.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish train engineers, demanding pay
raises and early retirement schemes, said Tuesday they will go on
at midnight after breaking off negotiations with the government.
	   The decision was announced by Jan Zaborowski, head of the
engineers' largest trade union that represents some 14,000 out of
Poland's 20,000 engineers.
	   Solidarity union members refused to participate in the action
that is to idle trains just days before school vacation begins,
saying it was not over money but to sow political trouble.
	   Railway authorities said they have plans to ensure continuation
of transport, using non-striking engineers but estimate the action
will cost 21 million zlotys (dlrs 6.1 million) daily.
	   Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski said the strike will be at
the expense of the ``country's economy, of the railway clients and
of the whole country.''
	   The action was called after the government spokesman refused to
apologize for calling the strike political, Zaborowski said.
	   Transport ministry officials said they were nearing an agreement
after weeks of negotiations, but the engineers broke off the talks
Tuesday morning.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said the union action was discrepant
with labor procedures. He added the government was prepared for the
action.
	   The engineers want a 300-zloty (dlrs-88) raise in their monthly
pay, currently about 1,000 zlotys (dlrs 300).
	   They want to be eligible for retirement at 55 if they have
worked for at least 20 years. They want the age limit dropped for
those who have worked for at least 30 years. The current retirement
age is 65 for men and 60 for women.
	   In addition, the engineers want the government to funnel 1
percent of its annual budget to subsidize the railways, which are
strapped for cash but need to lower prices to compete with cheaper
road travel.
	   The Polish rail carries 1.1 million passengers and some 600,000
tons of goods daily.

World Cup: Norway, Scotland draw 1-1

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Maybe Norway peaked too soon.
	   After outclassing three other World Cup-bound teams by a
combined 13-2 in six weeks before the tournament, the Norwegians
now have a meager two points after yet another draw, 1-1 against
Scotland on Tuesday.
	   ``I'm disappointed by our performance,'' said coach Egil
``Drillo'' Olsen, whose Norwegians were fourth in the world in
FIFA's computer rankings going into the tournament.
	   ``We lost our concentration and we were in fact lucky that we
didn't lose. But we can still decide things ourselves in our group,
and it's a good feeling.''
	   Scotland snatched the draw when midfielder Craig Brown chased
down a perfect 25-meter lofted pass from substitute David Weir and
volleyed it on one hop over advancing goalkeeper Frode Grodas in
the 66th minute.
	   The goal answered Havard Flo's header in the 46th, and kept the
Bravehearts' hopes alive of making the second round for the first
time in eight World Cup appearances.
	   ``The Norwegians were getting a little bit tired and a few
players were going down with cramp,'' Burley said. ``There was
little more space. The ball was delivered by David Weir over the
left center-back's head. It fell nicely. The keeper came out and I
mind my mind up: to lob him. For a minute I thought it had dropped
over the bar. Fortunately it went into the net and I was
delighted.''
	   It was the biggest goal ever for Burley, a midfielder from
Glasgow Celtic who had scored once in 25 previous appearances for
the Scots. I came only minutes after Brown made two substitutions,
bringing on Weir for Colin Calderwood and Jackie McNamara for
Darren Jackson, allowing Burley to assume a more central role in
midfield.
	   ``When we went behind, there was no option,'' Brown said. ``We
had to gamble and move forward. It's OK the substitution was
successful, but sometimes they're successful and sometimes they're
not. I'm not going to take huge credit because, quite honestly, we
shouldn't have needed that goal to get back in the game. We
should've been ahead.''
	   Scotland outshout Norway 13-6 and had seven corner kicks to the
Norwegians' two.
	   Olsen kept Flo on the team for his strength in the air. And it
paid for Norway's only goal when the 1.83-meter (6-foot) striker
nicknamed ``the Midget'' _ in comparison with taller cousins Tore
Andre Flo and Jostein Flo _ got past Christian Dailly at the far
post to head Riseth's left wing cross just 30 seconds after the
break.
	   The draw left two disappointed coaches leaving Bordeaux' Parc
Lescure stadium. Scotland will need to beat Morocco and get some
help from others to advance to the second round, while Norway will
need help unless they beat world champion Brazil.
	   ``We felt we were the better team,'' Brown said. ``And we're
desperately disappointed that we didn't win the match. Only one
point in two games is not too pleasing for us.''

Report: Suspects confess to killing journalist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with attack on another employee of paper. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two former aides to a regional leader and
announced candidate for the Russian presidency have confessed to
killing an opposition journalist, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Larisa Yudina, editor of the Soviet Kalmykia Today newspaper,
was found dead on June 8 in the Kalmykian capital Elista with
multiple knife wounds and a fractured skull.
	   Another employee was attacked in Elista on Tuesday while
distributing the latest issue of the newspaper, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   The driver of the bus in which Semyon Ageyev was riding attacked
him and threw him from the vehicle, ITAR-Tass said. It gave no
other details.
	   Yudina's newspaper had long criticized the leadership of Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov, the president of the southern region of Kalmykia. It
recently accused him of extorting money from local businessmen
under the guise of ``voluntary'' donations.
	   President Boris Yeltsin demanded Monday that Yudina's killing be
investigated ``to the utmost level,'' adding that local officials
investigating the case ``cannot be fully trusted.''
	   Police have arrested Sergei Vaskin, a former aide to
Ilyumzhinov, and Tyurbya Boskhomdzhiyev, Ilyumzhinov's envoy to a
nearby region. Both men have admitted killing Yudina, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing a federal prosecutor.
	   The business daily Kommersant said that Boskhomdzhiyev had lured
Yudina to a meeting by promising to turn over compromising
materials on Ilyumzhinov. Investigators believe that Vaskin then
killed her, the newspaper said.
	   Boskhomdzhiyev said that Ilyumzhinov's lieutenants had long
urged Yudina to stop criticizing the Kalmyk leader and ordered the
killing after she refused, Kommersant quoted investigators as
saying.
	   Liberal Russian media have assailed Ilyumzhinov, a millionaire
businessman turned Kalmyk president, for running the impoverished
region like a medieval baron, flaunting his fleet of luxury
imported cars and other wealth while ignoring the republic's social
woes and crushing dissent.
	   Ilyumzhinov, who also serves as the president of the World Chess
Federation, says that he will seek the Russian presidency in 2000.

Supreme Court rejects petition to stop Jewish housing project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Supreme Court rejected a petition
Tuesday by Palestinians who claimed that an Israeli housing project
for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem discriminates against
them as Arabs, a court official said.
	   The 30 petitioners from the villages of Umm Toubah and Beit
Sahour, which border the construction site on a disputed east
Jerusalem hilltop known in Hebrew as Har Homa and Jabal Abu Ghneim
in Arabic.
	   Israel's announcement in March 1997 to built 650 homes there for
Jews touched off rioting and brought an impasse in
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations which still remains.
	   Supreme Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the court rejected the
petition because the Israeli government had granted local Arabs
building privileges on land near the building site.
	   Israel captured the hilltop along with the rest of the West bank
and east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. It later
annexed east Jerusalem, claiming sovereignty over the area and has
encouraged Jews to move into those areas.
	   In an effort to restart peace talks, the United States has asked
Israel for a time-out in settlement construction. Preparatory work
at the site has been completed but Israel has delayed the next step
of advertising construction bids, apparently seeking to avoid
conflict with Washington and further complicate Israeli-Palestinian
relations.

US hopeful as new Nigerian leader takes over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government praised Nigeria's new head
of state Tuesday, calling him a well respected professional soldier
who is capable of guiding his country toward democratic rule.
	   Spokesman James P. Rubin said Abdulsalam Abubakar, an army
general named to replace the late Sani Abacha, ``has a historic
opportunity to open the political process and institute a swift and
credible transition to civilian democratic rule.''
	   That process, Rubin said, should include freeing political
prisoners, ensuring respect for freedom of press, speech and
assembly and the return of the Nigerian military to the tasks of
defending the constitution and civilian rule.
	   ``We want this transition to make it possible for there to be a
return to civilian democratic rule by October 1, 1998,'' Rubin
said.
	   Rubin said a high-level U.S. mission may travel to Nigeria to
convey that message. Such a mission was supposed to go to Lagos
last week but Nigeria imposed conditions that the State Department
could not accept.
	   Abacha died on Monday after almost five years of repressive
rule. At the time of his death, he was maneuvering to perpetuate
his rule by being the sole candidate in elections set for August.
	   Abubakar, who received military training in the United States,
had served as Army chief of staff before assuming his new duties.

IMF sending special mission to Russia next week

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is sending a team
to Moscow next week to discuss new loans to help Russia stabilize
its shaky financial markets, government and IMF officials confirmed
Tuesday.
	   The IMF's chief representative in Russia, Martin Gilman, said an
``extensive dialogue'' is planned when the team arrives Monday, but
refused to say what kind of assistance may be offered.
	   ``We believe that what they are doing is appropriate, but the
current market situation and circumstances are not normal,'' Gilman
said. ``So we are looking at additional measures.''
	   Some officials and market analysts hope the IMF will provide a
bailout package, even though the fund and Russian government
officials have said repeatedly that the country is capable of
overcoming the crisis on its own.
	   The market rebounded on the news, with the Russian Trading
System closing 4.2 percent higher after seven straight days of
declines.
	   The market collapse late last month prompted fears of a
devaluation of the national currency, the ruble, which would lead
to a sharp rise in prices. Russian officials worry that inflation,
combined with the government's continuing inability to pay state
workers their wages on time, could lead to social unrest.
	   The Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin as saying Russia had still not officially requested funds
beyond its current dlrs 10 billion lending program.
	   However, Vyugin confirmed that his trip to meet the IMF's top
officials in Washington, D.C., last week was aimed at securing
additional assistance to Russia.
	   Vyugin said the Russian government is aware that the IMF will
impose stringent conditions for additional aid. The IMF has been
pressing the government to boost tax collections and rein in
spending.
	   ``We do ourselves understand that the time for decisive and
tough measures has come, particularly in the sphere of budget
revenues,'' Vyugin said, according to Interfax.
	   A group of Russia's most powerful business leaders, commonly
called the ``oligarchs'' met Tuesday night with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko to discuss the financial crisis, Russian media
reported.
	   Russian media also said the government plans to ask former
deputy premier Anatoly Chubais to return to the Cabinet to take
charge of liaisons with international financial institutions.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has twice fired Chubais from his
Cabinet. He was was recently appointed head of Russia's huge
state-owned electricity monopoly, Unified Energy Systems.

World Cup: Norway, Scotland draw 1-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Brown to Burley, 5th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Maybe Norway peaked too soon.
	   After outclassing three other World Cup-bound teams by a
combined 13-2 in six weeks before the tournament, the Norwegians
now have a meager two points after yet another draw, 1-1 against
Scotland on Tuesday.
	   ``I'm disappointed by our performance,'' said coach Egil
``Drillo'' Olsen, whose Norwegians were fourth in the world in
FIFA's computer rankings going into the tournament.
	   ``We lost our concentration and we were in fact lucky that we
didn't lose. But we can still decide things ourselves in our group,
and it's a good feeling.''
	   Scotland snatched the draw when midfielder Craig Burley chased
down a perfect 25-meter lofted pass from substitute David Weir and
volleyed it on one hop over advancing goalkeeper Frode Grodas in
the 66th minute.
	   The goal answered Havard Flo's header in the 46th, and kept the
Bravehearts' hopes alive of making the second round for the first
time in eight World Cup appearances.
	   ``The Norwegians were getting a little bit tired and a few
players were going down with cramp,'' Burley said. ``There was
little more space. The ball was delivered by David Weir over the
left center-back's head. It fell nicely. The keeper came out and I
mind my mind up: to lob him. For a minute I thought it had dropped
over the bar. Fortunately it went into the net and I was
delighted.''
	   It was the biggest goal ever for Burley, a midfielder from
Glasgow Celtic who had scored once in 25 previous appearances for
the Scots. I came only minutes after manager Craig Brown made two
substitutions, bringing on Weir for Colin Calderwood and Jackie
McNamara for Darren Jackson, allowing Burley to assume a more
central role in midfield.
	   ``When we went behind, there was no option,'' Brown said. ``We
had to gamble and move forward. It's OK the substitution was
successful, but sometimes they're successful and sometimes they're
not. I'm not going to take huge credit because, quite honestly, we
shouldn't have needed that goal to get back in the game. We
should've been ahead.''
	   Scotland outshout Norway 13-6 and had seven corner kicks to the
Norwegians' two.
	   Olsen kept Flo on the team for his strength in the air. And it
paid for Norway's only goal when the 1.83-meter (6-foot) striker
nicknamed ``the Midget'' _ in comparison with taller cousins Tore
Andre Flo and Jostein Flo _ got past Christian Dailly at the far
post to head Riseth's left wing cross just 30 seconds after the
break.
	   The draw left two disappointed coaches leaving Bordeaux' Parc
Lescure stadium. Scotland almost certainly needs to beat Morocco
and get some help from others to advance to the second round, while
Norway will need help unless they beat world champion Brazil.
	   ``We felt we were the better team,'' Brown said. ``And we're
desperately disappointed that we didn't win the match. Only one
point in two games is not too pleasing for us.''

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with more reaction; edits throughout &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Au Pair &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward's mother Tuesday said it
was ``absolutely fantastic'' that her daughter would be coming home
at last after being convicted of killing a child in her care.
	   But Susan Woodward had nothing more to say to reporters, and the
reaction in the family's hometown was notably subdued after the
appeals court in Massachusetts cleared the way for Miss Woodward to
leave the United States.
	   The court upheld a ruling by the trial judge, Superior Court
Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that Louise Woodward's sentence for
second-degree murder should be reduced to manslaughter and the
length of sentence to the time she had already served.
	   ``I'm really pleased with the news, but I'm surprised, I thought
people would have been here in their thousands,'' said Thomas
Maddocks, 78, who found just a few drinkers at the Rigger pub,
which has served as headquarters for local supporters.
	   It had been packed on the day Miss Woodward was convicted of
killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, and again on the day her
sentence was reduced.
	   ``I can't understand it, everyone was here for the verdict and
for everything else. I suppose it's been going on for so long and
the final came and people had had enough,'' Maddocks said.
	   Mrs. Woodward had nothing more to say publicly, but Paul Barrow,
an attorney for the family, read a statement to reporters.
	   ``Louise will continue to maintain her innocence and a statement
in fact has already been made by her American lawyers a short time
ago, stating the injustice that they consider she has suffered,''
Barrow said.
	   ``It is the family's dearest wish that they be reunited again as
soon as possible and once certain procedural matters in the U.S.
have been resolved, Louise will be returning to this country,'' he
said.
	   Julie Smith, the landlady at the Rigger, said she was ``pleased
she's coming home and we'll take it from there.
	   ``We've not forgotten that a baby was killed. We've all got
children or grandchildren. I'm scared to say anything in case it
might get misconstrued,'' Mrs. Smith said.
	   ``We can hardly believe it, everyone as you can imagine is
absolutely over the moon,'' said Roy McCabe, a family friend.
	   ``The main thing is that she is coming home, but I don't think
the fight is over. We still have to find the honest truth in all of
this.''
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the trustees of the appeal fund,
said he was relieved that the court had finally made its decision.
	   ``I am obviously very pleased that the appeal has been upheld
and that she will at last be able to come back.
	   ``We have still not got to lose sight of the fact that there is
a dead baby at the end of it and we still feel for the Eappen
family and their pain must be increased because of this verdict,''
Davey said.
	   ``I am sure Louise will be very pleased with the verdict and she
will be longing to get back and get her life back to normal, or as
normal as possible.''
	   Jean Antrobus, who stopped by at the Rigger, said the court's
ruling was ``brilliant news.''
	   ``I don't think the conviction should stand but at least it
means she's coming home,'' Mrs. Antrobus said.
	   ``She's only a girl herself. It doesn't alter the fact that
Matthew died and I feel very sorry for his parents, but it's time
that she came home and to put everything behind us.''
	   Ann Bradshaw of Elton said she was ``so glad it's all over'' for
the Woodwards.
	   ``In recent weeks it's got totally out of hand because it
dragged on so long,'' Mrs. Bradshaw said. ``Now everyone knows
where they stand and can get on with their lives.''
	   Gareth Jones, a supporter of the Louise Woodward Appeal Fund,
said people in Elton had learned from the negative reaction to
their jubilation when Zobel reduced the sentence.
	   ``People think the best thing to do is keep a low profile and
rejoice in the fact that she's coming home. You don't need to jump
up and down, the freedom speaks for herself,'' Jones said.

Emirates, Kuwait and Oman agree to more oil cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates agreed Tuesday to cut 170,000 barrels a day in oil
production in an attempt to bolster sagging prices.
	   But Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer, did not pledge
further cuts at the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
decision that analysts predicted would keep oil prices at some of
their lowest levels in 12 years.
	   Crude oil prices had jumped to as high as dlrs 12.35 in earlier
trading, but were back below dlrs 12 after the announcement.
	   The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, both OPEC members, each
agreed to cut their oil production by 75,000 barrels a day. Oman,
which is not an OPEC member, agreed to output by 20,000 barrels a
day. The cuts will take effect July 1.
	   Those cuts follow a pledge by Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela
earlier this month to cut their oil output by 450,000 barrels a
day, also starting July 1. Other OPEC producers have added around
140,000 barrels a day in cuts since that announcement.
	   But analysts believe more cuts are necessary to bolster prices.
	   The Gulf Cooperation Council brings together six states: Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

World Cup: Italy seeks qualifying points against African Lions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Del Piero starting from the bench, Moriero
teaming with Baggio and Vieri, ADDS lineups &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Deja vu. Sixteen years later, it's
Italy versus Cameroon again in a first-round World Cup match.
	   And just as in 1982, the ``Azzurri'' again need to earn decisive
qualifying points against the Indomitable Lions of Africa to
advance to the second round. The teams drew 1-1 in that first World
Cup meeting. Italy went on to win the championship.
	   Fielding some of the most expensive stars from the world's
strongest league, Italy starts as the favored team in the Group B
night game at Mosson stadium.
	   However, the Italians struggled against Chile in their opener
and the growing strength of African soccer has made everybody
cautious about the outcome.
	   Spain's 3-2 upset loss to Nigeria in Group D was seen by some
soccer analysts as the first of a streak of stunning results by
African teams at France 98.
	   Cameroon is an ``extremely dangerous opponent, athletically very
strong and including talented players with an experience in
European Leagues,'' Italy coach Cesare Maldini said.
	   ``I expect a tough match. We will have to suffer a lot,'' he
added.
	   Italy will play for victory to pocket three points, which may be
indispensable for moving into the second round. Italy's final
opponent of the first round is Austria.
	   All four Group B teams are tied with one point apiece following
their first-match draws _ Italy-Chile 2-2 and Austria-Cameroon 1-1.
	   Cameroon, its internal squabbles and tactical problems
apparently solved by new French coach Claude Le Roy, is looking
forward to a repeat of its 1990 World Cup success in Italy when it
became the first African nation to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Cameroon's star forward Samuel Ipoua said he and his teammates
had overcome disappointment for allowing Austria's last-minute
equalizer and were looking forward to an outstanding performance
against the Italians.
	   ``I believe Italian players are a bit stressed following a tough
Serie A season. We are physically superior and can play good
soccer. We only lack some international experience,'' said the
25-year-old striker, who has played in Italy with Torino.
	   Fueling fresh controversy about the penalty which allowed
Italy's late equalizer against Chile, Le Roy said that ``referees
traditionally side with powerful teams such as Italy and we must
beware of the referee Wednesday.''
	   Maldini had been tormented for days about whether to start a
more offensive team against Cameroon, utilizing both Roberto Baggio
and Alessandro Del Piero.
	   The Baggio-Del Piero saga, with Italian premier Romano Prodi
joining the nationwide call for the use of both strikers against
Cameroon, was finally resolved following Tuesday's evening training
when the coach announced that Del Piero will be starting from the
substitutes bench.
	   ``He's ready to enter, if needed, during the match'' Maldini
said.
	   Maldini said that Baggio will pair with striker Christian Vieri
with Inter Milan offensive midfielder Francesco Moriero supporting
them.
	   Baggio, 31, brought to France as a substitute for Del Piero,
scored Italy's equalizer against Chile in the absence of his
younger teammate who was recovering from a thigh strain.
	   Del Piero did not complain about his exclusion from the starting
11.
	   ``I'm fit. I'll help the team when needed,'' he said.
	   The announced lineups:
	   Italy: Gianluca Pagliuca: Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini, Fabio
Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta, Dino Baggio, Francesco Moriero,
Luigi Di Biagio, Demetrio Albertini, Christian Vieri, Roberto
Baggio.
	   Cameroon: Jacques Singo'go; Pierre Wome; Rigobert Song, Raymond
Kalla Nkongo, Pierre Njanka, Joseph Ndo, Solomon Olembe, Patrick
Nmboma, Augustine Simo, Samuel Ipoua, Francois Omam Biyick.

Hooligan concerns move on to Toulouse; Iranians protest film
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Norway-Scotland, ADDS quote from
Iranian player, Toulouse businessman; TRIMS; WILL be UPDATED with
Brazil-Morocco &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ England and its fans are headed for Toulouse,
trailed closely by French police. Scotland moves on to
Saint-Etienne, thankful to Craig Burley that it can go there with a
purpose.
	   Burley, scoring only his second goal in 25 international
appearances, chased down substitute David Weir's 25-meter lob pass
and volleyed it on one hop over advancing goalkeeper Frode Grodas
in the 66th minute to give Scotland a 1-1 draw with Norway on
Tuesday.
	   A loss would have made Scotland, which lost 2-1 last week to
Brazil, the first team to be mathematically eliminated from any
chance of advancing to the World Cup's second round. Still, the
Scots almost certainly need to beat Morocco at Saint-Etienne next
week and get some help from others in the group to advance for the
first time in eight Cup appearances.
	   ``We're desperately disappointed that we didn't win the match,''
Scotland manager Craig Brown said. ``Only one point in two games is
not too pleasing for us.''
	   Meanwhile, courts in the southern resort of Marseille dealt
swiftly and harshly with hooligans detained after waves of violence
surrounding England's 2-0 victory over Tunisia. Now, Toulouse,
about 400 kilometers (240 miles) to the west, was bracing for
England's next match with Romania on Monday.
	   About 1,000 English fans were already reported in the city,
prompting officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July
11. They also considered closing bars early.
	   ``This is a shame,'' said Michel Delord, who owns a snack bar
next to the stadium in Toulouse. ``We had a great day with the
Austrian fans last week. They were full of beer, but polite. It's a
shame that the English don't know how to restrain themselves.''
	   In Marseille, 25 suspects _ 18 French, six English and a
Tunisian _ remained held for questioning for the violence. A local
public official joined calls for England to be kicked out of the
World Cup, a suggestion rejected by FIFA.
	   Late Monday, a court convicted and sentenced three Englishmen to
three months in prison. Five English and three French suspects were
given a trial date of July 17, five days after the World Cup ends.
	   Officials were also dealing with fans in Bordeaux, where
Scotland played Norway. Police rounded up 58 ticketless Scots
before the game. They were fed and placed in a hall to watch the
match on TV, then were to be loaded on their bus and escorted out
of town.
	   They no doubt had mixed reactions to Scotland's effort,
especially after Norway's Havard Flo scored on a header 30 seconds
into the second half. But Brown made a tactical move to bring
Burley ahead to a central midfield position, and it paid off.
	   ``For a minute I thought it had dropped over the bar,'' Burley
said. ``Fortunately it went into the net and I was delighted.''
	   Later Tuesday, Brazil had a chance to become the first team to
clinch a second-round berth as it faced Morocco in Nantes.
	   An entirely different kind of controversy was brewing in the
Iranian team's camp, where officials are incensed over the showing
of an unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV.
	   ``Not Without My Daughter,'' which stars Sally Field and
portrays Iranians as dirty, boorish, cruel and obsessed with their
Islamic religion and its attitudes toward women, was screened on
France's privately owned channel M6 late Monday.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' Safaei
Farahani, head of Iran's soccer federation, told The Associated
Press. ``We hold the French government responsible for allowing the
screening of the film, and will register our severe protest.''
	   Iranian forward Khodadad Azizi took off the yellow cap given by
the French Organizing Committee, and pointed to its ``Fair Play''
logo.
	   ``Is the showing of this movie, which is an insult to our
people, fair play,'' asked Azizi. ``Fair play is not limited to the
field. The French organizers must ensure fair play off the field as
well. I'm not going to wear this cap again.''
	   Farahani submitted a written protest to the World Cup organizing
committee and to FIFA. ``I'm waiting for an answer,'' he said.
	   In Marseille, deputy mayor Renaud Muselier urged that England be
banned from the championship because of the violence. ``The World
Cup's image ... requires that the team be disqualified or
excluded,'' he said in a statement.
	   In London, The Independent newspaper urged the England team to
pull out of the World Cup so the tournament could return to being
``a festival of football.''
	   The English Football Association has already scoffed at such
suggestions. In Paris, FIFA soccer officials had no plans to send
the English home.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding for the 2006 games.

New genetic tests could help patients avoid drug side effects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Doctors may soon give simple genetic tests
before they write a prescription to make sure the drug will
actually work _ and a patient won't be one of the unlucky ones to
suffer a serious side effect.
	   It's a new science that pinpoints subtle genetic characteristics
so doctors can personalize drug use. First in line: tests to pick
out which women will suffer blood clots if they take birth control
pills and which Alzheimer's patients should try tacrine.
	   ``This is an enormously exciting new frontier,'' said Dr.
Francis Collins, genetics chief of the National Institutes of
Health, which is launching a dlrs 30 million, three-year program to
help drug companies find this information. ``This is the kind of
thing we'd love to have for every drug in every disease.''
	   Doctors have always known that even the best medicines don't
work for every patient, and some are dangerous. The Journal of the
American Medical Association recently reported that 2 million
Americans are hospitalized annually for bad drug reactions, and
100,000 die.
	   Medicines are sold after they prove an effect on the average
sufferer of a disease, not every individual. So there's little way
to know who is wasting time and money on treatment that will fail,
and who will suffer side effects.
	   ``It's a crapshoot,'' George Poste, chief science officer of
drug maker SmithKline Beecham, acknowledged Tuesday at a meeting of
4,000 biotechnology researchers and companies. Instead, the new
science, known as pharmacogenomics, ``should be the rational
foundation of rational therapy.''
	   Scientists are deciphering the roughly 80,000 genes in people,
hunting mutations that cause diseases so they can attempt to repair
the defects.
	   People also have variations in genes, called polymorphisms, that
are too subtle to cause disease. Until now, these variations were
largely dismissed. But new evidence suggests polymorphisms can
determine how people metabolize and react to drugs.
	   ``There's a biological reason that people react differently.
It's not just luck or magic,'' said Ken Conway of Millennium
Predictive Medicines, one of about a dozen new biotechnology
companies hoping to bank on pharmacogenomics.
	   NIH's Collins said the first such test is likely to be for women
about to take birth control pills. A rare but serious side effect
is blood clots. New studies indicate about 7 percent of the
population has a genetic variation in a blood-clotting gene called
factor V-leiden _ and that women with that variation may be at
greatest risk from birth control pills, he said.
	   Canadian researchers recently discovered that Alzheimer's
patients who have a gene subtype called ApoE-4 aren't likely to be
helped by the drug tacrine. Tacrine can cause debilitating side
effects, so ruling out those patients could prevent unnecessary
illnesses.
	   Those tests could be offered fairly soon, experts said, but they
stressed Tuesday that most pharmacogenomics work is still several
years away.
	   That's because there are few databases to test which drugs
interact with which genetic variations. France's Genset holds a
private genetics map that it says within a year will contain 60,000
markers for drug testing. With it, Genset is developing a test for
Abbott Laboratories to find the 30 percent of asthma sufferers who
would be best helped by its popular drug Zyflo _ and rule out the 3
percent who would suffer liver toxicity from it, said Genset
genomics chief Daniel Cohen.
	   The NIH's new program will map 100,000 genetic variations,
putting them on the Internet so any drug can be tested.
	   But pharmacogenomics could have a downside for drug marketers
because it would rule out potential customers.
	   ``Overwhelmingly, it's going to come back to economics,'' said
SmithKline's Poste.
	   Take beta blockers, popular blood pressure medicines that cost
12 cents a dose _ too cheap to justify researching which patients
best respond, he said. But pharmacogenomics would be cost-effective
for expensive drugs for which insurers already balk at the
financial gamble that a patient will respond, he said.
	   And companies are saving gene samples from clinical trials to
study every patient who fails a Coneytherapy and target new drugs
to compensate, said Millennium's Conway. ``All the drugs developed
in the future will have a pharmacogenomics component,'' he
predicted.

Daughter proclaim mother's innocence in Gucci slaying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The daughter of slain fashion scion Maurizio Gucci
is convinced her mother did not murder Gucci despite constantly
saying she wanted to see him dead.
	   In a rare interview published Tuesday, Alessandra Gucci, 21,
says that when authorities came to arrest her mother last year, she
forced her into a corner and asked her to swear she didn't murder
her ex-husband.
	   ``Swear to me mom, swear to me that you didn't do it. I promise
I won't tell anyone, not even grandma ... '' said Alessandra Gucci,
describing the moment to the Corriere della Sera daily.
	   The eldest of the pair's two daughters said her mother, Patrizia
Reggiani Martinelli, looked her straight in the eyes and swore she
did not murder Gucci.
	   Martinelli is being tried here along with her former psychic and
three others for the fatal shooting of Gucci in 1995.
	   The prosecution says Martinelli had Gucci killed because she was
obsessed with gaining control of his estate and because he had cut
her alimony in half to dlrs 900,000 a year. It alleges she paid her
co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to carry out the killing.
	   Martinelli contends two of the other defendants schemed to kill
Gucci on their own and then hit her up for hush money.
	   The Guccis were married in 1972 and separated 12 years later.
Their other daughter, Allegra, is sixteen.
	   ``They say my mother went around saying she wanted to see dad
dead,'' Alessandra Gucci said. ``It is true. But father also always
said he wanted mother dead.''

One prisoner freed, but Nigeria awaits word on others
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with prisoner known to be free,
quotes. Pro-democracy group says it will work with new government.
Picks up sixth graf previous, `Abubakar ordered...' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The first of nine prominent political
prisoners ordered freed by Nigeria's military leaders arrived home
Tuesday, but Nigerians were still waiting for word about the
others.
	   ``My detention was extremely tough,'' Olabintan Durojaiye told
reporters after he went to church in Lagos. ``I was never tortured
but isolated. I was not allowed access to any book but the Holy
Bible.''
	   Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen.
Sani Abacha, was thrown behind bars last year without charges or
trial. Authorities never even interrogated him during his
imprisonment, he said declining to comment further.
	   Nigeria's new military ruler Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar on Monday
ordered the nine prisoners be immediately released. Besides
Durojaiye, though, none of the others were known to be free by
Tuesday evening. The seven men and one woman were being held in
prisons spread across the sprawling West African country and their
status was not completely clear.
	   Those ordered released include Nigeria's former state leader
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who voluntarily relinquished his three-year
presidency in 1979 and became a vocal critic of Abacha, who took
power in a bloodless coup in 1993. Obasanjo was serving a 15-year
prison term.
	   The release came as Nigeria's largest pro-democracy group, the
National Democratic Coalition, accepted an invitation from Abubakar
to enter into dialogue. Abubakar made a general invitation to all
Nigerians to work with his government in his maiden speech a week
ago.
	   ``It is our view that this will calm frayed nerves and ease
tensions,'' the group said in a statement that urged Abubakar to
release all remaining political prisoners, abolish
government-approved parties and nullify all local and regional
elections held during Abacha's flawed transition to democracy
program.
	   It also called for a government of national unity to be formed
under Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of presidential elections
in 1993. Abiola, who was jailed in 1994 and remains the nation's
most prominent detainee, was not among those ordered free Monday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that Israel and the Palestinians would never achieve a final peace
settlement if the Palestinians did not give up their demands for
Jerusalem and the return of refugees.
	   Netanyahu said completing an interim deal on a West Bank troop
pullout was proving so difficult because it could be the last
agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians for a long time.
	   ``It is possible that we will have to live for some time,
perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that (interim)
agreement,'' he told Israel's Army Radio.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States _ and also
reportedly from his own defense minister _ to respond to a U.S.
proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Unofficial deadline after deadline has passed with no decision
from Israel _ and no action from the United States. The plan, first
introduced in January, has been accepted by the Palestinians.

agreed upon yet,'' with the Palestinians for a next withdrawal.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Chinese fishermen shot by Russian border
guards during a crackdown on poachers have recovered and returned
to their fishing vessel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Friday.
	   Two suspected poachers were killed after they allegedly resisted
arrest and attacked the Russians who accused them of poaching
salmon in the Bering Sea.
	   Three wounded fishermen, including the captain of the
Zonglong-37, were taken to a hospital in the Far East port of
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Two were released and returned to the
ship, but the captain was still being treated, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The vessel has been impounded in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.

Emirates, Kuwait and Oman agree to more oil cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with GCC statement on future cuts in 7th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates agreed Tuesday to cut 170,000 barrels a day in oil
production in an attempt to bolster sagging prices.
	   But Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer, did not pledge
further cuts at the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
decision that analysts predicted would keep oil prices at some of
their lowest levels in 12 years.
	   Crude oil prices had jumped to as high as dlrs 12.35 in earlier
trading, but were back below dlrs 12 after the announcement.
	   The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, both OPEC members, each
agreed to cut their oil production by 75,000 barrels a day. Oman,
which is not an OPEC member, agreed to output by 20,000 barrels a
day. The cuts will take effect July 1.
	   Those cuts follow a pledge by Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela
earlier this month to cut their oil output by 450,000 barrels a
day, also starting July 1. Other OPEC producers have added around
140,000 barrels a day in cuts since that announcement.
	   But analysts believe more cuts are necessary to bolster prices.
	   A statement after the GCC meeting urged other oil producers to
make cuts ``with the aim of restabilizing the oil market.'' It said
earlier cuts that were pledged ``have not been fully achieved.''
	   The Gulf Cooperation Council brings together six states: Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that Israel and the Palestinians would never achieve a final peace
settlement if the Palestinians did not give up their demands for
Jerusalem and the right for refugees to return.
	   Netanyahu said completing an interim deal on a West Bank troop
pullout was proving so difficult because it could be the last
agreement Israel reaches with the Palestinians for a long time.
	   ``It is possible that we will have to live for some time,
perhaps a long time, with whatever is determined in that (interim)
agreement,'' he told Israel's Army Radio.
	   Netanyahu is under pressure from the United States _ and
reportedly from his own defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai _ to
respond to a U.S. proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   Several unofficial deadlines have passed with no decision from
Israel _ and no action from the United States. The plan, first
introduced in January, has been accepted by the Palestinians.
Netanyahu told Israel TV Tuesday that ``13 percent hasn't been
agreed upon yet,'' with the Palestinians for a next withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu insisted Tuesday that he would not be rushed into a
decision.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the two obstacles to
wrapping up an agreement were how to verify whether the
Palestinians were keeping their promises to improve security
measures, and yet another promised West Bank pullout.
	   Israel's Haaretz newspaper said Israel also wanted assurances
that the United States would oppose any unilateral declaration of
Palestinian statehood.
	   In the past, Netanyahu has proposed that once an agreement on a
pullout is reached, Israel and the Palestinians will move directly
to talks on a final peace settlement, which is supposed to be
negotiated by next May.
	   But Netanyahu said Tuesday that the Palestinians would have to
give up their demand for the right of Palestinian refugees from the
1948 and 1967 Mideast wars to return to Israeli and Palestinian
territories. Otherwise, he said, ``There will be no agreement.''
	   The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in
1967 war, as a future capital. The status of the city _ along with
the refugee question and other fundamental issues such as
Palestinian statehood _ are supposed to be part of the final status
talks.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu was
trying to pre-empt the outcome of the final settlement talks before
they even started.
	   ``If he's saying he will not negotiate Jerusalem and refugees
... what is left for the permanent status agenda?,'' he asked.
``These are the real issues on the agenda.
	   Also Tuesday, Israel demolished two houses in Arab neighborhoods
of east Jerusalem, despite criticism from the United States after
demolishing three others on Monday. Israel says the houses were
built illegally.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the demolitions
sent the ``wrong signals'' at a time when the Mideast peace process
is in crisis.
	   Israel's settler council said settlers would camp out in tent
cities across from Netanyahu's house starting next week, in a new
campaign against any West Bank pullout.

Anti-hooligans crackdown; Toulouse gears for next English match

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Aiming to head off new soccer riots during the
World Cup, French authorities expelled or imprisoned English
hooligans Tuesday, rounded up Scottish fans in Bordeaux and braced
for an English match in Toulouse.
	   The crackdown came while authorities in Marseille faced
criticism they bungled efforts to control the three nights and two
days of violence by hundreds of drunken English fans and local
youths that left more than 50 injured.
	   ``It was predictable,'' the tabloid daily France-Soir headlined,
with a picture of English hooligans throwing beer cans. It called
police efforts ``a failure of prevention.''
	   ``Where were the police? Nowhere,'' the Marseille daily La
Provence said of one of the clashes. ``Police eventually took up
position. Timidly.''
	   It was the nightmare the French hoped to prevent during the
five-week World Cup that began last Wednesday. A few hundred
troublemakers tainted an event drawing 1 million foreign spectators
and billions of TV viewers.
	   Tear gas from the violence wafted over Marseille's stadium
during Monday's match in which England beat Tunisia 2-0.
	   Despite about 2,000 police deployed in Marseille, violence
trashed the picturesque Old Port, spread to other downtown areas
and erupted on Prado Beach. Drunken English fans fought pitched
battles with Tunisia supporters and local youths from North African
immigrant families.
	   Police detained nearly 80 people, and a court late Monday wasted
no time convicting the first three English suspects to three months
in prison. Four others faced a hearing Tuesday.
	   Tunisia also pointed the finger at French authorities Tuesday,
and expressed its ``indignation'' at the violence.
	   ``Tunisia deplores the fact that Marseille authorities were not
able to guarantee the protection of peaceful Tunisian citizens and
foreign visitors,'' a statement by Tunisia's foreign ministry said.

Ombudsman to investigate Spanish radioactive cloud first detected

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's ombudsman opened an investigation
Tuesday into a radioactive cloud produced by a steel mill in the
far south of the country that was not detected until it arrived in
France, Switzerland and Italy.
	   The ombudsman has asked the Spanish Nuclear Security Council to
submit a report on the cloud that is believed to have originated in
the stainless-steel producer Acerinox near the city of Cadiz.
	   The link between the melting down of radioactive scrap metal in
the mill and an increase of the radioactive isotope Cesium 137
detected elsewhere in Europe in early June was not publicly
revealed by the council until June 12.
	   Environmental groups on Tuesday added demands for more
information to their initial complaints of negligence and a
cover-up.
	   ``Cesium 137 is a highly radioactive element that could cause
significant harm to animals and plants,'' a Greenpeace spokesman
said. ``We need to know how much was released by square
kilometer.''
	   The council had previously stressed that the radiation levels
were too low to cause concern, and that the cloud probably traveled
north over the Mediterranean sea, avoiding the Spanish network of
monitoring stations.
	   Meanwhile, the council released the results of an evaluation of
129 workers at the Acerinox plant. A statement Tuesday said that
the maximum dose found was similar to that received from a medical
x-ray.
	   In a press release, Acerinox said it had conducted ``detailed
and exhaustive'' radioactivity measurements that showed the plant
was free from radioactive residues.
	   Production at Acerinox's plant has not been affected, the
company said. The company owns a similar mill called North American
Stainless in the United States.
	   Elsewhere, two small mills in southwestern Spain that picked up
Acerinox's metal scrap, have closed their operations for fear that
ashes may be contaminated.

Polish train engineers threaten nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS dropped word 'strike' to lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish train engineers, demanding pay
raises and early retirement schemes, said Tuesday they will go on
strike at midnight after breaking off negotiations with the
government.
	   The decision was announced by Jan Zaborowski, head of the
engineers' largest trade union that represents some 14,000 out of
Poland's 20,000 engineers.
	   Solidarity union members refused to participate in the action
that is to idle trains just days before school vacation begins,
saying it was not over money but to sow political trouble.
	   Railway authorities said they have plans to ensure continuation
of transport, using non-striking engineers but estimate the action
will cost 21 million zlotys (dlrs 6.1 million) daily.
	   Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski said the strike will be at
the expense of the ``country's economy, of the railway clients and
of the whole country.''
	   The action was called after the government spokesman refused to
apologize for calling the strike political, Zaborowski said.
	   Transport ministry officials said they were nearing an agreement
after weeks of negotiations, but the engineers broke off the talks
Tuesday morning.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said the union action was discrepant
with labor procedures. He added the government was prepared for the
action.
	   The engineers want a 300-zloty (dlrs-88) raise in their monthly
pay, currently about 1,000 zlotys (dlrs 300).
	   They want to be eligible for retirement at 55 if they have
worked for at least 20 years. They want the age limit dropped for
those who have worked for at least 30 years. The current retirement
age is 65 for men and 60 for women.
	   In addition, the engineers want the government to funnel 1
percent of its annual budget to subsidize the railways, which are
strapped for cash but need to lower prices to compete with cheaper
road travel.
	   The Polish rail carries 1.1 million passengers and some 600,000
tons of goods daily.

Iraq calls deal with U.N. inspectors a breakthrough

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's agreement with United Nations
weapons monitors for ending disarmament activities in two months is
a ``breakthrough'' that will lead to lifting of U.N. sanctions,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Tuesday.
	   He said the deal met a longstanding Iraqi demand that the arms
inspectors write down specifically what they wanted Iraq to do ``to
close the files (and) prepare the ground for the lifting of the
economic embargo.''
	   ``It is in essence a breakthrough,'' Aziz told reporters in
Iraq's first comment on the deal he reached with chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler on Sunday.
	   The comments, mirroring similar statements by Butler on Monday,
are the best sign yet that Iraq could soon be free from U.N.
sanctions, which have devastated the country's once- prosperous
economy by banning free sale of oil.
	   In Kuwait, Butler said he was optimistic.
	   ``If they were to do it, put their shoulder to the wheel, they
could step forward and give us what we need in a matter of weeks,''
Butler said after meeting Kuwaiti leaders.

Tehran mayor accuses court of extracting confessions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trial adjourned to avoid conflict with World Cup
match in 16th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran on trial for corruption
sparred with a judge in court Tuesday, accusing him of improper
questioning and giving credence to confessions extracted under
pressure.
	   ``It's not fair that you are interrupting me. Why are you not
allowing me to defend myself?'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi told the
judge in the packed courtroom on the third day of his trial.
	   Judge Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei replied: ``When
your remarks are off the point, I will not allow you to speak.''
	   The judge became visibly irritated when, as in the previous
sessions, Karbaschi adopted a confrontational attitude to the
proceedings.
	   ``I will not allow you to discuss issues with me as you please.
This is a courtroom and you are a defendant here,'' Mohseni Ejaie
said.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested on April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hard-liner, on charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds.
	   He was released on bail on the orders of Iran's spiritual
leader, Ali Khamenei, after Karbaschi's supporters took to the
streets and clashed with security forces.
	   The court case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories about the mayor. The walls of Tehran are covered
with spray-painted graffiti, in equal parts for and against the
mayor. ``Karbaschi must be convicted,'' and ``Karbaschi is the hero
of construction,'' are among the slogans.
	   When the judge asked Karbaschi Tuesday if money had left the
city's coffers without documentation, the mayor said such a
question was improper for a judge.
	   ``I am the judge and, according to the rules of public courts, I
can also interrogate you,'' Mohseni Ejaie replied.
	   At one point the judge quoted incriminating confessions from
former city council employees who had been interrogated in
detention.
	   ``I do not accept anything written while these people were in
prison, under pressure,'' said Karbaschi, implying the confessions
were false.
	   Replied the judge: ``You are making serious accusations against
the court and judiciary by implying the use of pressure against
prisoners.''
	   Karbaschi retorted: ``You are also making serious accusations
against government employees by calling us thieves.''
	   The judge adjourned the case until June 25, instead of Sunday as
planned, because Iran will be playing a World Cup match in France
against the United States that day.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Yugoslav army helicopters
allegedly opened fire on refugee camps on a mountain near Kosovo's
frontier with Albania, killing two people, and an unidentified man
was killed Tuesday on Albanian soil by firing Yugoslav troops.
	   The two incidents were reported as Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed in Moscow to meet again with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova to discuss the bloody conflict in Kosovo,
where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   For the first time, Kosovo's militant Albanian separatists
stated their conditions for a dialogue with the Serbian
authorities, saying a ceasefire depends on withdrawal of all
security forces and foreign mediation.
	   ``As soon as the first camp was burned, we left immediately,''
said Hilmi Ziberi of the attack late Monday, explaining that
Yugoslav troops on the ground chased away the refugees before
setting the camps on fire. He and other 50 refugees arrived at the
Padesh border post early Tuesday.
	   Both helicopters used heavy machine guns and also dropped hand
grenades as they buzzed the camps, Ziberi claimed. His report could
not be independently verified.

World Cup: Ronaldo's first World Cup goal as Brazil leads 2-0 at
</HEADLINE>
halftime &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Ronaldo fired his first World Cup goal
after only nine minutes as Brazil led Morocco 2-0 at halftime
Tuesday.
	   The Inter Milan striker, who was on the Brazilian squad who
completed a record fourth World Cup title in 1994 but didn't get on
the field, drove the ball home from the edge of the area for a
simple strike after collecting a forward pass from Rivaldo.
	   It was Rivaldo who made it 2-0 in first half injury time with a
close-range tap-in from Cafu's right wing cross.
	   But Brazil, already a 2-1 winner over Scotland, revealed first
half frailties against a Moroccan team who refused to lie down.
	   Leonardo thought he had given Brazil the lead when he fired home
in the second minute but was thwarted by an offside flag.
	   But there was nothing wrong with Ronaldo's strike seven minutes
later.
	   The 21-year-old striker was on his own when he collected a
forward pass by Rivaldo but didn't need any help. He took the ball
first time and wasted no time in firing home from 18 meters (yards)
in the ninth minute.
	   Errors began to creep into the Brazilian midfield and defense as
half time neared and Bebeto and team captain Dunga became involved
in a heated argument after the defending champions had been exposed
by a Moroccan raid and conceded a free kick just outside of their
own area.
	   Although they blocked the free kick, Brazil conceded another
corner and Said Chiba flicked a long-range header just wide of the
post.
	   But a second goal came with first half time running out, Cafu
breaking down the right and crossing low for the unmarked Rivaldo
to run the ball in from barely five meters for his sixth goal in a
Brazilian shirt.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel, Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo, Rivaldo; Bebeto, Ronaldo.
	   Morocco _ Driss Benzekri; Abdelilah Saber, Youssef Rossi,
Abdelkrim El Hadrioui, Noureddine Naybet; El Moustafa Hadji, Said
Chiba, Youssef Chippo, Tahar El Khalej; Abdeljilil Hadda,

Iran judge adjourns trial to avoid football date
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Priorities, please.
	   The trial of Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi on corruption
charges _ one of the hottest topics in Iran today _ was postponed
from Sunday to June 25.
	   The reason?
	   Sunday is the World Cup match between Iran and the United
States, and the judge didn't want the next session to conflict.
	   The trial has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories about the mayor. The walls of Tehran are covered
with spray-painted graffiti, in equal parts for and against the
mayor, who stands as a symbol of reformers in Iran.
	   But soccer apparently can compete, especially a game against the
United States, with whom Iran's relations off the field have been
strained since the 1979 revolution overthrew the pro-Western shah.
	   The judge said many people asked him not to hold the session
Sunday, and he had no objection.

Grains, soybeans rise on deteriorating crop conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns about prolonged bad
weather that could worsen crop quality.
	   Forecasts Tuesday from private meteorologists suggest a summer
drought might replace the abundant rainfall and mild Midwestern
temperatures that are becoming detrimental to crop development.
	   Concerns about the weather were heightened by a U.S. Agriculture
Department report late Monday that indicated crop conditions were
deteriorating.
	   While the government currently is predicting bumper soybean and
corn crops _ at a time of weak export demand _ poor growing weather
could shave final production figures.
	   Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1-2 cents to dlrs 2.77 a bushel;
July corn rose 4 1-2 cents to dlrs 2.37 1-4 a bushel; July oats
rose 1-2 cent to dlrs 1.20 3-4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 9
1-4 cents to dlrs 5.87 1-4 a bushel.

German supreme court says lawmaker can label rival as Stasi
</HEADLINE>
informant &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that merger referendum passed in west Berlin and
defeated in former East Germany, sted having been widely defeated.
Minor edits to tighten. New to some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court ruled Tuesday
that a lawmaker from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party can say a
political rival collaborated with former East Germany's secret
police even though that has not been proven.
	   The ruling overturns a decision by a lower court ordering the
Berlin lawmaker to stop labeling Brandenburg state governor Manfred
Stolpe an informer for the Ministry for State Security, known as
the Stasi.
	   The court said the statements by Christian Democratic Union
lawmaker Uwe Lehmann-Brauns were protected under freedom of
thought, which is guaranteed by Germany's constitution.
	   Stolpe, a Social Democrat and once the top Lutheran bishop in
East Germany, said the ruling infringed on ``human dignity.''
	   Stolpe has never denied that, as a top religious official, he
often communicated with East Germany's communist leaders. But he
denies having collaborated with the Stasi.
	   ``Under the conditions of a dictatorship other ways must be
taken in the interest of the people than in a free democracy,''
Stolpe said.
	   Stolpe had called on his party colleague, former Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt, and five former East German Lutheran bishops as
character witnesses in his defense.
	   Lehmann-Brauns accused Stolpe of working as the Stasi's
unofficial agent for more than 20 years under the code name
Sekretaer, or secretary.
	   Lehmann-Brauns made the allegation in a ZDF television interview
in 1996, when Berlin, a city-state, and surrounding Brandenburg
state held a referendum to determine if the two should merge.
Lehmann-Brauns, who opposed the merger, said the prospect of Stolpe
becoming governor of Berlin ``gives me a bad headache.''
	   The proposed merger was defeated by voters in former East
Germany, thought voters in western Berlin were in favor.
	   A state appeals court issued an order barring Lehmann-Brauns'
statements linking the governor to the Stasi after the Potsdam
state court in Brandenburg ruled against Stolpe.
	   Lehmann-Brauns then filed with the Federal Constitutional Court
in Karlsruhe to have the restraining order lifted, arguing that as
a lawmaker he should be allowed to express a political opinion.

Albright says Milosevic response not enough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs to elaborate on White House reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Congress Tuesday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had
failed to meet most of the U.S. demands in his treatment of ethnic
Albanians in the tense Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Following a telephone call between President Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, who met with Milosevic in Moscow, White
House officials were conditionally more positive, saying, ``The
outcome of this meeting , in the president's view, moves us in the
right direction.''
	   Still, White House press secretary Mike McCurry voiced regret
that Milosevic agreed to withdraw brutal security forces from
border areas only ``as terrorist activities stop.''
	   ``That is a linkage that would appear to be a loophole,''
McCurry told reporters after Clinton's eight-minute call to
Yeltsin. ``The withdrawal of Serb security forces is fundamental.''
	   Albright said ``there was some progress'' in Milosevic's Moscow
meetings, particularly his offer to resume negotiations with
Albanian leaders.
	   But she said Milosevic did not pledge to halt his ``torching the
various populations'' in the predominantly Albanian province or to
withdraw Serbian troops that have retaliated against civilians for
secessionists' actions trying to wrench independence from Belgrade.
	   Albright said ``all options are open,'' including military
options, and that a U.S. warning under the Bush administration in
1992 of unilateral U.S. action ``is still valid.''
	   Despite some progress, Albright told the Senate Appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee, ``It is insufficient that the
killing of civilians and depopulating of villages continues.''
	   Specifically, she criticized the Yugoslav president for
conditioning any pullback of Serbian forces on Albanian extremists
halting their attacks.
	   Albright said Milosevic has to pull back in any event.
	   ``NATO leaders have not ruled out the use of force,'' she said.
``Contingency planning is under way,'' although the United States
would far prefer a diplomatic settlement of the crisis in Kosovo.
	   The key U.S. Demands, endorsed Friday at a foreign ministers
meeting in London by Russia and six other U.S. Allies, are a
cease-fire, a pullback of Serb forces, resumption of negotiations
with Albanian leaders, a monitoring system and return of refugees
to their homes.
	   Albright said the conflict in Kosovo has the potential to draw
neighboring countries into conflict as well.
	   While the allies are united in their demands, there is some
disagreement on how to proceed. Russia, for instance, dissented
from the decision Friday to cut off Yugoslav commercial flights.
	   The Clinton administration takes the position a new U.N.
Security Council resolution is not required to take military action
_ a resolution Russia could block with its veto in the Security
Council _ while Britain, a close U.S. ally in the Balkans, is
pushing for such a resolution.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Havel's TV comments in 17th, last graf. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Three days before elections
President Vaclav Havel bills as a choice between democracy and ''a
banana republic,'' he was under fire for saying he may not choose
the largest party to form the next government.
	   Noone expects any political clarity to emerge from the vote
Friday and Saturday, held two years ahead of schedule following the
ouster of Premier Vaclav Klaus and the collapse of his center-right
coalition last winter. A caretaker government under banker Josef
Tosovsky has run the country since.
	   Center-left and center-right parties are bitterly opposed to one
another, and neither has hope of a clear majority _ even if
alliances are made with smaller, questionably stable parties.
	   Latest opinion polls show the Social Democrats of Milos Zeman
the top of the 13 parties running for the 200-seat lower chamber of
parliament, with a projected 23.2 percent.
	   Zeman's bitter rival, Klaus, is just behind, with his Civic
Democratic Party polling 20.7 percent in polls with a 3 percent
margin of error.
	   Only five other parties are expected to cross the five percent
hurdle needed to get into parliament. Of these, two are the old
guard Communists and extreme Republicans, excluded by all
mainstream parties as possible coalition partners.
	   That leaves only the small Christian Democrats, the Freedom
Union _ a party of center-right rebels against Klaus, favored by
Havel _ and the eclectic Pensioners for a Secure Life as potential
partners in government.
	   Although polls show that almost half of the 8.09 million voters
would support a grand coalition uniting the Social Democrats,
Klaus' party and the Freedom Union, all three rule it out _ at
least for now.
	   The Social Democrats say they would be willing to form a
government with the populist pensioners' party, which has about
seven percent support, and the Christian Democrats, Klaus' former
coalition partner.
	   They could even make it with just the pensioners' party, and
tacit support from the Communists _ but the latter insist on a
referendum on the country's membership in NATO, which already has
been approved by both houses of parliament, but the Reds still
reject.
	   Klaus says his only possible coalition partners are the Freedom
Union and the Christian Democrats. The latter's leader, Josef Lux,
says no way again with the often-arrogant Klaus: ``This would be an
alliance of confrontation.''
	   Lux' idea is to join up with the Freedom Union and Social
Democrats to ``suppress latent communism'' among the latter.
	   Jan Ruml of Freedom Union says he might prefer more early
elections to that combination.
	   Regular parliamentary elections had been scheduled for 2000. But
Klaus' government collapsed in November over a party financing
scandal.
	   Klaus now warns the Czech Republic is at a crossroads and
socialism soon may be back. Havel agrees the country is at a
crossroads but says there is no threat socialism would return.
	   ``The country is at a crossroads,'' Havel said on television
Saturday, facing the choice between becoming a ``civilized
democracy'' or turning into a ``banana republic.''
	   ``I dream of a government with a concept, of a government
composed of younger people, ... that is doing what politics should
be: a service for the public,'' he said Tuesday on the private NOVA
television.
	   Havel is constitutionally responsible for tapping the man to
form a new government after voting ends Saturday. He refused to
ally himself with either left or right but named several ministers
of the current caretaker government _ which he played a large part
in forming _ as the example of young politicians who meet his
standards.
	   At odds with Klaus, and no supporter of Zeman, Havel repeatedly
said he may not necessarily pick the head of the strongest
political party to try to form a government.
	   That statement galvanized all sides into unusual unity.
	   ``Let's stick to the usual practice that the winner has the
first chance,'' said Ruml. ``It's important that the president asks
the winner,'' insisted Lux. ``Any other alternative,'' snipped
Klaus, ``would go against the very sense of democratic elections.''
	   Havel took offense when asked whom he would ask to form the
government, saying such a question implies suspicion that he will
not respect election results.

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: EDITS, ADDS quotes from defense lawyer Barry Scheck in grafs
9-11, MOVES first reference to Woodward Appeal Fund to graf 15
 &UR; With BC-US-Au Pair

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward's mother Tuesday said it
was ``absolutely fantastic'' that her daughter would be coming home
at last after being convicted of killing a child in her care.
	   But Susan Woodward had nothing more to say to reporters, and the
reaction in the family's hometown was notably subdued after the
appeals court in Massachusetts cleared the way for Miss Woodward to
leave the United States.
	   The court upheld a ruling by the trial judge, Superior Court
Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that Louise Woodward's sentence for
second-degree murder should be reduced to manslaughter and the
length of sentence to the time in prison she had already served.
	   ``I'm really pleased with the news, but I'm surprised, I thought
people would have been here in their thousands,'' said Thomas
Maddocks, 78, who found just a few drinkers at the Rigger pub,
which has served as headquarters for local supporters.
	   It had been packed on the day Miss Woodward was convicted of
killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, and again on the day her
sentence was reduced.
	   ``I can't understand it, everyone was here for the verdict and
for everything else. I suppose it's been going on for so long and
the final came and people had had enough,'' Maddocks said.
	   Although Mrs. Woodward had nothing more to say publicly, Paul
Barrow, an attorney for the family, read a statement to reporters.
	   ``Louise will continue to maintain her innocence and a statement
in fact has already been made by her American lawyers a short time
ago, stating the injustice that they consider she has suffered,''
Barrow said.
	   In Oxford, Barry Scheck, one of Miss Woodward's U.S. attorneys,
said the trial had been a ``terrible experience for all involved.''
	   ``This has been a tragic case from the beginning for the family
of Matthew Eappen, and for this young woman who was charged with a
crime that the scientific evidence I believe demonstrates she did
not commit,'' Scheck told a news conference.
	   ``The waiting was unbearable, but what was unbearable was being
in jail. It was very difficult. While she was waiting for the
verdict, everything she did was subjected to wall-to-wall publicity
and tabloid scrutiny,'' Scheck said.
	   Julie Smith, the landlady at Elton's Rigger pub, said she was
``pleased she's coming home and we'll take it from there.
	   ``We've not forgotten that a baby was killed. We've all got
children or grandchildren. I'm scared to say anything in case it
might get misconstrued,'' Mrs. Smith said.
	   ``We can hardly believe it, everyone as you can imagine is
absolutely over the moon,'' said Roy McCabe, a family friend.
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the trustees of the Louise
Woodward Appeal Fund, said he was relieved that the court had
finally made its decision.
	   ``I am obviously very pleased that the appeal has been upheld
and that she will at last be able to come back.
	   ``We have still not got to lose sight of the fact that there is
a dead baby at the end of it and we still feel for the Eappen
family and their pain must be increased because of this verdict,''
Davey said.
	   Jean Antrobus, who stopped by at the Rigger, said the court's
ruling was ``brilliant news.''
	   ``I don't think the conviction should stand but at least it
means she's coming home,'' Mrs. Antrobus said.
	   ``She's only a girl herself. It doesn't alter the fact that
Matthew died and I feel very sorry for his parents, but it's time
that she came home and to put everything behind us.''
	   Ann Bradshaw of Elton said she was ``so glad it's all over'' for
the Woodwards.
	   ``In recent weeks it's got totally out of hand because it
dragged on so long,'' Mrs. Bradshaw said. ``Now everyone knows
where they stand and can get on with their lives.''
	   Gareth Jones, a supporter of Woodward's appeal fund, said people
in Elton had learned from the negative reaction to their jubilation
when Zobel reduced the sentence.
	   ``People think the best thing to do is keep a low profile and
rejoice in the fact that she's coming home. You don't need to jump
up and down, the freedom speaks for herself,'' Jones said.

World Cup: Italian star fit but benched
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Italy-Cameroon &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Former Brazilian soccer great Pele
strongly suggested it. Italian premier Romano Prodi joined a
nationwide appeal to see the ``wonder duo'' starting together in
Wednesday's match against Cameroon.
	   But Italy's coach Cesare Maldini disappointed everyone Tuesday
when he decided to keep Alessandro Del Piero on the substitutes
bench and start veteran Roberto Baggio in a pair with young striker
Christian Vieri.
	   Maldini announced his conservative choice following an evening
training session, leaving the door open for a possible inclusion of
Del Piero during the match.
	   ``He will be starting on the bench, but he's ready to enter at
any time, if needed,'' Maldini said on the eve of Italy's Group B
match against Cameroon.
	   Maldini's only concession in support of the attacking duo was
inclusion of offensive midfielder Francesco Moeriero in the place
of Angelo Di Livio, who had started against Chile.
	   Roma's midfielder Luigi Di Biagio was named to replace Chelsea's
Roberto Di Matteo.
	   Del Piero, 23, recovered from a right thigh strain suffered in
the Champions Cup final, did not complain for his exclusion from
the starting 11 but he clearly was not happy.
	   After missing the first match against Chile because of his
questionable form, Del Piero was fit and ready to regain his place
on Italy's attack.
	   ``I'll help the team when needed,'' said Del Piero.
	   Maldini explained he had talked to the player to explain his
tactical choice but did not elaborate.
	   An attacking trident of Del Piero, Baggio and Vieri was
considered by some analysts _ and by Maldini _ a risky tactic
against the powerful and fast Indomitable Lions of Africa. When
playing together with Juventus, Del Piero and Baggio have seldom
supported defensive play of midfielders.
	   Baggio, an original substitute of Del Piero, is now starting in
his second consecutive match of his third World Cup.
	   ``There is no rivalry with Del Piero. We are concentrating on
Cameroon which is an unpredictable team. We must play well, to
win,'' Baggio said.
	   Italy needs a victory against Cameroon to boost its qualifying
chances following a 2-2 draw against Chile.
	   The Italian team plays its last Group match against Austria at
St. Denis, near Paris, on June 23.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Yugoslav army helicopters
reportedly attacked refugee camps in the mountains of Kosovo
province, killing two people, and a man was shot dead Tuesday
inside Albania by Yugoslav soldiers firing across the border.
	   The incidents were reported as Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed in Moscow to meet with ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova to discuss the separatist conflict in Kosovo, where
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1.
	   Refugees said the Yugoslav MI-8 helicopters used heavy machine
guns and dropped hand grenades as they buzzed the camps near the
Albanian frontier. The refugees said the aircraft were backed by
dozens of Serb soldiers in the assaults on the mountain camps,
where hundreds of people had taken shelter while waiting to cross
into Albania.
	   The accounts of the refugees could not be confirmed
independently. Serb officials made no comment on the reports.
	   ``As soon as the first camp was burned, we left immediately,''
Hilmi Ziberi, a 39-year-old refugee, said of the attack on the
camps late Monday. He and other 50 refugees reached a border post
in Padesh, Albania, early Tuesday.
	   Also Tuesday, Ambassador Dan Everts, head of the mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Albania,
confirmed a report that an unidentified man was shot and killed at
the Padesh border checkpoint by the Yugoslav soldiers firing across
the border.
	   Everts, who spoke in the Albanian capital, Tirana, also said the
soldiers resumed firing Tuesday when police tried to recover the
man's body.
	   In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Congress Tuesday that Milosevic had failed to meet most of the U.S.
demands in his treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   Albright said ``there was some progress'' in Milosevic's Moscow
meetings, particularly his offer to resume negotiations with
Albanian leaders. But, she said, Milosevic did not pledge to halt
his ``torching the various populations'' or to withdraw Serbian
troops.
	   In impoverished northern Albania, meanwhile, a U.N. convoy of 11
trucks carrying plastic sheeting for windows and roofs, shoes and
bedding arrived in the border town of Bajram Curri.
	   ``We made contingencies for more than 20,000 people,'' said
Laura Boldrini, a U.N. aid agency spokeswoman. Some 13,000 Kosovo
refugees have reached Albania since the Yugoslav crackdown began in
Kosovo more than three months ago.
	   Late Monday, Jakup Krasniqi, the newly appointed spokesman for
the Kosovo Liberation Army, appeared on television in full uniform
emblazoned with the KLA insignia.
	   In an Albanian television interview received by satellite in
Kosovo, he said a dialogue with Serbian authorities could not begin
until all ``enemy forces'' withdraw from Kosovo. He said
international mediation was also required.
	   More than 300 people have since been killed in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians seek independence for the Serbian province.

World Cup: Brown's gamble pays off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORLEY MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Scotland manager Craig Brown's desperate
gamble worked, throwing a World Cup lifeline to the Scots.
	   Scotland has qualified for eight World Cup finals without
reaching the second round, and yet another early flight home looked
on the cards when Flo Havard gave Norway a 46th minute in Tuesday's
Group A match.
	   With time running out fast and no equalizer in sight, Brown
replaced Colin Calderwood with defender David Weir in the 59th
minute.
	   It proved to be an inspired switch. Just seven minutes after
coming on, Weir threaded a perfect 25-meter pass through the
Norwegian defense and midfielder Craig Burley calmly lobbed the
ball over goalkeeper Frode Grodas for only his second goal in 26
international appearances.
	   The 1-1 draw kept hopes alive the possibility that Scotland,
which lost its opener 2-1 last week to Brazil, won't be going home
after three games this time.
	   ``When we went a goal down, we had to gamble,'' Brown said.
``The gamble paid off with an excellent goal from Craig Burley and
a wonderful pass from David Weir.''
	   Brown, who became manager in 1993, admitted the omens looked
ominous when Scotland went behind, but the team's fighting spirit
remained strong.
	   ``We have always made a habit of coming back,'' Brown said.
``I'd like to think that sometime soon we will get ahead in the
game and then I think we can go on from strength to strength. We're
still in there and we'll be fighting to the end.''

World Cup: Maradona says he now will travel to France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona said Tuesday he
has decided to travel to France to fulfill his commitment as a
television commentator.
	   But the former Argentine national team captain did not specify
when he will arrive in France.
	   ``I'm going to be there as the people are, with the people. I
don't want them to have a reception for me,''Maradona said on a
local television program.
	   Maradona had cancelled his trip last week after a judge issued a
two-year, 10-month suspended sentence for a 1994 shooting incident
involving journalists outside his country home. Maradona was found
guilty of assault with a weapon.
	   The court case had clouded the possibility he would travel to
France. After the ruling was handed down Friday, Maradona said he
was unable to travel because he was ``depressed.''

	   KOMAN, Albania (AP) _ Adjusting the lapels of his brown
polyester suit, the gangly man whipped off his sunglasses and
reached under his red and yellow beach shirt for a Chinese-made
pistol.
	   His audience was duly impressed as the pop-pop of the pistol
echoed off cliffs overhanging Albania's Drini River, in an
impromptu trade show aboard a ferry on an Albanian gunrunning route
to Kosovo.
	   The arms entrepreneur smiled, exposing teeth rotted by years of
bad nutrition.
	   Gunrunning has become a lucrative business along border towns in
Albania, Europe's poorest country, and smugglers can count on
police to look the other way. Most of the guns are going to
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian separatists and with tensions there high,
business is booming.
	   ``Look at them, they don't even bother to hide it anymore,''
said Sulejman Broji, a passenger headed for the frontier town of
Bajram Curri.
	   Albanian authorities, seeking to maintain the moral high ground
in the escalating conflict in Kosovo, officially frown on
gunrunning. But the pistol performance demonstrated how lax
enforcement is.
	   Driving minivans with Swiss license plates, the customer and his
dozen friends looked out of place aboard the rusting ferry. Their
clothes looked fresh, their boots unsullied by the mud and dust
that are the bane of life here.
	   Albanian emigres from Switzerland and Germany are thought to be
supplying much of the funding for the weapons being smuggled into
Kosovo on mule trains. The arms convoys often follow the same
trails used in the other direction by more than 10,000 Kosovo
Albanians who have fled the fighting and taken refuge in wild
northeastern Albania.
	   Less than one hour before, in the small town of Koman, men
sweated in the hot midday sun loading heavy machine guns,
Kalashnikov automatic rifles and potato sacks full of ammunition
aboard the river ferry.
	   The Drini River provides the easiest route through the mountains
and deep ravines that separate Shkodra, northern Albania's biggest
town, from the border with Kosovo.
	   Weapons slowly find their way to Kosovo. On Tuesday, a tractor
was seen pulling more than two dozen crates of shoulder-held
anti-tank missiles towards the border. Nearby, a Kosovo Liberation
Army guerrilla trained seven young men on automatic rifles.
	   Most of the weapons were looted from armories around Albania in
the rioting and chaos that followed the nationwide collapse of
highly popular pyramid schemes.
	   While many border towns are flush with weapons, the recent
frequency of gun traffic up the Drini River indicates that demand
is steadily outpacing local supplies.
	   ``This is different, these guns are new,'' said Broji. Others
standing around on the deck of the ferry agreed.
	   Many of the bigger weapons, including tripod-mounted heavy
machine guns usually found on top of tanks, glinted with the sheen
of packing oil.
	   Men in a rubber dinghy unloaded automatic rifles at the front
end of the ferry. Police nearby directed traffic, seemingly
oblivious.
	   The larger guns were carried aboard and dumped at the front of
the boat. Large quantities of money wrapped in newspaper were
exchanged at the port.
	   Some of the men, their faces red from the summer sun, used new
hand-held video cameras to film themselves aboard the ferry. One
man emptied another magazine of bullets into the cliffs.

Super painkillers top list of upcoming wonder drugs

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Drug makers, eyeing Viagra's runaway success
with profit envy, expect the drive for arthritis relief will yield
the next wonder drug.
	   Some industry experts believe Celebra, a painkiller that cuts
inflammation but avoids the stomach-damaging effects of aspirin,
ibuprofen and acetaminophen, could outsell the impotency drug by
millions of dollars a year.
	   Drug makers' ceaseless efforts to stock America's medicine chest
have long plowed research money into trying to ease such ills as
cancer, obesity and chronic pain. But the road to a cancer cure is
littered with promising treatments that fizzled. And last year's
recall of two diet pills left many dieters wary of weight-loss
drugs.
	   Now comes a new class of super painkillers with a singular
advantage: They could be on pharmacy shelves within months. And
industry watchers believe millions of Americans will gladly toss
their bottles of common painkillers for an alternative that saves
their stomachs.
	   Kathryn Howe already has.
	   Rheumatoid arthritis left the 51-year-old executive secretary's
joints so swollen she couldn't type or take long walks. Rolling
over in bed hurt.
	   She kept the swelling under control with prescription-strength
versions of drugs such as Tylenol and Advil. But 15 years of them
left her with an inflamed stomach and rectal bleeding. Last year,
her doctor asked her to test an unapproved drug called Celebra. Now
she walks, swims, does low-impact aerobics and even lifts weights
comfortably with no apparent side effects.
	   ``A person can shake my hand and I'm not in pain,'' the
Eastlake, Ohio, resident said. ``I can hold a pencil.''
	   Some analysts predict Celebra will outsell Viagra, the lucrative
Pfizer Inc. impotency treatment that became the fastest-selling
drug in history its first month.
	   ``That's what I would put my finger on as the next blockbuster
drug, not only in terms of medicinal value but in terms of cult
following,'' said Stephen Tang, a drug industry specialist with
A.T. Kearney, a management consulting firm in New York.
	   Typical estimates call for annual Viagra sales to reach dlrs 3
billion by 2002. Celebra sales could eventually top dlrs 4 billion,
said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Christina Heuer.
	   With the global market for prescription painkillers, not
including over-the-counter sales, at dlrs 5 billion, Ms. Heuer
predicts Celebra could be ``the most significant new drug
introduction of 1999.''
	   Celebra is expected to be the first out of the blocks from a new
class of drugs called cox-2 inhibitors, so named because they block
the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase. Aspirin and similar
anti-inflammatory drugs do that too, but they go too far, also
blocking the cox-1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining.
	   Doctors believe the new class of painkillers may also provide a
significant side benefit. Patients are more likely to get better
faster, or improve more profoundly, if they're willing to take
their medicine and stay on it.
	   When Mrs. Howe was prescribed standard anti-inflammatory drugs
that hurt her stomach, she conceded, ``I wasn't a very compliant
patient.''
	   Celebra's manufacturer, Monsanto Corp.'s Searle unit, is
expected to ask the Food and Drug Administration for an expedited
six-month review by September. If that happens, the drug could be
on the market by early next year in the United States and late 1999
abroad.
	   Having tested Celebra's effects on rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis and dental pain, scientists are now researching
signs that Celebra might help prevent colon cancer and Alzheimer's
disease, in which cox-2 is believed to play a role.
	   If it is approved for rheumatoid arthritis, the most severe
joint disease, doctors would be free to prescribe it for a number
of painful conditions.
	   Searle will have to move quickly. Merck and Co. is about six
months behind in developing a rival painkiller named Vioxx. Glaxo
Wellcome PLC, Johnson and Johnson and Roche Laboratories also have
cox-2 drugs on the way. Already Merck and Searle are entangled in a
legal battle over patents.
	   Monsanto, Searle's parent, has agreed to be acquired by American
Home Products Corp., but the new owner won't be marketing Celebra.
Searle signed up Pfizer for that agreeable task long before the
acquisition.
	   Whoever handles it, Wall Street appears to be betting on
Celebra.
	   ``Cox-2, that's potentially the next big blockbuster, and I
think Monsanto and Pfizer have the upper hand,'' said Hemant K.
Shah, an independent drug industry analyst in Warren, New Jersey.
``The first product always has the advantage.''
	   Prozac's dlrs 2.6 billion in worldwide sales, for instance,
makes it the best-selling antidepressant years after similar rivals
_ Pfizer's Zoloft, Glaxo's Wellbutrin, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil _
came on the market.
	   In addition to the cox-2 class, Wall Street analysts recognize
several candidates as wild-card contenders in the race for the next
wonder drug:
	   _ Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan. Ms. Heuer estimates the drug could
bring in dlrs 1.5 billion in 2002, matching 1997 sales of
SmithKline's top-selling antibiotic Augmentin.
	   _ Avandia, an oral diabetes drug by SmithKline. Analysts say it
could become a blockbuster if it lacks the side effects of
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin, which was pulled from the market in the
United Kingdom after a few patients suffered liver failure.
	   _Leptin, Amgen Inc.'s weight-loss hormone. Some patients lost 35
pounds in six months, but doctors remain wary of obesity drugs
since last August's recall of the diet pills Redux and fen-phen, a
combination of fenfluramine and phentermine. Knoll Pharmaceuticals'
new diet pill, Meridia, drew a lackluster 11,185 prescriptions last
month, according to researcher IMS Health. Leptin is also being
tested on diabetes patients.
	   But even blockbusters will have a hard time topping Viagra, with
an unprecedented 1.7 million prescriptions in three months.
	   ``There's never been a drug like this so far in the history of
the business,'' said Joseph P. Riccardo, a drug industry analyst at
Bear Stearns and Co. in New York.

Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico sells controlling stake to venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Co.
said Tuesday it agreed to sell a controlling stake to a venture of
Pohlad Cos. and Pepsico Inc.
	   Pohlad Cos. is a large independent Pepsi bottler with interests
in the southeastern United States.
	   Under the pact, Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico's chief executive, Rafael
Nin, will grant the venture an option to buy all of Pepsi-Cola
Puerto Rico's issued Class A shares for dlrs 23.75 million, or dlrs
4.75 a share. That money would go to the company, while a
additional dlrs 1 required to exercise the shares would go to their
current holders.
	   At the same time, the venture will acquire 6.2 million Class B
common shares for dlrs 3.62 a share from Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico
stockholders.
	   Following those two transactions, the venture will own about 52
percent of the overall shares and 77.9 percent of the voting
control of Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico. The venture will also get a
warrant to buy an additional 1.7 million Class B shares,
exercisable at any time for seven years at dlrs 6.87{ a share.
	   PepsiCo Inc., of Purchase, New York, does not own a stake in
Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico.

One prisoner freed, but Nigeria awaits word on others

Pro-democracy group says it will work with new government. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The first of nine prominent political
prisoners ordered freed by Nigeria's military leaders arrived home
Tuesday, but Nigerians were still waiting for word about the
others.
	   ``My detention was extremely tough,'' Olabintan Durojaiye told
reporters after he went to church in the capital, Lagos. ``I was
never tortured but isolated. I was not allowed access to any book
but the Holy Bible.''
	   Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen.
Sani Abacha, was thrown behind bars last year without charges or
trial. Authorities never even interrogated him during his
imprisonment, he said, declining to comment further.
	   Abacha died of a heart attack last week.
	   Nigeria's new military ruler Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar on Monday
ordered that nine prisoners be immediately released. Besides
Durojaiye, though, none of the others were known to be free by
Tuesday evening. The seven men and one woman were being held in
prisons spread across the sprawling West African country and their
status was not completely clear.
	   Those ordered released include Nigeria's former state leader
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who voluntarily relinquished his three-year
presidency in 1979 and became a vocal critic of Abacha, who took
power in a bloodless coup in 1993. Obasanjo was serving a 15-year
prison term.
	   The release came as Nigeria's largest pro-democracy group, the
National Democratic Coalition, accepted an invitation from Abubakar
to enter into dialogue. Abubakar made a general invitation to all
Nigerians to work with his government in his maiden speech a week
ago.
	   ``It is our view that this will calm frayed nerves and ease
tensions,'' the group said in a statement that urged Abubakar to
release all remaining political prisoners, abolish
government-approved parties and nullify all local and regional
elections held during Abacha's flawed transition to democracy
program.
	   It also called for a government of national unity to be formed
under Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of presidential elections
in 1993. Abiola, who was jailed in 1994 and remains the nation's
most prominent detainee, was not among those ordered free Monday.
	   The other prisoners include labor leaders, opposition activists,
journalists and other Abacha foes.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus
criticized the United States and its allies Tuesday for a double
standard in dealing with the Middle East.
	   ``The United Nations adopted important resolutions concerning
the settlement in the Middle East but the United States and its
allies did not show real intention to implement them,'' he said in

Ombudsman to investigate Spanish radioactive cloud first detected

elsewhere in Europe &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement by company president saying scrap
suppliers to blame &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's ombudsman opened an investigation
Tuesday into a radioactive cloud produced by a steel mill in the
far south of the country that was not detected until it arrived in
France, Switzerland and Italy.
	   The ombudsman has asked the Spanish Nuclear Security Council to
submit a report on the cloud that is believed to have originated in
the stainless-steel producer Acerinox near the city of Cadiz.
	   The link between the melting down of radioactive scrap metal of
unknown origin in the mill, and an increase of the radioactive
isotope Cesium 137 detected elsewhere in Europe in early June, was
not publicly revealed by the council until June 12.
	   Environmental groups on Tuesday added demands for more
information to their initial complaints of negligence and a
cover-up.
	   ``Cesium 137 is a highly radioactive element that could cause
significant harm to animals and plants,'' a Greenpeace spokesman
said. ``We need to know how much was released by square
kilometer.''
	   The council previously said the radiation levels were too low to
cause concern, and that the cloud probably traveled north over the
Mediterranean sea, avoiding the Spanish network of monitoring
stations.
	   On Tuesday the council released the results of an evaluation of
129 workers at the Acerinox plant indicating that the maximum dose
found was similar to a medical x-ray.
	   In a press release, Acerinox said it had conducted ``detailed
and exhaustive'' radioactivity measurements that showed the plant
was free from radioactive residues and that production has not been
affected.
	   Acerinox president Victoriano Munoz said his company was the
``victim'' and not the cause of the incident, the private news
agency Europa Press reported.
	   ``We were sold radioactive scrap when our contracts with
suppliers include a specific clause to guarantee that the material
is inert'' Europa press quoted Munoz as saying.
	   Acerinox buys most of its scrap from Dutch, German and U.S.
dealers, the agency reported.

World Cup: Ronaldo strikes as Brazil qualifies for round two with
</HEADLINE>
3-0 win &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Ronaldo scored his first World Cup goal
and Brazil became the quickest team into the second round Tuesday
by cruising to a 3-0 victory over Morocco.
	   The Inter Milan striker, who was on the Brazilian squad who
completed a record fourth World Cup title in 1994 but didn't get on
the field, drove the ball home from the edge of the area for a
simple strike in the ninth minute after taking a pass from Rivaldo.
	   It was Rivaldo who made it 2-0 in first half injury time with a
close-range tap-in from Cafu's right wing cross and Ronaldo set up
the third for Bebeto four minutes into the second half.
	   The result meant that Brazil, already a 2-1 winner over
Scotland, has maximum points from two games and can't be caught in
Group A. Brazil was also the first team into round two in 1994.
	   Leonardo thought he had given Brazil the lead when he fired home
in the second minute but was thwarted by an offside flag.
	   But there was nothing wrong with Ronaldo's strike seven minutes
later.
	   The 21-year-old striker was on his own when he collected a
forward pass by Rivaldo but didn't need any help. He hit the ball
first time from 18 meters (yards) in the ninth minute.
	   There were anxious looks from the Brazilian bench when Ronaldo
went down after a late, high tackle from Said Chiba clattered into
him just above the left knee. The bench was relieved to see him
resume after brief treatment.
	   The Moroccans had enough possession to force a series of corners
but didn't worry Taffarel in the Brazilian goal while Ronaldo went
close in the 24th minute to adding to his early goal.
	   Roberto Carlos curled in a low cross from the left and Ronaldo,
stretching at the far post, was a toecap away from prodding the
ball home but failed to make contact.
	   But there was still plenty to worry coach Mario Zagallo as
errors began to creep into the Brazilian midfield and defense as
half time neared.
	   Bebeto and team captain Dunga became involved in a heated
argument after the defending champions had been exposed by a
Moroccan raid and conceded a free kick just outside of their own
area.
	   Although they blocked the free kick, Brazil conceded another
corner and Said Chiba flicked a long-range header just wide of the
post.
	   But a second goal came with first half time running out, Cafu
breaking down the right and crossing low for the unmarked Rivaldo
to run the ball in from barely five meters for his sixth goal in a
Brazilian shirt.
	   Rivaldo was involved in the move that almost brought a third
goal only two minutes into the second half. The Barcelona forward
swung in a cross from the left directly onto the head of Bebeto
whose firm header was held by the diving Driss Benzekri just inside
his right hand post.
	   But the third goal came two minutes later when Ronaldo won the
ball wide on the left and slipped past two defenders with a magical
change of pace and mesmerizing footwork.
	   He drew goalkeeper Benzekri off his line and pulled the ball
across to Bebeto to slide the ball into an unguarded net.
	   Abdeljilil Hadda exposed more lapses in the Brazilian defense by
climbing above the lanky Junior Baiano and heading just wide. But
Ronaldo squandered a good chance to make it 4-0 when he fired wide
from 15 meters after a slick Brazilian move.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel, Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio (Doriva, 68th), Leonardo, Rivaldo (Denilson,
88th); Bebeto (Edmundo, 72nd), Ronaldo.
	   Morocco _ Driss Benzekri; Abdelilah Saber (Lahcen Abrami, 76th),
Youssef Rossi, Abdelkrim El Hadrioui, Noureddine Naybet; El
Moustafa Hadji, Said Chiba (Gharib Amzine, 76th), Youssef Chippo,

Brazil advances; fear of violence in Toulouse; Iranians protest

film &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Brazil-Morocco &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ For the second straight World Cup, Brazil has
become the first team to advance past the first round.
	   Once again, the Brazilians got there with a match to spare,
winning their second in as many games at France '98 by rolling past
Morocco 3-0 Tuesday night at Nantes.
	   While the defending champions are headed to the second round,
Scotland is moving on to its next game at Saint-Etienne with a
purpose after a 1-1 draw with Norway. A loss would have eliminated
Scottish hopes of making the second round.
	   And, in more disconcerting travel news, English fans are on
their way to Toulouse under the watchful eyes of French police, who
want to deter the kind of violence that erupted around England's
first game against Tunisia in Marseille.
	   Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Bebeto scored the goals as Morocco was
clearly outclassed by Brazil, which beat Scotland 2-1 in the
tournament's opening game a week ago. Brazil's final first-round
game, against Norway in Marseille on June 23, will be meaningful
only for the Norwegians, who have two draws in two games and will
need other results to fall their way if they don't pull the major
upset.
	   Norway would be in a more comfortable situation were it not for
Scotland's Craig Burley, who scored only his second goal in 25
international appearances to tie their game in Bordeaux in the 66th
minute. Havard Flo's header had given Norway the lead 30 seconds
into the second half.
	   When Scotland and Morocco at Saint-Etienne play next week, both
will almost certainly need to win and get some help from the
Brazil-Norway game. Scotland, in its eighth Cup appearance, has
never advanced past the first round.
	   ``We're desperately disappointed that we didn't win the match,''
said Scotland manager Craig Brown, whose gamble paid off when he
moved Burley to a central midfield position in the second half.
``Only one point in two games is not too pleasing for us.''
	   Meanwhile, courts in the southern resort of Marseille dealt
swiftly and harshly with hooligans detained after three days of
violence surrounding England's 2-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday.
Now, Toulouse, about 400 kilometers (240 miles) to the west, was
bracing for England's match with Romania next Monday.
	   About 1,000 English fans were already reported in the city,
prompting officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July
11. They also considered closing bars early.
	   ``This is a shame,'' said Michel Delord, who owns a snack bar
next to the stadium in Toulouse. ``We had a great day with the
Austrian fans last week. They were full of beer, but polite. It's a
shame that the English don't know how to restrain themselves.''
	   In Marseille, 25 suspects _ 18 French, six English and a
Tunisian _ remained held for questioning for the violence. The
city's deputy mayor called for England to be kicked out of the
World Cup, a suggestion rejected by FIFA.
	   ``There is no discussion of England being disqualified,'' the
world federation's spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``There is no
discussion of England being banned from the World Cup in 2002'' or
from bidding for the 2006 games.
	   Late Monday, a court convicted and sentenced three Englishmen to
three months in prison. Five English and three French suspects were
given a trial date of July 17, five days after the World Cup ends.
	   Officials were also dealing with fans in Bordeaux, where
Scotland played Norway. Police rounded up 58 ticketless Scots
before the game. They were fed and placed in a hall to watch the
match on TV, then were to be loaded on their bus and escorted out
of town.
	   An entirely different kind of controversy was brewing in the
Iranian team's camp, where officials are incensed over the showing
of an unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV.
	   ``Not Without My Daughter,'' which stars Sally Field and
portrays Iranians as dirty, boorish, cruel and obsessed with their
Islamic religion and its attitudes toward women, was screened on
France's privately owned channel M6 late Monday.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' Safaei
Farahani, head of Iran's soccer federation, told The Associated
Press. ``We hold the French government responsible for allowing the
screening of the film, and will register our severe protest.''
	   Iranian forward Khodadad Azizi took off the yellow cap given by
the French Organizing Committee, and pointed to its ``Fair Play''
logo.
	   ``Is the showing of this movie, which is an insult to our
people, fair play,'' asked Azizi. ``Fair play is not limited to the
field. The French organizers must ensure fair play off the field as
well. I'm not going to wear this cap again.''
	   Farahani submitted a written protest to the World Cup organizing
committee and to FIFA. ``I'm waiting for an answer,'' he said.

Rwanda sentences three people to death for 1994 genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A Rwandan court on Tuesday convicted 10
people for their involvement in Hutu-organized massacres in 1994,
the Rwanda News Agency reported.
	   Three of those convicted were sentenced to death, six others to
life in prison and one received 15 years. One of the suspects was
acquitted, according to the agency.
	   The group was charged last month in the southwestern town of
Cyangugu with crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, theft,
burglary and destruction of property during the massacres.
	   At least 500,000 people were killed in Rwanda over a three-month
period in 1994, most of them minority Tutsis slaughtered by Hutus.
The massacres ended when Tutsi soldiers won power in July 1994. The
first genocide trials opened two years later.
	   A total of 130,000 genocide suspects have been imprisoned, many
without formal charges. Around 350 have been convicted. A third of
those were sentenced to death, with the first 22 executed by firing
squad on April 24. Most others received prison sentences and a
small number were acquitted.
	   Justice officials say the first public executions prompted more
than 4,000 suspects to confess to the crimes in exchange for
leniency. Under a 1996 genocide law, those who merely followed
orders to kill are eligible for lesser prison sentences if they
implicate and help convict the leaders and organizers of the
killings.
	   Also Tuesday, the prosecutor in Gisenyi, 110 kilometers (65
miles) northwest of capital Kigali asked for life sentences for 10
genocide suspects who appeared in the court.
	   Separately, the U.N. tribunal for Rwanda has been trying
genocide suspects in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. So far,
36 suspects have been indicted, 24 of them in the tribunal's
custody. Four are standing trial, and one has pleaded guilty to
genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   Earlier this month, authorities in the West African countries of
Benin, Togo, Mali and Ivory Coast arrested six Rwandans in
connection with the slaughter to be transferred to Arusha.

UNITA detains, then frees, UN civilian police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Angola's former UNITA rebels detained but
later released two U.N. civilian police in an area from which U.N.
personnel had been evacuated for fear of new fighting, a U.N.
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   U.N. spokesman Juan-Carlos Brandt said UNITA fighters refused to
allow the two police observers to leave their headquarters for
several hours Tuesday in the town of Cazombo in eastern Angola.
	   Brandt said most U.N. personnel had been evacuated from nearby
Luau on Monday for fear of a UNITA attack. The U.N. employees
crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo with their
communications equipment.
	   The incident occurred four days after the Security Council
decided unanimously to impose new sanctions on UNITA, banning its
diamond exports and freezing its overseas bank accounts.
	   The measures take effect June 25 unless UNITA has complied with
all terms of the 1994 peace accord by June 23.
	   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
has stalled on fulfilling several key conditions of the peace
accord, including handing over key areas of the country to
government control.
	   U.N. officials also claim UNITA is secretly retaining an armed
capability, despite the movement's denials.

Bowman on verge of record-tying eighth Stanley Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Even with a record-tying eighth Stanley Cup
coaching victory within his grasp, Detroit Red Wings coach Scotty
Bowman wasn't changing his routine on Tuesday morning.
	   Everything was going by the book. Pre-game skate at 10 a.m., a
team meeting and some videos about three hours later and then the
usual pre-game schedule to get ready for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup
Finals against the Washington Capitals.
	   There is a reason Bowman is the National Hockey League's
winningest coach and that he is on the verge of tying Toe Blake of
Montreal for most Cup coaching wins. He leaves nothing to chance,
even with a 3-0 lead in the best-of-7 series.
	   ``He teaches things that make you a winner,'' Red Wings
associate coach Barry Smith said. ``You learn details, the
defensive side of the puck, don't cheat the game, play hard both
ways, short shifts, a team mentality, and those kinds of things,
Things that will help you win because that takes care of almost all
situations.''
	   Bowman's record is all about winning. The Hall of Fame coach has
a 1,057-484-277 mark in 26 seasons and a 193-112 record in the
playoffs, winning five titles with Montreal and one apiece with
Pittsburgh and Detroit.
	   ``It's quite a remarkable accomplishment, especially in this day
and age,'' added Dave Lewis, Bowman's other top assistant. ``He is
such a student of the game and such a student of the history of the
game. He has his finger into every aspect of the game, that's just
his nature.''
	   While Capitals coach Ron Wilson has gotten most of the credit in
this series for his ability to motivate, Bowman's players said
their 64-year-old coach knows how to get the most out of his
players.
	   ``I think he goes his own way,'' young Swedish defenseman Anders
Eriksson said. ``He has his own ideas and he really makes players
be on the edge all the time, so they do their best and play as a
team. He would rather have a lot of guys contribute rather than a
few individuals. That's our strength.''
	   Veteran defenseman Jamie Macoun said that when Bowman speaks,
players listen.
	   ``He has an overview of the game that many of the coaches don't
have or haven't acquired yet,'' Macoun said. ``He knows what he is
doing and whether you agree with him or not, you know Scotty knows
what he is doing.''
	   Bowman has one year left on his contract. During the past week,
he has hinted that he might consider his coaching future after the
season, but he said the same things before Detroit won the Cup last
year.
	   ``I have no idea,'' Smith said when asked if Bowman would
return. ``Every year is a different story.''
	   This story could have the same ending though, another
championship.

Bulls party one more time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Michael Jordan sure knows how to make a party.
	   With tens of thousands of Chicago Bulls fans chanting ``One More
Year, One More Year,'' Jordan leaned into the microphones, flashed
that famous grin and said the words an entire city was hoping to
hear.
	   ``My heart, my soul and my love has always gone to the city of
Chicago, and no matter what happens, my heart, my soul and my love
will still be in the city of Chicago,'' he said as the crowd
roared.
	   ``I just hope and pray that we can have the opportunity once
again to share this type of enjoyment in the city of Chicago.''
	   In what's become practically an annual event, the Bulls and
their fans gathered Tuesday at Grant Park for a citywide
celebration of another National Basketball Association
championship. The six gold trophies were there, with Toni Kukoc
carrying the newest one. Fans camped out overnight just to make
sure they'd get up close to the NBA champs, who beat the Utah Jazz
on Sunday for their sixth title. The park was filled with a sea of
red and black T-shirts and jerseys.
	   But this was no ordinary lovefest.
	   Coach Phil Jackson and Scottie Pippen have said repeatedly that
this championship run was their ``Last Dance,'' and Jordan has yet
to make up his mind about his future. Dennis Rodman wants to come
back, but only if Jackson, Pippen and Jordan do. Six others on
Chicago's 12-man playoff roster also are free agents.
	   ``This was our last dance, and it was a wonderful waltz,''
Jackson said. ``Thank you all.''
	   ``It's been a great run. Thank you for our last dance,'' Pippen
said, drawing a few boos from the crowd.
	   Boos usually are reserved for Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and
general manager Jerry Krause, whom most fans blame for a breakup
that's been in the making for three years. But neither Reinsdorf
nor Krause was introduced.
	   In fact, they stayed out of the crowd's sight for the half-hour
rally. If Jackson hadn't acknowledged the two, no one would have
even known they were there.
	   ``About a year ago this last month, Jerry Reinsdorf called me
and asked me did I think we could do it again. I said yes. ... I
thank him for that opportunity. Thank you, Jerry. And I want to
thank Jerry Krause for giving us the opportunity to do it,''
Jackson said, prompting a loud chorus of boos from the crowd and
laughter from Jordan and Pippen.
	   His Airness and his sidekick found plenty more to giggle at,
too. There was Bill Wennington and his video camera, which he had
in tow throughout the NBA Finals. There was Steve Kerr, who
replayed Jordan's game-winning shot _ and his pass that set it up.
	   And then there was Rodman.
	   ``I've always said I'm never, ever getting married again. I'll
never have another wife,'' he said, grinning and then pausing as if
the NBA's bad boy was about to make some big announcement. Or say
something provocative.
	   ``If I had to marry anybody, it'd be these 12 guys right here!''

Tehran mayor accuses court of extracting confessions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to move up that trial adjourned and UPDATE
with trial adjourned until later date to avoid conflict with World
Cup match. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor accused a judge of
improper questioning and giving credence to confessions extracted
under pressure on Tuesday, the third day of his trial on
allegations of corruption.
	   ``It's not fair that you are interrupting me. Why are you not
allowing me to defend myself?'' Gholamhossein Karbaschi asked the
judge in the packed courtroom.
	   ``When your remarks are off the point, I will not allow you to
speak,'' replied Judge Hojatoleslam Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei,
who became visibly irritated when, as in the previous sessions,
Karbaschi adopted a confrontational attitude. ``I will not allow
you to discuss issues with me as you please. This is a courtroom,
and you are a defendant here.''
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-line
elements in the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with
moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran
Khatami's election campaign last year.
	   He was arrested April 4 on the orders of the chief justice, a
known hard-liner, on charges of embezzlement, fraud and
mismanagement of public funds. He was released on bail on the
orders of Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, after Karbaschi's
supporters took to the streets and clashed with security forces.
	   The judge adjourned the case until June 25, instead of Sunday as
planned, because Iran will be playing a World Cup match in France
against the United States that day.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.
	   The case has gripped the nation, generating hundreds of
newspaper stories about the mayor, who has been restricted by his
duties during the trial. The walls of Tehran are covered with
spray-painted graffiti for and against the mayor. ``Karbaschi must
be convicted,'' and ``Karbaschi is the hero of construction,'' are
among the slogans.
	   When the judge asked Karbaschi on Tuesday if money left the
city's coffers without documentation, the mayor said such a
question was improper for a judge.
	   ``I am the judge and, according to the rules of public courts, I
can also interrogate you,'' replied, Mohseni Ejaie, who at one
point, quoted incriminating confessions from former city council
employees interrogated in detention.
	   ``I do not accept anything written while these people were in
prison, under pressure,'' said Karbaschi, implying the confessions
were false.
	   ``You are making serious accusations against the court and
judiciary by implying the use of pressure against prisoners,'' the
judge said.
	   ``You are also making serious accusations against government
employees by calling us thieves,'' Karbaschi retorted.

Belarus president lashes out at U.S. Mideast policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus
criticized the United States and its allies Tuesday for a double
standard in dealing with the Middle East.
	   ``The United Nations adopted important resolutions concerning
the settlement in the Middle East but the United States and its
allies did not show real intention to implement them,'' he said in
a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Egypt.
	   Lukashenko met with President Hosni Mubarak during the visit.
	   The two countries signed an agreement to establish a company to
promote trade and to build a factory to assemble tractors in Egypt.

Stanford reunion at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON SIRAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ They looked like three college kids playing
a fun round of golf. The laughter and words flowed easily. Poor
shots were greeted by put-down lines.
	   In many ways, it was just like all those rounds Tiger Woods,
Casey Martin and Joel Kribel played at The Olympic Club when they
were students at Stanford.
	   The only difference was that this was a practice round for the
U.S. Open.
	   Kribel, at 21 the youngest of the three, tried a chip from the
back of the three-tier seventh green Tuesday morning, and no sooner
had the ball landed than Woods said ``bye,'' laughing as the ball
rolled off the green.
	   When Woods tried a chip from the thick, greenside rough at No. 9
and went completely under the ball without moving it, all three
made eye contact then dissolved in laughter.
	   On the ninth fairway, the bushy mustache of Woods' caddie, Mike
``Fluff'' Cowan,'' was likened to the rear end of a yak. Woods and
his coach, Butch Harmon, were laughing so hard Kribel had to back
away from his shot.
	   ``Is this how he wins all those tournaments?'' Kribel shouted,
referring to the distraction.
	   Kribel, who was using his red Stanford Cardinal golf bag, then
hacked his ball out of the wet rough and applauded in genuine
admiration when Martin hit his approach shot within 3 feet (0.9
meters) of the hole.
	   It was as if this were homecoming day, except they were coming
home to play in one of the game's most important tournaments.
	   ``I played here nearly every Monday when I was at Stanford,''
said Woods, who would have graduated this year if he had not quit
school before his junior year to turn pro. ``It was either here or
at San Francisco Country Club.''
	   There was one other reminder that this was different from one of
those rounds in college. The most famous fragile right leg in golf
has been further weakened by circulatory problem, and Martin's
reliance on a golf cart is now constant.
	   As the threesome moved down No. 6, about 20 people _ including
coaches, family members, tournament officials and security
personnel _ milled in the middle of the fairway.
	   Emerging from the small crowd was a green single-person cart
carrying Martin. The company that makes the cart was quite
appropriate.
	   There, emblazoned on the front and again on the rear of the
battery operated vehicle were the words ``PRIDE Cars.''
	   If there is one thing Martin is all about it is pride _ pride
not in beating the PGA Tour in court to win the right to use a
cart, but pride in making it to the tournament he fantasized
playing in while hitting Whiffle balls in his back yard as a kid.
	   It was a dream that almost became a nightmare.
	   Martin nearly didn't get to the U.S. Open, making a double bogey
on the final hole of his 36-hole sectional qualifier.
	   ``He thought he had let his dream tournament slip away,''
Cameron Martin, 28, said about his 26-year-old brother. ``It showed
what he is all about that he could do what he did.''

Fighting wracks Bissau, neighboring Senegal launches attack

<TEXT>
	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ Heavy artillery crashed
across the border Tuesday into neighboring Guinea-Bissau, where the
aftermath of an army mutiny has left the capital in chaos with
thousands of people fleeing.
	   Senegal launched the cross-border attack to push back their own
separatist rebels who had taken safe haven in the area and have
reportedly aligned themselves with Guinea-Bissau's coup leader
Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   Shorts bursts of machine gun fire echoed across the dusty, red
countryside just kilometers (miles) from the border. Heavier
weapons fire crashed in the distance, while a Senegalese
prop-engine spotter plane buzzed overhead.
	   Fighting near the border _ not uncommon in this
rebellion-wracked region _ this time seemed to indicate an
escalation of the conflict that began in Guinea-Bissau's capital of
Bissau 10 days earlier, Senegalese military officers said.
	   The Senegalese rebels have reported ties with Guinea-Bissau army
renegades who have been holed up in a garrison since beginning the
uprising about a week ago.
	   ``We had been expecting the rebels to step up their fighting
here to coincide with the war in Guinea-Bissau,'' said a senior
commander speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   A United Nations refugee agency official expressed fears that
innocent refugees would get caught in the cross-fire.
	   UNHCR spokesman Khassim Diagne said about 5,000 Senegalese
refugees who fled the 15-year-old civil war in Senegal's southern
Casamance province were vulnerable to border attacks aimed at
rebels.
	   ``In the past, there have been attempts to move the refugees
further inland (into Guinea-Bissau) but these have failed,'' Diagne
said in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
	   In Bissau, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the
border fighting, loyalist government troops and rebels continued to
trade mortar fire, while the onset of the rainy season increased
fears of disease for the tens of thousands of people fleeing the
capital of the former Portuguese colony.
	   Loyalist forces maintained their siege of a military garrison in
a suburb of Bissau where mutineers have been holed up since June 7.
	   ``The shelling is still serious,'' Michael Kleiner of the
International Red Cross said in Geneva.
	   Bissau, a city of some 300,000 people, was deserted, Kleiner
said.
	   The Senegalese commander said his country sent several truck
convoys with troops into Guinea-Bissau in support of President Joao
Bernardo Vieira.
	   The Republic of Guinea, south Guinea-Bissau, was also sending
troops to support the beleagured government in Bissau, although
unconfirmed reports from refugees and Senegal's military said some
Guinean soldiers had taken sides with the renegades.
	   Also Tuesday, the rebels said in a radio broadcast that even if
they were dislodged from their positions in the capital, they would
wage a guerilla war from the bush, according to reports.
	   The rebels said on a Bissau radio station they captured last
week that they would target Senegalese soldiers and aid the
separatist movement in the Casamance region of southern Senegal,
television channel S.I.C. reported from the city.
	   If accurate, the reports indicate an escalation of the attempted
conflict to involve three West African countries fueled by years of
simmering enmities.
	   Mane, who was fired from Guinea-Bissau's military in January for
allegedly running guns to Senegal's separatist forces, has suffered
poor relations with Senegal's government forces. Guinea-Bissau and
Senegal fought brief clashes in 1990 over offshore oil exploration
rights.
	   Fighting in Bissau triggered a mass exodus of refugees leaving
by ship and on foot.
	   Portuguese forces on Tuesday evacuated more than 400 foreigners,
mostly Portuguese, Brazilians and French nationals, from Bissau
without incident, chief of Portugal's armed forces, Gen. Espirito
Santo, said at a Lisbon news conference.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside Bissau. A
Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau, reported more than 150,000 refugees in the
area.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Jeromy Burnitz, John Jaha and Jose Valentin all
homered Tuesday as Milwaukee used a 16-hit attack to batter Chicago
11-2, ending a 10-game home winning streak for the Cubs.
	   Brad Woodall (3-2) held the Cubs scoreless into the seventh
inning, allowing four hits with four strikeouts and one walk. He
also helped the Brewers' attack with three hits and a walk and
scored twice.
	   Milwaukee scored six runs in the sixth inning to seal the win.
	   Kevin Foster, relieving Steve Trachsel (6-3), faced four batters
and all got hits. Valentin ripped his 10th home run and fourth in
the last four games, to score Marquis Grissom, who doubled, for a
6-0 lead.

World Cup: Brazil takes Morocco to school

 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ The defending World Cup champions had
gotten an earful about Morocco's ``Brazilian-style'' soccer. So
Ronaldo and Co. went out and showed the disciples how it's done.
	   With art and cool efficiency, Brazil dispatched the Atlas Lions
3-0 Tuesday night to clinch first place in Group A with six points.
Norway, which tied Scotland 1-1 earlier Tuesday, has two points,
while Morocco and Scotland have one.
	   Ronaldo, who had done everything but score in a 2-1 win over
Scotland, broke the ice in the ninth minute for his first World Cup
goal and set up Bebeto for the third at the 49th. But that hardly
measured the torment he caused the Lions' defense with a variety of
dribbles, passes and near-misses.
	   Two games, two wins, a berth in the second round. What else
could Brazil ask for? Defensive consistency? Showtime? They got
that, too.
	   After working all week on coverage, the Brazilian defense
stiffened and kept the agile Moroccan strikers out of the danger
zone. Goalie Taffarel didn't make a save all night.
	   The Brazilian party started early at Beaujoire stadium in this
northwestern river port. The 40,000 fans were a festival of
Brazil's green-and-yellow jerseys, face paint and glitter wigs,
daubed with splashes of Moroccan red.
	   What would be a long evening for the Lions began in the second
minute, when Rivaldo sent Leonardo in on a breakaway, but his
apparent goal was called back for offside.
	   Five minutes later, Rivaldo tried to catch goalie Driss Benzekri
napping with a long shot from midfield, a goal he had made for FC
Barcelona. This one went high.
	   But in the ninth minute, Rivaldo found Ronaldo streaking up the
middle. The two-time FIFA Player of the Year took a step and
drilled a right-footed shot past the diving Benzekri to make it
1-0.
	   The Lions defense tried every way to shut down Ronaldo, even
physically. in the 18th minute, Said Chiba came in cleats high,
tearing Ronaldo's shorts and leaving an ugly bruise on his left
thigh. But Russian referee Nikolai Levnikov let him off with a
warning.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo refused to comment on the
violence.
	   ``That's FIFA's problem,'' he said.
	   Morocco's pony-tailed star El Moustafa Hadji was in the middle
of some deft footwork, charging up the wings and testing the
center. But their shots invariably went high or wide.
	   Meanwhile, Rivaldo and Leonardo drew little attention from the
Moroccan defenders and settled nicely into the role of playmakers.
	   Abdeljilil Hadda got yellow-carded in the 31st minute for
stepping on Cafu's foot.
	   Five minutes later it was Brazil's Cesar Sampaio who drew a
yellow, his second of the Cup, and misses the game against Norway
as a result. That set up a free kick near the penalty area, but
Chiba's shot hit the wall.
	   It was injury time when Bebeto found Cafu open on the right
wing, and he sent a cross to Rivaldo that struck Benzekri's arm
before going in for a 2-0 lead.
	   In the second period, Bebeto took over.
	   In the 47th minute he slipped between two defenders for a
testing header that Benzreki picked off in the corner.
	   Three minutes later, defender Abdelilah Saber stepped on the
ball and Ronaldo picked it off. He blew in from the left side,
stitter-stepped around a defender and fed Bebeto for the tap-in.
	   After that, it was showtime.
	   Rivaldo opened with a behind the back pass, and Cafu samba'd
over the ball before a perplexed defender. The highlight was a
Rivaldo-to-Ronaldo-to-Bebeto gem that was cleared at the last
minute, but the crowd roared its appreciation.
	   Doriva, making his World Cup debut, replaced Sampaio in the 68th
minute, and four miniutes later Edmundo came in for Bebeto.
	   Morocco then sent in Lahcen Abrami and Gharib Amzine for Saber
and Chiba in the 76th minute. Amzine would have Morocco's best
chance on a feed from Hadji, but his shot from outside the area
went high.
	   In the final minutes, Denilson replaced Rivaldo and Ali El
Khattabu came in for Hadda. Junior Baiano drew a yellow card for a
rough tackle.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel, Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio (Doriva, 68th), Leonardo, Rivaldo (Denilson,
88th); Bebeto (Edmundo, 72nd), Ronaldo.

Supreme Court rejects petition to stop Jewish housing project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Supreme Court rejected a petition
Tuesday by Palestinians who claimed that an Israeli housing project
for Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem discriminates against
them as Arabs, a court official said.
	   The 30 petitioners from the villages of Umm Toubah and Beit
Sahour, which border the construction site on a disputed east
Jerusalem hilltop known as Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim
in Arabic.
	   Israel's announcement in March 1997 to build 650 homes there for
Jews touched off rioting and brought an impasse in
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations which still remains.
	   Supreme Court spokesman Moshe Gorali said the court rejected the
petition because the Israeli government had granted local Arabs
building privileges on land near the building site.
	   Israel captured the hilltop along with the rest of the West bank
and east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. It later
annexed east Jerusalem, claiming sovereignty over the area and has
encouraged Jews to move into those areas.
	   In an effort to restart peace talks, the United States has asked
Israel for a time-out in settlement construction. Preparatory work
at the site has been completed but Israel has delayed the next step
of advertising construction bids, apparently seeking to avoid
conflict with Washington and further complicate Israeli-Palestinian
relations.

Caricom plans cultural festivities to mark 25th anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The Caribbean Community is planning a
series of cultural ``theme nights'' to celebrate the trade group's
25th anniversary during a summit this month, organizers said
Wednesday.
	   The summit, which will feature a visit from South African
President Nelson Mandela, will commemorate the 1973 treaty that
called for a common market between English-speaking countries of
the Caribbean.
	   Literary, musical, sports and media theme nights will feature
celebrities from those fields. Concerts will feature Trinidadian
calypso singers The Mighty Sparrow and Lord Kitchener, and Jamaican
reggae artists Culture, Marcia Griffiths and Beres Hammond will
also perform.
	   Plays ranging from 16th century works to a drama by St. Lucian
Derek Walcott, who won the Nobel Prize in 1992, will be presented.
	   The Caribbean Community originally included only Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Barbados. Antigua and Barbuda,
Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, St. Lucia, Belize, Bahamas and Montserrat later joined
the group.

Ethiopia dismisses Eritrean interpretation of air strike moratorium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite a moratorium on air strikes,
Ethiopia warned Tuesday that the border crisis with Eritrea is
``worsening by the day'' and repeated demands the Eritreans
withdraw from contested territory.
	   Leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed late Sunday to halt the
use of air strikes in their border war after President Clinton
spoke by telephone with them separately.
	   The White House said the moratorium ``can help restore the
mutual confidence necessary to achieve a peaceful resolution of the
conflict as quickly as possible.'' Eritrea welcomed the air-strike
ban as a first step toward meeting its call for a halt to
hostilities.
	   In a statement issued by the Ethiopian Mission to the United
Nations, the Ethiopians said the suspension of air attacks ``is not
by any stretch of the imagination a positive and first step toward
ending the war as the Eritrean authorities would like the
international community to believe.''
	   ``The Foreign Ministry of the Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia, therefore, wishes to reiterate that the crisis between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, far from showing any sign of improvement, is
in fact worsening by the day,'' the statement said.
	   Ethiopia called on the international community ``to convey a
clear message'' to Eritrea to withdraw from the disputed territory.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea have battled since early May over several
stretches of their common border with the loss of hundreds of
lives. No skirmishes have been reported since Thursday.
	   Ethiopia has insisted that Eritrea withdraw its troops from more
than a half-dozen disputed areas, the largest being the 260-square
kilometer (160-square-mile) Yirga triangle _ before peace talks can
begin.
	   Eritrea has refused, claiming it owns the disputed territory,
based on boundaries drawn by Italy when it occupied the country in
1885.

Musicians argue for an end to boycott of Wagner's music
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo JRL103 &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Conductors and musicians told parliament
Tuesday the time has come to end Israel's 50-year de facto ban on
the music of Richard Wagner, a virulent anti-Semite and Adolf
Hitler's favorite composer.
	   Holocaust survivors pleaded for keeping the ban, arguing that
the operas so closely associated with the Nazi horrors should
remain off Israel's airwaves and out of its concert halls.
	   ``Please do it later, in the next generation,'' said lawmaker
Shevah Weiss, who spent part of his childhood in a cramped basement
hiding from storm troopers in Nazi-occupied Poland.
	   The new debate over Wagner's music reflects the conflicting
realities of Israeli-German relations.
	   On the one hand, Germany is a key trading partner and ally of an
increasingly isolated Israel. Israelis drive Volkswagen cars,
vacation in German resorts and stage joint military maneuvers with
the German army on Israeli soil. Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' is now
treated as just another historical document, studied by students at
Hebrew University.
	   At the same time, aging Holocaust survivors are becoming
increasingly insistent on speaking out about their experiences in
the camps, breaking a silence forced on them after World War II by
a young Israel unwilling to hear about Jews as victims.
	   The hundreds of thousands of survivors living in Israel carry a
great moral weight, and there is a broad consensus in the country
that they should be spared further pain and suffering.
	   Wagner's music still evokes strong feelings among survivors. The
19th-century composer's works were often played during Nazi rallies
_ and later in Nazi death camps. Wagner was part of the repertoire
Jewish inmates were forced to play in orchestras set up by their
tormentors.
	   An informal boycott of Wagner's works has been observed in
Israel since its founding in 1948. The state-run classical music
station plays the occasional passage from a Wagner opera, but never
a complete work. Wagner's compositions are not performed by the
renowned Israel Philharmonic Orchestra or the New Israeli Opera,
both subsidized by public funds.
	   Asher Fisch, the music director of the New Israeli Opera, said
playing Wagner was a symbol of Jewish survival rather than of
acquiescence to the composer's beliefs.
	   Yaacov Mishori, the lead violinist for the Israeli Philharmonic,
told parliament's Education Committee that while no one should be
forced to hear Wagner's works, there was room for special concerts
for those who wanted the freedom to hear the music.
	   The hearing was intended only as a forum for public debate;
legislators plan no official action on the ban.
	   Musicians have tried from time to time to break it. In 1981,
conductor Zubin Mehta announced as an encore to an Israel
Philharmonic concert the prelude to the Wagner opera ``Tristan and
Isolde.'' The audience cried ``Shame!'' and an usher rushed to the
stage, pulling up his shirt to show Nazi-inflicted scars.
	   Last week, Fisch tried to gauge sentiments with a symposium on
``Wagner, Artist or Symbol.'' The debate turned emotional, with
audience members shouting down a singer and pianist who tried to
perform a sample Wagner piece.
	   But Fisch was not deterred, saying he believed a majority wanted
to hear Wagner's works.
	   The opera has begun sending questionnaires to subscribers. Fisch
said that if he gets at least 80 percent support, he will override
the objections of the minority.
	   Legislator Zvi Weinberg, who wrote a book on modern
anti-Semitism, said Wagner's operas were filled with anti-Semitic
themes and that the composer was instrumental in creating the
culture that inspired the Nazi ideology of racial supremacy.
	   The most emotional appeal was made by Weiss, the Holocaust
survivor.
	   Looking directly at Fisch and banging his fist on the table,
Weiss said he couldn't understand the urgency to perform music that
still caused pain to so many.
	   Fisch said politicians often spoke for the survivors without
knowing how they felt. ``I know many more people who think that by
playing Wagner we actually triumph and show our survival, our
cultural and spiritual strength,'' he said.

Mexico negotiating team tries to make contact with Zapatistas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) _ Seeking to restart stalled peace
talks, a group of legislators visited a Chiapas jungle village
Tuesday, hoping to persuade Zapatista rebels to ``break the
silence.''
	   The legislators, members of a multi-party mediation commission
known by the Spanish acronym Cocopa, arrived in La Realidad, a
village that commanders of the Zapatista National Liberation Front
often use for public appearances.
	   ``We came to La Realidad ... because we know that violence isn't
the way to resolve the controversies,'' German Martinez Caceres, a
deputy from the opposition National Action Party, told the
government news agency Notimex.
	   ``We believe the government should be prudent and the
(Zapatistas) should break the silence,'' said Caceres, who holds
the commission's rotating presidency.
	   The Zapatista rebels, who staged a brief uprising in January
1994 in the name of Indian rights and greater democracy, broke off
peace talks with the government two years ago, claiming it had
failed to abide by a preliminary agreement.
	   The government repeatedly has called on the Zapatistas to resume
negotiations, even as it has stepped up pressure on the rebels. A
clash last week between Zapatistas and government forces killed 10
people.
	   The 13 commission members planned to spend 24 hours in La
Realidad, 140 kilometers (85 miles) southeast of San Cristobal de
las Casas, and another village, Guadalupe Tepeyac.
	   On Wednesday, they will meet with Archbishop Samuel Ruiz, who
was the main negotiator in the conflict before resigning this month
under government pressure.
	   On Thursday, the commission will visit El Bosque, where eight
villagers and two police officers died when hundreds of police and
soldiers tried to dissolve a pro-Zapatista town council and arrest
15 suspects.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the governor of
Chiapas said the raid averted an even deadlier clash between rival
communities.
	   Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen said Monday that the government was
trying to re-establish ``the rule of law'' and that the huge number
of security forces were needed because ambushes and killings are
common in the region.
	   The operation was prompted by the shooting of five farmers from
another village in which one man died. The governor said the
government feared retaliation if it didn't act.
	   It was the third time recently that hundreds of troops and
police have raided areas in Chiapas to arrest Zapatista supporters
who have set up shadow governments that challenge state authority.
	   Critics claim that state officials have failed to act against
pro-government vigilante groups accused of killing dozens of people
and expelling Zapatista supporters from their communities. One such
group, aided by at least some soldiers and police, massacred 45
people in the hamlet of Acteal in December.
	   ``The government of the state of Chiapas has not had complete
information nor legal foundation that would permit it to
prosecute'' such groups, other than those accused at Acteal, the
governor said.
	   Albores Guillen indicated that the government has not begun
investigating claims that police and soldiers looted homes of
villagers in El Bosque or that it mistreated prisoners.

One prisoner freed, but Nigeria awaits word on others
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S. comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The first of nine prominent political
prisoners ordered freed by Nigeria's military leaders arrived home
Tuesday, but Nigerians were still waiting for word about the
others.
	   ``My detention was extremely tough,'' Olabintan Durojaiye told
reporters after he went to church in the capital, Lagos. ``I was
never tortured but isolated. I was not allowed access to any book
but the Holy Bible.''
	   Durojaiye, a lawyer and critic of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen.
Sani Abacha, was thrown behind bars last year without charges or
trial. Authorities never even interrogated him during his
imprisonment, he said, declining to comment further.
	   Abacha died of a heart attack last week.
	   Nigeria's new military ruler Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar on Monday
ordered that nine prisoners be immediately released.
	   Besides Durojaiye, though, none of the others were known to be
free by Tuesday evening. The seven men and one woman were being
held in prisons spread across the sprawling West African country
and their status was not completely clear.
	   Those ordered released include Nigeria's former state leader
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who voluntarily relinquished his three-year
presidency in 1979 and became a vocal critic of Abacha, who took
power in a bloodless coup in 1993. Obasanjo was serving a 15-year
prison term.
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry released
a statement Tuesday applauding the announcement.
	   ``We hope this action will lead to the unconditional release of
all political prisoners and detainees, and will help all Nigerians
come together to work in support of a credible and open transition
to civilian democratic government,'' McCurry said in the statement.
	   The release came as Nigeria's largest pro-democracy group, the
National Democratic Coalition, accepted an invitation from Abubakar
to enter into dialogue. Abubakar made a general invitation to all
Nigerians to work with his government in his maiden speech a week
ago.
	   ``It is our view that this will calm frayed nerves and ease
tensions,'' the group said in a statement that urged Abubakar to
release all remaining political prisoners, abolish
government-approved parties and nullify all local and regional
elections held during Abacha's flawed transition to democracy
program.
	   It also called for a government of national unity to be formed
under Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of presidential elections
in 1993. Abiola, who was jailed in 1994 and remains the nation's
most prominent detainee, was not among those ordered free Monday.
	   The other prisoners include labor leaders, opposition activists,
journalists and other Abacha foes.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Every morning, battered tankers rumble
into quiet walled compounds in the wealthy neighborhoods of this
seaside city, dispensing thousands of gallons of water for rich
businessmen, diplomats and members of the ruling junta.
	   In a city where the water supply can be even less predictable
than the haphazard electricity, it's the only way to ensure a bath.
	   Lagos is beyond breakdown. Electricity stays off in some
neighborhoods for weeks at a time, universities are besieged by
violent, well-armed student groups. Small mountains of garbage bury
entire street corners and gasoline is desperately scarce _ even
though Nigeria is one of the world's top oil producers. The police
are better known for demanding bribes than for stopping the city's
rampant crime.
	   But suddenly, there's reason to hope. The five-year dictatorship
of Gen. Sani Abacha ended last week with his death and the new
military leader has ordered some of Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoners freed. It may not mean the power will be
switched on any time soon, but at least there are signs of change.
	   ``I'm on the moon without riding on Sputnik,'' raved Gani
Fawehinmi, a Lagos attorney and activist, after the nine prisoners
were ordered released Monday.
	   Fawehinmi _ normally given to scathing criticism of the new
junta leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar _ quickly backed off from
his exaltation. He noted that dozens of political prisoners remain
in jail, including Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993's
annulled presidential elections.
	   Still, many people across this city of 10 million are hoping
Abubakar will bring change. He has a reputation for honesty, for
wanting to bring honor back to Nigeria's military.
	   ``We are expecting (Abubakar) to do well,'' said Ahmed Hakeem.
He makes a living hand-pushing a rusting, six-seat ferris wheel at
Lagos' Lekki Beach, where a rusting shipwreck hulks above people
playing in polluted surf.
	   Lagos is a crowded, tumble-down city full of modern office
buildings and rancid slums, but a place where even in the worst of
times people know how to enjoy themselves.
	   ``Lagos is everything _ positive and negative,'' laughed Taiwo
Adedaji, a law student standing under a shade tree at Lagos State
University.
	   The only people who manage to live easily are those who can
afford generators, black-market gasoline and guards. They live
behind walls, shop at stores packed with imported goods and eat at
fine restaurants.
	   Nigeria, which once swam to prosperity on a sea of oil profits,
has been drowning for years, pulled down by corruption and
mismanagement.
	   Abubakar has sent contradictory signals so far. Authorities
quashed pro-democracy demonstrations last week and he has vowed to
forge ahead with the highly flawed democratic transition program
begun under Abacha.
	   Some also fear the prisoner releases may be a smokescreen.
	   ``I'm obviously very happy,'' said Nike Ransome-Kuti, whose
father, activist Beko Ransome-Kuti, was among those ordered
released. ``But I'm taking the news with caution because I'd hate
to see something where he only releases a few people as a publicity
gimmick.''
	   Such skepticism is understandable in Lagos, a city often so
unlivable its residents quickly run out of adjectives trying to
describe it.
	   ``It's really bad,'' said Tokumbo Ogonlesi, a 46-year-old
caterer. She shakes her head: ``It's really bad, it's really bad.''
	   She is most terrified of the city's crime.
	   ``A chicken is more likely to go out and come home than a human
being,'' she said.
	   And yet perhaps the most surprising thing about Lagos is that
despite its mountain of difficulties, it still has fun. Nigerians
are crazy for music, voracious readers and avid movie-goers, and
Lagos is the cultural center of Africa's most populous country.
	   Publishers pump out hundreds of titles and gossipy newspapers
are filled with the loves of TV and movie stars. Nightclubs swell
with music lovers.
	   Some people even believe Lagos has found a hero: a bespectacled
colonel named Buba Marwa, the Lagos State military administrator.
	   Marwa's boosters say he has cut crime and punished corrupt cops.
Cynics say he has only made a dent in the enormous problems.
	   At least he's doing more than the federal government. One of
their contributions is ``sanitation day,'' a monthly Saturday
morning when everyone must stay in and clean house.
	   Anyone caught on the streets risks arrest.

	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The Caribbean Community is planning a
series of cultural ``theme nights'' to celebrate the trade group's
25th anniversary during a summit this month, organizers said
Tuesday.
	   The summit, which will feature a visit from South African
President Nelson Mandela, will commemorate the 1973 treaty that
called for a common market between English-speaking countries of
the Caribbean.
	   Literary, musical, sports and media theme nights will feature
celebrities from those fields. Concerts will feature Trinidadian
calypso singers The Mighty Sparrow and Lord Kitchener, and Jamaican
reggae artists Culture, Marcia Griffiths and Beres Hammond will
also perform.
	   Plays ranging from 16th century works to a drama by St. Lucian
Derek Walcott, who won the Nobel Prize in 1992, will be presented.
	   The Caribbean Community originally included only Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Barbados. Antigua and Barbuda,
Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, St. Lucia, Belize, Bahamas and Montserrat later joined
the group.

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling

	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward's mother Tuesday said it
was ``absolutely fantastic'' that her daughter would be coming home
at last after being convicted of killing a child in her care.
	   But Susan Woodward had nothing more to say to reporters, and the
reaction in the family's hometown was notably subdued after the
appeals court in Massachusetts cleared the way for Miss Woodward to
leave the United States.
	   The court upheld a ruling by the trial judge, Superior Court
Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that au pair Louise Woodward's sentence for
second-degree murder should be reduced to manslaughter and the
length of sentence to the time in prison she had already served.
	   ``I'm really pleased with the news, but I'm surprised, I thought
people would have been here in their thousands,'' said Thomas
Maddocks, 78, who found just a few drinkers at the Rigger pub,
which has served as headquarters for local supporters.
	   The pub had been packed on the October day when Miss Woodward
was convicted of killing an 8-month-old child in her care, Matthew
Eappen, and again on Nov. 10 when Woodward's sentence was reduced.
	   ``I can't understand it, everyone was here for the verdict and
for everything else. I suppose it's been going on for so long and
the final came and people had had enough,'' Maddocks said.
	   Although Mrs. Woodward had nothing more to say publicly, Paul
Barrow, an attorney for the family, read a statement to reporters.
	   ``Louise will continue to maintain her innocence and a statement
in fact has already been made by her American lawyers a short time
ago, stating the injustice that they consider she has suffered,''
Barrow said.
	   In Oxford, Barry Scheck, one of Miss Woodward's U.S. attorneys,
said the trial had been a ``terrible experience for all involved.''
	   ``This has been a tragic case from the beginning for the family
of Matthew Eappen, and for this young woman who was charged with a
crime that the scientific evidence I believe demonstrates she did
not commit,'' Scheck told a news conference.
	   ``The waiting was unbearable, but what was unbearable was being
in jail. It was very difficult. While she was waiting for the
verdict, everything she did was subjected to wall-to-wall publicity
and tabloid scrutiny,'' Scheck said.
	   Julie Smith, the landlady at Elton's Rigger pub, said she was
``pleased she's coming home and we'll take it from there.
	   ``We've not forgotten that a baby was killed. We've all got
children or grandchildren. I'm scared to say anything in case it
might get misconstrued,'' Mrs. Smith said.
	   ``We can hardly believe it, everyone as you can imagine is
absolutely over the moon,'' said Roy McCabe, a family friend.
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the trustees of the Louise
Woodward Appeal Fund, said he was relieved that the court had
finally made its decision.
	   ``We have still not got to lose sight of the fact that there is
a dead baby at the end of it and we still feel for the Eappen
family and their pain must be increased because of this verdict,''
Davey said.
	   Jean Antrobus, who stopped by at the Rigger, said the court's
ruling was ``brilliant news.''
	   ``I don't think the conviction should stand but at least it
means she's coming home,'' Mrs. Antrobus said.
	   ``She's only a girl herself. It doesn't alter the fact that
Matthew died and I feel very sorry for his parents, but it's time
that she came home and to put everything behind us.''
	   Ann Bradshaw of Elton said she was ``so glad it's all over'' for
the Woodwards.
	   ``In recent weeks it's got totally out of hand because it
dragged on so long,'' Mrs. Bradshaw said. ``Now everyone knows
where they stand and can get on with their lives.''
	   Gareth Jones, a supporter of Woodward's appeal fund, said people
in Elton had learned from the negative reaction to their jubilation
when Zobel reduced the sentence.
	   ``People think the best thing to do is keep a low profile and
rejoice in the fact that she's coming home. You don't need to jump
up and down, the freedom speaks for herself,'' Jones said.

Express derails in main north-south train link
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's main east coast railway line was blocked
Tuesday after part of a London to Edinburgh express train derailed.
Police said no one was seriously injured.
	   Passengers on the Great Northern and Eastern Railway's afternoon
express said the train was traveling fast near Sandy, in the
English Midlands, when it came to a shuddering halt. Transport
police said that the second to last carriage on the 10-car train
derailed.
	   ``The train was going at full pelt and suddenly it came to a
shuddering halt. I was toward the front of the train and we didn't
really feel anything,'' said Nizan Horsefield, 25.
	   Other passengers said that the rear carriages were left titling
to one side after the train stopped, although all the carriages
remained upright.
	   ``As we walked back down the track you could see that it had
damaged some of the concrete sleepers along the line. There was
quite a bit of damage,'' said attorney Richard Knaggs, another
passenger.
	   An ambulance service spokesman said that nine people had
suffered minor injuries, and about 400 people had been evacuated
from the train.

World Cup: Brazil takes Morocco to school
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional, updates with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ The defending World Cup champions had
gotten an earful about Morocco's ``Brazilian-style'' soccer. So
Ronaldo and Co. went out and showed the disciples how it's done.
	   With art and cool efficiency, Brazil dispatched the Atlas Lions
3-0 Tuesday night to clinch first place in Group A with six points.
Norway, which tied Scotland 1-1 earlier Tuesday, has two points,
while Morocco and Scotland have one.
	   Ronaldo, who had done everything but score in a 2-1 win over
Scotland, broke the ice in the ninth minute for his first World Cup
goal and set up Bebeto for the third at the 49th. But that hardly
measured the torment he caused the Lions' defense with a variety of
dribbles, passes and near-misses.
	   ``We played joyful, sparkling and efficient soccer,'' said coach
Mario Zagallo. ``I'm happy with everything _ the defense, the
midfield and the attack.''
	   Two games, two wins, a berth in the second round. What else
could Brazil ask for? Defensive consistency? Showtime? They got
that, too.
	   After working all week on coverage, the Brazilian defense
stiffened and kept the agile Moroccan strikers out of the danger
zone. Goalie Taffarel didn't make a save all night.
	   Despite the one-sided outcome, Zagallo had nothing but praise
for the Lions.
	   ``We didn't draw just any adversary,'' he said. ``Morocco is a
good team that knows how to play soccer. It might not qualify, but
it has every chance to take second in the group.''
	   Moroccan midfielder Moustafa El Hadgi hasn't given up.
	   ``There is still hope,'' he said. ``It will be difficult for
Norway to beat Brazil. We are going to concentrate our efforts on
Scotland.''
	   Coach Henri Michel admitted Morocco's fate was no longer in its
own hands.
	   ``Mathematically, it is still possible, but it wont be our
doing. It is something that will be decided after the games.
	   ``We have to be realistic,'' Michel said. ``Brazil was better
than us tonight and the score proves it.''
	   The Brazilian party started early at Beaujoire stadium in this
northwestern river port. The 40,000 fans were a festival of
Brazil's green-and-yellow jerseys, face paint and glitter wigs,
daubed with splashes of Moroccan red.
	   What would be a long evening for the Lions began in the second
minute, when Rivaldo sent Leonardo in on a breakaway, but his
apparent goal was called back for offside.
	   Five minutes later, Rivaldo tried to catch goalie Driss Benzekri
napping with a long shot from midfield, a goal he had made for FC
Barcelona. This one went high.
	   But in the ninth minute, Rivaldo found Ronaldo streaking up the
middle. The two-time FIFA Player of the Year took a step and
drilled a right-footed shot past the diving Benzekri to make it
1-0.
	   The Lions defense tried every way to shut down Ronaldo, even
physically. in the 18th minute, Said Chiba came in cleats high,
tearing Ronaldo's shorts and leaving an ugly bruise on his left
thigh. But Russian referee Nikolai Levnikov let him off with a
warning.
	   Zagallo refused to comment on the incident. ``That's FIFA's
problem,'' he said.
	   Five minutes later it was Brazil's Cesar Sampaio who drew a
yellow, his second of the Cup, and misses the game against Norway
as a result.
	   It was injury time when Bebeto found Cafu open on the right
wing, and he sent a cross to Rivaldo that struck Benzekri's arm
before going in for a 2-0 lead.
	   ``When we relax, the results start coming,'' said Cafu. ``We
knew we'd gather momentum once the Cup started, and that's what's
happening.''
	   In the second period, Bebeto took over.
	   In the 47th minute he slipped between two defenders for a
testing header that Benzreki picked off in the corner.
	   Three minutes later, defender Abdelilah Saber stepped on the
ball and Ronaldo picked it off. He blew in from the left side,
stutter-stepped around a defender and fed Bebeto for the tap-in.
	   After that, it was showtime.
	   Rivaldo opened with a behind-the-back pass, and Cafu samba'd
over the ball before a perplexed defender. The highlight was a
Rivaldo-to-Ronaldo-to-Bebeto gem that was cleared at the last
minute, but the crowd roared its appreciation.
	   Rivaldo said the game showed that it makes little difference
whom Brazil plays. ``I think we've grown and can beat anyone,'' he
said.
	   Doriva, making his World Cup debut, replaced Sampaio in the 68th
minute, and four miniutes later Edmundo came in for Bebeto.
	   Morocco then sent in Lahcen Abrami and Gharib Amzine for Saber
and Chiba in the 76th minute. Amzine would have Morocco's best
chance on a feed from Hadji, but his shot from outside the area
went high.
	   In the final minutes, Denilson replaced Rivaldo and Ali El
Khattabu came in for Hadda. Junior Baiano drew a yellow card for a
rough tackle.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel, Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio (Doriva, 68th), Leonardo, Rivaldo (Denilson,
88th); Bebeto (Edmundo, 72nd), Ronaldo.
	   Morocco _ Driss Benzekri; Abdelilah Saber (Lahcen Abrami, 76th),
Youssef Rossi, Abdelkrim El Hadrioui, Noureddine Naybet; El
Moustafa Hadji, Said Chiba (Gharib Amzine, 76th), Youssef Chippo,
Tahar El Khalej; Abdeljilil Hadda (Ali El Khattabi, 89th),
Salaheddine Bassir.
	   Referee _ Nikolai Levnikov, Russia.

National Democratic Party on Monday, winning seven of 15 Parliament
seats.
	   Opposition party officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they were discussing protests and possibly strikes to force a
re-election within six months.
	   ``In spite of glaring electoral irregularities, fraud, bribery
and intimidation, the Unity Labor Party received over 4,000 votes
more than the NDP,'' according to a statement from Labor leader
Vincent Beache.
	   Beache's party had seen its best opportunities in years to wrest
back the power they enjoyed after the islands first became
independent in 1979.
	   Beache said Tuesday morning that registration problems had
particularly affected three constituencies in which his party had
lost by less than 70 votes. He called for religious, business and
labor leaders to join his party's demand for fresh elections.
	   Labor won 27,506 votes to the Democrats' 23,219, but they got
fewer seats because of the proportional representation system
inherited from British colonizers.
	   The supervisor of elections was recounting the provisional
results and could not be reached for comment on Labor's charges. He
was expected to announce official results Wednesday.
	   ``NDP candidates were on election day active within polling
stations and their precincts, issuing threats and offering bribes
to voters,'' said Beache's statement.
	   A police officer was stationed at each of the 187 polling
stations in the Eastern Caribbean island chain, but the police
commissioner could not be reached to comment on the claims.
	   ``They are trying to keep hope alive,'' Mitchell responded on
the national radio. The results were a big blow to his party, which
had held 12 of the 15 seats.
	   Despite the win, the governing party saw its near-absolute power
diminished by voters disillusioned by a troubled banana industry
and 45 percent unemployment. Unemployment soared soon after
Mitchell was elected in 1984 and doubled the minimum wage to
Eastern Caribbean dlrs 20 (dlrs 7.70) an hour. Several U.S.
factories moved out as a result.
	   The Labor Party had made no charges of fraud until it was
announced that they had lost.
	   During Monday's voting, the party's deputy leader, lawyer Ralph
Gonsalves, told The Associated Press that some people had been
unable to vote because of irregularities in registration, but he
said the problem was ``marginal'' and would not affect results.

Joy in Woodward's hometown after court ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Fixes Louise Woodward's courtesy title to Ms. sted Miss &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Au Pair
 &UR; By SUE LEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELTON, England (AP) _ Louise Woodward's mother Tuesday said it
was ``absolutely fantastic'' that her daughter would be coming home
at last after being convicted of killing a child in her care.
	   But Susan Woodward had nothing more to say to reporters, and the
reaction in the family's hometown was notably subdued after the
appeals court in Massachusetts cleared the way for Ms. Woodward to
leave the United States.
	   The court upheld a ruling by the trial judge, Superior Court
Judge Hiller B. Zobel, that au pair Louise Woodward's sentence for
second-degree murder should be reduced to manslaughter and the
length of sentence to the time in prison she had already served.
	   ``I'm really pleased with the news, but I'm surprised, I thought
people would have been here in their thousands,'' said Thomas
Maddocks, 78, who found just a few drinkers at the Rigger pub,
which has served as headquarters for local supporters.
	   The pub had been packed on the October day when Ms. Woodward was
convicted of killing an 8-month-old child in her care, Matthew
Eappen, and again on Nov. 10 when her sentence was reduced.
	   ``I can't understand it, everyone was here for the verdict and
for everything else. I suppose it's been going on for so long and
the final came and people had had enough,'' Maddocks said.
	   Although Mrs. Woodward had nothing more to say publicly, Paul
Barrow, an attorney for the family, read a statement to reporters.
	   ``Louise will continue to maintain her innocence and a statement
in fact has already been made by her American lawyers a short time
ago, stating the injustice that they consider she has suffered,''
Barrow said.
	   In Oxford, Barry Scheck, one of Ms. Woodward's U.S. attorneys,
said the trial had been a ``terrible experience for all involved.''
	   ``This has been a tragic case from the beginning for the family
of Matthew Eappen, and for this young woman who was charged with a
crime that the scientific evidence I believe demonstrates she did
not commit,'' Scheck told a news conference.
	   ``The waiting was unbearable, but what was unbearable was being
in jail. It was very difficult. While she was waiting for the
verdict, everything she did was subjected to wall-to-wall publicity
and tabloid scrutiny,'' Scheck said.
	   Julie Smith, the landlady at Elton's Rigger pub, said she was
``pleased she's coming home and we'll take it from there.
	   ``We've not forgotten that a baby was killed. We've all got
children or grandchildren. I'm scared to say anything in case it
might get misconstrued,'' Mrs. Smith said.
	   ``We can hardly believe it, everyone as you can imagine is
absolutely over the moon,'' said Roy McCabe, a family friend.
	   The Rev. Ken Davey, chairman of the trustees of the Louise
Woodward Appeal Fund, said he was relieved that the court had
finally made its decision.
	   ``We have still not got to lose sight of the fact that there is
a dead baby at the end of it and we still feel for the Eappen
family and their pain must be increased because of this verdict,''
Davey said.
	   Jean Antrobus, who stopped by at the Rigger, said the court's
ruling was ``brilliant news.''
	   ``I don't think the conviction should stand but at least it
means she's coming home,'' Mrs. Antrobus said.
	   ``She's only a girl herself. It doesn't alter the fact that
Matthew died and I feel very sorry for his parents, but it's time
that she came home and to put everything behind us.''
	   Ann Bradshaw of Elton said she was ``so glad it's all over'' for
the Woodwards.
	   ``In recent weeks it's got totally out of hand because it
dragged on so long,'' Mrs. Bradshaw said. ``Now everyone knows
where they stand and can get on with their lives.''
	   Gareth Jones, a supporter of Ms. Woodward's appeal fund, said
people in Elton had learned from the negative reaction to their
jubilation when Zobel reduced the sentence.
	   ``People think the best thing to do is keep a low profile and
rejoice in the fact that she's coming home. You don't need to jump
up and down, the freedom speaks for herself,'' Jones said.

Brazil celebrates victory over Morroco
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The spirit of Carnival reigned over
this city's business district Tuesday as thousands of people
celebrated Brazil's 3-0 victory over Morroco in the World Cup in
France.
	   Crowds gathered before large screen televisions mounted along
Avenida Paulista, the city's main thoroughfare, commemorating each
goal with fireworks and blasts from green and yellow plastic
trumpets.
	   Brazilian flags were hung from skyscrappers and ticker taped
rained down from offices.
	   When the judge blew the final whistle, a sound truck began
blaring Carnival music, turning the sports fans into a dancing mob.
	   ``It's the only time you can stay in the street without worrying
about being held-up. For 90 minutes, perfect strangers seem like
your closest friends,'' said Dorival Menezes, 42, a dentist.
	   Most business shut down for the game which aired at 4 pm local
time (19:00 GMT).
	   But the city's traffic, harsh on a normal day, turned into
gridlock and left a number of people stranded in the city center.
	   The few business that remained open had televisions set up for
employees to watch and restaurants and bars had multiple
televisions set up for their customers.
	   ``It was either set up five televisions or not open for business
at all,'' said Augustinho Camponelli, who manages the Veneza
restaurant.
	   A block and a half a way, a McDonald's forgot its American
heritage and bowed to Brazilian tradition when it shut down for the
duration of the game.

World's airlines record solid profit in 1997, says UN agency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Figures in U.S. dollars. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ The world's commercial airlines recorded an
overall profit of 5.7 percent in 1997, the second-best result in
the past 30 years, the International Civil Aviation Organization
reported Tuesday,
	   The U.N.-affiliated agency said the airline industry earned dlrs
291 billion in operating revenues, while spending dlrs 274.5
billion.
	   It was the industry's best performance since a 6.1 percent
profit in 1988, and the second best since a four-year period of
record profits in 1964-67.
	   The ICAO said the Latin America-Caribbean region recorded the
biggest growth in 1997, while the Middle East was the only region
performing markedly below the world average.
	   Asia, which had been the fastest-growing air-travel region in
recent years, slipped back to join North America, Europe and Africa
at about the world average.
	   The agency said scheduled international air traffic increased by
9 percent in 1997, and average passenger load on international
flights reached a record 70 percent of capacity.
	   There were 1.448 billion passengers on scheduled flights during
the year, up from 1.39 billion in 1996, the ICAO said.

Els limps into Open, Martin rolls in and Tiger stands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON SIRAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Ernie Els shifted in his chair and gently
rubbed the lower part of his back with his left hand, as if he were
trying to push something into place.
	   Suddenly, the question for the man who has won two U.S. Opens in
four years was not whether he could win for the second year in a
row, but whether he was physically fit to play at all.
	   ``It is not the way you really want to feel like playing in a
major tournament,'' Els said Tuesday at The Olympic Club. ``But I
am defending here this week.''
	   Els, who withdrew from the Buick Classic last week because of
his back, is working with the same therapist who helps Fred Couples
and Davis Love III.
	   ``It is still a day-to-day thing,'' Els said. ``I can't, for one
thing, sit down too long.''
	   He also cannot practice as much as he would like and the kind of
standing around that is common in the usually slow first two rounds
of a U.S. Open tends to make the back stiffen.
	   There is, however, reason to believe that Els might be fit by
the time he has to tee it up in Thursday's first round.
	   A week ago Els could barely swing through the ball. That's not a
problem now, but if there is any kind of layout that it not good
for someone with a bad back, it is a U.S. Open venue.
	   He will have to play a golf course with typical U.S. Open rough
that is not only more than 6-inches (15-cms) high but also very
thick because of the unusually heavy El Nino rain this year.
	   ``This rough is the worst rough, most difficult rough, that I
have seen in the U.S. Open, I think ever,'' said Tom Watson, who
has played in the Open 26 times.
	   Els is one of several players coming into the Open with back
problems.
	   Couples, who has won twice this year and has to be considered a
favorite, has had a problem with his back for years but seems to
have stabilized the situation with exercises and a reduced travel
schedule.
	   Love, the PGA Championship winner and another top contender
here, had his back problem flare up about six weeks ago and, as
with most players, it bothers him most when he has to sit for a
long time, like in an airplane.
	   Woods, who knows the Olympic course very well from his days at
Stanford University, withdrew from the Kemper Open two weeks ago
because of a sore back and at the time it was feared that it might
be the beginning of a chronic situation. But now he thinks it was
more from running too much.
	   ``It's fine _ 100 percent,'' Woods said Tuesday after he played
a practice round with Casey Martin and Joel Kribel, two guys who
also played college golf at Stanford.
	   While Woods' back was fine on Tuesday, his wallet experienced a
little pain.
	   ``I was taken for some cash,'' he said with a smile. ``Casey
played well. He made some birdies and got in my pocket.''
	   Martin, who successfully sued the PGA Tour for the right to ride
in a cart because of a circulatory problem in his right leg, won
another cart-related fight on Tuesday.
	   The USGA changed its mind and decided to let Martin use a
regular cart in the Open instead of the one-man cart it required
him to use in the qualifier and in practice rounds here.
	   Martin felt the cart wasn't safe.
	   While Martin will be able to cruise the fairways in the cart of
his choice, it will be keeping the ball in the fairway that will
likely be the deciding factor when the Open starts on Thursday.
	   Hitting the ball straight will count for a lot this week and
playing the wise shot when a fairway is missed will also be a key.
	   ``You better use your head coming out of the rough,'' said
Watson, who finished second here in the 1987 U.S. Open.
	   ``You better be thinking of your shot after the shot that comes
out of the rough,'' Watson said. ``You better be playing that shot
as precisely as you would any shot that you really needed to
make.''
	   Watson said he likes Colin Montgomerie's chances at Olympic,
both because he hits a lot of fairways and because his
left-to-right game works well on this course.
	   He also thinks Woods' length will work to his advantage at
Olympic, even though he will be hitting almost no drivers off the
tee because of the many dogleg holes.

A mighty track team, and a turbulent time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ The 1968 U.S. men's Olympic track and field
team had a certain magic. It was also immensely talented and
controversial.
	   ``It was a very special team,'' long jumper Bob Beamon said.
``This team was so great. We could do so many things. Anyone
running the mile on down could run the 100 meters and win.''
	   That year, the United States was rocked by the assassinations of
Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, civil rights
demonstrations and anti-war protests.
	   Into the mix came the Olympics in Mexico City. Black Americans
and Africans threatened to boycott the games, and shortly before
the opening ceremony, 30 students were killed during a student
rally in the host city.
	   But the games began on schedule, and the United States brought
its greatest track and field team ever.
	   On Thursday night, 23 medalists from the team will attend USA
Track and Field's 30th Anniversary of America's Champions,
sponsored by Xerox, in New Orleans, site of this weekend's national
championships.
	   There, they will be able to relive their memories _ good or bad.
	   The men would win 12 of 24 gold medals in Mexico City and the
overall team would set eight world records, including Beamon's
remarkable 29-foot-2 1/2-inch (8.90 meters) long jump, Lee Evans'
43.86-second clocking in the 400 meters, Jim Hines' 9.95 in the
men's 100 and Wyomia Tyus' 11.08 in the women's 100.
	   Winning performances also included Dick Fosbury in the men's
high jump with his unique ``Fosbury Flop,'' a style that
revolutionized the event, and Al Oerter, the men's discus gold
medalist for the fourth consecutive time.
	   This was a close-knit group, having trained for two months in
Spartan conditions in South Lake Tahoe, California. And it was
caught in the social upheaval of the day.
	   Most prominent was the black-gloved demonstration on the medals
podium by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the first and third
finishers in the 200 meters.
	   Their gesture was interpreted as too political, and Smith and
Carlos were expelled from the Olympic Village by the U.S. Olympic
Committee, following pressure from the International Olympic
Committee.
	   ``It was so unfortunate that we took a nonviolent activity that
devastated two fine athletes,'' Beamon said.
	   ``The same thing could happen today and it could have a
different meaning. It's unfortunate how it was interpreted. It was
not planned.''
	   Vince Matthews, a member of the 1,600-meter relay team that set
a world record of 2:56.16 and who won the Olympic 400 gold medal in
1972, differs with Beamon.
	   Matthews knew it was going to happen. The men's team had met
about possible protests and it was left to each person to determine
what he would do if on the medals stand.
	   ``Tommie and John were very strong about their feelings,''
Matthews said.
	   Smith said the raised fists were not a a ``malignant gesture.''
	   ``It was meant to get a respectful response,'' he said.
	   Instead, the gesture backfired. Smith and Carlos were denounced
as ``ugly Americans,'' and their lives were tainted for years.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Yugoslav army helicopters
allegedly attacked refugee camps in the mountains of Kosovo
province, killing two people, and a man was shot dead Tuesday
inside Albania by Yugoslav soldiers firing across the border. The
incidents were reported as Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed in Moscow to meet with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
to discuss the separatist conflict in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Refugees said the Yugoslav MI-8
helicopters fired machine guns and dropped hand grenades as they
buzzed the camps near the Albanian frontier. The refugees said the
aircraft were backed by dozens of Serb soldiers in the assaults on
the mountain camps, where hundreds of people had taken shelter
while waiting to cross into Albania. The accounts of the refugees
could not be confirmed independently. Serb officials made no
comment on the reports. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ Senegalese troops fired
heavy artillery Tuesday into Guinea-Bissau, raising fears for the
safety of tens of thousands of refugees fleeing after a bloody
failed coup in the neighboring country. Senegal launched the
cross-border attack to push back its own separatist rebels, who had
taken haven in the area and are believed to have aligned themselves
with Guinea-Bissau's coup leader, Brig. Ansumane Mane. The border
fighting indicated an escalation of the conflict that started with
the June 7 army uprising in Guinea-Bissau's capital, Bissau, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) to the southeast. Mane's rebels accuse
elected President Joao Bernardo Vieira of corruption and abuse of
power and have demanded that he step down. (GUINEA-BISSAU)
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The first of nine prominent political
prisoners ordered freed by Nigeria's military leaders arrived home
Tuesday, but Nigerians were still waiting for word about the
others. ``My detention was extremely tough,'' Olabintan Durojaiye
said after he went to church in the capital, Lagos. Durojaiye, a
lawyer and critic of Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, was
thrown behind bars last year without charges or trial. Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, who assumed power last week after Abacha's
death from a heart attack, on Monday ordered the nine prisoners
released immediately. Besides Durojaiye, though, none of the others
were known to be free by Tuesday evening. (NIGERIA)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
abruptly ordered the closing Tuesday of more than 100 private
schools that have been educating girls in defiance of bans aimed at
keeping women at home. Included in the closure edict were scores of
small home-based vocational training programs, many of them run by
international aid groups, that teach girls and young women to weave
carpets and sew. Supporters say the classes are vital to rebuilding
the country after years of civil war. Under the new rules, the
Taliban will issue licenses to schools, but only after scrutinizing
their objectives. Schools will not be allowed to teach girls older
than 8 and will be limited to lessons about the Koran, the Muslim
holy book. (AFGHANISTAN-GIRLS SCHOOLS)
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The state's highest court cleared the way Tuesday
for Louise Woodward to go home to England, upholding a judge's
ruling that freed the au pair convicted of killing a baby. The
parents of Matthew Eappen immediately filed a civil lawsuit aimed
at keeping Ms. Woodward from profiting from the story. But
prosecutors said they planned no further appeals in the
16-month-old case that divided public opinion on both sides of the
Atlantic and stirred debate over working mothers and affordable
child care. Ms. Woodward's mother said it was ``absolutely
fantastic'' that her daughter would be coming home at last. But

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology stocks led a modest rebound Tuesday
as the market steadied following Monday's tumble to the lowest
level since March. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged
207 points on Monday, rose 37 points to 8,665 after bouncing back
from two dips below 8,600. Broader indexes also recovered some of
Monday's losses, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite posting
the sharpest gain. Outside technology, however, the bargain-hunting
never really picked up momentum, a sign that investors have hardly
shrugged off their worries about the Asian financial crisis and its
impact on American companies. Notably, the advance came despite a
second day of sharp losses on Asian markets, which have been
rattled by the dollar's unrelenting climb against the battered
currencies in that region. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
warned on Tuesday against overreaction to a national wave of
megamergers, saying there is no sign of economic danger. He
suggested the government should respect the ``dynamism of modern
free markets.'' It's the fifth burst of business mergers this
century, Greenspan told senators, and there is little reason to
think it will have any more effect than the previous one in the
early 1980s. But Sen. Edward Kennedy voiced worry about the
thousands of employees losing their jobs because of mergers while
some company executives get big benefit packages known as ``golden
parachutes.'' Greenspan acknowledged there would be job losses from
mergers, but said a growing economy should be able to handle the
displaced workers. (US-MERGERS-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund is sending a team
to Moscow next week to discuss new loans to help Russia stabilize
its shaky financial markets, government and IMF officials confirmed
Tuesday. The IMF's chief representative in Russia, Martin Gilman,
said an ``extensive dialogue'' is planned when the team arrives
Monday, but refused to say what kind of assistance may be offered.
Some officials and market analysts hope the IMF will provide a
bailout package, even though the fund and Russian government
officials have said repeatedly that the country is capable of
overcoming the crisis on its own. The market rebounded on the news,
with the Russian Trading System closing 4.2 percent higher after
seven straight days of declines. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Two United Auto Workers strikes cut deeply into
General Motors' bottom line Tuesday, having halted more than 70
percent of the automaker's production of pickups and sport utility
vehicles. Light trucks generate the fattest profits for the No. 1
automaker. By Friday, GM's North American production of the popular
vehicles will be reduced to a trickle. In all, more than 71,700 GM
workers have been idled at those assembly plants and 78 parts
plants in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The prospect of
heavy strike-related losses at GM, combined with the recent
downturn in the stock market, has sent the company's stock price
down nearly 10 percent since its close the day before the first
strike began. It rose 50 cents Tuesday to dlrs 68.87 1/2 a share on
the New York Stock Exchange. (US-GM STRIKE)
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ General Motors Corp. will pay dlrs 150,000 to
three black auto workers who accused a white union official of
racial and sexual harassment. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission named GM in the lawsuit because it said the company
failed to take action to stop harassment by Robert Wilson, a former
United Auto Workers committeeman. In settling the lawsuit, GM
admitted no wrongdoing. The settlement does not resolve the EEOC's
lawsuit against the union, which is scheduled to be tried in July.
Two of the workers will receive dlrs 60,000 each, while the third
will get dlrs 30,000. All three were supervisors at the company's
Hazelwood parts plant in 1992. (US-GM-HARASSMENT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
Congress to hold a separate vote on the administration's request
for dlrs 18 billion for the International Monetary Fund. But House
Majority Leader Dick Armey said it was unlikely. ``IMF funding is
critical to demonstrate U.S. support for its mission and to prevent
international financial problems,'' Albright told a Senate panel
Tuesday. Some lawmakers want to attach to the IMF legislation
anti-abortion limits on U.S. aid to family planning groups.
President Bill Clinton has said he will veto any such bill.
Albright called the IMF funding a security issue, saying that if it
is not provided, the 182-nation organization would be weakened as a
tool for dealing with financial crises that are deepening in Asia
and threatening Russia. (US-IMF CONGRESS)

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Elton John wants to record a tribute to
fashion designer Gianni Versace, much like he did for Princess
Diana.
	   The pop star told reporters about his latest musical inspiration
during a party Monday to inaugurate an exhibition of Versace's
designs.
	   Versace was shot to death outside his Miami Beach home on July
15 by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who later committed suicide.
	   John, who has long been close to the Versace clan, sang at the
memorial service held in Milan for Versace a week after the
slaying.
	   The tribute to Versace is still unwritten, but the composer said
he already has a title _ ``Bitch.''
	   ``That's how we used to greet each other on the phone,'' John
joked.
	   ___
	   SANTA ANA, California (AP) _ Yoko Ono says she's simply paying a
karmic debt by promoting the artwork of John Lennon.
	   Ono has created a touring exhibition of her late husband's
drawings.
	   ``He used to promote my work like crazy, and now I can do the
same for him,'' she said. ``I think this is cosmically right in a
way, that it's my turn now to be there for him.''
	   The exhibit consists of more than 100 pieces, including
self-portraits.
	   Some critics describe the work as mere doodling. But Lennon's
work has remained popular with his fans. Paul Jillson, director of
the tour, said he expects 12,000 people to see the show this week
at Laguna Hills Mall.
	   ``I think John would be surprised, in a way, by this sort of
popularity,'' Ono said. ``He wasn't the kind of person to get
caught up in what people thought of his art.''
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ Andrew Lloyd Webber has canceled four preview
performances of his latest musical, ``Whistle Down the Wind,''
because of concerns about the safety of the stage set.
	   ``After an accident in rigging on the set last week, I was told
that there was a one-in-a-million chance that it could be
repeated,'' the composer said Monday. ``These odds were not good
enough for me. Therefore I decided that over the past weekend
additional safety work should take place.''
	   Details of the accident were not disclosed.
	   Previews were supposed to begin June 17. They will be postponed
until June 22.
	   Opening night will still be July 1 at the Aldwych Theatre.
	   ___
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul blessed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who came to the Vatican on Tuesday to
brief the pontiff on efforts to start a permanent tribunal to deal
with crimes against humanity.
	   ``God bless you!'' declared the pope at the end of their private
meeting.
	   The men also discussed current events in Europe, Africa and the
Middle East, said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls.
	   Earlier this year, the pope praised Annan for his mission in
Baghdad to avert an attack on Iraq over the issue of arms
inspections.
	   ___
	   DETROIT (AP) _ American homeowners are heading into Canada to
sneak around U.S. regulations and pick up high-capacity toilets.
	   A U.S. conservation law that took effect in 1994 limited toilets
to 1.6 gallons (6 liters) a flush. The older toilets allowed 3.5
gallons (13 liters).
	   Plumbing suppliers in Windsor, Ontario, just across the border
from Detroit, report they are increasingly see customers from
Michigan. Some buy up to four toilets for remodeling projects or
new homes.
	   ``They drive back across the border from Windsor and we ask them
what they've got in their cars,'' said Mark Hoying, a senior
inspector at the U.S. Customs Service in Detroit. ``Some will say
they bought a toilet, believe it or not.''
	   The toilets are available duty-free in Canada because of the
North American Trade Agreement.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's drug czar, who fought a
losing battle to halt the flow of Colombian cocaine into Venezuela,
resigned Tuesday to run for the senate.
	   Carlos Tablante said he would resume ``political and social''
work in central Aragua state, and run for the Senate in November
congressional elections. He had served as drug czar since December
1996.
	   Tablante helped implement a ``just-say-no'' to drugs campaign
but made scant progress in stopping the flow of narcotics into
Venezuela from neighboring Colombia, the world's No. 1 cocaine
producer.
	   Venezuela is now a major shipment point for drugs bound for the
United States and Europe, officials say.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan prosecutors cleared one man of
involvement in the killing of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi
Conedera, but another suspect remained in custody Tuesday.
	   Attorney General Otto Ardon Medina said no evidence indicated
that Ivan Alexander Hernandez was involved in the April 26 killing
of Gerardi, who headed the church's human rights office in
Guatemala.
	   Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in the garage of his home two
days after presenting a report blaming the army for most of the
killings during Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
	   Hernandez, 25, was arrested June 5 during an alleged drug deal
and was still being held Tuesday on possible drug possession
charges. He had been linked to the 1994 killing of a Catholic
priest, Belga Alfonso Stessel, but was never charged.
	   A first suspect, Carlos Enrique Vielman, 24, was arrested in
April in connection with Gerardi's death but still has not been
formally charged. Vielman has said he is innocent.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's president said Tuesday he
understood the desire of 14 municipalities to secede and become
part of Costa Rica because they have been ``totally abandoned'' by
previous governments.
	   Residents of a remote chunk of southern Nicaragua earlier had
said they wanted to become part of Costa Rica because officials in
the far-off capital have forgotten about them.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman dispatched a team including five
ministers and the head of the army to the Cardenas region, 140
kilometers (90 miles) south of the capital, Managua, to show his
government would not neglect the region.
	   The jungle area, with a 1,000 population, saw heavy conflict
between the Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels
during the 1980s, and now is a transit zone for thousands of
Nicaraguans seeking jobs in Costa Rica.
	   Costa Rican currency is widely used in the area, and residents
get radio and television signals from the south, not the north.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ A strike by public transport workers who
set up road blocks shut down traffic in the country's seat of
government Tuesday, bringing many businesses to a standstill.
	   Transport workers parked hundreds of buses on city intersections
to protest a plan to change the routes for buses and mini buses in
an effort to ease traffic congestion in this city, which has a
population of 1 million.

NBA players bounced from U.S. roster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Faced with an unstable labor situation, USA
Basketball on Tuesday announced it would replace the 12 National
Basketball Association players chosen to represent the United
States in the World Championships.
	   ``We are extremely disappointed and regret that this action had
to be taken, but training camp for our team starts July 8, and we
simply cannot wait until July 2 for a decision before we begin the
process of fielding a replacement team,'' said USA Basketball
executive director Warren Brown.
	   The World Championships begin July 29 in Athens, Greece. The
current NBA labor agreement expires July 1 and indications are that
a lockout by the owners could be possible.
	   The 12 NBA players selected to represent the United States spoke
by conference call June 11 and decided they would not commit to
playing as long as a lockout seemed likely.
	   Friday is the deadline for submitting 24-man rosters to FIBA,
the international governing body that runs the World Championships.
	   Options include entering the 12-man Goodwill Games team, made up
of college players, or a roster of CBA players and Americans
playing overseas. No roster would be final, however, until 72 hours
before the tournament begins.
	   The 12 NBA players on the U.S. team were: Tim Duncan (San
Antonio), Tim Hardaway (Miami), Vin Baker and Gary Payton
(Seattle), Terrell Brandon (Milwaukee), Kevin Garnett and Tom
Gugliotta (Minnesota), Grant Hill (Detroit), Allan Houston (New
York), Christian Laettner (Atlanta), Glen Rice (Charlotte) and
Chris Webber (Sacramento).
	   Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston Rockets was the coach.
	   Other countries participating are Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Nigeria, Puerto Rico,
Russia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain and Yugoslavia.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The West, flexing its military muscles,
wants Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to open meaningful
talks with Kosovo's independence-seeking Albanians. He has promised
the Russians he will.
	   But even if Milosevic keeps his promise, it remains unclear what
solution could indeed bring peace to the troubled region. The West
has no fixed ideas, and enmities between Milosevic and Kosovo's
majority Albanians run too deep for them to concoct a solution of
their own that will stick.
	   The West has ruled out the goal of many Kosovo Albanians:
independence for their territory. Kosovo is now a part of Serbia,
one of Yugoslavia's two republics.
	   That leaves as possibilities such options as dividing Kosovo
into separate territories for its ethnic Albanian community and the
Serb community Milosevic says he is protecting; making it a third
Yugoslav republic, alongside Serbia and Montenegro; or simply
restoring the broad autonomy for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo that
Milosevic stripped away in 1989.
	   Autonomy or republic status would allow Kosovo Albanians to use
their own language for official business and in schools, and
generally rule their own lives.
	   All are imperfect compromises. To stick, they could need a
strong Western diplomatic or even military presence. They would
also need local leaders with real clout among their peoples.
	   But as for Western involvement, there is no sign the West is
ready for another Balkan deployment like the one in Bosnia. There,
it has taken 34,000 troops, thousands of foreign officials and aid
workers and billions of dollars to make the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement hold.
	   Giving Kosovo autonomy or the status of a republic will be
unacceptable to the ethnic Albanians, at least while Milosevic
controls Yugoslavia.
	   Partition or independence _ even if the Serbs accepted either _
carry uncomfortable implications.
	   To date, the Western mantra for the Balkans has been: no changes
of borders, because that will spark more conflict.
	   Hence, Croatia was recognized as an independent state in 1991
with the same borders it had had as a republic of Yugoslavia, even
though the government that received independence controlled only
two-thirds of that territory.
	   The West kept Bosnia as a single republic because, after all the
suffering of its Muslims, it would have been morally impossible to
dismember it and let Croats and Serbs take their desired share.
	   An independent Kosovo, or a partitioned Kosovo with its
Albanian-ruled part allowed to vote to join Albania, could cause
more trouble. It could tempt Bosnia's Serbs to unite with Serbia.
Or it could unravel the neighboring nation of Macedonia, whose
strong ethnic Albanian minority also borders Albania proper.
	   But first, the Serbs and Albanians have to agree on what to do
in Kosovo.
	   Last month, under U.S. pressure, Milosevic for the first time
met Kosovo's ethnic Albanian political leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Talks between delegations were set, and one session took place.
Now, the Kosovo Albanians have scrapped them, demanding Milosevic
first halt his attacks to wipe out a militant uprising.
	   The Serbs say they cannot let ``terrorism'' go unchecked.
	   The growth of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the militant ethnic
Albanian group that first emerged in 1996, is a problem for all _
the Serbs, Rugova and the West.
	   No one seems to know who leads the KLA. It has announced a new
spokesman, who has stated its supposed conditions for negotiations:
withdrawal of all Serbian security forces from Kosovo and foreign
mediation. But it is not clear if the spokesman really represents
all of the KLA.
	   Rugova may be the single Albanian leader with most authority.
But he has lost ground to the KLA since Serbian police began a
crackdown in March. More than 300 people have died since in
fighting.
	   Milosevic, too, has problems. Last weekend, the Serbian Orthodox
Church _ whose monasteries and churches in Kosovo are the heart of
the issue for Serbs _ said the strongman has lost authority to rule
or negotiate on Kosovo because of his repressive policies against
Kosovo Albanians.

Stellar Brazil gives World Cup a break from its worries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ For a couple of hours, the World Cup got the
perfect panacea in a week flush with hooligan violence and griping
teams: a dazzling performance from world champion Brazil.
	   In an entertaining display of elegance and artistry topped with
a measure of samba-style show-boating, Ronaldo and the Brazilians
totally dismantled Morocco 3-0 Tuesday night and became the first
team to clinch a berth in the second round.
	   ``We played joyful, sparkling and efficient soccer,'' coach
Mario Zagallo said. ``I'm happy with everything _ the defense, the
midfield and the attack.''
	   The joy that Brazil brought to the field contrasted with the
daunting task faced by French police, who are bracing for another
round of fan violence as English supporters make their way from
Marseille to Toulouse, site of England's next game against Romania
on Monday.
	   About 1,000 English fans are already reported in the city,
prompting officials to postpone a weekend music festival until July
11. Owners of shops, bars and restaurants say they will either
close early, or completely, while the English are in town.
	   ``I prefer to close my shop rather than get it smashed up,''
said Lionel Laurier, owner of a local cafe. ``But whether closed or
open, I'm sure to suffer damages. But I can't afford to put the
lives of my employees at risk.''
	   As they did in the United States in 1994, the Brazilians got to
the second round with a match to spare as Ronaldo, Rivaldo and
Bebeto scored to make it two wins in as many games. When Ronaldo
side-stepped a defender in a marvelous run to set up Bebeto with a
deft pass for the third goal in the 50th minute, showtime had
begun.
	   In the final minutes, Rivaldo made a behind-the-back pass. Cafu
danced over the ball in front of a perplexed defender. Then there
was a Rivaldo-to-Ronaldo-to-Bebeto gem didn't net a goal, but got a
roar of approval from the 33,266 at the Stade de la Beaujoire in
Nantes.
	   Poor Morocco didn't manage even one shot on goal the entire
game.
	   ``We were outmatched,'' defender Youssef Rossi said. ``The first
goal added to the feeling of intimidation we had at the start. They
were fast, skilled, everything Brazil is supposed to be.''
	   Brazil's final first-round game, against Norway in Marseille on
June 23, will now be meaningful only for the Norwegians, who drew
1-1 with Scotland in Tuesday's other game. If Norway doesn't pull
the huge upset, the second team to advance with Brazil from Group A
will be decided by the Scotland-Morocco game to be played at the
same time.
	   ``Brazil will not field its best team against us,'' said hopeful
Norwegian striker Havard Flo. ``But we need to get back to a
hundred percent. We need to vary our game more in the future. We
only played well in the first 15 minutes of the second half
tonight.''
	   Flo's goal, his second in nine games for Norway, put Norway
ahead against Scotland just 30 seconds into the second half. Craig
Burley equalized in the 66th minute, also his second in
international play, keeping Scottish hopes alive of making the
second round for the first time in their eighth World Cup
appearance.
	   ``We're desperately disappointed that we didn't win the match,''
said Scotland manager Craig Brown, whose gamble paid off when he
moved Burley to a central midfield position in the second half.
``Only one point in two games is not too pleasing for us.''
	   Meanwhile, in Marseille, the courts continued to deal swiftly
with the hooligans arrested after following three days of violence
surrounding England's 1-0 victory over Tunisia on Monday.
	   Tuesday night, two fans were sentenced to four months in jail
and a third was given a three-month term. Three others were given
three-month sentences on Monday. All will be banned from France for
at least a year after their releases.
	   An entirely different kind of controversy was brewing in the
Iranian team's camp, where officials are incensed over the showing
of an unflattering U.S. film about Iran on French TV.
	   ``Not Without My Daughter,'' which stars Sally Field and
portrays Iranians as dirty, boorish, cruel and obsessed with their
Islamic religion and its attitudes toward women, was screened on
France's privately owned channel M6 late Monday.
	   ``We see this as nothing but a political exercise and as an
insult to our country, our government and our players,'' Safaei
Farahani, head of Iran's soccer federation, told The Associated
Press.
	   At a press conference, Iranian forward Khodadad Azizi took off
the yellow cap given to him by the French Organizing Committee and
pointed to its ``Fair Play'' logo.
	   ``Is the showing of this movie, which is an insult to our
people, fair play?'' Azizi said. ``Fair play is not limited to the
field. The French organizers must ensure fair play off the field as
well. I'm not going to wear this cap again.''
	   Farahani submitted a written protest to the World Cup organizing
committee and to FIFA. ``I'm waiting for an answer,'' he said.

	   NEMA MILITARY SECTOR II, Senegal (AP) _ The violent aftermath of
a failed coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau spread to the country's
northern border Tuesday as neighboring Senegal launched an
artillery barrage across the frontier into rebel territory.
	   The attack, aimed at dislodging Senegal's own separatist rebels
with suspected links to coup leader Brig. Ansumane Mane, came as
heavy fighting in Guinea-Bissau continued to rock the capital of
Bissau.
	   Loyalist forces maintained their siege of a military garrison in
a suburb of Bissau, where renegade soldiers have been holed up
since June 7. Aid workers reported the two sides were lobbing
large-caliber artillery and mortar shells in the city, which was
almost deserted of its 300,000 inhabitants.
	   Mane's rebels have demanded that Guinea-Bissau's President Joao
Bernardo Vieira step down. They accuse him of corruption and abuse
of power.
	   ``The shelling is still serious,'' Michael Kleiner of the
International Red Cross said in Geneva.
	   The border attack, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of
Bissau, began with a volley of artillery early Tuesday, while small
arms skirmishes rattled through the countryside through much of the
day.
	   Shorts bursts of gunfire echoed across the red, dusty landscape
just kilometers (miles) from the border. Heavier gunfire pumped
away in the distance, while a Senegalese prop-engine spotter plane
buzzed overhead.
	   The fighting near the border _ not uncommon in this
rebellion-wracked region _ appeared this time to indicate an
escalation in the conflict in Guinea-Bissau, Senegalese military
officers said.
	   ``We had been expecting the rebels to step up their fighting
here to coincide with the war in Guinea-Bissau,'' a senior
commander based near the border said on condition of customary
anonymity.
	   While thousands of refugees fled Bissau in hopes of seeking
refuge in Senegal, the cross-border clash cut one of their main
escape routes out of the former Portuguese colony.
	   Thousands of people reportedly were camping outside the city. A
Catholic mission in Nhacra-Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Bissau on the road to Senegal, reported more than
150,000 refugees in the area.
	   ``The big problem is the lack of drinking water and food for the
people on the road,'' Kleiner said.
	   Those who had already made it into Senegal said many had been
cut off close to the border.
	   ``As far as in this area, the people are afraid to even move,''
said Lamin Mane, who sat with a group of other refugees under a
looming mango tree just beyond the border fighting.
	   The pop and whistle of gunfire crackled in the background as he
spoke.
	   A Senegalese truck driver, who normally hauls goods between the
two countries said several of his friends had been trapped inside
Guinea-Bissau.
	   Portuguese forces Tuesday evacuated more than 400 foreigners,
mostly Portuguese, Brazilians and French, from Bissau.
	   Senegal, meanwhile, was beefing up its contingent of soldiers
sent to support Vieira, the elected president.
	   The Senegalese commander said several truck convoys with troops
had been sent to reinforce earlier troops and heavy artillery
pieces in the capital.
	   The Republic of Guinea, south Guinea-Bissau, also was sending
troop support, although unconfirmed reports from refugees and the
Senegalese military said a significant number of Guinean soldiers
had lined up with Mane.
	   If the reports are accurate, what began as an attempted coup in
the capital of Bissau could end up involving three countries in
West Africa, fueled by years of simmering enmity.
	   Mane, accused of running guns to Senegal's separatist forces in
Casamance province, has suffered from poor relations with the
military command in Senegal's capital, Dakar. The two countries
also fought brief clashes in 1990 over offshore oil exploration
rights.
	   The deputy chief of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces said Tuesday
that his troops, supported by soldiers from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea, were gaining the upper-hand.

World Cup: 1-1 draw leaves both coaches disappointed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Only two points from as many games and
Brazil up next.
	   For most teams it's certainly a tough task facing the defending
world champions and probably needing a win in the first-round
finale.
	   Maybe not so for Norway, which has never lost to the Brazilians
in two games and soundly beat them 4-2 a year ago in Oslo.
	   OK, that was only a friendly and this is the World Cup with an
unprecedented second-round berth at stake for Norway. But coach
Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen knows his team can do it again.
	   Olsen naturally wanted Brazil to beat Morocco in the other Group
A match Tuesday and his wishes came true as the South Americans won
3-0 in Nantes.
	   ``But in any case, we can decide things ourselves,'' Olsen said
after Norway's 1-1 draw Tuesday with Scotland. ``We don't depend on
Brazil and that's a good feeling.''
	   Havard Flo, who scored for Norway just 30 seconds after the
break, said ``Brazil will not field its best team against us.
	   ``But we need to get back to a 100 percent. We need to vary our
game more in the future. We only played well in the first 15
minutes of the second half tonight.''
	   Olsen kept Flo mainly on the team for his strength in the air.
And it paid off as Flo, at 1.83 meters (6 feet) called ``the
Midget'' by his taller teammates and cousins Tore Andre and Jostein
Flo, got past Christian Dailly at the far post to head Riseth's
left wing cross.
	   Midfielder Craig Burley salvaged Scotland's first point in the
tournament, taking a long forward pass from substitute David Weir
and scoring on a beautiful lob over goalie Frode Grodas, his former
Chelsea team-mate, in the 66th minute.
	   The draw kept the Bravehearts' hopes alive of making the second
round for the first time in eight World Cup appearances.
	   ``The Norwegians were getting a little bit tired and a few
players were going down with cramp,'' Burley said. ``There was
little more space. The ball was delivered by David Weir over the
left centerback's head.
	   ``It fell nicely. The keeper came out and it mind my mind up: to
lob him. For a minute I thought it had dropped over the bar.
Fortunately it went into the net and I was delighted.''
	   Both coaches were frustrated as they left Bordeaux' Parc Lescure
stadium.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' Olsen said. ``We started badly for the
first 20 minutes. Then we gradually came into the match.
	   ``I thought we would win after we took the lead. But things went
wrong after 1-1. We lost our concentration and we were in fact
lucky that we didn't lose the match.''
	   The Norwegians may have peaked too early. They outscored fellow
World Cup teams Denmark, Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a combined 13-2
in six weeks before the World Cup. In the first World Cup game,
Norway rallied from one-goal deficits twice to draw Morocco 2-2.
	   Scotland's coach Craig Brown said ``we felt we were the better
team and we're desperately disappointed that we didn't win the
match. Only one point in two games is not to pleasing for us.''
	   Brown was pleased he made some tactical substitutions which
pusher Burley further forward.
	   ``When we went behind, there was no option,'' he said. ``We had
to gamble and move forward. It's OK the substitution was
successful, but sometimes they're successful and sometimes they're
not.
	   ``I'm not going to take huge credit because, quite honestly, we
shouldn't have needed that goal to get back in the game. We
should've been ahead.''

World Cup: Hwang still out, Choi and Seo return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ Veteran striker Hwang Sun-hong,
forced to miss South Korea's opening World Cup match against Mexico
due to a knee injury, will also have to skip the team's next game
against the Netherlands.
	   Injured when he was tackled two weeks ago in a 1-1 draw with
China, Hwang's absence was sharply felt last Saturday during South
Korea's 3-1 bitter defeat to Mexico.
	   The Pohang Steeler, one of South Korea's most prolific scorers
with 43 goals in 74 international matches, had water in his knee
joint removed earlier this week.
	   Though Hwang was expected to play against South Korea's toughest
rival in group E, the Netherlands, it seems the 29-year-old
international is still feeling a little pain.
	   ``It's not serious,'' coach Cha Bum-kun said Tuesday. ``But he
hasn't recovered fully, not sufficiently to play on Saturday.''
	   Hwang was present at Tuesday's training, jogging gently around
the field and performing light exercises.
	   The good news is that Choi Sung-yong, who twisted his right
ankle last week during training and played just half the match
against Mexico, will start for South Korea against the talented
Dutch in Marseille.
	   Another blessing for South Korea is the return of the fast and
wily Seo Jung-won.
	   Seo, the first Korean ever to sign with a French club at the
start of the year when he joined Strasburg for dlrs 1.5 million,
watched from the sidelines as his team bowed to Mexico, still
recovering from a bout of chicken pox.
	   Seo caught the scratchy illness from his son a week before
coming to France.
	   Luckily, said vice-manager Chun Hanjin, all the other South
Korean players have already had chicken pox and are in no danger of
catching it.
	   Cha announced several changes to the starting lineup next
Saturday.
	   Not surprisingly, South Korea's top-scorer Choi Yong-soo, who
scored seven times during the second round of Asia's qualifying
tournament, will replace Kim Do-hoon up front. Kim, striker in the
match against Mexico, will step back and flank Choi instead.

World Cup: Three strikers ready to try to break the ice for
</HEADLINE>
Paraguay &QL; 
 &UR; By JUAN ZAMORANO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAPIERS, France (AP) _ Worried by a weak attack, head coach
Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani has several strikers to choose from for
Paraguay's crucial World Cup group D match against Spain on Friday.
	   Carpeggiani has not announced any moves, but the top candidates
for the job are Hugo Brizuela, Cesar Ramirez and Aristides Rojas.
	   The Brazilian coach was generally pleased with his team's
scoreless tie against tough Bulgaria in its World Cup debut.
	   But he knows that to advance in the tournament's ``Group of
Death'' Paraguay must find a way to score, which means ineffective
striker Jose Cardozo will likely sit out the next match.
	   So low has Cardozo's stock sunk that he didn't even train with
the starters in Monday's practice. And so weak was the Paraguayan
attack against Bulgaria that its best scoring chance came on a free
kick by goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert which was tipped over the
bar by his opposite number.
	   Paraguay faces a Spanish squad desperate for its first points of
the tournament, after its shocking 3-2 loss against Nigeria in
their first match.
	   The Paraguayans meet the Nigerians in Toulouse a week from
Wednesday. But before they can start thinking that far ahead they
must first solve their scoring problems.
	   ``We have to find a faster rhythm, defend better at midfield and
not get desperate when passing the ball,'' Carpeggiani said.
	   During recent practices he has been urging midfielders Roberto
Acuna, Julio Enciso and Miguel Angel Benitez not to delay passes
and to keep moving forward.

World Cup: Humble yet ambitious, Narahashi hopes for goal against
</HEADLINE>
Croatia &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan defender Akira Narahashi
learned two important lessons from Zico while the Brazilian great
was with his J-League team Kashima Antlers.
	   First, to be always humble. Second, to always keep aiming for
the highest. And Narahashi has learned them both well.
	   In a team of nice guys, he is easily the nicest, never too busy
or stuck up to answer a question.
	   And, when World Cup novice Japan goes against Croatia Saturday,
Narahashi is going to be taking a shot for his first goal as a
member of the national team.
	   ``It's going to feel so great to score on such a great
international stage,'' he said Tuesday. ``Croatia is one or two
notches above us, so I plan to run, run, run for the full 90
minutes, whether the ball comes to me or not.''
	   Japan lost to Argentina 1-0 in its opener Sunday and desperately
needs a win against Croatia, if it hopes to advance past the first
round.
	   Narahashi said he looked forward to playing against defender
Robert Jarni, who has a stunningly powerful and accurate free kick.
	   ``He's someone who is getting worldwide attention,'' he said.
``Yet he can't be better than Roberto Carlos,'' he added, referring
to Brazil's defender, whose free kick Narahashi described as fast
as ``a ball of fire.''
	   Like many Japanese players, Narahashi has picked up a lot more
from the Brazilians than just good soccer. He makes a point to put
his left spikes on first for good luck.
	   ``Always the left,'' he said.
	   He also looks up to Jorginho, a fellow Antlers player who as
also on the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 World Cup.
	   ``Jorge told me the World Cup was great, but once I was here, I
was so caught up with just playing. All I remember is being totally
exhausted, that was it,'' Narahashi recalled.
	   ``I want to work harder to become as great as him,'' he said.
	   And Zico, now Brazil's technical coordinator?
	   ``He's like a god,'' Narahashi said.

OPEC faces uphill battle against worst crisis in years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ OPEC is staring at the weakest oil market since
the disaster year of 1986, and traders are betting the producers
can't find a quick fix, if they find one at all.
	   OPEC's average price plunged to dlrs 10.11 per barrel early this
week _ a 12-year low and less than half the official OPEC target of
dlrs 21 that analysts now call a joke.
	   Some of the biggest players in OPEC, including Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela, are promising a new round of production cutbacks _ after
an earlier emergency deal failed to rescue the market. Kuwait, the
United Emirates and non-OPEC member Oman pledged more cuts Tuesday
night.
	   The Kuwaiti oil minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that he hopes petroleum exporters can come up
with another 1.2 million barrels in production cuts by next week,
when OPEC holds its summer meeting.
	   But analysts aren't sure whether OPEC and its non-OPEC allies in
Mexico and Oman can slash production by even 1 million barrels a
day. And even if OPEC delivers, the glutted market might not
recover for months.
	   The cheap oil is a bargain for consumers, including
gasoline-guzzling U.S. motorists, but it's devastating for the oil
producers who planned their national budgets based on much higher
oil revenues.
	   ``It's pretty disastrous and there's not really anything they
can do to alleviate the troubles very quickly,'' said Leo Drollas,
chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
``They might as well write off '98.''
	   Ten of the 11 members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries pledged this spring to cut production by 1.245
million barrels a day. They have delivered most but not all of
those cuts, but Iraq complicated the formula by raising production
under a U.N. oil-for-food deal, leaving OPEC short of its target.
	   News that the United Nations might be closer to ending its
embargo of Iraqi crude exports, imposed after Iraq invaded fellow
OPEC member Kuwait in 1990, prompted oil traders to push prices
even lower.
	   If Iraq gets back in this year, the timing could hardly be worse
for the rest of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, also including Norway,
who have tried to rescue the market.
	   ``Never dismiss Iraq,'' warned Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London.
	   Oil rallied Tuesday on the futures markets, but in New York the
benchmark light sweet crude contract for July wound up 42 cents
higher at only dlrs 11.98 per barrel _ a depressing number for
anybody in an industry that was enjoying premium oil prices of more
than dlrs 20 per barrel late last year.
	   Even if OPEC were to announce another 1 million barrels of daily
production cuts _ the target many analysts are looking for _ it
could take months of adherence to those numbers to reduce the
supply glut. And OPEC's members have long lacked the willpower to
stick to their production agreements.
	   OPEC got itself into this jam by agreeing last winter to
increase production, just before the economic crisis in Asia
severely weakened global oil demand.
	   Although OPEC's stated production ceiling is 27.5 million
barrels a day, too high for current demand, outside experts say
output hovers above 28 million barrels.
	   Analysts aren't predicting a repeat of the 1986 carnage, but
they say the industry is changing dramatically.
	   As Big Oil adapted over the past decade to an era of cheaper
prices, cutting production costs and many thousands of jobs, OPEC
members have become ever more dependent on high oil revenues,
according to Peter Bogin, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris.
	   The huge oversupply, which could persist for months or years,
might force OPEC members to find ways to become less dependent on a
market they no longer can control, he said.
	   ``They have to say, `What's our role as a cartel, if we are a
cartel, or can we accept dlrs 6 or dlrs 8 oil?''' Bogin said.
	   OPEC formally opens its meeting on June 24 in Vienna, Austria.
OPEC members are Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Unfazed by 3-0 defeat to Brazil, Morocco player and fans looking

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Witnesses to their team's crushing 3-0
loss to defending champions Brazil, Moroccan fans said they were
going to vent their frustration - by going to a party.
	   ``Why cry about the loss,'' Atlas Lions supporter Khalil
Abdel-Rahman, 19, told The Associated Press Tuesday. ``It was
expected, and now I expect to have a good time downtown at the
concert.''
	   ``There's nothing like Rai (music) to help u through the tough
times,'' he said, referring to a kind of Arabic music that combines
traditional Arabic melodies with pop and Berber beats make popular
by North African musicians such as Cheb Mami, an Algerian star who
is scheduled to hold a concert in downtown Nantes after the match.
	   But responding to more than the allure of Rai, Moroccan fans and
players alike are taking this loss lightly mainly because it was
expected.
	   ``They were fast, skilled - everything Brazil is supposed to
be,'' defender Youssef Rossi, who plays for France's Rennes, told
the AP.
	   ``We did what we could after a slow start, but it just wasn't
enough,'' he added.
	   From the start of the competition, Morocco promised to surprise.
And in its match against Norway last week, the Atlas Lions
delivered, drawing 2-2 with a team that soccer experts believed
would give Brazil a run for its money.
	   More of the same was expected during this match.
	   But defensive errors, coupled with the players' inability to
properly mark their ever-elusive Brazilian counterparts, meant that
Coach Henri Michel's ``dream'' of showing Morocco's skill was not
to be.
	   ``We have to be realistic. Brazil was better than us tonight,
and the score proves it.''
	   Deportivo la Coruna midfielder Moustafa Hadji, the star of the
match against Norway, wasn't able to press the Brazilian defense
the way he did in the last match. Similarly, at least two chances
at goals by striker Salaheddine Bassir missed the mark because he
was out of position.
	   ``We made a number of mistakes throughout the match,'' team
captain Noureddine Naybet told the AP after the game.
	   ``We lost some good chances. We had problems keeping the
Brazilians marked. This was our mistake from the start,'' said
Naybet, who also plays for Deportivo la Coruna.
	   Though disappointed with the result, both players and fans alike
are confident that crumbling before Brazil is not the team's death
knell.
	   ``I'm not worried. I know that during the next match (against
Scotland), we will win,'' said fan Abdel-Rahman smiling, his voice
almost drowned out by his drum-pounding friends.
	   The players agree.
	   ``It will be difficult for Norway to beat Brazil,'' said
midfielder Hadji. ``We're going to concentrate our efforts on
Scotland.''

World Cup: Warning _ Brazil building momentum

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Mario Zagallo, from atop his experience on
all four of Brazil's World Cup champions, kept telling his players
it would come. Now they can feel it.
	   The momentum.
	   ``We're picking up steam,'' defender Roberto Carlos said. ``We
have lots of confidence in ourselves, and we're getting better.''
	   ``When we relax, the results start coming,'' added Cafu. ``We
knew we'd gather momentum once the Cup started, and that's what's
happening.''
	   Just ask Morocco. The Atlas Lions, coming off a 2-2 tie with
Norway that made soccer fans sit up, had their tails handed to them
by Brazil in their second game Tuesday. The 3-0 score didn't tell
the story of the one-sided play.
	   ``We played joyful, sparkling and efficient soccer,'' Zagallo
said Zagallo. ``I'm happy with everything _ the defense, the
midfield and the attack.''
	   The win also clinched first place in Group A for Brazil, the
first of 16 teams to qualify for the next round. Norway is second
with two points, followed by Scotland and Morocco with one.
	   Morocco did show some deft footwork, and, as usual, Deportivo La
Coruna star El Moustafa Hadji was in the middle of it. But the
Brazilian defense, which looked porous in a 2-1 win over Scotland,
shut them down. Goalie Taffarel didn't make a save all night.
	   ``This team just keeps getting better,'' he said. ``We have a
lot of personality, on and off the field.''
	   Two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo seemed on a crusade to
break his World Cup scoring drought, and it took him all of nine
minutes. Rivaldo hit him streaking up the middle, and Ronaldo
rifled a shot into the lower left corner to make it 1-0.
	   In the 18th minute, Said Chiba came in cleats high with a
vicious tackle that tore Ronaldo's shorts and left an ugly bruise
on his left thigh. But Russian referee Nikolai Levnikov didn't even
show a yellow card.
	   Meanwhile, the samba rhythm was pumping as the 40,000 fans at
Beaujoire stadium caught the party mood. The ``wave'' went around
in a festival of Brazilian green-and-yellow jerseys, face paint and
glitter wigs.
	   In injury time, Bebeto found Cafu on the right wing, and his
cross left Rivaldo in front of the goal for a tap-in and a 2-0
lead.
	   In the second period, it was Bebeto who got rolling.
	   After a near-miss on a header in the 47th minute, Bebeto took a
cross from Ronaldo and scored his first goal of the Cup, Brazil's
third of the night.
	   Then came showtime _ Rivaldo with a behind-the-back passes, Cafu
dancing a samba over the ball, and a Rivaldo-to-Ronaldo-to-Bebeto
gem that didn't go in but drew roars of appreciation.
	   Two games, two wins, a berth in the second round. Brazilians
could hardly ask for more. But they know more is coming. They can
feel it.
	   ``The truth is I don't care who we play,'' Rivaldo said. ``I
think we've grown and can beat anyone.''

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Maradona traveling to France, Yugoslav fans
national squad, trial of Iran's mayor rescheduled due to World Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona has changed his
mind. He's going to France for the World Cup after all.
	   ``I'm going to be there as the people are, with the people. I
don't want them to have a reception for me,'' said the former
Argentina national team captain, who will work as a television
commentator during the tournament.
	   Maradona had canceled his trip last week after he received a
two-year, 10-month suspended sentence for a 1994 shooting incident
involving journalists outside his country home. Maradona was found
guilty of assault with a weapon.
	   After the ruling Friday, Maradona said he was unable to travel
to France because he was ``depressed.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The World Cup has put justice on hold in
Iran.
	   Iranian judiciary has decided to postpone by four days the
hugely controversial corruption trial of Tehran's mayor to avoid a
clash with the country's World Cup match against the United States.
	   The trial of mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi has gripped the
nation, generating hundreds of newspaper stories. The walls of
Tehran are covered with spray-painted graffiti, in equal parts for
and against the mayor, who stands as a symbol of reformers in their
struggle against religious hardliners.
	   But soccer apparently can compete, especially Sunday's game
against the United States, with whom Iran's relations off the field
have been strained since the 1979 revolution overthrew the
pro-Western shah.
	   The judge, Mohseni Ejei, said many people asked him not to
postpone the trial, and he had no objection.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two very devoted Yugoslavian soccer fans had the
last word at the team's press conference in Saint-Etienne Monday
night.
	   Milorad Majkic, a 52-year-old university sports teacher and his
29-year-old student Zoran Blesic cycled 2,085 kilometers (1,292
miles) from their hometown of Futog, Yugoslavia, to see their team
in France.
	   The two congratulated coach Slobodan Santrac on the team's 1-0
win Sunday over Iran, the French organizing committee reported.
	   The cyclists trained nearly three months for the 10-day trip and
spend close to dlrs 3,000 of their savings. The trip went smoothly
until they reached Cannes, where professor Majkic fell and hurt
himself. He had to take the train to Saint-Etienne, leaving his
student to finish the last kilometers (miles) to the city alone.
	   They both reached Saint-Etienne on Saturday the 13th, in time to
see their team beat the Iranians.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONACO (AP) _ Training in the hot evening sunshine of the Cote
d'Azur, the Dutch World Cup squad was watched by the Netherlands'
``Ice Queen,'' double speedskating gold medalist Marianne Timmer.
	   Timmer, who sped to gold in the 1,000-meter and 1,500-meter
sprints at the Winter Olympics in Nagano earlier this year, was
joined Tuesday by Erben Wennemars, who was tipped for a
speedskating medal before his games were ended by a fall and
dislocated shoulder.
	   Also in the crowd watching the players was Arsenal coach Arsene
Wenger, club manager of Dutch-born Arsenal players Dennis Bergkamp
and Marc Overmars.
	   Wenger had no problems finding his way to the secluded AS Monaco
training ground the Dutch are using _ he coached Monaco before
moving to Japan and then to Arsenal.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan's World Cup squad is getting
some royal support.
	   Prince Takamado, cousin of Emperor Akihito and an avid soccer
fan, paid a special visit to this southeastern French resort to be
close to the team during the tournament.
	   Not satisfied with watching from the stands, the prince _
wearing the blue jersey of the national team _ started kicking the
ball around with physical coach Flavio, assistant coach Takeshi Ono
and other officials right by the field where the players were
practicing.
	   ``I was happy to be able to see Japan's top players practice for
the first time. It is going to help my soccer,'' said Prince
Takamado, who has his own soccer team nicknamed ``Tono,'' or ``Your
Highness.''
	   When asked whether the prince should be on his team, coach
Takeshi Okada laughed and said, ``I'll think about it.''

Japan's demanding workplace driving more workers to suicide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic JPN SUICIDES, AP Photo NY300 &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the 1980s, the notoriously hardworking Japanese
coined a term to describe workers who die suddenly after putting in
extremely long hours. The word is ``karoshi,'' or death from
overwork.
	   Japan has a new word for the '90s _ ``karojisatsu,'' suicides
from overwork.
	   Spurred by an economic slide throughout the decade, the number
of such suicides has swelled to an estimated 1,000 or more a year,
according to a group of lawyers involved in lawsuits over
work-related deaths.
	   Officially, the phenomenon is still a gray area.
	   Before 1995, there were only one or two applications at the
Labor Ministry for compensation in such cases. In 1995 and 1996,
they hit double-digits. In 1997, the total was 22.
	   But officials acknowledge the vast majority of overwork-related
suicides do not lead to legal action, and they are not
differentiated from other suicides. Police put the number of all
work-related suicides at about 1,300 a year, but have no
classification for suicide from overwork.
	   Still, experts say the problem is clear.
	   ``Suicides from overwork are becoming a serious problem,'' said
Kazunari Tamaki, a lawyer representing dozens of clients seeking
damages for job-related deaths of family members. ``The myth that
Japanese management is benevolent is full of lies.''
	   The victims of ``karojisatsu'' range from workers toiling at
greasy factories to businessmen sent abroad on difficult missions.
What they tend to have in common is having regularly worked 10 to
12 hours a day, with no days off, for months.
	   Oddly enough, they rarely blame their companies, Tamaki said.
Instead, they leave behind notes apologizing for not having done
better.
	   Tadashi Shimonaka, 46, was typical.
	   Shimonaka clocked at least 80 hours of overtime a month at
Hitachi Zosen, a shipbuilder.
	   The firm had been slashing the workforce for years, and
Shimonaka had no choice but to work alone on its rudder design
project. He often complained of chest pains, and told his wife the
overwork was killing him.
	   One Monday in March 1993, he left for work as usual. His drowned
body was found on a nearby beach two days later.
	   ``I no longer have the strength to go on. I am really sorry,''
he said in his suicide note.
	   This past December, Shimonaka's wife sued.
	   ``The company snatched away from us the life of my husband who
worked so hard to do a good job,'' said Keiko Shimonaka. ``The
people at the company did not care about a human being's life.''
	   Officials at Hitachi Zosen contend Shimonaka's suicide was not
work-related, but decline to discuss specifics of the case.
	   In a way, suicide is considered an honorable action in Japan. It
is often seen as a kind of atonement or way of taking
responsibility. Scandal-tainted politicians and businessmen often
make headlines by killing themselves. In May, tens of thousands of
young people turned out to mourn the suicide of one of Japan's most
popular rock stars.
	   Japan's overall suicide rate is high, totaling 17.2 per 100,000
people. That compares with 12 in the United States and 7.5 in
England, but is well below Finland's 27.3, according to Japan's
Health Ministry.
	   Suicides from overwork underline the intense commitment and
devotion expected in Japan's corporate world, where protests to
superiors or simply quitting aren't considered viable options by
many workers.
	   Mid-career job changes are difficult in Japan and usually entail
steps down, rather than opportunities for advancement. Job-hopping
is still reserved for the adventurous.
	   The Japanese workplace is fraught with intense social pressures.
Being liked by coworkers and maintaining a harmonious team usually
take precedence over fair assessments of performance or ability.
	   This means employees tend to get the same pay and the same
seniority-based promotions, regardless of productivity. Those
workers who can produce are leaned on much harder, but don't
necessarily get monetary or status rewards.
	   But overwork suicides may be having an impact on attitudes
toward corporate responsibility.
	   Last year, Ichiro Oshima, a 24-year-old worker at a Tokyo
advertising agency, became the first suicide from overwork upheld
by the courts as a company liability.
	   Oshima averaged 30 minutes to two hours of sleep a night and
didn't get a single day off for 17 months. Still, Dentsu, his
employer, argued that personal troubles were behind Oshima's 1991
suicide.
	   The Tokyo High Court ruled otherwise, and ordered Dentsu to pay
89 million yen _ about dlrs 654,000 _ to Oshima's family.
	   Such cases are rare because proving overwork directly led to
suicide is very difficult.
	   Chieko Iijima, who lost her husband to suicide from overwork,
filed a lawsuit last year seeking worker compensation for his
death. The 30-year-old welder hanged himself after putting in 150
hours of monthly overtime.
	   Whatever the outcome of her suit, she says, she will never look
at work the same again.
	   ``People start out working for their livelihood, for their
families, for happiness,'' she said. ``Then why does it have to end
up this way?''

Albright faults Milosevic for not withdrawing Serb troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
again rejecting U.S. demands for a pullback of forces in Kosovo,
the Clinton administration said it will keep warships and jets
ready, should NATO decide on military action.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen sought Tuesday to maintain pressure on the Yugoslav
leader after limited progress in Milosevic's talks in Moscow with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   In testimony to Congress, and then at a news conference,
Albright declared that NATO was going ahead with contingency plans
for attacks on the Serbs and warned Milosevic that the allies were
more united than it might seem.
	   ``While Milosevic may be trying to find differences, the bottom
line is we are united in the fact that what is going on there is
unacceptable, and that action needs to be taken,'' Albright said at
the State Department after a scathing verbal attack on the Yugoslav
leader in testimony before the Senate Foreign Operations
Subcommittee.
	   Accusing the Serbian forces in the predominantly Albanian
province of killing civilians and depopulating villages, Albright
said bluntly: ``The Serbs are out there torching the various
populations.''
	   Cohen, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington from
Europe, said a NATO decision on the use of force could come
quickly.
	   ``I believe the forces will remain in the region and will be
prepared to follow through with any military action, should any
ever be called for and agreed to,'' he said.
	   On Monday, NATO, in a show of force, sent warplanes into the
skies over the Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia to reinforce
the still-unfulfilled U.S. demand that Milosevic pull troops from
civilian population centers in Kosovo.
	   The NATO allies fear that the Kosovo crisis could spark a wide
conflagration in the Balkans, with refugees spilling into
neighboring states, as thousands have already fled into Albania.
	   Some 250 people have died and tens of thousands been made
homeless since Milosevic took the offensive in February against
Albanian nationalists in Kosovo. The Clinton administration is
demanding the Yugoslav president reverse his 1989 revocation of
limited self-rule for the population, which is about 90 percent
ethnic Albanian, and negotiate the Albanians' grievances.
	   What was not clear Tuesday was whether Milosevic had given
enough ground in his talks in Moscow with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to cause the allies to shelve any military attack and rely
on diplomacy to try to resolve the conflict.
	   Albright, on the one hand, said NATO planning was going forward.
But on the other, she said ``that is being done in support of
diplomacy.''
	   Crediting Yeltsin with applying pressure on Milosevic, Albright
said there was ``some progress'' in three areas _ treatment of
refugees, setting up international monitoring and in Milosevic's
apparent willingness to resume negotiations with the ethnic
Albanian political leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   But she said any talks must move beyond preliminary
conversations to sustained negotiations, on a weekly basis, for
instance.
	   Where Albright was most downbeat was on Milosevic's failure to
promise a unilateral withdrawal of the Yugoslav army and special
forces to their barracks.
	   ``That has not happened,'' she said. ``It doesn't matter what
the words are if there is action that would, in fact, show there is
some withdrawal and the level of violence decreases.''
	   White House press secretary Mike McCurry took a more upbeat
view. He said Milosevic had ``taken some steps and done some things
that, we think, move in the right direction.''
	   But, like Albright, McCurry singled out the actions of Yugoslav
troops and Milosevic's refusal to agree to an unconditional
withdrawal.
	   ``There's no justification for continuation of the brutal
campaign of violence by Serb security forces, and the withdrawal of
Serb security forces is fundamental,'' McCurry said.
	   Earlier, at the Senate Foreign Operations subcommittee, Albright
was asked about the Bush administration's Christmas 1992 warning of
unilateral U.S. action to shield Kosovo. She said the ``Christmas
warning has never been made public specifically,'' but added that
``all options are on the table. Nothing has been removed from the
table.''
	   The key U.S. demands, endorsed Friday at a foreign ministers
meeting in London by Russia and six other U.S. allies, are a
cease-fire, a pullback of Serb forces, resumption of negotiations
with Albanian leaders, a monitoring system and return of refugees
to their homes.

<TEXT>
	   MERIDA, Venezuela (AP) _ Eighteen years ago, Manuel Da Silva
Oliveira had a small snack bar that offered just four ice cream
flavors.
	   Then he saw a television show about a Brazilian who made
avocado-flavored ice cream, and Oliveira got an inspiration that
has brought him fame _ as an unparalleled creator of bizarre ice
creams.
	   After watching the show, Oliveira went to work trying to
recreate the avocado concoction. ``I lost 45 kilos (99 pounds) of
ice cream because it kept crystallizing,'' he recalls. ``After 50
kilos (110 pounds), I achieved it.''
	   He introduced more new flavors and business took off. Today you
can wander into his Coromoto ice cream parlor and ask for some tuna
fish ice cream. If that doesn't suit your taste, you can always try
onion, spinach or a perennial favorite, fried pork rind.
	   Oliveira's inventiveness has won him a place in the Guinness
Book of Records as owner of the ice cream shop with the most
flavors. At last count he was up to 709.
	   ``I wanted to create something that didn't exist in the world,''
says Oliveira, a mirthful 68-year-old who proudly proclaims that
most people, including his wife, called him crazy when he started.
	   The Portuguese immigrant's shop is a local landmark with flavors
like carrot, tomato, shrimp, squid, beans, trout, spaghetti, corn,
rose petal, garlic, champagne and chili pepper (yes, it's hot).
	   Amazingly, many don't taste as disgusting as they sound. The
trout is creamy, sweet, and not unpleasant _ unless you don't fancy
chunks of fish floating about in your ice cream. The same goes for
the shredded beef.
	   ``You think it can't possibly be true, but when you try it the
combination is delicious,'' said Elizabeth Sanchez, an engineer on
vacation who stopped by recently to try a scoop of shrimp and a
scoop of beer. It was good, she said, even though ``you feel kind
of strange'' eating it.
	   Later, she had a mix of coffee and liqueurs dubbed ``Coffee and
the Scent of Woman'' after a Colombian soap opera.
	   When Oliveira first started out, professors at a local
university, fearful the bizarre ice creams could be dangerous, sent
students to smuggle out samples to be tested in laboratories. The
professors never released their findings and customers kept pouring
in.
	   Oliveira says his recipes, all with natural ingredients, are a
family secret. The only other people who work in the store are a
daughter, a nephew and a son-in-law.
	   He cooks the fish, spaghetti and meat in the back kitchen, then
mixes it with ice cream. Oliveira says he has no problem selling
all the flavors he makes.
	   The Coromoto _ named after Venezuela's patron saint _ also
offers more traditional flavors such as chocolate, vanilla,
strawberry and coconut. They're mainly for children, who often are
``scared'' by the unusual flavors, Oliveira says.
	   Not all 709 flavors are offered every day. Customers choose from
a rotating menu with 60 flavors. The top sellers are corn, rose
petals, trout and a concoction Oliveira recently came up with
called ``France-98'' in honor of the World Cup soccer competition
in France. It includes champagne, brandy, wine, almonds and nuts.
	   The business has attracted visitors from as far away as Germany,
Japan, New Zealand, the United States and Russia, who also come to
this picturesque city of snow-capped Andean mountains to ride the
world's longest and highest cable car. Photos and cards from
customers along with a list of all the flavors fill the store's
walls.
	   On his best day ever, Oliveira says he sold 1,800 cups of ice
cream in eight hours _ about one every 15 seconds.

Dollar weaker, Tokyo stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen early
Wednesday on speculation the United States may try to help stem the
yen's recent slide. Tokyo stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 142.72 yen in early trading, down 2.42 yen
from 145.14 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 143.47 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 147.35 points, or 1.00 percent, to 14,867.73 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei average fell
104.79 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   The dollar's drop came in line with overnight movements in New
York, where the currency fell from near eight-year highs following
a Japanese newspaper report that a top U.S. Treasury official was
planning to visit Japan.
	   The Treasury Department said late Tuesday it was considering
dispatching Summers to Tokyo for emergency talks over Japan's
stagnant economy and sagging yen.
	   Details of the possible trip were undecided, but Japan's Nihon
Keizai financial daily reported Wednesday morning Summers would
visit Japan Thursday.
	   In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that
the United States continues to be concerned about the weak yen.
	   ``It's been of enormous concern to us,'' Rubin said. ``We have
been very actively involved in talking to Japan for the past 18
months, publicly and privately, about weakness in the economy.''
	   Concern that the falling yen could throw other Asian countries
into further economic turmoil has also led Asian officials to urge
Japan to stabilize its economy.
	   Market participants expect Summers will prod Japan to step up
efforts to boost economic growth and accelerate the write-off of
problem loans at Japanese banks.
	   Some traders also took the news of Summers' possible dispatch to
Japan as suggesting that U.S. and Japanese officials may be
considering some kind of joint action, such as yen-buying
intervention in currency markets, to boost the ailing currency.
	   On the stock market, prices gained on the yen's rise against and
higher futures prices.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 9.56 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,166.03. The TOPIX
closed down 10.74 points, or 0.92 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.215 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.210 percent, driving its price down to 111.88 yen from 111.93
yen.

	   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories (AP) _ For 10 years, Charles
Fipke chipped away at rocks strewn across some of the most desolate
land in North America. His persistence paid off.
	   In October, the continent's first world-class diamond mine is
scheduled to begin production on a tract of tundra and lakes in the
remote heartland of Canada's Northwest Territories.
	   The industrial complex is designed to operate every day for the
next 25 years in harsh arctic weather, producing high-quality
diamonds with a projected value of more than dlrs 7 billion.
	   Other mines are expected to open in the region over the next few
years, and experts predict Canada will soon be producing more than
10 percent of the world's gem-quality diamonds.
	   Fipke, a geologist from British Columbia, wasn't the first
prospector to hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories, but
he was perhaps the most dogged. Starting in 1981, he followed the
path of Ice Age glaciers across the sparsely populated region,
looking for tiny mineral traces in the surface rocks that would
signal the presence of diamond-bearing ore underneath. It took him
a decade to find what he was looking for.
	   ``Everybody thought he was a nut,'' said Mike Vaydik, general
manager of the Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines. ``But that
one guy's singlemindness has started a whole new industry for
Canada.''
	   Fipke's prospecting company, Dia Met Minerals, entered into a
partnership with Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co., one of
the biggest mining companies in the world. BHP bought 51 percent of
what is now known as the Ekati mine and is spending about dlrs 750
million to develop it.
	   It has been a complicated project, logistically and politically.
	   The site _ 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of the Arctic Circle
and 185 miles (300 kilometers) from the nearest supply sources in
Yellowknife _ is accessible only by air or by an ice road usable
for about 12 weeks in mid-winter.
	   This winter, before the spring thaw began turning the area into
an impenetrable maze of lakes, bogs and boulders, 2,100 truckloads
of supplies moved over the ice road from Yellowknife, the
territorial capital. The cargo included 15 million gallons (56
million liters) of fuel _ a year's supply for an operation that
must keep running even during wintertime bouts of minus-40
(minus-40 C) temperatures.
	   Employees will work two solid weeks of 12-hour shifts, then fly
out for two-week breaks. No alcohol is allowed at the mine, and
employees will be subjected to body searches and
surveillance-camera monitoring.
	   On the political front, Broken Hill has worked out accords with
three Indian tribes and the territory's community of Inuit. The
company is providing job training and scholarships to the native
communities and has pledged to allocate about 30 percent of the
mine's 600 permanent jobs to aboriginals.
	   Stephen Kakfwi, a former chief of the Dene tribe and now the
territory's economic development minister, praised BHP as ``a good
corporate citizen'' that has kept its promises on hiring and local
purchasing of supplies.
	   The company also went through a 2 1-2 -year environmental review
that Vaydik, the Chamber of Mines official, described as the
toughest ever for a Canadian mining project.
	   Some major environmental groups initially were hostile to the
project, but criticism ebbed after Broken Hill detailed its
conservation and reclamation plans. Key challenges include
minimizing water pollution on a tract that contains 8,000 lakes and
preserving a migration corridor for a herd of 450,000 caribou.
	   The diamonds are buried in cylinder-like deposits of volcanic
rock called kimberlite, covered by shallow lakes that will be
drained to create open-pit mines.
	   Initially, the mine will process 9,000 tons of ore a day to
produce a quantity of diamonds that would fit in a can of coffee.
The projected yearly output _ roughly 4 million carats of diamonds
_ would earn dlrs 350 million and constitute about 4 percent of
worldwide production.
	   Fipke's discovery triggered a two-year diamond rush in the
Northwest Territories, one of the largest mineral-staking rushes
ever in North America.
	   The other project closest to fruition is the proposed Diavik
mine, scheduled to begin production in 2001. It is close to the
Ekati mine and is expected to earn comparable revenues for the
Anglo-Australian operator, Rio Tinto Ltd., and its Canadian
partners.
	   The diamond boom couldn't have come at a better time for the
Northwest Territories, where the important gold industry and other
mining sectors have been battered by falling prices.
	   ``Thank God the diamonds are here, or we'd really be in
trouble,'' Vaydik said.
	   One of the key unanswered questions for the Ekati mine is how
Broken Hill will market its diamonds. The company is negotiating
with De Beers, the world's No. 1 producer and marketer of diamonds,
but BHP spokesman Graham Nicholls said Ekati's diamonds will be
marketed through ``multiple channels'' that will bypass De Beers at
least partially.
	   De Beers opened its first Canadian office in Vancouver, British
Columbia, in January, confirming its keen interest in Northwest
Territories diamonds.
	   ``Canada will become a very important diamond producer,'' the
office's manager, Tom Beardmore-Gray, said in a telephone
interview. ``We would hope, at some stage, to have our own mine.''
	   Nicholls and Beardmore-Gray both indicated some sort of deal was
likely between BHP and De Beers.
	   ``You can't be in the diamond business without dealing with De
Beers,'' said Vaydik. ``No matter what the other companies might
say, they like De Beers because it keeps the market stable.''
	   De Beers produces about 50 percent of the world's diamonds and
markets about 70 percent of the world's gem diamonds through its
sales arm, the Central Selling Organization.
	   The diamond market has been sluggish in recent months, largely
because economic problems have reduced demand in Japan, which along
with the United States is the biggest purchaser of diamond jewelry.
But long-term prospects are considered bright as demand grows in
Asia and Russia.

Amnesty International says Brazilian activist was unfairly tried
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A leader of Brazil's landless
movement, sentenced to 26 years for his part in two killings, did
not receive a fair trial, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
	   The human rights group called for an impartial retrial of Jose
Rainha Jr., one of the leaders of the Landless Rural Workers
Movement and said he was a potential prisoner of conscience, in a
report that was to be issued Wednesday.
	   Amnesty International uses the term ``prisoner of conscience,''
for people punished for their ideals rather than for criminal acts.
	   Rainha was found guilty last November of participating in the
1989 killings of a farmer and police officer that occurred when
movement members stormed a farm in Pedro Canario 370 miles (600
kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro. He was sentenced to 26 years in
prison.
	   The landless movement promotes the takeover of land it considers
unproductive as a way to pressure the government into speeding up
its agrarian reform program.
	   Amnesty Internation's report was to call for stepped-up pressure
up against police violence and maintains that human rights
violations continue against Indians and the landless, Fiona
Macaulay, the organization's Brazilian researcher, said by
telephone from London.
	   The report, however, praised the government for creating a
National Human Rights Secretary. It also backed moves to protect
crime witnesses and reform the country's police and criminal
justice system.
	   Rainha remains free pending a retrial, which Brazilian law
grants anyone sentenced to more than 20 years for a single crime.
Rainha is due to be retried later this year in Vitoria, the capital
of Espirito Santo, a move that Amnesty International has backed.
	   Amnesty International has said in the past that there is
``compelling evidence'' that Rainha was falsely convicted of the
killings.
	   At the first trial, defense lawyers argued that 14 members of
the 21-member jury pool had links with local farmers, and three
were related to one of the shooting victims.
	   ``His trial did not meet international standards of
impartiality. If he is jailed under the same circumstances at his
retrial we will consider him a prisoner of conscience,'' Macaulay
said Tuesday.

FBI files _ on Hitler, Amelia and UFOs _ on the Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-FEA-US-FBI-Elvis &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE FEINSILBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Dear FBI: You'll want to know that I just saw
Adolf Hitler and a woman in Seat 40, Car 10 of the Illinois Central
Railroad. ...
	   Dear FBI: I saw an unidentified aerial object. It moved due
north, it was three times the size of the evening star, it was
stationary for five to 10 seconds, it was blue but turned white and
then ``went out like a light. ...''
	   Dear FBI: About the disappearance of Amelia Earhart: I believe
there were stowaways. After takeoff, the plane was taken over by
people from some other country. ...
	   Anyone with computer access to the Internet now can browse
through FBI files on some of the cases that have intrigued millions
of Americans.
	   So far, the FBI has made 16,000 pages from 37 investigations
accessible. It intends ultimately to post all 1.3 million pages of
files already opened to the public and available for perusal in FBI
headquarters. Names of informants and correspondents are blacked
out for privacy.
	   The FBI's Internet motive is simple: When people request copies
of files, it is cheaper to refer them to the Web than to make
photocopies, says spokesman John Collingwood. Since last July, 1.4
million visits to the FBI site have been recorded. Four hundred
people work full time handling such requests.
	   The bureau started with historic cases that once were matters of
intense interest.
	   Among them: the explosion of the German zeppelin Hindenburg in
1937; the 1940 pickax murder in Mexico of exiled Russian
revolutionary Leon Trotsky; the 1962 escape of three Alcatraz
inmates who fashioned a raft from rubber raincoats.
	   Or the 1934 shooting by FBI agents of John Dillinger; the
disappearance of flying pioneer Earhart in 1937 over the Pacific
Ocean; the St. Valentine's Day killing of seven members of the Bugs
Moran gang in Chicago in 1929; the crime spree of Bonnie Parker and
Clyde Barrow that ended with their roadside killing by police in
1934.
	   Some don't involve criminal investigations at all: the 1972 gift
of dlrs 75,000 by John Lennon to the Allamuchy Tribe, a group that
planned to disrupt the Republican Convention later that year; the
1953 congressional investigation into why actress Lucille Ball
registered to vote as a communist in 1936. (It was at her
grandfather's insistence.)
	   As for Hitler, reports that he was alive kept coming for years
after World War II, possibly because no body was ever recovered
after he committed suicide in his bunker in Berlin as allied forces
closed in. Historians now generally agree that that the body was
burned to ashes.
	   In the bureau's mail about Hitler was a letter from someone who
had registered in a hotel in Quebec, Canada, and was dumbfounded to
look around the lobby and see a man who ``appeared identical in
every respect with Adolf Hitler.''
	   Another correspondent claimed to have seen Hitler jump out of a
railroad boxcar. Another saw him in a New York boarding house.
Another reported that Hitler had written him recently from
Argentina. Another said Hitler _ minus mustache _ had arrived by
submarine in Argentina with a group of henchmen and headed for the
Andes.
	   The most popular file concerns unidentified flying objects, even
though these sightings chiefly fell into the purview of the Air
Force. UFO observations became so common five decades ago that the
bureau devised a 28-question form for use in questioning
eyewitnesses. People were asked about the ``apparent size,''
``color of object,'' ``shape,'' ``sound and odor,'' ``maneuvers,''
``manner of disappearance.'' Then there is a line for ``comments of
interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer.''
	   Also on file is a July 8, 1947, teletype from the Dallas office
reporting a call from the Air Force advising ``that an object
purporting to be a flying disc was recovered near Roswell, N.M.,
this date.'' That was a critical day for UFO followers.
	   Like so many other historically interesting cases, this one came
to nought: Lots of questions asked, lots of paperwork generated,
but no conclusions reached. Case closed.
	   That was certainly the outcome of some other Hitler documents of
interest for people with a what-if bent: These were letters
received in 1933 by the German ambassador reporting overheard
conversations _ in Yiddish _ plotting the assassination of the new
German chancellor.

Hoover made himself scarce when a long-haired Presley visited
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Elvis Presley had visited President Nixon 10
days earlier, but when he came calling at FBI headquarters 28 years
ago, Director J. Edgar Hoover made himself scarce. An aide had
advised that Presley was ``not the type of individual whom the
director would want to meet.''
	   Memos concerning Presley's FBI visit have been posted on the
FBI's Web page on the Internet. Previously they were open to the
public, but to read them people had to visit FBI headquarters or
write to ask for copies.
	   ``It is noted at the present time he (Presley) is wearing his
hair down to his shoulders and indulges in the wearing of all sorts
of exotic dress,'' wrote FBI official M.A. Jones in advising
against a Hoover handshake with the king of rock 'n' roll. ``I
concur,'' Hoover wrote on the bottom of the page.
	   That was Dec. 31, 1970, just 10 days after Presley sought _ and
got _ an Oval Office meeting with Nixon to discuss ideas for
fighting drugs. A photograph that resulted _ showing Nixon and
Presley with big smiles _ is the National Archives' most frequently
requested historic photo.
	   After Presley visited the FBI with six of his security people,
Jones sent in a memo saying everything went smoothly.
	   ``Despite his rather bizarre personal appearance, Presley seemed
a sincere, serious minded individual who expressed concern over
some of the problems confronting our country, particularly those
involving young people,'' Jones wrote.
	   Presley also took the opportunity to knock some competitors for
young people's affections _ the Beatles.
	   He said the British singing group ``laid the groundwork for many
of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy
unkempt appearances and suggestive music,'' Jones reported.
	   Presley also criticized actress Jane Fonda and other
entertainers ``for the way they have poisoned young minds by
disparaging the United States in their public statements and
unsavory activities,'' Jones added.
	   He noted that Presley had volunteered to Nixon to help fight
narcotics and that Nixon had given him a badge of the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. ``Presley was carrying this badge in
his pocket and displayed it,'' Jones said.
	   Presley also noted that he was occasionally approached by people
with motives ``not in the best interest of this country'' and
volunteered to tell the FBI of these approaches.
	   He also told FBI officials that he had read Hoover's books about
the communist threat and felt that no one ``has ever done as much
for his country,'' Jones wrote.
	   Responded Hoover, in a letter to Presley four days later: ``Your
generous comments concerning this bureau and me are appreciated,
and you may be sure we will keep in mind your offer to be of
assistance.''

Hashimoto Cabinet approval rating hits new low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Public support for Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's Cabinet has fallen to 29.9 percent, its lowest level
ever, Japan's largest newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The approval rating declined 2.8 percentage points from a
similar survey conducted in April, according to poll results
published by the Yomiuri newspaper.
	   The Cabinet's disapproval rating jumped 2.4 percentage points to
57.3 percent, the highest level so far, it said.
	   The results come as the latest blow to Hashimoto and his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party ahead of elections next month for the
upper house of Parliament.
	   Hashimoto's public support ratings have suffered as the Japanese
economy's performance has deteriorated in recent months. He has
been prime minister since January 1996.
	   The survey, conducted last weekend, followed the government's
announcement Friday that the economy posted its worst year of
growth in more than two decades and has slid into recession.
	   Among those polled who disapproved of Hashimoto's
administration, 47 percent said they were unhappy with Cabinet
policies. More than half of them singled out economic policy for
criticism.
	   In April, the Cabinet announced a 16 trillion yen (dlrs 112
billion) economic stimulus package of temporary tax cuts and
massive spending on public works projects.
	   Many business leaders and opposition politicians, however, have
called on the government to enact deeper, more permanent income tax
relief to jump start the moribund economy.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper surveyed 3,000 eligible voters, of which
1,995 responded. As is customary with Japanese opinion polls, no
margin of error was provided.

Mexico negotiating team tries to make contact with Zapatistas

<TEXT>
	   LA REALIDAD, Mexico (AP) _ Seeking to restart stalled peace
talks after a recent round of violence, a group of legislators
visited a Chiapas jungle village, hoping to find Zapatista rebels
and persuade them to rejoin negotiations.
	   The members of the multiparty mediation commission known by the
Spanish acronym Cocopa on Tuesday traveled to La Realidad, a
village near the Guatemalan border where commanders of the
Zapatista rebels often made public appearances in the past.
	   They waited hours under burning sun, but the rebel leadership
remained elusive and uncommunicative, as it has been for the last
year.
	   The only person the legislators met in La Realidad who would
accept their letter to the Zapatistas was a thin, T-shirt-clad
Indian who identified himself only as Miguel.
	   Miguel said that even the pro-rebel villagers in La Realidad had
lost contact with the Zapatista leadership and that he couldn't
promise a response to the Cocopa proposal for a meeting with them.
	   ``With this document we hope to re-establish communication with
the Zapatistas,'' said German Martinez Caceres, president-in-turn
of the legislative group.
	   ``We believe the government should be prudent and the
(Zapatistas) should break the silence,'' said Martinez Caceres, the
government Notimex news service reported.
	   The Zapatista rebels, who staged a brief uprising in January
1994 in the name of Indian rights and greater democracy, broke off
peace talks with the government two years ago, claiming it had
failed to abide by a preliminary agreement.
	   The government has repeatedly called on the Zapatistas to resume
negotiations, even as it has stepped up pressure on the rebels.
	   On June 10, eight villagers and two police officers died in the
township of El Bosque when hundreds of police and soldiers tried to
dissolve a pro-Zapatista town council and arrest 15 suspects.
	   Another group of legislators from the mediation commission
visited El Bosque Tuesday.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the governor of
Chiapas said the raid averted an even deadlier clash between rival
communities.
	   Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen said Monday that the government was
trying to reestablish ``the rule of law'' and that the huge number
of security forces were needed because ambushes and killings are
common in the region.
	   It was the third time recently that hundreds of troops and
police have raided areas in Chiapas to arrest Zapatista supporters
who have set up shadow governments that challenge state authority.
	   Albores Guillen indicated that the government has not begun
investigating claims that police and soldiers looted homes of
villagers in El Bosque or that it mistreated prisoners.
	   Meanwhile, in an unrelated incident, thieves in the town of
Suchiate, Chiapas shot two people and wounded three others with a
hand grenade after robbing a currency exchange near the Guatemalan
border, the Televisa television network reported.

U.S. lawyer takes search for guerrilla husband to human rights

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ American lawyer Jennifer Harbury
broke down in tears during four hours of testimony about her
six-year quest to wrest information from the Guatemalan government
about the death of her guerrilla husband.
	   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared a short recess
Tuesday to allow Harbury to continue her testimony about her
investigation into the death of Efrain Bamaca, a guerrilla leader
Harbury believes was killed while in custody by the Guatemalan
military in 1993.
	   ``The army always told me things like `Look, your husband ran
away with another woman,' or `Yeah, we'll comb the mountains to see
if we can capture him,'' Harbury said.
	   Harbury's testimony revealed her own tragedy, as well as
Bamaca's.
	   ``I know that he was alive until at least March, 1993 ...
imagine it, I could have gotten him out alive,'' she told the
court.
	   Harbury took the case to the court, a regional body, after the
Guatemalan government allegedly tried to block her efforts to find
out about her husband's fate.
	   If the court rules in her favor, Harbury could press Guatemala
to find her husband's body, identify the people responsible for the
killing and pay her compensation.
	   Bamaca, a guerrilla commander, disappeared after a skirmish with
the army. Military officials first said he died in combat and had
been buried, but Harbury discovered that the body in the grave was
not her husband's. The army then denied any knowledge of having
captured him and has admitted to no wrongdoing.
	   Also testifying Tuesday was former Guatemalan guerrilla Santiago
Cabrera Lopez, who said he saw Bamaca in military prisons on two
occasions. Cabrera Lopez said Bamaca was in ``lamentable''
condition the last time he saw him.
	   With the help of a U.S. legislator, Harbury obtained Central
Intelligence Agency documents in 1995 indicating that Bamaca had
been captured March 12, 1992, kept prisoner for most of the year,
then executed under orders of Guatemalan Col. Julio Roberto
Alpirez, a paid CIA informant.
	   The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, a division of the
Organization of American States, determined that Bamaca had been
kidnapped, jailed, tortured and killed by the army.
	   It referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights, which is expected to hear testimony for four days.
	   In addition to the case before the Human Rights court, Harbury
is suing the U.S. government and the CIA in federal court in
Washington, accusing them of collaborating in Bamaca's death and
claiming they committed fraud against her and several members of
Congress.
	   She said she will pursue the case until she obtains all the
information in the hands of U.S. security agencies.

	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ After declaring an ambitious bid to widen
its ranks by 11 countries firmly on track, the European Union now
faces the hard part: Who is going to pay the bill?
	   The 15 EU leaders ended a two-day summit Tuesday with
disagreements over how to revamp the union's finances. They gave
themselves until March 1999 to resolve the squabble pitting
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden against the rest.
	   ``An extremely tough political debate,'' was the way Portuguese
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres described the summit. His Dutch
counterpart, Wim Kok, said ``the knives have been sharpened.''
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl insists Germany pays too much into
the union and gets back too little. It pays dlrs 11.9 billion more
than it gets back and wants that reduced by a third.
	   The Dutch, Austrian and Swedish governments also feel their
``net payments,'' the difference between what they pay and what
they receive, is too large.
	   ``This is not a declaration of war. We seek fair treatment,''
said Kohl. Facing Sept. 27 general elections, Kohl has made his
call for reducing Germany's EU contribution, almost one-third of
the dlrs 86 billion budget this year _ a vote getter.
	   Financial reform is not in doubt. All agree the EU must change
its budget before it can take in Cyprus and at least five East
European nations by 2004. After that, five more eastern neighbors
will be admitted.
	   However, poorer EU nations, especially Spain, fear losing funds
to the rust-belt of the former East Germany and candidate nations
further east.
	   French President Jacques Chirac sees another problem. ``I'm not
in favor of a reduction of the German contribution, because it
would mean an increase in the French contribution.''
	   As the leaders argued over their membership fees, no one was
saying how much each member pays into the EU, or gets in return.
The European Commission never issues such figures, arguing that
benefits cannot be measured in cold money figures.
	   Consequently, individual governments do their own calculations
and often give politically motivated figures.
	   That will change. The EU leaders ordered the EU executive
Commission to report on current payments, identifying how much each
country pays and receives.
	   The EU now limits budget contributions to 1.27 percent of each
member's gross national product. Austerity-minded northern members
believe that limit must not be raised and that the EU's enlargement
can be financed by slashing agricultural subsidies. Poorer southern
European countries _ popularly known as the EU's Club Med nations _
want it to be raised.
	   Key to budget reform is the fate of EU spending on farm
subsidies. Despite repeated cost-saving drives, farm spending still
accounts fro close to half of the EU budget.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Two U.S. firms and one British company
are the only bidders for the Guyana Electricity Corp., government
officials have announced.
	   The U.S. bidders are Leucadia National Corp. of Salt Lake City
and Eldorado Energy and Industrial Development Inc. of Silver
Spring, Maryland. The other bidder was the London-based
Commonwealth Development Corporation in partnership with ESB
International Ltd. of Ireland.
	   The deadline for bids was Monday. The winner will be announced
June 26, Winston Brassington, head of the government's
privatization agency, said Tuesday.
	   The state-owned electric corporation is on the block a second
time after Canadian firm Saskatchewan Power Commercial canceled its
purchase of the company in January. Saskatchewan Power officials
cited political violence following Guyana's Dec. 15 elections.
	   In May, the Guyanese government said it planned to sue
Saskatchewan Power over the collapsed deal.
	   Saskatchewan Power had won a 50 percent stake in the company
with a bid of dlrs 22.5 million. Leucadia had placed second and the
Commonwealth Development Corp. third in the first sale.
	   Texas-Ohio Energy and Corporation Hydro Energy of Quebec,
competitors in the first sale, did not submit bids.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to ADD graf with Smith and Carlos invited and Smith
attending. &QL;

 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ The 1968 U.S. men's Olympic track and field
team had a certain magic. It was also immensely talented and
controversial.
	   ``It was a very special team,'' long jumper Bob Beamon said.
``This team was so great. We could do so many things. Anyone
running the mile on down could run the 100 meters and win.''
	   That year, the United States was rocked by the assassinations of
Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, civil rights
demonstrations and anti-war protests.
	   Into the mix came the Olympics in Mexico City. Black Americans
and Africans threatened to boycott the games, and shortly before
the opening ceremony, 30 students were killed during a student
rally in the host city.
	   But the games began on schedule, and the United States brought
its greatest track and field team ever.
	   On Thursday night, 23 medalists from the team will attend USA
Track and Field's 30th Anniversary of America's Champions,
sponsored by Xerox, in New Orleans, site of this weekend's national
championships.
	   There, they will be able to relive their memories _ good or bad.
	   The men would win 12 of 24 gold medals in Mexico City and the
overall team would set eight world records, including Beamon's
remarkable 29-foot-2 1/2-inch (8.90 meters) long jump, Lee Evans'
43.86-second clocking in the 400 meters, Jim Hines' 9.95 in the
men's 100 and Wyomia Tyus' 11.08 in the women's 100.
	   Winning performances also included Dick Fosbury in the men's
high jump with his unique ``Fosbury Flop,'' a style that
revolutionized the event, and Al Oerter, the men's discus gold
medalist for the fourth consecutive time.
	   This was a close-knit group, having trained for two months in
Spartan conditions in South Lake Tahoe, California. And it was
caught in the social upheaval of the day.
	   Most prominent was the black-gloved demonstration on the medals
podium by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the first and third
finishers in the 200 meters.
	   Their gesture was interpreted as too political, and Smith and
Carlos were expelled from the Olympic Village by the U.S. Olympic
Committee, following pressure from the International Olympic
Committee.
	   ``It was so unfortunate that we took a nonviolent activity that
devastated two fine athletes,'' Beamon said.
	   ``The same thing could happen today and it could have a
different meaning. It's unfortunate how it was interpreted. It was
not planned.''
	   Vince Matthews, a member of the 1,600-meter relay team that set
a world record of 2:56.16 and who won the Olympic 400 gold medal in
1972, differs with Beamon.
	   Matthews knew it was going to happen. The men's team had met
about possible protests and it was left to each person to determine
what he would do if on the medals stand.
	   ``Tommie and John were very strong about their feelings,''
Matthews said.
	   Smith said the raised fists were not a a ``malignant gesture.''
	   ``It was meant to get a respectful response,'' he said.
	   Instead, the gesture backfired. Smith and Carlos were denounced
as ``ugly Americans,'' and their lives were tainted for years.
	   Smith and Carlos were both invited to the reunion and Smith is
expected to attend.

Taiwan investors fear anti-Asian sentiment in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Taiwanese companies are reassessing
plans to invest in Australia because of the rise of
anti-immigration, protectionist political party One Nation, a
Taiwanese business leader said Wednesday.
	   In the first sign that the success of the party in a state
election last weekend was affecting the Australian economy, the
Taiwan-Australia Business Association said potential business
investors feared anti-Asian sentiment.
	   ``Quite a big number of companies called to this office to ask
our opinion,'' association spokesman Jim Sheu said on Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio from Brisbane.
	   ``They are really concerned because Taiwanese newspapers and TV
put the headlines that say One Nation is anti-Asian,'' he said.
	   One Nation has sent shockwaves through Australian politics after
winning around 23 percent of the vote in last Saturday's Queensland
election. Recent opinion polls have placed the party's support
nationally in low double figures.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been criticized as racist
for claiming Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians''
and opposing immigration. She also opposes special welfare benefits
for Aborigines and advocates protectionist economic policies.
	   Sheu said he had told about 10 businesses that he did not
believe One Nation voters were anti-Asian, but advised them to hold
off investing until after the federal election.
	   Prime Minister John Howard is expected to call an election this
year, possibly as early as August.
	   Jim Soorley, Mayor of the Queensland capital Brisbane, said
Tuesday the Taiwan Sugar company had canceled plans to invest U.S.
dlrs 12 million (Australian dollars 20 million) in the state
because of One Nation's rise and would set up its planned sugar
development in News South Wales instead.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Jeromy Burnitz, John Jaha and Jose Valentin
homered to lead Milwaukee's 16-hit attack as the Brewers snapped
Chicago's 10-game home winning streak, 11-2 Tuesday.
	   Brad Woodall (3-2) held the Cubs scoreless into the seventh
inning, allowing four hits with four strikeouts and one walk. He
also had three hits, walked once and scored twice.
	   Milwaukee scored six runs in the sixth, including Valentin's
two-run shot. It was his 10th homer of the season, and fourth in
his last four games.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Reds 1
	   In Cincinnati, Omar Daal set an Arizona record with nine
strikeouts and the Diamondbacks got another franchise first _
victory No. 1 on artificial turf.
	   Travis Lee and David Dellucci had three hits apiece for the
Diamondbacks, who had four doubles and a triple among their 10
hits.
	   Daal (3-4) lost his shutout when Chris Stynes singled home a run
in the ninth, but he finished for the first complete game of his
career.
	   The Reds lost for the 11th time in 14 games.
 &UR; Mets 2, Expos 0 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Al Leiter pitched a five-hitter for his fifth
career shutout and lowered his ERA to an NL-best 1.53.
	   Leiter (8-3), who won his fifth straight start, struck out seven
and walked one as New York won for the 18th time in 26 games.
Montreal has lost six of eight.
	   Butch Huskey's bases-loaded single in the sixth broke up a
scoreless duel between Leiter and Dustin Hermanson (4-6).
 &UR; Braves 7, Marlins 0 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the Braves scored six runs in the first inning and
went on to beat Florida in their first meeting since last year's
National League championship series.
	   Ryan Klesko hit the sixth grand slam of his career, Denny Neagle
broke a personal three-game losing streak with a four-hitter and
Bobby Cox became the winningest manager in Braves history.
	   Cox has won 1,004 games in two stints as Atlanta manager,
breaking the record set by Frank Selee from 1890-1901, when the
franchise was in Boston.

All Nippon Airways pilots threaten to resume strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pilots at All Nippon Airways, Japan's second
largest airline, will resume a strike to protest a new wage system
if the dispute is not resolved by next week, the airline said
Wednesday.
	   The strike is scheduled to begin at midnight Monday and will
force flight cancellations on some of ANA's international routes if
it goes forward, the company said in a statement.
	   The pilots' union is demanding that ANA abandon a new salary
restructuring system introduced on April 1 that the pilots say will
result in pay cuts.
	   ANA pilots went on strike in early April, but suspended their
walkout before Japan's ``Golden Week'' holiday period between April
29 and May 5, a popular time for both international and domestic
travel. The walkout was limited to international routes.
	   During the two weeks prior to the holiday period, a total of
27,000 passengers were affected by flight cancellations, and the
airline suffered 4.2 billion yen (dlrs 31.8 million) in losses.

NBA players bounced from U.S. roster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from USA Basketball, Tomjanovich and NBA
players' association; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association's unstable
labor situation forced USA Basketball on Tuesday to replace the 12
NBA players who had been selected to represent the United States in
next month's World Championships.
	   When the NBA players' association indicated a boycott might be
staged if a new labor deal wasn't reached by the July 1 expiration
of the current one, USA Basketball asked each player to reaffirm
his intention of playing the World Championships, which start in
Athens, Greece, on July 29.
	   USA Basketball executive director Warren Brown said Tuesday none
of the players did and the NBPA informed the sport's national
governing body that a decision would not be made until July 2.
	   ``We are extremely disappointed and regret that this action had
to be taken, but training camp for our team starts July 8, and we
simply cannot wait until July 2 for a decision before we begin the
process of fielding a replacement team,'' Brown said.
	   ``When no player reaffirmed, then we received the letter from
the NBPA, that resulted in the committee's action for an alternate
plan. USA Basketball is not part of the (labor) issue and holds no
influence. We feel we are being held hostage in the situation.''
	   The decision to drop the NBA players was made by the
eight-member Executive Committee. Friday was the original deadline
for submitting 24-man rosters to FIBA, the international governing
body that runs the World Championships.
	   Brown said FIBA realized the emergency nature of the situation
and said it would work with USA Basketball to make sure the best
team is chosen.
	   USA Basketball will invite at least 24 players to a training
camp, and those invited will be current college players, CBA
players and Americans playing abroad such as David Rivers,
Dominique Wilkins and Byron Scott. No roster would be final until
72 hours before the tournament begins, but Brown said Tuesday's
action closed the door on the participation of NBA players even if
the labor issue is settled.
	   The 12 NBA players on the U.S. team were: Tim Duncan (San
Antonio), Tim Hardaway (Miami), Vin Baker and Gary Payton
(Seattle), Terrell Brandon (Milwaukee), Kevin Garnett and Tom
Gugliotta (Minnesota), Grant Hill (Detroit), Allan Houston (New
York), Christian Laettner (Atlanta), Glen Rice (Charlotte) and
Chris Webber (Sacramento).
	   ``I'm sure our players are disappointed by USA Basketball's
decision,'' union director Billy Hunter said in a statement. ``We
think the decision is premature in light of the fact that USA
Basketball is permitted to submit a 24-man roster to FIBA that
doesn't have to be reduced to 12 players until July 26. The players
wanted to exhuast every possible opportunity to participate in the
World Championships, but the decision was clearly taken out of
their hands by the actions of USA Basketball.''
	   Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston Rockets will still be coach of
the U.S. team.
	   ``I am obviously disappointed I won't be coaching a team
comprised of NBA players in the World Championships, however, as
the makeup of the team changes drastically, it won't change my
attitude one bit. It is an honor to coach and represent your
country,'' he said.
	   ``We've gone from being the favorite to a team as big an
underdog. Now I look at the situation as a great challenge.''
	   Other countries participating are Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Nigeria, Puerto Rico,
Russia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain and Yugoslavia.
	   Brown said indications were that NBA players would still play
for other countries. Among those scheduled to play are Vlade Divac
of Yugoslavia, Steve Nash and Rick Fox of Canada and Zydrunas
Ilgauskas of Lithuania.
	   The United States, with a team of NBA players, won the World
Championships in Toronto in 1994.

Red Wings sweep Capitals to win Stanley Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ This Stanley Cup wasn't for players or fans.
This one was for friends _ Vlady and Sergei.
	   The Detroit Red Wings became the first National Hockey League
team to win consecutive Stanley Cups since 1992, completing a sweep
of the Washington Capitals with a 4-1 victory Tuesday night behind
a two-goal performance by Doug Brown.
	   The Red Wings' second straight sweep also gave Scotty Bowman a
record-tying eighth Stanley Cup as a coach and capped an emotional
and tumultuous season that followed the team's first championship
in 42 years.
	   Six days after the 1997 celebration started, it tragically ended
in a automobile accident that left defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov
and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov with severe head injuries.
	   Konstantinov, considered one of the NHL's top defenseman, was in
the stands at the MCI Center for the game. When the Red Wings
opened a 4-1 lead early in the third period, chants of ``Vlady!
Vlady! Vlady!'' cascaded through the arena from the thousands of
Detroit fans who somehow got tickets.
	   When the chants reached a peak, Konstantinov's wife, Irina,
helped her husband to his feet. He waved his fist and the cheers
grew louder.
	   Konstantinov, wearing a Red Wings jersey, was wheeled onto the
ice immediately after the game to take part in the trophy
presentation.
	   Even Washington fans seemed to join in as their team's first
trip to the NHL finals ended quickly. It was the fourth straight
sweep, the first time that has happened in major pro sports
history.

Dollar weaker, Tokyo stocks higher in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen Wednesday
morning on speculation the United States may try to help stem the
yen's recent slide. Tokyo stock prices edged higher.
	   The dollar bought 142.79 yen at late morning, down 2.35 yen from
145.14 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 143.47 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 8.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to 14,728.52 points to close the
morning session. On Tuesday, the Nikkei average fell 104.79 points,
or 0.71 percent.
	   The dollar's fall came in line with overnight movements in New
York, where the currency fell from near eight-year highs following
a Japanese newspaper report that a top U.S. Treasury official was
planning to visit Japan.
	   But the dollar rebounded slightly compared to its levels earlier
Wednesday as Japanese institutional investors bought the U.S.
currency on dips, traders said.
	   The Treasury Department said late Tuesday it was considering
dispatching Summers to Tokyo for emergency talks over Japan's
stagnant economy and sagging yen.
	   Details of the possible trip were undecided, but Japan's Nihon
Keizai financial daily reported Wednesday morning Summers would
visit Japan Thursday.
	   In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that
the United States continues to worry about the weak yen.
	   ``It's been of enormous concern to us,'' Rubin said. ``We have
been very actively involved in talking to Japan for the past 18
months, publicly and privately, about weakness in the economy.''
	   Concern that the falling yen could throw other Asian countries
into further economic turmoil has also led Asian officials to urge
Japan to stabilize its economy.
	   Market participants expect Summers will prod Japan to step up
efforts to boost economic growth and accelerate the write-off of
problem loans at Japanese banks.
	   Some traders also took the news of Summers' possible dispatch to
Japan as suggesting that U.S. and Japanese officials may be
considering some kind of joint action, such as yen-buying
intervention in currency markets, to boost the ailing currency.
	   On the stock market, prices started higher on the yen's rise
against the dollar and higher futures prices.
	   But shares lost most of their early morning gains as the dollar
began to regain ground against the yen.
	   ``The stock market is completely focused on where foreign
exchange rates settle,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of
the stock division at Tokyo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.97 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,159.44. The
TOPIX closed down 10.74 points, or 0.92 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.215 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.210 percent, driving its price down to 111.88 yen from 111.93
yen.

	   Martin Lapointe and Larry Murphy also scored for the Red Wings,
while goalie Chris Osgood completed a spectacular series by making
30 saves. He allow but seven goals in 99 shots in the series.
	   Osgood, who had been maligned for giving up three long goals
earlier in the playoffs, was every bit the equal of Washington's
Olaf Kolzig, who was outstanding in defeat.
	   Brian Bellows, whose wife gave birth to a son between the first
two games of the series, got his second goal in as many games for
Washington. The Caps had the fourth-best record in the Eastern
Conference under new coach Ron Wilson and came into the finals as a
heavy underdog after New Jersey, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were
eliminated in the first round.
	   ``Guys have different reasons why they want to win,'' Detroit
associate coach Dave Lewis said prior to Game 4. ``The biggest
reason now is for Sergei and Vlady. Not much has been said about
it, but that has been the driving force for this team since Day 1
of training camp.''
	   The Red Wings wore patches all season on their right shoulders
with their friends' initials and the word ``believe'' in English
and Russian.
	   The accident wasn't the only obstacle in the way of the team's
bid to become the first repeat champion since the Pittsburgh
Penguins in 1991-92.
	   During the offseason, the Red Wings traded goaltender Mike
Vernon, the MVP of last year's playoffs, and decided to go with
Osgood, a younger goaltender. Osgood was just as dominant and the
Wings retained the MVP award as well. It went to Steve Yzerman.
	   There was further adversity with a contract holdout that caused
dynamic center Sergie Fedorov to miss the first 59 games of the
season. He didn't return until the Red Wings matched a six-year,
dlrs 38 million offer sheet from Carolina, that included a dlrs 14
million signing bonus and a dlrs 12 million incentive clause if
Fedorov's team made the conference final this year.

	   As the final seconds ticked off, Osgood held his hands high
above his head while Murphy handled the puck in front of his own
net.
	   With about three seconds to go, Osgood threw off his glove,
tossed his stick away and reached out to accept hugs from
teammates.
	   After the teams exchanged handshakes, the Stanley Cup was
presented to Konstantinov, who beamed as it teetered on his lap.
His teammates formed a circle around him and he feebly raised two
fingers to signify the second title.
	   With the Cup still on his wheelchair, his teammates pushed him
around the ice in a victory lap.
	   As they have done each game of the series, the Red Wings scored
the first goal. Brown got it on a power play at 10:30 following a
great play by Fedorov, who had the game winner late in Game 3.
	   This time the dlrs 38 million man took the puck from Murphy just
inside the Washington blue line, carried it to the faceoff circle,
turned completely around and finished at the top of the circle. He
made a cross-ice pass that found Brown in full stride and he beat
Kolzig with a wrist shot from the dot in the left faceoff circle.
	   Lapointe stretched the lead to two goals early in the second
period with a shot from just inside the blue line that beat Kolzig
to the right corner at 2:26. Igor Larionov set up the shot with a
pass from the sideboards.
	   The goal seemed to take the life out of the sellout crowd. But
they got back into the game with just over 12 minutes left in the
period when Brian Bellows got his second goal in two games by
capitalizing on one of the rare mistakes by the Red Wings' defense,
a turnover by Jamie Macoun.
	   Osgood, who was outstanding the whole series despite limited
work, made a shoulder save on a shot by Bellows a little more than
two minutes late to kept Detroit ahead.
	   Murphy, a former Cap who was hooted every time he touched the
puck in the series, seemed to put the final nail in the Capitals
with 8:14 to play on a power play. Tomas Holmstrom controlled the
puck behind the net and eventually found Murphy sneaking in from
the right point for a shot from the faceoff circle that beat Kolzig
up high.
	   Brown got his second goal early in the third period, capping a
2-on-1 break with Vyacheslav Kozlov.

Williams sisters could play third head-to-head
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The prospect of a third all-Williams
match this year looms when Wimbledon opens next week.
	   ``Cool,'' said 16-year-old Serena, who has lost the first two
singles showdowns to her sister Venus.
	   By the luck of Tuesday's draw, Venus and Serena were grouped in
the same section with two of the game's other rising teen stars _
17-year-old Anna Kournikova of Russia and 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic
of Croatia.
	   ``A draw's a draw,'' Kournikova said matter of factly. ``It's
luck, and I'm going to take it a match at a time. I'm not looking
forward to playing the third or whatever round.''
	   If they both win their first three matches, the American sisters
will meet in the fourth round, repeating the second round of the
Australian Open and the quarterfinals of the Italian Open.
	   Sixth-seeded Venus, who turned 18 Wednesday, faces Jana Nejedly
of Canada in the first round and then it's a relatively easy path
to the fourth round for last season's U.S. Open runner-up.
	   Not so for Serena.
	   She begins with Laura Golarsa, would probably face Lucic in the
second round and, if she advances, could play Kournikova in the
third.
	   Another teen-ager, 17-year-old defending champion and top seed
Martina Hingis, drew capable American Lisa Raymond in the first
round. No. 2 Lindsay Davenport will play Florencia Labat.
	   Hingis could face No. 3 Jana Novotna, the woman she beat in last
year's final, in the semis. Davenport would meet No. 4 Steffi Graf
in the other semifinal.
	   The 29-year-old Graf _ winner of 21 Grand Slams _ is continuing
her comeback from surgery and a year's worth of injuries. She opens
against Gala Leon Garcia. No. 6 Monica Seles, in Graf's half of the
draw, opens with another Spaniard _ Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo.
	   With defending champion Pete Sampras in a slump, the men's draw
is the most wide open in years.
	   Sampras, looking for his fifth title, was paired in the first
round against Dominic Hrbary, a Slovakian ranked 47th who led
Sampras 4-2 in the fifth set before losing at the 1997 Australia
Open.
	   Sampras is in the draw's top half, and dangerous players lurk:
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Petr Korda, Patrick Rafter and Andre Agassi.
	   Sampras could face fellow American MaliVai Washington, the
Wimbledon runner-up in 1996, in the second round. Talented Swede
Thomas Enqvist could loom in the third and Australia's Scott
Draper, winner last weekend on grass at Queen's, in the fourth.
	   Korda, the Australian Open champion and No. 3 seed, or Rafter,
the 1997 U.S. Open champion and No. 4 seed, could face Sampras in
the semis.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion who is fashioning a comeback, is
seeded No. 13 and opens against 77th-ranked Spaniard Alex
Calatrava. Next he could meet upcoming German Tommy Haas and then
get Korda in the fourth round.
	   The bottom half of the draw is much weaker with No. 2 Marcelo
Rios of Chile and No. 4 Greg Rusedski of Britain the highest seeds.
	   Rios is no grass-court player. Rusedski is 50-50 for Wimbledon
after suffering a sprained left ankle last week. Rios opens against
Francisco Clavet and Rusedski faces a qualifier.
	   If form holds, the bottom half will boil down to Rios vs.
France's Cedric Pioline, the 1997 Wimbledon runner-up and No. 8
seed, and Rusedski vs. Carlos Moya of Spain, the French Open
champion and No. 5 seed.
	   The most intriguing first-round match is Kafelnikov vs.
Australia's Mark Philippoussis, one of the hardest servers in the
game. However, the Australian has played poorly in recent months
and even considered withdrawing from Wimbledon.

Lots of food waiting for Malaysia's ruling party delegates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite a crushing economic
crisis, delegates to the annual conference of Malaysia's ruling
party this week will have plenty of food to see them through the
four-day meeting.
	   The shrinking economy has not forced Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's party to reduce the spread that will be served to the
nearly 20,000 delegates and observers, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Seventy-five chefs and 45 stewards would be working with 10 tons
of food to serve 42,000 meals beginning Thursday, said the Star
newspaper.
	   More than 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lbs) of beef, 2,000 kilograms
(4,400 lbs) of chicken, 800 kilograms (1,760 lbs) of prawns and
4,000 eggs would be used during the United Malays National
Organization party conference, the daily said quoting a
spokesperson for the company that is handling the arrangements.
	   The assembly is scheduled to focus on the country's economic
crisis. UMNO is the dominant group in Malaysia's 13-party
coalition, the Barisan Nasional.

Watson contender 11 years after almost winning at Olympic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The yips are gone, at least for the time
being. At age 48, Tom Watson surprised even himself by figuring out
a way to win a golf tournament again.
	   So Watson had reason to smile Tuesday when it was suggested that
he has a chance to win the U.S. Open on a course where he came
agonizingly close to winning his last major 11 years ago.
	   ``To possible winner from not a chance is a big upgrade for
me,'' Watson said.
	   Not a chance would have been the appropriate description before
Watson managed to overcome his putting woes and resurrect his
career over the past few years. He won only once since he last
contended here before capping a streak of good play to win the
Colonial last month.
	   He returns to the Olympic Club this week as much a contender as
he is a curiosity, eager to play his 27th U.S. Open on a course
where a putt that fell a fraction of an inch short on the last hole
gave Scott Simpson the win in 1987.
	   Watson's putting nerves seem calm and the swing that helped him
win eight majors is still intact. More importantly, he believes he
can win again.
	   That confidence was built at Colonial, where he shed tears after
his first victory in two years and only his second since the 1987
Nabisco Championship.
	   ``I was honestly thinking maybe this was my last tournament I'll
ever win on tour,'' Watson said. ``It was great to be there again.
That's one reason a tear or two came out.''
	   The win at Colonial was unexpected, but perhaps not so shocking
after Watson started the 1998 season with two ties for second and a
tie for first in the still-to-be-completed AT and T Pebble Beach
Pro-am.
	   He missed the cut in the Masters after shooting 78 the first day
and was in the middle of a string of mediocre finishes when he shot
four straight rounds in the 60s to beat Jim Furyk by two shots in
the Colonial.
	   ``I still believe that I can still swing the golf club and hit
the ball straight,'' Watson said.
	   Hitting the ball straight is the key at Olympic, where some of
the most severe rough in U.S. Open history awaits those who stray
from the tight, manicured fairways.
	   Those who miss the fairways and greens will find themselves in
wet deep grass that grabs clubheads and will force most players to
simply try to get the ball somewhere back in play again.
	   ``It's clingy rough,'' Watson said. ``You just don't know what
it's going to do. When you hit a shot out of it around the green,
15 feet (4 1/2 meters) from the hole with just a simple shot is
your average.''
	   The big test for Watson, though, figures to come on the greens,
where he will have to demonstrate the yips are not there under
major tournament pressure. He succeeded at Colonial by quickly
hitting his short putts, but the greens of the Olympic may be
another matter.

Yzerman grabs two trophies as Red Wings win Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Steve Yzerman won his second Stanley Cup and
his first Conn Smythe Trophy on Tuesday night.
	   Once called a player who could not lead his team to victory in
the big games, Yzerman was finally officially recognized as the
most valuable player of the playoffs with his strong all-around
contribution.
	   Yzerman was the Red Wings' best player in the postseason, and it
had to do with more than just his playoff-leading statistics of 24
points on six goals and 18 assists.
	   Not only did Yzerman score, but also worked on the power play
and penalty killing unit and was a force on defense against
whatever Capitals line was on the ice.
	   Coming into the Cup-clinching fourth game of the finals, Yzerman
had posted the top face-off percentage of 68.2, winning 15 of 22.
	   For the first 13 years of his career, Yzerman had the label of
not showing up for the big games. He could always score, posting
six 100-point seasons, but his teams never won championships _ that
is until the Red Wings ended a 42-year Cup drought last season.
	   All the perceptions about Yzerman changed after that, from being
a loser to one of the great captains in the game.
	   Part of the credit went to coach Scotty Bowman, who convinced
Yzerman to become more of a two-way player. But even that took time
to change the image.
	   Before sweeping Philadelphia last year, Yzerman joked that
people would not sit down next to him at a craps table in a casino.
	   But he started to get lucky after that. Yzerman scored in all
four games against the Flyers, and continued that scoring splurge
in the finals against the Capitals. He scored in seven straight
games before going scoreless in the Red Wings' clinching game
Tuesday night.
	   No player has had a longer streak since Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky
scored at least one point in 12 consecutive finals games in 1987
and 1988. The longest such streak in Stanley Cup finals history is
15 games, set by Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders in the
early 1980s.

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Red Wings 4, Capitals 1 &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings became the first team to
win consecutive Stanley Cups since 1992, completing a sweep of the
Washington Capitals with a 4-1 victory behind a two-goal
performance by Doug Brown.
	   The Red Wings' second straight sweep Tuesday night also gave
Scotty Bowman a record-tying eighth Stanley Cup as a coach and
capped an emotional and tumultuous season that followed the team's
first championship in 42 years.
	   Six days after the 1997 celebration started, it tragically ended
in a automobile accident that left defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov
and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakonov with severe head injuries.
	   ``Vlady's spirit was present in us all season long,'' winger
Vyacheslav Koslov said.
	   ``This is for this man, who will run and walk again,'' said
Vyacheslav Fetisov, his hand on the shoulder of Konstantinov, who
was brought down to the ice for the celebration.
	   Konstantinov, considered one of the NHL's top defenseman,
watched the game from the stands at the MCI Center. When the Red
Wings opened a 4-1 lead early in the third period, chants of
``Vlady! Vlady! Vlady!'' cascaded through the arena from the
thousands of Detroit fans who somehow got tickets.
	   When the chants reached a peak, Konstantinov's wife, Irina,
helped her husband to his feet. He waved his fist and the cheers
grew louder.
	   Even Washington fans seemed to join in as their team's first
trip to the NHL finals ended quickly. It was the fourth straight
sweep, the first time that has happened in major pro sports
history.
	   Konstantinov, wearing a Red Wings jersey, was wheeled onto the
ice immediately after the game to take part in the trophy
presentation.
	   Martin Lapointe and Larry Murphy also scored for the Red Wings,
while goalie Chris Osgood completed a spectacular series by making
30 saves. He allow but seven goals in 99 shots in the series.
	   Brian Bellows, whose wife gave birth to a son between the first
two games of the series, got his second goal in as many games for
Washington. The Caps had the fourth-best record in the Eastern
Conference under new coach Ron Wilson and came into the finals as a
heavy underdog after New Jersey, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were
eliminated in the first round.
	   ``Guys have different reasons why they want to win,'' Detroit
associate coach Dave Lewis said prior to Game 4. ``The biggest
reason now is for Sergei and Vlady. Not much has been said about
it, but that has been the driving force for this team since Day 1
of training camp.''
	   The accident wasn't the only obstacle in the way of the team's
bid to become the first repeat champion since the Pittsburgh
Penguins in 1991-92.
	   During the offseason, the Red Wings traded goaltender Mike
Vernon, the MVP of last year's playoffs, and decided to go with
Osgood, a younger goaltender.
	   There was further adversity with a contract holdout that caused
dynamic center Sergie Fedorov to miss the first 59 games of the
season. He didn't return until the Red Wings matched a six-year,
dlrs 38 million offer sheet from Carolina, that included a dlrs 14
million signing bonus and a dlrs 12 million incentive clause if
Fedorov's team made the conference final this year.
	   As the final seconds ticked off, Osgood held his hands high
above his head while Murphy handled the puck in front of his own
net.
	   With about three seconds to go, Osgood threw off his glove,
tossed his stick away and reached out to accept hugs from
teammates.
	   After the teams exchanged handshakes, the Stanley Cup was
presented to Konstantinov, who beamed as it teetered on his lap.
With the Cup still on his wheelchair, his teammates pushed him
around the ice in a victory lap.
	   As they have done each game of the series, the Red Wings scored
the first goal. Brown got it on a power play at 10:30 following a
great play by Fedorov, who had the game winner late in Game 3.
	   This time the dlrs 38 million man took the puck from Murphy just
inside the Washington blue line, carried it to the faceoff circle,
turned completely around and finished at the top of the circle. He
made a cross-ice pass that found Brown in full stride and he beat
Kolzig with a wrist shot from the dot in the left faceoff circle.
	   Lapointe stretched the lead to two goals early in the second
period with a shot from just inside the blue line that beat Kolzig
to the right corner at 2:26. Igor Larionov set up the shot with a
pass from the sideboards.
	   They got back into the game with just over 12 minutes left in
the period when Brian Bellows got his second goal in two games by
capitalizing on one of the rare mistakes by the Red Wings' defense,
a turnover by Jamie Macoun.
	   Osgood made a shoulder save on a 20-footer (6-meter shot) by
Bellows a little more than two minutes late to kept Detroit ahead.
	   Murphy seemed to put the final nail in the Capitals with 8:14 to
play on a power play. Tomas Holmstrom controlled the puck behind
the net and eventually found Murphy sneaking in from the right
point for a shot from the faceoff circle that beat Kolzig up high.
	   Brown got his second goal early in the third period, capping a
2-on-1 break with Kozlov.

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Manny Ramirez homered and drove in six runs,
and Bartolo Colon pitched his AL-leading fifth complete game as the
Cleveland Indians ended a four-game losing streak with a 9-1
victory over the Kansas City Royals.
	   Ramirez had a two-run double in the first, a solo homer in the
fifth off Kansas City starter Hipolito Pichardo (2-6) and a
three-run double in Cleveland's five-run sixth Tuesday night.
	   Colon (6-4), who has gone at least eight innings in seven of 14
starts, allowed one run and six hits, walking one and striking out
two. The 23-year-old lowered his ERA to 2.73.
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   At St. Petersburg, Toronto's bullpen blew it for the second
straight night as Miguel Cairo's RBI double capped Tampa Bay's
three-run ninth-inning rally off Randy Myers.
	   Myers (2-2) was brought in to hold a 3-1 lead for starter Pat
Hentgen. With one out, pinch-hitter Aaron Ledesma doubled and
scored on Mike DiFelice's single. Bobby Smith's base hit sent
pinch-runner Randy Winn to third.
	   Kevin Stocker hit a chopper to short and Winn beat Alex
Gonzalez's throw to the plate. Cairo hit Myers' next pitch into
right-center for a ground-rule double, scoring Smith.
	   Jim Mecir (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.

Japanese city posts first population growth since 1995 quake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The western Japanese city of Kobe has posted its
first population increase since a 1995 earthquake which killed
thousands of people living in the area, a city official said
Wednesday.
	   The Jan. 17, 1995 quake, which had a magnitude of 7.2, caused
the deaths of 6,300 people, most of whom were residents of Kobe, a
port city located 435 kilometers (272 miles) west of Tokyo.
	   As many as 46,841 people fled the Kobe area immediately after
the devastating quake, and the city suffered a net loss of 1,115
more people the following year, according to city statistics.
	   But Kobe posted a net gain of 6,357 people in 1997, said city
spokesman Kenji Murakami, citing local registration figures.
	   ``The population increase reflects the progress that's been made
in rebuilding the city,'' Murakami said.
	   A quarter of a million homes and buildings were destroyed or
made unlivable by the Kobe earthquake, which also toppled elevated
highways and damaged docks on the city's harbor.
	   Despite efforts to rebuild, some 13,096 households still live in
temporary housing units provided by the local government in the
wake of the disaster.

Drought in Kuala Lumpur area has cost dlrs 3.75 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A rationing program designed to
stretch water reserves for parched residents of Malaysia's capital
city and its suburbs has cost the government 15 million ringgit
(dlrs 3.75 million), a local newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``The money has mostly been spent on tankers and static tanks
which are placed in areas affected by the water shortage,'' Abu
Hassan Omar, Chief Minister of Selangor state, which encompasses
large parts of the Kuala Lumpur region, was quoted as saying in the
New Straits Times newspaper.
	   The costly rationing comes during Malaysia's worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   Drought has forced more than 2 million residents to cope with
dry faucets or bear with strict water rationing since March.
	   The rationing is likely to continue through October when delayed
monsoon rains are expected to begin filling depleting reservoirs.
	   In the meantime, the state government has begun digging for
wells in search of underground water sources. Water trucks have
been sent around the city to provide temporary relief, but critics
complain the trucks have missed many neighborhoods.
	   Authorities have blamed the drought on the El Nino weather
phenomenon. But consumer organizations say the crisis was brought
on by mismanagement.

Indonesian currency plunges, jeopardizing bailout package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's fragile currency plunged
nearly 7 percent on Wednesday, jeopardizing efforts by the
International Monetary Fund to haul the Southeast Asian nation's
shattered economy out of a yearlong crisis.
	   The drop came as a big blow to the government of President B.J.
Habibie, which has pushed an agenda of democratic reform since the
ouster last month of the authoritarian leader Suharto.
	   A drastic weakening of the currency could also worsen rising
inflation and mass unemployment, problems which helped spark riots
and protests leading to Suharto's downfall after 32 years in power.
	   The Indonesian currency was trading at 16,250 rupiah against the
U.S. dollar by midmorning, down from 15,150 rupiah at the close of
trading Tuesday in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   Dealers said local banks were rushing to snap up dollars to pay
off debt arrears.
	   ``With such a thin market and one-way trading, the only
direction for the dollar is upward,'' said Pardi Kendy, chief of
the treasury department of Bank Buana Indonesia, a private bank.
	   Dragged down earlier this week by the weakening Japanese yen,
the rupiah failed to strengthen even as the yen rose against the
dollar in early trading Wednesday.
	   The economic crisis plaguing much of Asia was trigged last year
by the sudden devaluation of the Thai baht.
	   Financial turmoil has undermined stability in Indonesia, which
has suffered social unrest over price increases in Jakarta and
other cities. In the capital, as many as 1,190 people died last
month during mob rampages, many of them killed in shopping mall
fires set by looters.
	   The slide in the value of the rupiah was likely to undermine a
deal to resolve a key obstacle to economic recovery, Indonesia's
estimated dlrs 80 billion in private foreign debt. Many Indonesian
companies are technically insolvent.
	   In talks earlier this month in Frankfurt, Germany, Indonesian
officials and foreign bankers agreed to ease some of the repayment
burden on debt-ridden businesses and help creditors recover some
assets.
	   With the rupiah weakening, however, debtors will be less willing
to fulfill terms of the deal, even though they are designed to give
some breathing room to Indonesian companies.
	   IMF officials, meanwhile, are assessing how to revive a dlrs 43
billion bailout package that was suspended because of the recent
political turmoil. A top IMF official visiting Jakarta, Hubert
Neiss, said Monday he hoped the rupiah would eventually stabilize
below the 10,000 level.
	   The rupiah fell to an all-time low of 17,000 in January after
Habibie, then research and technology minister, emerged as a
candidate for the presidency.
	   Habibie is viewed with suspicion by market traders because of
his taste for costly, government-funded projects, but as president
he has pledged to streamline the economy and battle corruption.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Jeromy Burnitz, John Jaha and Jose Valentin
homered to lead Milwaukee's 16-hit attack as the Brewers snapped
Chicago's 10-game home winning streak, 11-2 Tuesday.
	   Brad Woodall (3-2) held the Cubs scoreless into the seventh
inning, allowing four hits with four strikeouts and one walk. He
also had three hits, walked once and scored twice.
	   Milwaukee scored six runs in the sixth, including Valentin's
two-run shot. It was his 10th homer of the season, and fourth in
his last four games.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Reds 1
	   In Cincinnati, Omar Daal set an Arizona record with nine
strikeouts and the Diamondbacks got another franchise first _
victory No. 1 on artificial turf.
	   Travis Lee and David Dellucci had three hits apiece for the
Diamondbacks, who had four doubles and a triple among their 10
hits.
	   Daal (3-4) lost his shutout when Chris Stynes singled home a run
in the ninth, but he finished for the first complete game of his
career.
	   The Reds lost for the 11th time in 14 games.
 &UR; Mets 2, Expos 0 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Al Leiter pitched a five-hitter for his fifth
career shutout and lowered his ERA to an NL-best 1.53.
	   Leiter (8-3), who won his fifth straight start, struck out seven
and walked one as New York won for the 18th time in 26 games.
Montreal has lost six of eight.
	   Butch Huskey's bases-loaded single in the sixth broke up a
scoreless duel between Leiter and Dustin Hermanson (4-6).
 &UR; Braves 7, Marlins 0 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the Braves scored six runs in the first inning and
went on to beat Florida in their first meeting since last year's
National League championship series.
	   Ryan Klesko hit the sixth grand slam of his career, Denny Neagle
broke a personal three-game losing streak with a four-hitter and
Bobby Cox became the winningest manager in Braves history.

franchise was in Boston.

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Manny Ramirez homered and drove in six runs,
and Bartolo Colon pitched his AL-leading fifth complete game as the
Cleveland Indians ended a four-game losing streak with a 9-1
victory over the Kansas City Royals.
	   Ramirez had a two-run double in the first, a solo homer in the
fifth off Kansas City starter Hipolito Pichardo (2-6) and a
three-run double in Cleveland's five-run sixth Tuesday night.
	   Colon (6-4), who has gone at least eight innings in seven of 14
starts, allowed one run and six hits, walking one and striking out
two. The 23-year-old lowered his ERA to 2.73.
 &UR; Devil Rays 4, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   At St. Petersburg, Toronto's bullpen blew it for the second
straight night as Miguel Cairo's RBI double capped Tampa Bay's
three-run ninth-inning rally off Randy Myers.
	   Myers (2-2) was brought in to hold a 3-1 lead for starter Pat
Hentgen. With one out, pinch-hitter Aaron Ledesma doubled and
scored on Mike DiFelice's single. Bobby Smith's base hit sent
pinch-runner Randy Winn to third.
	   Kevin Stocker hit a chopper to short and Winn beat Alex
Gonzalez's throw to the plate. Cairo hit Myers' next pitch into
right-center for a ground-rule double, scoring Smith.
	   Jim Mecir (3-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the win.
 &UR; Orioles 2, Yankees 0 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, rookie Sidney Ponson and Arthur Rhodes combined on
a two-hitter to end New York's major league record streak of
non-losing series at 24.
	   By winning the first two games of the three-game series,
Baltimore assured the Yankees of not splitting or winning a series
for the first time since opening the year with two straight losses
at Anaheim.
	   Ponson (1-4), making just his fourth career start and his first
at Camden Yards, allowed the two hits in 6 2-3 innings. Rhodes
finished for his third save.
	   Alomar homered off Hideki Irabu (6-2) and Lenny Webster matched
a career-high with three hits for Baltimore.
 &UR; Red Sox 6, White Sox 1 &QC; 
	   At Chicago, Pedro Martinez struck out 11 in seven innings to
take over the AL lead and Reggie Jefferson hit a two-run homer to
lead Boston.
	   Martinez (8-2) gave up four hits and walked a season-high five.
He raised his strikeout total to 124, passing Seattle's Randy
Johnson (122) for the league lead.
	   Nomar Garciaparra and Lou Merloni each had three hits for the
Red Sox, who've won five of six.
	   Jason Bere (3-6) was charged with five runs and seven hits in 5
1-3 innings.
 &UR; Athletics 9, Rangers 7 &QC; 
	   At Arlington, Texas, rookie Ben Grieve homered twice in his
hometown debut and Oakland hung on after blowing most of a nine-run
lead.
	   Grieve, who grew up watching the Rangers, hit two-run shots in
the first and second innings off Matt Perisho (0-1) in his first
game at The Ballpark in Arlington to help the A's take a 6-0 lead.
	   Grieve's first career multi-homer game led the A's to their
fourth victory in their last five games. Texas has lost five of its
last six.
	   Buddy Groom (3-1) pitched two hitless innings of relief for the
win, and Billy Taylor pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save.
 &UR; Twins 8, Tigers 5 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Pat Meares' two-run single put Minnesota ahead to
stay in the sixth inning and Ron Coomer hit a three-run homer in
the seventh as the Twins won for the sixth time in nine games.
	   Kimera Bartee hit a two-run homer and had a career-high four
RBIs for the Tigers, who have lost 12 of 16.
	   Minnesota trailed 3-2 when one-out singles from Todd Walker and
Coomer finished Tigers starter Denny Harriger (0-1) in the sixth.
Sean Runyan walked Matt Lawton before Meares singled home two runs
off Tim Worrell to put the Twins ahead.
	   Reliever Dan Serafini (3-0) got the win and Rick Aguilera got
his 14th save.
