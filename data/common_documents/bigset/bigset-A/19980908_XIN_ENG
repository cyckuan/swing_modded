<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Again Rejects Chernomyrdin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma again
rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister in the
second round of voting on Monday, despite earlier efforts to break
the political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Only 138 deputies at the lower house of parliament voted for
Chernomyrdin, who was renamed premier August 24 after five months
in the political wilderness, way below the required simple
majority of 226 votes. Two hundred and seventy-three deputies
voted against with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear when the third, or final, vote will take
place. Under the Russian constitution, if the nomination is
rejected three times, the president will have to dissolve the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, President Boris Yeltsin chaired a roundtable
meeting participated by Chernomyrdin, speakers of both houses of
parliament and leaders of major political factions.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was designed to end the impasse over the
government crisis, Yeltsin signed a "unprecedented document" that
is expected to give the State Duma more power in state affairs,
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The continued political stand-off between the parliament and
Yeltsin will certainly drive Russia's economy, already in a
shambles, to further chaos.
</P>
<P>
The ruble has shed more than 200 percent against the
U.S. dollar in three weeks, forcing up prices and inflation.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the present monthly minimum wage set by law, at
83.49 rubles (about five U.S. dollars), can only buy one liter of
vegetable oil, two cans of meat preserves and one loaf of bread.

<HEADLINE> Annan on U.N. War Against Poverty  (Embargoed for Tuesday) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite its limited
resources, the United Nations "has made the eradication of poverty
a central cross-cutting goal of its activities," U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report to the 52nd session of the General
Assembly, Annan said, "Guided by the outcomes of its major world
conferences of the 1990s, especially the 1995 World Summit for
Social Development, the United Nations has made the eradication of
poverty a central cross-cutting goal of its activities."
</P>
<P>
To meet the main purpose of the anti-poverty drive, the
185-member world body has adopted a plan to "seek better
coordination and greater cooperation between the various elements
of the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods
institutions, and to agree on a shared strategy addressing all of
the key dimensions of action against poverty" he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bretton Woods institutions resulted from a July 1944
meeting held at the Bretton Woods on the invitation of the United
States. The meeting led to the creation of the two post-war
international financial institutions, namely the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. The latter has been popularly known as the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"During the past year, the United Nations assisted some 100
countries with the preparation, formulation or implementation of
national anti-poverty programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief listed some areas which have to be
improved in order to broaden the scope of action against poverty:
to address such critical issues as access to productive assets; to
encourage a more inclusive dialogue between the State, civil
society and the private sector; and to target resource-poor
communities and asset-poor households.
</P>
<P>
"A substantial share of UNDP resources -- some 26 percent of
the total -- is now devoted directly to poverty reduction," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) renders
assistance in such fields as support for poverty mapping,
assessments of national capacity for poverty reduction, setting
national goals and targets, public expenditure reviews, review of
policies, administrative structure and procedures, and resource
mobilization.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving the eradication of poverty also requires that the
feminization of poverty be reversed," Annan said, adding that this
is because "poverty is a major cause of hunger, but hunger also
causes and perpetuates inter-generational cycles of poverty."
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan also spoke highly of the efforts by the
World Food Program to carry out "vulnerability assessment mapping"
in 22 African, 8 Asian and 2 Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
"This exercise identifies the geographic distribution of
poverty and food insecurity, and helps ascertain their underlying
causes together with the approaching programmatic responses,"
Annan added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the poor have sustained access to food, the
World Food Program targets some 60 percent of its development
resources directly to women and involves them in the management of
food distribution and in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly is expected to
consider and approve the annual report before its conclusion on
Tuesday. It will be followed by the 53rd session of the General
Assembly, which begins one week earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly, the main deliberation organ, is composed
of representatives of all 185 U.N. members. The General Assembly's
regular session used to begin each year on the third Tuesday in
September and continues usually until mid-December.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President May Defer Visit to India: PTI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton may defer his visit to India with New Delhi unwilling to
accept Washington's demand to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) immediately and unconditionally, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that India's position on the CTBT was outlined
by Brajesh Mishra, Indian Prime Minister's principal secretary,
who stated categorically that his country was not close to signing
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
It quoted informed sources as saying that Clinton's visit,
which was put on hold soon after India's nuclear tests last May,
was unlikely to come through this year.
</P>
<P>
Indian prime minister's special envoy Jaswant Singh and U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met for several times
since May, most recently last Thursday in New York, but failed to
make any breakthrough in relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
India is keen to realize Clinton's tour of South Asia before
the end of this year while the U.S. has linked the president's
visit to progress made at the ongoing talks with both India and
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Social and Sustainable Development  (Embargoed for Tuesday) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS. September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday summarized the world body's work in social
development and sustainable development, saying the world body is
taking steps to translate agreed policy measures into activities
of the U.N. system, especially at the country level.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in Annan's annual report to the
52nd session of the General Assembly, which is expected to
consider and approve the report before its conclusion on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The social development involves a series of efforts to better
conditions for the older people, women and children, including
pains-taking endeavors to fight AIDS disease, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly has designated 1999 the International Year
of Older Persons, Annan said, adding that by this means, the
United Nations hopes to enhance the participation of older persons
in their communities.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance from the world body, "some 70 countries
have now adopted legislation or established programs to advance
that end," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the equality for women, the U.N. chief said, "The lack of
equality for women and violations of their human rights remain
major impediments to development, democracy and peace."
</P>
<P>
Preparations have begun for the high-level review to be
conducted by the General Assembly in June 2000 of progress made in
the implementation of the decisions of the Nairobi and Beijing
World Conferences on Women, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the work for children and families in different nations, he
said that the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and its partners help
to focus worldwide attention on issues affecting children.
</P>
<P>
These issues include the many millions of children over the
world who suffer from malaria and malnutrition, the plight of
those who serve in armies or work at hazardous or exploitative
jobs, discrimination and violence against girls and young women,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the past year, UNICEF devoted increased attention to
strengthening community involvement in matters concerning children
and families," he said. "This has been the key to success in
raising the number of girls enrolling and staying in school.
UNICEF programs have been expanded to reach not only infants and
young children but also adolescents and youth."
</P>
<P>
On the global fight against AIDS disease, Annan said that the
Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) seeks to build
worldwide commitment and political support for the prevention and
treatment of HIV/AIDS through advocacy based on technically sound
and up-to-date analyses.
</P>
<P>
"The examples of Thailand and Uganda show that HIV rates can be
reduced significantly by strong prevention programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has cut its HIV infection rate by more than a quarter,
and Thailand by almost 15 percent -- reductions that compare
favorably with those in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
"Stopping new infections is ultimately the best way of averting
the devastating impact of HIV and success hinges on using a
careful mix of tried-and-tested prevention methods," he added.
</P>
<P>
On sustainable development, Annan said that "because half of
the world's population now lives in cities and towns -- and an
estimated two thirds will be urban in 2025 -- the sustainable
development of our planet will more than ever depend on our
understanding of urban problems and on the ability to craft and
implement effective responses to them."
</P>
<P>
The Sustainable Cities Program, a joint effort of Habitat and
the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), supports urban
management at city and national levels through capacity-building
and networking.
</P>
<P>
"The program is active in more than 20 cities and has produced
a series of policy guidelines that are used in many countries," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half of Russians Have No Money to Cope With Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Forty-nine percent of Russia's
urban residents have no money to soften the impact of the
financial crisis, according to a recent poll earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of the respondents were buying extra supplies
of foodstuffs, 5 percent were stocking up on consumer goods, 4
percent were buying durables and another 4 percent were buying
U.S. dollars, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
The poll was organized by the All-Russia Public Opinion Center
and involved 1,862 Russian residents in September.
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of those polled declined to say what they were
doing to ease the impact of the crisis, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Only 3 percent of those surveyed think the actual situation is
better than what it is believed to be. They said they were doing
nothing at all to cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
For two weeks prices have been escalating rapidly while the
ruble nosedives, and the country continues to go without a fully
functioning government.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the present legal monthly minimum wage, 83.49 rubles
(about 5 U.S. dollars), can only buy one liter of vegetable oil,
two cans of meat preserves and one loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, prices for some imported foodstuffs on wholesale
markets in the capital city were up 100-500 percent against the
pre-crisis levels, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Prices for most Russian-produced food products, including
sausage, butter, canned meat, pasta and oil, jumped 50-100 percent
on the average.
</P>
<P>
Goods with long shelf life are vanishing from Moscow's stores,
which are crowded with people eager to stockpile food.
</P>
<P>
However, prices of domestically produced bread and milk haven't
changed much, a relief for many pensioners who can now barely
survive on these staples.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Cooperation With Turkey Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here Monday that the Israeli-Turkish
cooperation would improve the prosperity and security of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Mesut Yilmaz, Netanyahu said that he discussed with
Yilmaz the economic, political and defense relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that Israeli cooperation with Turkey was the
"natural cooperation" that is "not against anyone" and will
contribute to the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He tried to allay the growing suspicion and anger among the
Arab and Islamic world towards Israel's booming military
cooperation, saying the Israeli-Turkish cooperation would do no
harm to Syria, which has disputes with both Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He urged Syrians to resume the negotiations with Israel which
have been stalled since early 1996 after making marked progress in
talks held between Syria and Israel's previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yilmaz said that his visit was aimed at improving
the stability and security of the region. He believed that the
whole region would benefit from the better relations between
Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He counterattacked those who protested against the booming
Israeli-Turkish cooperation, saying that the real sources of
instability in the Middle East should be "among those who have
aggressive policies."
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey began their military cooperation since early
1996 when they signed a military cooperation deal, which allows
Israeli fighter pilots to fly training flights in Turkish air
space. Israel has also been upgrading Turkish fighter planes with
its advanced electronic aviation technologies.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Netanyahu and Yilmaz also discussed ways
to expand the free trade between the two countries. And the two
sides signed an agreement on the agriculture cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Netanyahu
said he phoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Monday morning,
and hoped that Mubarak would help to advance the stalled
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz also expressed concern over the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, and said that Turkey would continue to play a
constructive role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister arrived here from Jordan Monday
morning for a two-day visit to Israel. He is also to hold talks
with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's growing military ties with Jordan and Israel have
provoked fears in the Arab and Islamic world about the creation of
a new military axis in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Syria fears military cooperation among its three rivaling
neighbors will leave it encircled by an enemy coalition.

MAPUTO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano, accompanied by leaders of the state government and
political parties, laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's
Heroes here to mark the 24th Victory Day Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech after the ceremony, Chissano called on all
Mozambicans to carry out the behest of the fallen heroes, and
work hard to rebuild the country, following the examples set by
those combatants fighting for the national independence.
</P>
<P>
Victory Day falls on September 7 each year when 24 years ago,
the Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo) signed a Lusaka
agreement with Lisbon on granting independence to Mozambique on
June 25, 1975.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the ruling Frelimo in a message to
the whole nation Monday urged all political forces and
organizations to cherish the national unity and the ideal of
independence and freedom.
</P>
<P>
It called on all Mozambicans to take an active part in
promoting the development of both urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The central committee also urged the government departments to
take effective measures to help rehabilitate women socially and
economically and support helpless children and old people.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Veterans for the National Liberation also
asked their members to set good examples for the younger
generations in loving peace, preserving national solidarity and
upholding freedom and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Victory Day was also celebrated in other parts of the country,
with songs and dances, sports games and fora.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Joint Efforts in Globalization  (Embargoed for Tuesday) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Defined in geographic
terms, little is new about globalization because interconnected
human activity on a worldwide scale has existed for centuries. But
"the form of contemporary globalization is new."
</P>
<P>
The comparative statement came as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Tuesday presented his annual report to the 52nd session
of the General Assembly, which is scheduled to end on the same day
before adopting this work report.
</P>
<P>
The concept of globalization covers the environmental and
economic dimensions, Annan said in his 32-page report in English,
citing three new characteristics of the globalization.
</P>
<P>
First, "demographic momentum, together with patterns of land
use and energy consumption, has always affected local and
subregional ecosystems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, "today these and other human factors increasingly
affect the planet's ecology as a whole, be it through ozone
depletion, global warming or diminishing biodiversity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last but not least, "the technological advances and open
borders that enable the commercial firms to organize the
production of goods and services transnationally also enable
terrorist networks, criminal syndicates, drug traffickers and
money launderers to project their reach across the globe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"These new dimensions of globalization can only be addressed
multilaterally, by the United Nations and by other international
institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the environmental dimension, Annan said that international
cooperation has a vital role to play in arresting and reversing
the potentially harmful effects of human activities on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
In June 1997, the General Assembly considered a study warning
that, without preventive measure, two thirds of the world's
population could face freshwater scarcity and water quality
problems by 2005. In 1998, a series of international meetings
sought to identify approaching policy responses.
</P>
<P>
On the economic dimension, Annan said that "in cooperation with
other multilateral organizations, the United Nations has sought to
strengthen normative, legal and institutional frameworks that will
allow the global economy to operate more effectively and
equitably."
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the Asian financial crisis has
intensified and now affects countries on every continent. "It has
exacted steep and possibly long-lasting social costs in East Asia,
and raised serious concerns about the operations of unregulated
financial markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Looking beyond the immediate crisis, the U.N. Economic and
Social Council devoted its 1988 high-level segment to market
access in the context of globalization, and debated how
developments since the Uruguay Round are affecting developing and
least developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
In September 1988, the General Assembly will, for the first
time, hold a high-level dialogue on the social and economic impact
of globalization and interdependence and their policy
implications, Annan added.

UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The world has been
mercifully free from large-scale regional conflict over the past
year, but many local wars have continued with new ones breaking
out, said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report 1998 on peace and Security, Annan said
there had been some important successes for the international
community, including the restoration of the democratically elected
Government in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the world lived through a period of high tension in
February when Iraq seemed set on refusing to comply with its
disarmament obligations, and some Member States prepared for
military action to enforce compliance. War was averted by the
timely collective action of the international community.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, peace in many parts of the world
remains precarious, and of particular concern is the lack of
progress in the Middle East peace process, the turmoil in
Afghanistan, the escalation of violence in Kosovo, the ongoing
civil war in the Sudan, the continuing instability and violence in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the rest of the Great
Lakes region, and the return to civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Nor is the human race yet delivered from the threat of unclear
annihilation, said the U.N. chief, adding the successes of
previous year, the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the signing of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Tear-Ban Treaty, had been called into
question this year by the decisions of India and Pakistan to
conduct underground nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the adoption, late in 1997, of the Ottawa Convention
on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, production and
Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction was an
unprecedented achievement, and similarly, the adoption of the
Statute of the International Criminal Court at Rome in July was a
historical development in the age-long struggle to punish and
deter war crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Positive developments
have been made in the area of disarmament for the past year, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report 1998 on disarmament, Annan said the United
Nations placed disarmament near the center of its mission of peace
and development by reestablishing the Department for Disarmament
Affairs with an Under-Secretary-General as its head.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General said the Department played a
critical role in post-conflict peace-building, notably in the
collection, disposal and destruction of weapons and in the
reintegration of former combatants into civil society.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the positive developments include the issuance of
the eight-nation joint declaration on creating a
unclear-weapon-free world, and the establishment of two ad hoc
committees in the Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in the past year efforts were also made to
consolidate existing nuclear-weapon-free-zones, notably those in
Africa and in South-East Asia and the move towards the
establishment of another such zone in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said in the struggle for sustainable peace and
development, steps need to be taken to curb the flow of small arms
circulating in civil society, and one approach to this problem
would be to seek to build a global consensus on monitoring and
controlling illicit arms transfers and their links with
trafficking in other contraband goods.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the Member States to increase and improve their
participation in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms
and the system for standardized reporting of military expenditures
so as to achieve greater openness and transparency in military
matters.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leaders Believe in Govt on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Faction leaders in central
Somalia ended up a peace conference Monday, with the belief that
a lasting peace and a broad-based government for Somalia could
only be achieved through grassroots peace negotiations among all
the Somalis in general.
</P>
<P>
The peace promoting conference attended by hundreds of
intellectuals, traditional leaders as well as politicians from
the districts of the central region of Hiran was concluded Monday
in the town of Beletuein, 300 Km North of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman of the conference, the meeting
which lasted for four days was aimed at opening a peace making
dialogue for what is called the Great Hawiye communities in
Beletuein within four weeks beginning from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Ibrahim Habeb Nur from the Hiran region
dominant clan of Hawadle, said the conference has also sent
official invitation letters to all the Hawiye leaders.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was chaired by Colonel Omar Hashi Aden,
is reportedly initiated by the Ugas of the Hawadle clan, Ugas
Khalif Ugas Robleh in an effort of pacifying the Hawiye
communities, including the Hawadle clan who fought politically
and clan-wise in the past seven year.
</P>
<P>
The call by the politicians of Hiran region coincides with
other political settlement tentative by the recently arrived
governor of Mogadishu, Hussein Ali Ahmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The international
community had began to overcome its reluctance to make use of the
U.N. peace-keeping capacity in the past year, Annan said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report 1998 on peace-keeping, Annan said the
Security Council authorized two new peacekeeping operations, the
United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and the
United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said at the U.N. Headquarters, the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations continued its efforts
to strengthen the Organization's capacity to respond swiftly.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the past year had seen some progress in the
development of the United Nations standby arrangements system,
which now includes 74 Member States, with over 100,000 personnel
pledged in the framework of the system.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the total number of peacekeepers in the
field had declined since the early 1990s, as a consequence of the
winding down of several major United Nations operations, but the
actual number of United Nations peacekeepers operations had in
fact risen from 15 to 17 in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports Tangible Results in Humanitarian Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tangible results had
been resulted in the humanitarian field in the past year despite
serious funding constraints, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report 1998 on humanitarian commitment, Annan
said the United Nations continued to provide humanitarian relief
as well and as quickly as it could, and it had made efforts in
finding more sophisticated ways of dealing with the plight of
civilians on complex emergencies and in mobilizing the resources
of the world community.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in July 1998, the Economic and Social Council for
the first time included a special humanitarian segment in its
regular session, in which it reaffirmed the importance of respect
for international humanitarian law and principles, endorsed the
work of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
and set out specific goals for future priority areas.
</P>
<P>
There had been more evidence in the past year of a further
erosion in the respect for humanitarian principles in several
countries, said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
The right of civilians in need, particularly children and
women , to receive humanitarian assistance was enshrined in
international humanitarian law, and humanitarian organizations
had been denied access to people in need and deliberate attacks
on civilian populations has continued, Annan noted.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Again Rejects Chernomyrdin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma once
again rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister
in the second voting on Monday, despite earlier efforts to break
the political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Only 138 deputies at the lower house of parliament voted for
Chernomyrdin, who was renamed premier August 24 after five months
in the political wilderness, way below the required simple
majority of 226 votes. Two hundred and seventy-three deputies
voted against with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear when the third, or final, vote will take
place. Under the Russian constitution, if the nomination is
rejected three times, the president will have to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, President Boris Yeltsin chaired a roundtable
meeting participated by Chernomyrdin, speakers of both houses of
parliament and leaders of major political factions.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was designed to end the impasse over the
government crisis, Yeltsin signed a "unprecedented document" that
is expected to give the State Duma more power in state affairs,
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
But Communists and their allies in the Duma insisted that they
would vote against Chernomyrdin again.
</P>
<P>
"Our stance remains unchanged," Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said after the roundtable meeting. "He (Chernomyrdin)
doesn't even understand the program he has proposed."
</P>
<P>
Born on April 9, 1938, in Orenburg District, Chernomyrdin was
graduated from Kuybyshev Polytechnic School. Once an operator in
the oil refinery industry and a soldier in the Soviet army, he
became minister of gas in 1985 and stayed on the position until
the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1989
</P>
<P>
He served as chairman of council of ministers (later called
prime minister) from December 1992 to March 1998 before being
sacked by President Yeltsin in a sudden government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Five months later, Yeltsin fired Chernomyrdin's successor and
appointed Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister on August 23 when
Russia was hit by a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been without a full functioning government for the
past two weeks. The political crisis has made the economic crisis
even worse.
</P>
<P>
The ruble has shed more than 200 percent against the
U.S. dollar in three weeks, forcing up prices and inflation.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the present monthly minimum wage set by law, at
83.49 rubles (about five U.S. dollars), can only buy one liter of
vegetable oil, two cans of meat preserves and one loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, prices for some imported foodstuffs on wholesale
markets in the capital city were up 100-500 percent against the
pre-crisis levels, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prices for most Russian-produced food products, including
sausages, butter, canned meat, pasta and oil, jumped 50-100
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
Goods with long shelf life are vanishing from Moscow's stores,
which are crowded with people eager to stockpile food in
anticipation of further fall of the ruble and more price hikes.
</P>
<P>
However, prices for domestically produced bread and milk
haven't changed much, a relief for many pensioners who can now
barely survive on these staples.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll taken last week, 49 percent of Russia's
urban residents have no money to soften the impact of the
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Urges Iran, Taliban to Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian King Fahd
Bin Abdelaziz Monday urged Iran and Afghan Taliban militia to
exercise restraint and resolve their disputes peacefully, the
Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd issued his call at the Cabinet session he chaired for
the first time after recuperation from his recent illness.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Taliban should start "a constructive
dialogue that embodies the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and
sincere intents..."
</P>
<P>
Fahd's statement came amid rising tension between Iran and
Taliban after Tehran accused the Taliban militia of kidnapping
10 Iranian diplomats when they took over the northern city of
Mazari Sharif on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban regime is only recognized by Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, the Iranian government has
recently asked Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for their help in
securing the release of the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has also sought help from the United Nations in rescuing
the Iranian diplomats and dozens of Iranian citizens allegedly
held by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
So far the Taliban has denied holding the Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
To flex its military muscle, Iran has recently held a massive
military exercise near the border with Afghanistan and deployed
some 70,000 troops along the border to build up pressure on the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz paid an
one-day visit to Saudi Arabia, where he consulted with senior
Saudi officials on the Iranian-Taliban crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has not officially stated whether it will play any
mediation role. But Kuna reported that Riyadh has promised to help
defuse the tension in coordination with Pakistan so to spare the
bloodshed of the Muslims.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress, Ruling BJP Lash Out at Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Congress
party leader Sonia Gandhi Monday charged the India government led
by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with misrule while the BJP
said the Congress party's latest session was a total failure.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a convention of Congress workers in Bhopal, capital
of central Madhya Pradesh, Sonia Gandhi lamented the price rise
of essential commodities and growing anarchy under the BJP, saying
there was no one to take care of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted the Congress leader as
saying that the people already groaning under spiraling prices
were now living under the constant fear of consuming adulterated
foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
A hundred people have died of dropsy, caused mainly by
adulterated oil, in the past three weeks in many areas of the
country, including the Indian capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite such grave provocation of people's miseries, she said,
her party had acted with restraint and not tried to manipulate the
situation to topple the BJP-led government.
</P>
<P>
But as a responsible opposition, she reiterated, the Congress
was ready to shoulder the responsibility of governing at the
center should the government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee collapse because of its inherent weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
In a significant policy change, the Congress decided Sunday to
keep its option open to lead a coalition government instead of
forming an alternative administration on its own.
</P>
<P>
A BJP spokesman said Monday that the three-day brainstorming
session of the Congress party which ended Sunday was a total
failure and it showed the party lacked cohesion and was confused
on ideology.
</P>
<P>
Krishan Lal Sharma said here Monday that previous governments
led by the Congress had failed to provide stability ever after
former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had secured an overwhelming
majority in 1984 in Lok Sabha, the lower house of Indian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sonia Gandhi's remarks that the Congress would
stake claim in case the BJP-led government falls, Sharma said the
government would stay and the opposition would not succeed in its
moves to destabilize it.

Diouf said the immediate task for the 61 IRC member states,
world major rice producers, is to identify ways of raising
production while conserving the natural resource bases for future
generation.
</P>
<P>
Most of consumers who depend on rice as their primary food
intake live in the developing countries where farm holdings are
small and most of the farmers are poor and have limited resources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf also stressed the need to develop "rice and rice-based
production systems that fit in to socio-economic environments,
especially where the participation of women is dominant, and which
are capable of reducting risks of rural poverty."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Diouf said "since 1990, the growth rate of rice
production in many countries, especially in Asia, has been lower
than the growth rate of population."
</P>
<P>
Diouf ascribed the disparity partly to the expansion of
industrialization and urbanization that has been increasingly in
competition with land and water resources for rice production.
</P>
<P>
On the other, intensive cultivation in irrigated areas has led
to yield decline and negative impacts on the environment, losses
of natural resources and biodiversity, and social inequity, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
FAO estimated world paddy rice production hit record 572
million tonnes in 1997, up 2 million from 1996, while world rice
trade volume in 1997 dropped to 18.4 million tonnes, 1.2 million
tonnes lower than that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The IRC was set up at the Fourth FAO Conference in 1948 against
the backdrop of an imminent worldwide food shortage to promote
cooperation in member countries in rice production, conservation,
distribution and consumption.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Improves Security Through Education of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Security in Uganda has been
improved mainly by way of educating police force and the general
public, a security education report said.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Security Education to the Public About Bomb
Threats" is being implemented now throughout the country, Central
Region Police Commander Bakesiima Chrisostom told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
The police officers are now being trained to know more about
bombs and measures to be taken in emergencies. Only when
policemen learn more about it can they handle the matter
effectively, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is an international phenomenon which has been
increasingly affecting all the people in Uganda. Physical
security measures alone cannot exhaustively and effectively fight
terrorism, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The fight against terrorism is a social responsibility through
collective effort to eradicate this problem. The report requests
the general public to report to the police if anything suspicious
is discovered.
</P>
<P>
It also gives tips to people on what packages are suspicious
and what should be done when one is under bomb threats or after a
bomb goes off.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the education, most people now are more
enlightened and more alert and the capital remains relatively
quiet these days after disastrous bus bomb blasts last month.
</P>
<P>
Kampala Region Police Commander Benjamin Namanya told Xinhua
that some suspects allegedly involved in the bus blasts have been
sent to court.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Small, Medium-Sized Companies in Great Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 7 (Xinhua) -- President of Romania's
Chamber of Commerce and Industry George Cojocaru is for "milder
taxation", in order not to burden very much the small and
medium-sized companies, as it happens today.
</P>
<P>
"More than 90 percent of the 567,949 companies registered in
Romania's Chamber of Commerce and Industry are small and
medium-sized units and they face at present the most difficult
state since 1990," the local daily Curentul Monday citing Cojocaru
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of the newly created small and medium-sized units
are on the verge of bankrupcy, about a year after birth, Cojocaru
said, adding that about half of them find it difficult to survive.
Only 20 percent of them make profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
An X-ray of the structure of the small and medium-sized
companies showed that about 92 percent of them have less than 9
employees. Only 0.7 percent of the small and medium-sized
enterprises belong to the category of big companies, numbering
more than 250 employees.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 380,000 companies having forwarded the balance
sheet had zero turnover in 1997. Around 227,000 companies scored a
net profit and 110,000 net losses, the total losses amounting to
28,447 billion lei(3.16 billion U.S. dollars), 8,317 billion lei
(924 million U.S. dollars) more than the total profit.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Reserves Drop to Less Than $100M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign exchange
reserves stood at an all-time low of less than 100 million U.S.
Dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of Zambia's Macro-economic Indicators
obtained from the ministry of finance Monday shows that the gross
official reserves had fallen to 99.02 million from 117.618
million Dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
An official at the ministry said on anonymity that Zambia's
reserves at the moment had reached the lowest, with only about
three weeks worth of import cover.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the low level of reserves to the government's
heavy debt-servicing, saying that it had been using the little
reserves for clearing the county's huge debt which now stands at
n 7.2 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has managed to pay out 83 million Dollars towards
debt-servicing from January 1 to the end of last July, despite
not receiving any inflows from the donors in the past months.
</P>
<P>
However, Felix Kani, director of economics at the Bank of
Zambia, said the situation was not bad while maintaining that
there was at least enough reserves for an emergency.
</P>
<P>
Kani advised that the immediate way out of the current strain
on the reserves was to persuade the donors to release their 530
million Dollars of aid pledged in last May at a Paris
Consultative meeting with the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
The donors insisted that their pledged aid can not be released
until Zambia meets their preconditions such as good governance
and rapid privatization of its cash-trapped copper mines.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Senior Ruling Party Against Hungarian-Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 7 (Xinhua) -- President of the senior
ruling party Ion Diaconescu believes that negotiations in the
majority coalition can lead to the best solution to the problems
of tuition in the minorities' mother tongues.
</P>
<P>
The leader of Christian Democratic National Peasant Party Ion
Diaconescu, also the Speaker of the Lower Chamber, Monday told a
press conference that "a multicultural university fully satisfies
anybody's needs of mother-tongue tuition, at all grades and
disciplines, without taking the aspect of segregation on ethnic
criteria."
</P>
<P>
The co-ruling Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR) last
Saturday threatened to step down from the government unless a
Hungarian-language state university was established in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Ion Diaconescu underscored that a multicultural university was
"the maximal solution to be put before Parliament," and was of the
opinion that if the junior ruling UDMR quit the coalition, "the
solution will be still more difficult to find."
</P>
<P>
According to Diaconescu, the UDMR's presence in the current
ruling coalition is beneficial to both the Hungarian minority and
Romania.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians of Romania started to ask for a
Hungarian-speaking state university after the fall of Ceausescu in
1989. According to the last census, out of 23 million citizens of
Romania, 1.6 million-strong are Hungarians. They claims to
be entitled to "have got a Hungarian-language university of its
own."
</P>
<P>
The Commission for Education within the Lower Chamber last
Wednesday rejected the idea of founding a state university in the
language of the minorities, deciding that there may be organized
groups and sections in the language of the minorities only within
the multicultural universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Monday implored the government to honor its
agreement with Coca-Cola Company to reduce excise duty on the
company's soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Zambia News Agency, ZCTU vice-president
Austin Liato said that it was morally wrong for the government to
break its promise after the two parties had agreed on the deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement concluded with Coca-Cola three months ago,
the Zambian government pledged to reduce the company's excise
duty while Coca-Cola would invest 75 million U.S. Dollars in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambian government failed to honor its pledge and
has referred the reduction of excise duty back to Zambia Revenue
Authority.
</P>
<P>
In a response to this move, Coca-Cola has declared to suspend
its plans to undertake the investment program and to scale down
its operations in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The company also said that the reluctance of the Zambian
government would facilitate its departure from the country.
</P>
<P>
Liato said that if the government would not honor its pledge,
there would be 15,000 people to lose their jobs.

BUCHAREST, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania's currency went on
depreciating, and exceeded on Monday the ceiling of 9000 lei per
U.S. dollar by losing 18 units in only two days.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate the Romanian Central Bank announced on Monday
was close to rates in exchange offices where a dollar was sold for
9006 lei and was bought for 8970 lei on average.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday announcement by the government of the intention to
increase duties and excises on tobacco and alcohol caused
immediately an unrest on the financial market and the occurrence of
the "emotional factor" phenomenon among people.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank governor Mugur Isarescu forecasted a
depreciation of 1-2 percent per month of the Romanian currency leu
against the dollar for the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB) and the Rasdaq (the
secondary market) didn't register any spectacular evolutions on
Monday, maintaining a decreasing trend in transactions. The
transaction value lowered to 2.71 billion lei (301,000 U.S.
dollars) compared to 2.89 billion lei (321,000 U.S. dollars) on

BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union pledged on
Monday its support for Bosnia-Herzegovina ahead of the Balkan
nation's general elections.
</P>
<P>
"The elections offer a chance for Bosnia to overcome divisions
created by the war and to embrace modern European values," the
15-nation union said in a statement issued by its Austrian
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is ready to continue to help if the Bosnians
continue to take the responsibilities under the Dayton peace
accord to build up a peaceful, democratic, multi-ethnic and open
state, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The union described the September 12-13 elections as "a unique
opportunity" to stay on the path toward Bosnia's closer
integration into the European community.
</P>
<P>
"Seize this opportunity by choosing responsible leaders who
will manage the country's affairs honestly and will pursue the
future you want for yourselves and for your children," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
But the European Union was dismayed by recent violence in
Bosnia and appealed to all parties concerned to stop such actions.

BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Monday that it was expecting Malta's new government to
re-submit its bid for a European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
But the commission declined to say whether the island nation
would be admitted to join the front-runners in their pursuit for
EU membership.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for European External Relations Commissioner
Hans van den Broek told the press that the union would not be
surprised to receive a renewed application for membership from
Malta in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
She added that the European Commission, the executive body of
the 15-nation European Union and the member states of the union
would review its 1993 assessment that had rated Malta as
politically and economically suitable for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the review will be to see whether the
assessment still holds, the spokesperson added.
</P>
<P>
The last Maltese government freezed the country's membership
application process in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Upon election, Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami said
that a priority of the new government would be to reactivate the
country's application for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Malta first applied for EU membership in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The European Union started in March this year accession talks
with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and
Cyprus.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Duma's left-wing opposition
is ready to the dissolution of the lower house of parliament if
the president again nominates Viktor Chernomyrdin for prime
minister for the first time, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This remark was voiced by head of the Agrarian faction Nikolai
Kharitonov after the State Duma failed again to confirm
Chernomyrdin's nomination in the second vote on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Duma's left-wing opposition will be
able to collect enough votes against Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Duma's impeachment commission has
prepared a draft resolution on one of the charges brought against
the president and will submit it to the house on Tuesday, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Duma Security Committee chairman Viktor Ilyukhin,
the draft is ready to be put to vote as a basis for further
action.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was once again turned down by the deputies of the
State Duma in its second round of vote on Monday with 138 voting
for and 273 against. There was only one abstention, and 38
deputies did not vote.
</P>
<P>
He received 44 more votes in his favor than on the firs| vote
on him on August 31, when the ballot printouts showed that he won
only 94 votes for, while 251 voting against.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction in the second
vote on Chernomyrdin changed its position. Of the 50 LDPR deputies
48 voted in favor of Chernomyrdin's nomination. In the first vote
on the nominee the entire LDPR faction denied support to
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The Our Home is Russia faction granted Chernomyrdin 64 votes
with two deputies not voting.
</P>
<P>
All 43 members of the Yabloko faction unanimously voted against
Chernomyrdin, except one did not participate in the ballot.
</P>
<P>
As the first round of vote the whole Communist Party of Russian
faction voted against the president's premier-nominee. Only two
Communists deputies did not cast votes.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chernomyrdin's supporters in the Russian Regions
group shrank almost by half. Fourteen members of the group voted
in favor of Chernomyrdin's appointment Monday, against 24 on
August 31.
</P>
<P>
After the second failure to confirm Chernomyrdin's nomination
in the State Duma the Russian president did not renominate him.
</P>
<P>
If the State Duma three times failed to endorse the president's
nominee for prime minister, the president has the right to
dissolve the parliament, or have another new candidate for the
post.

<HEADLINE> British, Irish Leaders Welcome Real IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- British and Irish leaders on
Tuesday welcomed reports that the group responsible for the worst
atrocity in nearly 30 years in Northern Ireland had declared a
total ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the Real IRA, which admits it set the
Omagh bomb last month that killed 29 people, said it had declared
"complete cessation" of military activities from midnight on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the move but he
made it clear that both British and Irish governments remained
determined to track down the Omagh bombers.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to pursue those responsible for Omagh,"
Blair said in a statement issued by Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern also welcomed the Real IRA's
ceasefire announcement.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis that this statement is now fully in effect and
final, it represents both an important and positive development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The first minister of the Northern Irish assembly, David
Trimble, made a cautious welcome, saying it did not detract from
the horror of the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad these people have come to their senses and realize
the futility of their actions," he said. "But that doesn't change
the enormity of what they have done and their culpability for it."

<HEADLINE> Israel Approves Fighters' Sale to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite pleas from Eritrea,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has allowed to sell
upgraded MiG-21 fighter jets to the Ethiopian air forces, Israel
Radio reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal had been in limbo since Eritrea protested to Israel,
asking it not to allow the war planes to be sold to Ethiopia on
the ground that Ethiopia and Eritrea were at war.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had been urgently seeking fighter jets. Israeli Elbit
Systems Company offered to sell 10 MiG-21 jets to it. But the deal
needed to be approved by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky as
saying that the prime minister has decided not to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the deal would not be implemented
immediately and that conflict between the two East African states
would likely ebb before the jets were delivered.
</P>
<P>
"The first airplane is scheduled for delivery within one
year," according to a statement Bushinsky issued. "We hope that
by then the situation will calm down. Israel's official policy is
not to sell arms to areas of conflict," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Elbit is currently upgrading 100 Romanian MiG-21 jets in a
joint venture established with a Romanian company.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia currently has about 70 Soviet-made MiG-21 fighters,
but they are in questionable shape because Ethiopia has not been
able to maintain them properly since the severing of ties with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea are at odds over at least six areas along
their common border. The latest round of border clashes broke out
in last May.

CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A state ban on shrimp fishing by trawlers has
drastically reduced the quantity of shrimp on sale and triggered a
price hike in Kuwait, Tuesday's local daily Arab Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The ban from the Public Authority for Agricultural Affairs and
Fish Resources has put 120 owners of trawlers and hundreds of
fishermen out of work, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Salem Failakawi, a fish market supervisor, said the price of a
shrimp basket had risen to 130 to 200 U.S. dollars compared with
around 80 U.S. dollars per basket before the ban was imposed.
</P>
<P>
Retail price for large sized shrimp was nearly 10 U.S. dollars
per kilogram, some 30 percent higher than that during last fishing
season.
</P>
<P>
Some trawlers have already lodged complaints against the ban.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has started the bidding process for eight
power plants employing the build-operate-transfer method (BOT),
the Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many large Turkish companies including Koc, Entes, Ihlas,
Alarko, Okan, Marubeni, Guris and Suzer, along with some foreign
companies such as Unit International, ABB, AES and Gasprom are
among the tenderers.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the eight power plants will have a generating
capacity of 4,287 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has said that
other companies which are interested in the projects have to
present their feasibility studies to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
MANAMA -- Bahrain will host from September 13 to 16 the second
Middle East petrol-tech convention and exhibition at the Bahrain
international fair grounds, with the participation of a number of
refining and petrochemical experts the world over.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" quoted the chairman of
the convention organizing committee Daifulla Al Otaiba as saying
that the convention is the second in series of events successfully
launched in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that over 600 experts would participate in the
convention to discuss more than 100 scientific and technical
working papers presented by 20 countries. They cover all aspects
of refining as well as the production of chemical matters.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the production of petrochemicals by the
Gulf Cooperation Council member states accounts for 20 percent of
world production.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The governor of Suez Mamdouh Al Zohairi has agreed to
allocate 20,000 square meters in the industrial zone in Adabiya
for producting cardboard, with total investments of 850 million
Egyptian pounds (250 million U.S. dollars) for the first phase of
the project.
</P>
<P>
The new project will produce 150,000 tonnes of cardboard a
year, 50 percent of which will be exported.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's "Alam Al Yom" quoted Zohairi as saying that studies
are under way for the establishment of a garbage processing plant
to deal with the project's waste.
</P>
<P>
Zohairi added that the factory will provide 150 job
opportunities which will rise to 300 with the completion of the
second phase.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has refused to discuss with the European Union
(EU) the allocation of a quota of textile exports in return for
reducing the margin of dumping.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's "Alam Al Yom," Egyptian Minister of
Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili pointed out that Egypt's approval
would mean its admission of dumping, an issue rejected by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt is intensifying contacts with the six EU
countries opposed to Egypt. Two EU countries are neutral
ones. Seven EU countries support Egypt's stance. EU's voting on
the issue is due to take place later this month.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian and Palestinian officials decided Tuesday to
call for a trilateral meeting soon with Israel to establish a
clear mechanism that can facilitate the trade exchange, mainly
agricultural products exchange, between Jordan and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Jordanian Minister of Agriculture Mejhim Khreisha
and his Palestinian counterpart Hikmat Zeid, the meeting will
convene agricultural and trade experts from the three sides, but
its date and venue have not been finalized yet, Jordan's official
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel keeps monopoly over the Palestinian market. Other
countries are difficult to enter the market if Israel does not
give the green light.

<HEADLINE> HK to Remain an Open Market: Financial Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region promised here
Tuesday that the government will surrender its powers of
intervention and retreat from the market once the crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
Tsang made the assurance in an interview with Radio-3's "Hong
Kong Today" program Tuesday about a package of measures taken by
the government to tackle manipulations in the foreign exchange,
stock and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
"I have explained again that we had no alternative but to make
incursions in the market," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Those are all transparent measures which we hope would reduce
the incidence of such an incursion in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have explained clearly that this market, unlike others, is
regulated not only by our own law but by the Basic Law which says
quite clearly that the market we have has to be open and it also
states very clearly for the foreign exchanges to continue its
universal circulation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"So we have explained that in extreme circumstances under which
we have to make a departure, and we have explained why we
hopefully would not have made such an incursion in the future," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The government Monday put forward a 30-point package of
measures to tackle market speculation.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures are stiffer penalties for illegal short
selling, and the Stock Exchange will also crack down on brokerages
which failed to settle trades on time.
</P>
<P>
They form part and parcel of the package that together with the
measures that the government announced last Saturday in relation
to the Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he believed that they would basically form a
reasonable package to deal with improper trading in the stock and
shares market, particularly the futures market.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsang said that the permanent solution is not entirely
rested with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there has to be some discipline, universally
and internationally agreed discipline in regulating the flow of
funds which
are used for speculative purposes of this kind," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been advocating this and so are many other countries
in Asia. And so as the International Monetary Fund. But somehow we
have not yet come to a consensus about how to proceed," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, economies like Hong Kong and many others, have
to deal with it on their own, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we did over the last few weeks are things which we would
not have done, but unfortunately circumstances are such that we
have to take these protective measures in order to guard our own
systems," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that he was very glad that those measures the
government has put in place seem to be working and the market
welcomed them.
</P>
<P>
"But as I have said many many times, speculators are part and
parcel of an open market structure and we cannot avoid them and in
certain way they are good for the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we do not want to have are manipulators in the market,
who are trying to do a double play, both on the currency market as
well as the securities market by dictating what they believe to be
the real interest rates in HK," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Those people are the sort of people we have to deal with and I
am sure that they have seen that we have sufficient determination
to deal with them, up to the point that we have made the
incursions in the securities market," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> China Congratulates DPRK on 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Tuesday sent a congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il, leader of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the founding of DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The founding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opened
a new era in Korean history. The Korean people have since embarked
on the road of building a socialist country by maintaining
independence and keeping the initiative in their own hands," Jiang
said in his message to Kim Jong Il, chairman of the National
Defense Commission of DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, the Korean people have achieved great
progress in defending their national sovereignty and in building
socialism under the leadership of late President Kim Il Sung,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace and
friendship and developing friendly relations with all the peoples
of the world, the Korean people have made positive contributions
to the peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world as
well, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Korean people are more closely united around the
Worker's Party of Korea led by comrade Kim Jong Il, they are
working hard to advance socialist construction and the cause for
the peaceful reunification of the nation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to see every achievement made by the Korean people,
and wish your country ever greater success," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Jiang said that under the present
complicated international situation, it is both in the fundamental
interest of the two peoples and conducive to regional peace and
stability to further consolidate and develop the traditional
friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that under the joint efforts of the two sides,
traditional Sino-Korean friendly and cooperative relations will be
improved even more so," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Turkish Cypriots' Proposal of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' political leaders
Tuesday unanimously condemned a confederation proposal by the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as a solution to the island's
14-year-old division.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was made at a four-hour meeting of the
National Council, the top advisory body of President on the
handling of the Cyprus problem, which comprises leaders of five
political parties in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Denktash's statements constitute a repetition, a culmination,
a codification and further worsening of earlier known intransigent
positions of the Turkish side," government spokesman Christos
Stylianides said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting came a week after Denktash proposed the
reunification of the Mediterranean island in a confederation
"between two sovereign and equal states."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides told reporters that the proposal contravenes
relevant U.N. resolutions, the 1977 and 1979 agreements between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the spirit of international law.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements envisage the establishment of a bi-zonal,
bi-communal federation in Cyprus in line with relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.N. has been trying for decades to unify the island through a
bi-communal federation formula, but the Turkish Cypriots opted out
of peace talks a year ago to protest against a European Union
decision to begin access talks with Cyprus, but not their close
ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the National Council will see if to bring the
problem before the U.N. General Assembly and the Security Council
for discussion after President Glafcos Clerides' visit to New York.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and other senior officials will fly to New York later
this month to address the U.N. General Assembly on the issue.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges for Accord on Working Hours for Truckers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is
urging that an accord on working hours be established for truckers
and coach drivers since a one-day strike by French truckers
blocked inter-European Union trade.
</P>
<P>
European Employment Commissioner Padraig Flynn and Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock hoped the parties involved could reach
an agreement on shorter working hours before September 30.
</P>
<P>
A meeting for those concerned is scheduled for September 18.
</P>
<P>
If no accord is reached, then the commission, the executive
body of the 15-nation union, will have to introduce its own
proposal on working hours for truck and coach drivers, or what the
commission describes as mobile road transport.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Commissioner Flynn told the press on Tuesday
that the commission has proposed a regular working week of 48
hours and a maximum time of 60 hours per week.
</P>
<P>
Flynn and Kinnock said in a joint statement: "The commission
recognizes the strength of feeling behind this current (French)
protest.
</P>
<P>
"It is eager to get a firm agreement between both sides of the
industry on the critical issue of working time in road transport."
</P>
<P>
But, the commissioners stressed, the social partners have an
essential role to play in shaping the framework for working time
rules at a European level, and they should grasp the opportunity
in a constructive manner.
</P>
<P>
The commission worked out a directive on working time for the
non-mobile road transport sector in July last year.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 3.5 million people involved in the road
transport industry in the European Union. The total includes both
the non-mobile and mobile transport workers.
</P>
<P>
French truckers launched a multi-day strike last year just
before the World Cup soccer tournament was scheduled to start in
their country.
</P>
<P>
The strike caused a road transport havoc and resulted in a
blockade for the inter-European community trade.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi on Cooperation with Transnational Corporations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wu Yi said
here today that the Chinese government will take an even more
welcoming attitude to investment from multinational corporations
and their cooperation with Chinese large and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
She said this in a speech at a symposium on the investment
strategy of multinational corporations which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
She continued that multinational corporations play an important
role in global economic development.
</P>
<P>
With funds, management experience and practical technology from
the corporations, Chinese businesses will stand together with the
corporations to contribute to world economic development, Wu noted
in her speech on the theme of "The Asian financial crisis and
China's economic development."
</P>
<P>
"China will not falter in its efforts at modernization
construction despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis," Wu
said. She noted that the Chinese government is confident about
overcoming the difficulties caused by the crisis and that it can
keep stable its foreign economy and trade development.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), the World Bank and some multinational
corporations attending the symposium also gave speeches on topics
including the effects of the Asian financial crisis and the
investment strategy of multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of UNCTAD, said that China
has experienced a prosperous era in the field of direct overseas
investment over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he added, the country attracted a total of 45
billion U.S. dollars in overseas investment, accounting for over
50 percent of the total in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The sound economic situation in China is what keeps the country
attractive to overseas investors, Ricupero said, adding that
China's infrastructure development and the opening up of some
service sectors will also help it attract more overseas funds.

NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A serious food crisis is
looming over Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than five million residents in the capital are facing a
potentially explosive food crisis with the month-long civil war
blocking port supplies, diplomats and relief workers were quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said the stocks of food and chemicals for water treatment

And the power supply was disrupted by the rebels, leading to
further shortage of the city's water distribution.
</P>
<P>
The situation remains tense as the regional summit at Victoria
Falls of Zimbabwe Tuesday failed to reach a cease-fire with the
Congo rebels vowing to fight on.
</P>
<P>
European diplomats said Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
government had asked the West to help open an emergency air

<HEADLINE> Technology Helps Chinese Farmers Get Affluent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Use one spade and one
pickaxe, and do all the farm work, Chinese farmers have been
working like this for thousands of years. But now they are turning
to farming technology which brings great changes in their lives.
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese farmers come to realize that simple farm
tools are not enough and farming technology can lead them to
wealth.
</P>
<P>
Yu Wencang, a villager in Wuyi County in North China's Hebei
Province, turned to raise rabbits ten years ago. Because knowing
little of technology in stock farming, he failed.
</P>
<P>
After being trained in a technology school, he succeeded in
establishing a farm to raise rabbits and then he contracted
to run a farm to grow vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"It is farming technology that helped me get affluent," he
said, "I hope my fellow villagers will know more about it."
</P>
<P>
Yu has aided ten youngsters to have training class in a farming
technology school with a total of 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
To date, about three million farmers have become farming
technicians in various fields including agriculture, forestry,
animal husbandry and fishery, said an official from Chinese
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chuntai, a senior agronomist in Hebei, said that more and
more Chinese farmers became to realize the importance of science
and technology, and they are no longer satisfied with simple farm
tools.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers go to school to learn farming technology, and some
others join in various farming technology associations. A total of
240,000 farmers in Hebei have been members of these associations.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also invent new technology. A large number of new
technologies are invented by farmers every year, bringing about
wealth valued several billion yuan, said an official from the
Ministry of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> China Capable of Combating Economic Risks: State Councillor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a strong
capacity to combat economic risks, State Councillor Wu Yi told
a seminar on investment strategies of transnationals here
today.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark while delivering a speech titled "The Asian
Financial Crisis and China's Economic Development" at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The state councillor said that though the Asian financial
crisis has to some extent worsened the international environment
for developing China's economy, putting great pressure on China's
drive to realize its economic growth target for this year, the
country's economy has continued to maintain a steady growth.
</P>
<P>
China's steady economic development despite the Asian financial
crisis has also proved that the policies and measures the central
Chinese government has put into effect are correct and effective,
Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
According to her, in the first six months of this year China's
gross domestic product (GDP) went up by seven percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to July, China witnessed increases of 7.8 percent
in industrial added value and 15.6 percent in investment by
state-owned organizations in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
In July alone, the increase in investment for fixed assets was
22.8 percent, which gave an impetus to the development of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, retail sales of
consumer commodities went up by 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, China also scored 179.487 billion
U.S. dollars-worth of foreign trade, up 4.2 percent over the same
period of last year, and chalked up 26.7 billion U.S. dollars in
favorable balance of trade, a rise of 6.2 billion U.S. dollars
over last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Also during the same period, China newly signed contracts
involving 28 billion U.S. dollars in overseas investment, up 7.3
percent, and had an inflow of 23.9 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment, which kept the level at that of the same
period of last year, coupled with an improvement in the industrial
structure of overseas-funded businesses.
</P>
<P>
By early August, China's state foreign exchange reserves stood
at 140.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The state councillor noted that China's economic growth slowed
down in the first six months of the year, but it is considered a
high growth speed from the global perspective. And the entire
spectrum of foreign trade and economic cooperation also kept a
steady growth.
</P>
<P>
Under the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis, the
central Chinese government, with a view to maintaining a
coordinated development in China's economy and stabilizing the
Asian and the eventually the global economies, has tried hard to
safeguard the stability of the Chinese currency, although it
suffered severe losses by doing so, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China has also actively participated in the
rescue package plans organized by the IMF, and provided some Asian
countries with funds and materials in accordance with China's
ability, making a due contribution to stabilizing the Asian and
world economies, said Wu, adding that the central government's
responsible attitude has won wide appreciation from the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Minister Rules Out Food Scarcity After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Shah A.M.S.
Kibria Tuesday ruled out any possibility of food scarcity after
floods in the country as there is "sufficient stock of food" and
more food aid is "in the pipeline" from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have sufficient stock of food and donors have committed
more food aid for the flood victims," Kibria told reporters at a
press conference on the flood situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Denying mismanagement in the distribution of relief materials,
he said the government was following the time-tested method of
relief distribution.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, which has repeatedly accused the government of
mismanaging relief materials, called for an "All-party Flood
Relief Committee" last month, a proposal the government has
declined.
</P>
<P>
The people were suffering immensely in the longest flood in the
country, but they were not without food because food had been
reaching them adequately, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as the flood situation continued to deteriorate
in the country, the exact extent of damage to property and crops
could not be ascertained at present.
</P>
<P>
The government had sought 879.5 million U.S. dollars in cash
and kind to take up emergency relief and post-flood and
rehabilitation work, and had received positive response from many
countries and international agencies, according to Kibria.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the special steps taken by the government to
provide succor to the affected people, he said the government
would give Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) cards to about 250,000
flood-affected families, and 100,700 tons of rice had been
allocated for distribution under the VGF cards program.
</P>
<P>
"We will distribute 1,000 VGF cards in each union (township) of
the worst affected thanas (town), in the less affected unions 700,
500 and 300 cards will be distributed respectively considering the
extent of damage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The VGF program would be implemented for the next three months,
under which each card holder would get 16 kilograms of rice a
month as relief, according to the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The country has 4,451 unions in 490 thanas, under 64 districts.
Forty-five districts have been hit by the ongoing devastating
flood since July, which has affected nearly 30 million people,
left more than 600 dead, and inflicted heavy losses in property
and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The government had decided to give 32.5 billion taka (691.5
million U.S. dollars) as agricultural loans, and a total of 120
million taka (2.56 million dollars) would be spent as house
building assistance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, David Lockwood, the resident
representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
said that the UNDP had received commitment of over 100 million
dollars against its "flash appeal" from the donor countries for
233 million dollars for flood-affected Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a ship carrying 15,000 tons of wheat for the World
Food Program (WFP), which has committed 228,000 tons of foodgrain
to Bangladesh, was heading for the country as emergency food
assistance, a WFP press release said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ship originally carrying the wheat for another country was
now off the coast of Africa and would arrive in Bangladesh's
southeastern seaport of Chittagong by September 16, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
The wheat would be enough to provide one-month basic relief
food for over 900,000 destitute families though the VGF program,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Pak Not to Be Responsible for Engineered Default: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Commerce Minister
Ishaq Dar Tuesday said Pakistan would not be responsible for any
default that may be engineered to punish it for its nuclear
detonations.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a unique default, if happens at all, for it would
not be for home-grown reasons but would be imposed from outside,"
Dar told the National Assembly while speaking on the resolution
sought to be moved by the opposition with regard to the
stabilization of the Pakistani currency.
</P>
<P>
"We have to pay the price for our sovereignty. It would be a
default, if happens at all, not because of domestic reasons but
would be done due to malafide and engineered moves from outside,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the nuclear tests, he said, the government was supposed
to pay 7.7 billion dollars loans by June 1999 and the country
would have a surplus of 1.9 billion dollars in its reserves even
after paying back these loans.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, all foreign investments inflows have been
dried down after the economic sanctions imposed by the West in the
wake of its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the devaluation of rupee, he said, the government
would strictly deal with the handful of foreign exchange dealers
who were trying to destabilize the local currency for their
personal benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said the government intends to stabilize the rupee within
reasonable limits and warned stern action would be taken against
those speculators.

<HEADLINE> Frankfurt Airport Bows to EU Competition Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Tuesday that the Frankfurt Airport had changed its ground
handling policy to abide by the commission's competition rules.
</P>
<P>
The German airport told the commission, the executive body of
the 15-nation European Union, that it would no longer tie its
customers to the concluded long-term contracts for ground handling
services.
</P>
<P>
The commission adopted last January two decisions requiring the
German airport to bring its monopoly in ramp handling services to
an end.
</P>
<P>
After the Frankfurt Airport became aware that the ground
handling market had to be opened up for competition, it sought to
preserve the substance of its old monopoly by concluding long-term
contracts with its best customers, covering periods of from three
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert immediately
told the Frankfurt Airport that its practice was contrary to the
community competition rules.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a written statement issued on Tuesday
that the Frankfurt Airport had told it that the airport would
allow its customers to terminate without penalty any contracts
already concluded and that it would not conclude any more such
contracts in the future.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Threatened Siberian Tigers to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-two Siberian tigers that
had to be evacuated because of raging floods this summer will be
returned to their home in one month's time, sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The tigers had lived in an artificial "nature reserve" north of
this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, which was
only 400 meters away from the threatened dykes of the Songhua
River.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are animals on the verge of extinction. It is
estimated that only dozens of them are still living in the wild.
</P>
<P>
From August 10, floods on the river endangered the dykes as
well as the safety of these big cats, who are being trained at the
reserve to return to live in the wild in the future.
</P>
<P>
On August 16, the tigers were moved to a special center some
200 km away, where they had to be to locked in cages.
</P>
<P>
"They might feel that their freedom has been taken away," said
Liu Jinchen, who is taking care of the tigers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the water level of the Songhua River is still above
the danger line, four meters higher than the tigers' home which is
now deep in water. The drainage work will last at least one month,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the tigers can return to the reserve safely,
animal keepers are working as dyke keepers, patrolling along the
river round the clock.
</P>
<P>
As the water level recedes, the dyke might face the danger of
collapse, the local government has warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another special reserve is being built nearby for
24 baby tigers.

KATHMANDU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- All the diplomatic passports
of the 21-member Nepalese delegation including that of Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala were stolen in Durban, South
Africa, an informed source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation comprising Nepalese press representatives was
leaving Durban for Johannesburg when it found on September 4 at
the Durban International Airport that the bag containing all the
passports was stolen, a Nepalese journalist who accompanied the
delegation said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation went to Durban to attend the 12th Summit of the
Non-Aligned Movement held on September 2-3.
</P>
<P>
The South African police tried in vain to find the passports,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the advice of the South African Foreign
Ministry, Nepali Foreign Ministry officials in the delegation
wrote letters of certificate for all the members to serve as
provisional passports.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of passports, the Nepali delegation could not
exchange its traveler's checks in Johannesburg and Dubai, the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-hour stopover in Dubai, the rest of the
delegation members were not allowed to go outside the airport
except the prime minister, his daughter, the finance minister and
Nepal's ambassador to Egypt, the journalist said.
</P>
<P>
Later Prime Minister Koirala paid a three-day visit to Qatar
without a passport, but the Qatar government made all the
arrangements, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Researchers Claim to Develop Anti-malarial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- By exploiting a compound
isolated from a Chinese herb, Indian researchers claimed to have
developed an anti-malarial drug to cure cerebral malaria, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, arteether, was jointly developed by scientists at the
Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) and the Central Institute
of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), according to the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The drug can project people against "palsmodium falciparum"
mosquitoes and cure about 98 percent patients with no untoward
reactions, said a recent CDRI report.
</P>
<P>
Under a post marketing study, a total of 300 patients from
several states were administered with the drug and most of the
patients were cured without any side effects, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the anti-malarial drugs introduced in India were
found to have adverse side effects, Indian Drug Controller General
had earlier made most marketing surveillance mandatory for all new
drugs to observe the adverse reactions.
</P>
<P>
Arteether, developed in a seven year project, was granted
marketing permit last year.
</P>
<P>
The key ingredient of the drug is a compound called artemisinin
or qinghaosu, as it was known in Chinese medical text isolated
from the herb "artemisia annual".
</P>
<P>
The mother plant was cultivated in the Kashmir valley to
produce artemisinin, said PTI.

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With the investigation of President Bill Clinton becoming a
central concern for Congress this week, lawmakers have begun to
grapple with the question that independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's report will force them to confront: Do Clinton's actions
amount to impeachable offenses?
</P>
<P>
-- In Atlanta, the cradle of the nation's civil rights
movement, thousands of black youths gathered on historic Auburn
Avenue Monday, vowing to launch a grass-roots movement to end a
feeling of apathy they say has gripped many in their generation.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's private lawyer asked that Kenneth W.
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, let him review at least

the White House is readying a defense against possible impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 10,000 educational
institutions in Bangladesh have been affected so far by the
current floods and damage to the education sector has been
estimated at 6.5 billion taka (138.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government has appealed to the donor countries and other
development agencies for 3.4 billion taka (72.3 million dollars)
"flash aid" to recover from the immediate losses caused by the
nearly two-month-long devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Eight thousand primary schools, 1,758 secondary schools and
colleges have been affected by floods, according to a primary
assessment conducted by the Education Ministry, BSS news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total affected-primary schools, 3,000 were fully damaged
and infrastructures of the rest were partially affected.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary assessment was made on the basis of reports
from the 47 flood-hit districts.
</P>
<P>
A full assessment of the damage to the education sector will be
made when the flood waters recede, Education Ministry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the schools and colleges in the country's central part
have been inundated by flood waters, and textbooks and other
classroom materials have been destroyed, the ministry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will undertake immediate repairs on the basis of
existing preliminary damage estimates, and a massive re-equipping
program of the institutions will be taken in the affected

<HEADLINE> Clothes, Quilts Donated to Northeast Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sufficient clothes and quilts
have been collected for flood victims in northeast China's
Nenjiang and Songhuajiang river basins, the Ministry of Civil
Affairs said here today.
</P>
<P>
Stricken by the worst flooding in decades, the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces in
northeast China suffered enormous losses in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Though the floods are now receding, many people who lost their
homes in the flooding face a bitter winter. So, a shortage of
thick clothes and quilts was an urgent problem in the flood-hit
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which is in charge of disaster
relief, issued an urgent circular in late August, requiring
Beijing and Tianjin cities, and Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong
provinces to collect cotton clothes and quilts for the flood
victims in northeast China. The circular also required that the
work be done within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said today that by September 6, over 38
million items of clothing and quilts, some 23 million of which
were cotton, had been raised in the five above-mentioned cities
and provinces.
</P>
<P>
Most of the clothes and quilts have already arrived in the
flood-hit areas, and the rest are on the way, according to the
officials.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said his office, through its embassies abroad, was
ready to help the Attorney General's Office conduct an
investigation into the personal wealth of former president
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"If the Attorney General's Office sends us an official letter
requesting the help, we are ready to give it," Alatas said after
attending a meeting with the House of Representatives (DPR)
Commission I here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto Sunday night denied allegations that he was keeping
wealth overseas and had misused funds of several foundations he
chairs in his own or family interest.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody has evidence that I have bank accounts in
Switzerland, Hungary or other countries, he/she could make
contacts with Indonesian embassies to transfer it to the
Indonesian government to be used to help defuse the economic
crisis," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas, however, said the Attorney General could also conduct a
probe through various channels, including the Interpol.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala stressed here Tuesday strengthening ties with the
Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press at the airport upon arrival from a visit
to Qatar, Koirala said that Nepal neglected relations with small
countries by giving priority to ties with big countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep relations with the Gulf countries by changing
our foreign policy," he stressed, adding that the Gulf countries
have very good economic potentials.
</P>
<P>
After attending the 12th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) held on September 2-3 in Durban, South Africa, Koirala paid
a three-day visit to Qatar, the first by a Nepalese prime minister
to the country and the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Nepalese are working in the Gulf countries,
with about 30,000 in Qatar alone.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Qatar had agreed to work together to foster bilateral
relations for further boosting economic and trade links, promoting
joint investment in tourism, industry, manufacturing and financial
sectors and manpower supply to Qatar through government agencies,
the official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that he had invited his Qatar counterpart Sheikh
Abdullah Bin Khalifa Al-Thani to visit Nepal.
</P>
<P>
On the NAM summit, he said that Nepal's positions on
South-South cooperation, poverty alleviation and special
facilities for the least developed and land-locked countries were
written into the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the summit was very positive.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that while in South Africa, he handed
over a letter from Nepalese King Birendra to South African
President Nelson Mandela inviting him to visit Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation
has received donations totaling 470 million yuan (about 57 million
U.S. dollars) since it began flood-relief activities last month,
an official of the Federation said at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the donations have already been distributed to flood
victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past 30 days, the Federation has collected 270
million yuan in cash and 200 million yuan worth of relief
materials and goods.
</P>
<P>
He added that so far 413 million yuan in cash and relief
goods has been sent to the flooded areas including Hunan,
Hubei and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the Federation has just received a
donation of three million yuan from Shanghai, which will be used
to set up a fund for those injured in the flood-fighting battles.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Federation is also preparing a
fund to aid the anti-flood heroes.
</P>
<P>
Information about the fund and charity sales has already been
made available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
During this summer, about 223 million people in 29 of China's
provinces and regions have suffered flood devastation. So far,
3,004 people have been killed and about five million houses
destroyed. Direct losses are estimated at more than 166 billion
yuan (about 20 billion U.S. dollars).

At today's press conference, the China Charity Federation, the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the All-China Youth
Federation, and other associations, jointly sponsored a program to

<HEADLINE> Green Action in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of the country's most populous regions in the lower reaches of
the Yellow River, has begun a massive environmental protection
campaign, the "trans-century green action."
</P>
<P>
The province plans to carry out the green action in the next
three years, focusing on protecting and improving an environment
which has long been threatened by inappropriate human activities.
</P>
<P>
The province recently made public eight cases involving illegal
logging and the killing of precious animals, as part of its effort
to crack down on illegal activities related to environmental
protection, the provincial forestry department director Cai
Qiufang said.
</P>
<P>
The province will take strong measures against criminal
activities, impose a logging ban, and plant more trees, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, many forests in the province have been
forced to give way to grain planting, mining, sand gathering and
housing construction, said Cai.
</P>
<P>
As a result, about 20 percent of the province's
150,000-square-kilometer area has been suffering from soil
erosion, and 14 of its 17 cities and prefectures have been
aversely affected by wind and sand to various degrees.
</P>
<P>
Flood control experts say that deforestation along the
country's major rivers has caused serious erosion, raising
riverbeds and partially resulting in the summer flooding which has
affected 29 provinces, cities and autonomous regions in China.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wu Yi said
here today that the Chinese government will take more effective
measures to further expand domestic demand and open wider to the
outside world in a bid to ensure the fulfilment of this year's
economic growth target.
</P>
<P>
She told a symposium on the investment strategy of
multinational corporations which opened here today that the
measures will mainly focus on six aspects:
</P>
<P>
First, financial policies will be more vigorously resorted to
to raise more funds to increase investment in the badly-needed
infrastructure. More bank loans are also expected to support this
drive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more funds will be injected into science and
technology, and education.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has the ability and conditions to do so
without incurring duplicated construction and triggering
inflation," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Second, the government has decided to increase the input in
irrigation and water conservancy and environmental protection and
accelerate the construction of a number of key projects covering
railways, highways, telecommunications, key airports, urban
construction, state-owned grain warehouses, rural power grids and
commercial housing.

<HEADLINE> Congo Summit Ends Without Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A southern African summit on
the Congolese (K) conflict ended at Victoria Falls Tuesday
without agreement on a cease-fire, according to reports from the
Zimbabwean town.
</P>
<P>
Seven presidents including three backing Congolese President
Laurent kabila's government and two opposing it gathered for a
second round of talks Tuesday, promising an immediate end to the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
However, four hours later, the rebel delegation led by Arthur
Z'ahidi Ngoma, Deputy President of the Congolese Democratic
Coalition, left the summit venue without having met face to face
with Kabila or his backers, vowing to fight on.
</P>
<P>
"We are going back home now to do one thing only, to intensify
our campaign against Kabila," Ngoma told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no cease-fire before Kabila negotiates with us
directly," Ngoma said as he left the conference site.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Foreign Minister Theo Ben Gurirab, who earlier
promised that a cease-fire would be implemented across Congo (K)
Tuesday, said he was not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
"What more did you expect. We've had the presidents sitting
around a table and talking while their armies are fighting. This
is an achievement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity Salim
Ahmed Salim read a statement after the summit calling for an
early end to the fighting in Congo and saying Kabila had promised
to "broaden the political space" in his country.
</P>
<P>
"We believe ... there must be an end to war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo. We therefore call for an immediate end to
hostilities," the seven leaders said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the defense ministers of Zambia, Congo and its
backers, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and those from rebel
allies Rwanda and Uganda would meet in Addis Ababa Thursday to
explore cease-fire options.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba chaired the summit and
said all the participants agreed on the need for a cease-fire and
recognized Kabila as Democratic Congo's legitimate ruler.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a cease-fire so we can slowly but surely bring
peace to that country," said the Zambian President.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Uganda and Rwanda of invading his country and
refuses to recognize the rebels as an internal movement. The
rebels say Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms,
running instead a corrupt and nepotistic regime.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of Banyamulenge or Congolese Tutsis took up arms to
oust Kabila in the east on August 2. On August 20, Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia sent troops to rout the rebels in the
southwest but they still control large tracts of land in the
eastern part of Africa's third largest country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea pulled out of this week's CISM 46th Military
Pentathlon World Championships,the organizing committee said
today.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea team, which scheduled to arrive here today, told
the committee yesterday through the Korean Embassy in China that
their pentathlon team is not available for the competition.
</P>
<P>
No reason have been given for their abrupt decision.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Liming, leader of the Chinese team, said after he heard
the news, "We're disappointed for their pull-out. They're the
biggest rivals for our women's team. We're well prepared and
also confident to beat them if they come here."
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianzhu, coach of the Chinese women's team, said, "It will
be easier to defend the women's team title without the challenge
from the Koreans."
</P>
<P>
China won both the team and individual titles in women's
division last year in Kristinehamn, Sweden, but lost the relay
race to DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK, which sent their first women's team to the event in
1995, defeated the Chinese women to win the team trophy, the
Challenge Cup,in 1996, and pocketed two silver team medals in the
other participations.

BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Domestic and foreign donations
for China's flood victims received by the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, Red Cross Society of China and China Charity Federation
(CCF) have exceeded 1.8 billion RMB yuan (about 220 million US
dollars), the Civil Affairs Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the Civil Affairs Ministry had received 1.19 billion

China and the CCF had received over 154 million yuan and 470
million yuan, respectively.

million yuan in donated money and donated materials worth 630
million yuan to the flood-hit areas nationwide, adding that the

donations they have received to the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Fan Baojun, deputy minister of civil affairs, today received
from the Kuwaiti ambassador to China three million US dollars,
which was said to be the largest foreign government donation for

ministry had received from foreign governments. The eight other
nations providing assistance were the United States, Japan,

<HEADLINE> HK Government Committed to Maintain Its Free Market: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa stressed here Tuesday that the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region will continue its efforts to
maintain Hong Kong as a very free market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media session after attending the Executive
Council meeting, Tung said that a series of measures announced by
the financial secretary and the chief executive of the Monetary
Authority in the last few days aimed at making sure that "our
linked exchange rate is as strong as ever, and that our stock and
futures markets can operate in an orderly and transparent manner."
</P>
<P>
"This is done to avoid our markets being manipulated," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hong Kong is one of the freest markets in the
world, Tung said: "We aim to maintain it that way."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the reason why the government entered the
market was because it saw a clear linkage between activities in
the futures market and stock market on the one hand and the
foreign currency market on the other.
</P>
<P>
"We did this to correct distortions that had been created by
those who were manipulating our market and nothing else," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tung emphasized the importance of recovering a stable interest
rate environment as Hong Kong is going through a difficult period
of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that these measures which have been taken
will be widely supported by the community.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether he is concerned that the
regulations might affect Hong Kong's freedom, Tung said: "I am not
concerned at all because i think these regulations are made really
to improve our transparency, to improve the way we will regulate
ourselves to ensure that we continue to be a very free market, and
to ensure that our market will not be manipulated."
</P>
<P>
The 7-point plan to strengthen the local currency peg and the
30-point measures to curb breaches of securities regulations were
announced by the government respectively on Saturday and Monday.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Hopes to Help Angola in Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has expressed its
desire to engage in the post-war reconstruction in Angola, O
Jornal de Angola reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted Vietnamese Ambassador to Luanda Ta
Nguyen as saying here recently that his country is willing to
pass its rich experience in post-war restoration of production
and industrialization to the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen noted that the Vietnamese government would like to
cooperate with Angola in the fields of economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is interested in investing in Angola's trade,
agriculture, civil construction, transport and fishery, the
ambassador said, adding that priority should be placed on the
development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said that Vietnam can teach Angolan farmers in rice
growing. The southeastern Asian country ranks the second among
the rice producers and the fifth among the rice exporters in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Vietnam hopes to sell Angola its food products and
manufactured goods while buying petroleum products from the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
However, Nguyen pointed out that currently there is no trade
relationship between the two governments. There are only
contacts between the small enterprises of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador disclosed that there are now about 400
Vietnamese citizens working in Angola as experts in health care
and education.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam was the second country recognizing the independence of
Angola, next only to Brazil. And Angola is the only sub-Saharan
country which has embassy in Hanoi since 1976.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Waive Charge for Int'l Transit Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- International passengers in
transit/transfer at Bangkok International Airport will be exempted
from an airport service charge should they return to the airport
within a 12-hour period.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, to be effective from October 1 this year,
will waive the 500-bath (12.5 U.S. dollars) fee for
transit/transfer passengers who temporarily depart the airport,
the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said in a statement
available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The transit/transfer passengers are only required to notify
authorities and fill out a request form upon their arrival.
</P>
<P>
TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said the regulation amendment
could well compliment the ongoing Amazing Thailand 1998-1999
campaign. "This is among a number of our initiatives to make
Thailand a bit more attractive," he said.
</P>
<P>
TAT and the Association of Thai Travel Agents (ATTA) are
preparing suggested tour programs for those wishing to visit
interesting attractions. Itineraries are being tailored, taking
into account the duration of possible activities.
</P>
<P>
At least 4-5 hours are needed for the suggested excursions,
which feature nearby spots such as the fruit and vegetable
wholesale market and various shopping complexes. Longer transit
time is for more distant places, i.e. Bang Sai Handicraft Center
in Ayutthaya, Nonthaburi or downtown Bangkok. The tour package
will be reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
Passengers can opt to travel on their own, provided that the
12-hour period is strictly observed. TAT will distribute a
guidebook recommending attractions, tips and advice.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Blast Israel's Anti-Egypt Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian diplomat said on
Tuesday that Israel has launched an anti-Egypt campaign with
ulterior motives, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdi al Kodra shrugged off as
"tendentious and suspicious" Israel's allegations that Egypt
pressured Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during his recent visit
to Cairo to reject any agreement with Israel on the further
withdrawal from the West Bank, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is the Palestinians' big brother because of its crucial
and central role, global and regional weight and also its genuine
desire for peace and stability in the Middle East," Kodra said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has never turned its back on the Palestinian cause, and
it has never interfered in the Palestinian decisions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
"wrong" if it thinks that it can impose a status quo on the Arab
world and the Palestinian people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the constant coordination between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Arafat to realize a just and comprehensive peace
and restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are stuck over the overdue
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank. Israel and the
Palestinians gave different accounts of the outcomes of recent
contacts and blamed each other for the gaps.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stressed that any agreement has to be balanced and
should not sacrifice the interest of either side.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu said that he briefed
Mubarak Monday on the latest developments in the peace process
over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
He will also dispatch two top aides to Cairo Wednesday for
further talks on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> China Should Enter WTO As Soon As Possible: Wu Yi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi
said that China, as a member of the international community that
has the ability to shoulder the related responsibilities and duties,
should enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO will be incomplete without China's participation, and
long-term exclusion of China from the organization will not help
the improvement and implementation of the world multilateral trade
system," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"China's early participation in the WTO will be beneficial to
the country's reform and opening-up, and long-term economic
development. It will also make it possible for China to contribute
more to the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in a keynote speech at the Multinational
Corporations Investment Strategy Seminar here today, saying that
the effects of the Asian financial crisis should not be
underestimated, as its aftermath will last for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
China needs a sound domestic social order and development, as
well as sympathy and support from the world community in coping
with the challenge, she added.
</P>
<P>
China has begun to be extensively involved in worldwide
multilateral trade at a time when it is opening wider to the
outside world and the Asian-Pacific economic cooperation is
increasing, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China has also carried out its own
responsibilities and international duties, and obtained
corresponding rights and interests in conducting bilateral
economic and trade exchanges with more than 200 countries and
regions. As a result, China has promoted its economy and improved
its people's lives in the process.
</P>
<P>
China is confident of overcoming difficulties brought about by
the crisis, and maintaining foreign trade increases and sustained,
rapid and sound economic development, despite the fact that the
country's exports to Southeast Asia have begun to drop and the
amount of investment from the region has decreased dramatically.

<HEADLINE> China's First Bronze Museum Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's first museum
specializing in the exhibition of ancient bronze ware opened today
in the city of Baoji in northwest China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the museum started in 1994, and cost 20
million yuan (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 27-meter-high main building was designed in the shape of an
ancient bronze cooking vessel.
</P>
<P>
China's Bronze Age began some 3,000 years ago. It was a
splendid period in world civilization. The Shang and Zhou
dynasties were famous for their superb bronze wares which both
kings and commoners used for cooking, eating and drinking and
holding religious rites.
</P>
<P>
The museum opened with a special exhibition on rare relics
excavated from tombs of the Zhou and Qin dynasties, more than
2,000 years ago. The dynasties' capitals were located in what is
now Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the museum will serve as a storehouse and an
exhibition center as well as a research institute.

<HEADLINE> More Macao Residents Act as Civil Servants: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The localization of civil
servants in Macao has scored new headway, according to officials
attending a meeting held here on Tuesday by the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 27 percent of the officials at the department level
in the Macao government are headed by local Macao residents, and
73 percent of division chiefs are Macao residents, said Wang
Xi'an, Chinese representative of the Sino-Portuguese JLG.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has made a promise that approximately all government
departments will have been headed by Macao residents by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an noted that there are only more than three months
left for the promise to be materialized and a lot of work has to
be done, expressing his wish that the Portuguese side keeps
promise.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the localization of laws in Macao, Wang said that
the localization of Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law and Commercial
Law is well under way and is expected to be completed this year.
And consultations on some other laws can be conducted next year.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that the use of Chinese as an official language is
still not enough in some administrative, judicial and legislative
affairs in Macao. The Chinese side will continue to make the
Portuguese side strengthen the use of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Moitinho de Almeida, Portuguese representative of the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, told reporters on Tuesday that Portugal would
keep its promise of localizing civil servants of the Macao
government by the end of the year.

PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- French sports minister
Marie-George Buffet said she was worried about plans for a
European soccer Super League at a time when she was working to
reduce the sports calendar to fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a press conference Tuesday, Buffet said that
"While we're trying to reduce the soccer calendar, there comes a
project which is going to increase the burden on athletes for
purely financial reasons."
</P>
<P>
The minister's remarks came as she was setting up a working
group of doctors and scholars who will have to publish a report
within two months following the doping scandal which rocked the
cycling Tour de France in July.
</P>
<P>
The group will study ways to reduce the sports calendar and
to preserve the independence of sports doctors, whom Buffet said
were torn between the demands of their employers and the need to
protect the health of athletes.
</P>
<P>
Buffet's antidoping bill will go before the French parliament
on November 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany press Tuesday welcomed
the resignation of national coach Berti Vogts.
</P>
<P>
The financial daily Handelsblatt noted on its front page that
"his career as a footballer ended with an own goal and his career
as a trainer has finished with identical misfortune".
</P>
<P>
Under the headline "Aus!" (Out) the daily Bild recalled that
Vogts's team had won 67 games only losing 12.
</P>
<P>
The paper added: "If the national team is at an impasse Berti
Vogts is not the only person responsible. The players can no
longer hide behind him."
</P>
<P>
Skipper Oliver Bierhoff hoped that his team "will be able to
play more freely".
</P>
<P>
Bonn's General Anzeiger said Vogts' resignation had come "too
late", adding that he had accepted the consequences "of his
failure".
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Vogts resigned Monday after a period of
intense criticism spurred on when the press slammed his side's
performances in last week's two friendly matches with Malta and
Romania.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM to Visit Iran over Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem is scheduled to pay a four-day visit to Tehran next
week for talks on the latest developments in Afghanistan, the
official IRNA news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted informed sources as saying that Turkey has voiced
willingness to consult with Iran on ways of solving the Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cem's visit comes after a trip to Turkey Monday by
Afghanistan's ousted president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, who called
for international measures against his country's fundamentalist
Taliban militia, it said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani and his Northern Alliance suffered a serious setback
last month when the Taliban captured Mazari Sharif, a major
stronghold of the alliance in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which drove Rabbani out of capital Kabul in 1996,
is controlling most areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is concerned with Taliban's advance, fearing that the
group advocating strict Islamic rule would spread Islamic
fundamentalism to Central Asian republics, which enjoy close
relations with Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, though a predominantly Muslim country, maintains
secularism.
</P>
<P>
It is widely rumored that Tehran and Ankara are encouraged to
arm Afghan refugees in Iran in response to their request to fight
against the Taliban militia.

<HEADLINE> HK Fund Industry Sees Marginal Net Inflows in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust
industry recorded marginal net inflows of 3.5 million U.S. dollars
in July after a heavy outflow of 133.9 million U.S. dollars in
June.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 14 sectors, only five saw net inflows in the month,
according to the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA),
which groups 47 fund management firms.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive month, the six Asian sectors all
registered net outflows in July. However, net outflows from the
Asian sectors dropped substantially to 32 million U.S. dollars
from 141 million U.S. dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the sales of Asian funds, Lin Yoke Seetoh, acting
chairman of HKIFA, said: "As the outlook for the region continues
to be bleak, investors continue to stay away from Asian equity
funds. However, since July represented a relatively stable month
for the region, the level of redemption had subsided."
</P>
<P>
The month of July saw consistent robust inflows into European
equity funds, with net inflows, at 48.7 million U.S. dollars, the
highest recorded this year.
</P>
<P>
Investors have been turning to the more developed stock and
bond markets as the prospects of recovery for most Asian economies
appear distant, Seetoh remarked.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Laud Government's New Market Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Many newspapers in Hong Kong
issued editorials or commentaries Tuesday to welcome the
government's 30-point new measures to curb market speculation,
including expulsion of brokers who breach Hong Kong's trading
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Ming Pao Daily News said in an editorial that the new measures
aiming to maintain a good order of the securities and futures
market and increase its transparency are "moderate and
reasonable."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that it would not be difficult for these
measures to win the support of Legislative Council members and
the public as well, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, brokers who repeatedly breach rules on
short-selling will receive heavy penalties and risk losing their
stock exchange membership.
</P>
<P>
An article published by Hong Kong Standard said the new
measures will "add strength to the government's anti-speculation
drive by providing stricter rules no short-selling in the stock
market."
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao issued a commentary entitled "Goal of Defending
Linked Exchange Rate System, Stabilizing Market Bound to Be
Realized."
</P>
<P>
It said the sharp rise in the Hang Seng Index Monday to 8,076
points, the third highest so far this year, together with the fall
of the interbank rate, demonstrates that the order of Hong Kong's
financial market seems to start its recovery to normal.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said the seven-point measures announced by the
government at the weekend to strengthen the currency board system
have achieved remarkable results.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in the Hang Seng Index and lower interbank rate
fully show that the government's intervention in the stock market
is correct and necessary and the foundation of Hong Kong's stock
market is sound and healthy.
</P>
<P>
The government's 30-point measures to tighten up securities and
futures market are a result of summing up experiences by the
government to curb speculations, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The leadership of the
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) said Tuesday that
the Great Hural (parliament) has to be dismissed if it fails to
appoint a new government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The government crisis, which was caused by the wrong policy of
the ruling union -- the Mongolian National Democratic Party and
the Mongolian Social Democratic Party, is intensified and those in
power were unable to get the country out of the current political
deadlock, thus leading to a parliament crisis," the MPRP said in a
statement to all people of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
As the ruling union did not introduce systematical economic and
social policies, Mongolia has to face a very serious financial
difficulty, for which the ruling union should bear the
responsibility, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
So far, three prime minister nominees have been rejected since
the former government led by Tsakhiya Elbegdorj was dismissed on
July 24.

CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
Tuesday slightly weaker but off earlier lows as buying from Tokyo

The local currency closed the session in Sydney at 59.34 U.S.
cents, down marginally from 59.36 U.S. cents Monday night. It had
earlier dipped to 58.76 U.S. cents after opening below the 59.00
U.S. cent mark.
</P>
<P>
"With the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate bouncing off
131.00 yen today, we've seen Aussie/yen buying come out in force,
which drove the Aussie up and really kept it supported all day,"
said Stuart Moore, manager of foreign exchange trading with St
George Bank.
</P>
<P>
A great deal of movement is expected Tuesday night as U.S.
markets return from their Labor Day long weekend.

"The big thing will be tonight and the Dow, we've had two very
good days in the Asian stock market so people will be watching the
Dow after the holiday in the States," Moore said.
</P>

"I think (the Australian dollar) will focus mainly on the
strength or the weakness of the U.S. dollar and that will depend
on the Dow," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Jobless Rate Dips in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment rate
dropped slightly to 10.6 percent in August from 10.7 percent a
month ago, confirming a long-predicted trend reversal on the
country's depressed job market, the German Federal Labour Office
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics issued by the labour office Tuesday in
Nuremberg put Germany's jobless total at 4,095,400, down 39,000
from July.
</P>
<P>
When compared with the same month a year ago, the number of
people out of work dropped by 276,600, the office said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now talking about a trend reversal," said labour office
president, Bernhard Jagoda.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that Germany's jobless total is
set to go down below the four million mark in September and
October and would drop by between 200,000 and 300,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
With Germany's national elections just 19 days away, the latest
job data also gave a boost to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl whose
public support has suffered badly from the near-record
unemployment over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The positive development on the job market showed that the
government's reform policies had been effective and companies had
started once again to recruit more workforce, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), however,
played down the government's role in cutting unemployment and
stressed that the latest drop in the jobless total was
attributable to a large extent to makeshift job-creation
programs.

motorparks, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters stormed the Victoria Island office of the
Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) in five over-loaded buses and
then went to the office of the Lagos state military administrator
to formally register their grievances.
</P>
<P>
In a nine-point resolution contained in their public notice,
the striking drivers called for the "total disengagement of
NURTW and RTEAN from all motor parks".
</P>
<P>
The notice advised all vehicle owners to keep their vehicles
within their domain until the vexed issues were settled.
</P>
<P>
"All sectors of commercial drivers should cease work as from
Monday, September 7, until further notice," it added.
</P>
<P>
As there were no commercial buses in Lagos Monday, many
commuters had to walk to their destinations and most offices were
empty as workers could not have access to buses to take them to
work.
</P>
<P>
The striking drivers belong to five associations including
Lagos State Taxi Drivers' Association, Urban Commercial Bus
Drivers' Association of Nigeria and Mini-bus Drivers'
Association.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Output Up Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial output
picked up slightly, and the three months of flooding stimulated
domestic demand to a certain extent, according to the monthly
report released today by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that China's industrial added value totalled
158.2 billion yuan, increasing by 7.9 percent on an annual
basis. And the total added value during January-August reached
1.266 trillion yuan, up 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's heavy industry also witnessed a faster growth in
August, encouraged by the Chinese government's scheduled policy of
increasing investment and stimulating domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Statistics revealed that industry's output rose by 7.9 percent,
1.2 percentage points higher than the previous month, while light
industry grew 7.8 percent, 0.9 percentage points lower than the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
Production in the flood-hit regions is rebounding. For
instance, the growth rate of Jiangxi Province was 6.2 percent
higher than the previous month, while that of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province was 0.2 percentage points lower.
</P>
<P>
The month also registered the highest production-to-sales ratio
of 1998, hitting 97.64 percent, 1.35 percent higher than the
previous month.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers: Regional Financial Crisis Should Be  Urgently Addressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Ministers Responsible for
small and medium-scaled enterprises (SMEs) of Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Tuesday stressed the importance of
urgently addressing the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed concern that, if not addressed
urgently, the global contagion effect that is evident now will
exacerbate, a joint statement issued Tuesday at the end of their
two-day meeting held in Petaling Jaya near here said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of regional financial instability on the SMEs was
addressed in depth at the two-day meeting, Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told a press conference

social safety nets in affected economies.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers emphasized that APEC Finance Ministers should
develop the necessary securities and financial market regulatory
framework as soon as possible and agreed that proposals
pertaining to measures to address the financial crisis discussed
at this meeting be conveyed to finance ministers, it said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that it is important to continue with the
liberalization process and that the present financial turmoil
should not deter progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of APEC economies taking
measures either individually or collectively to prevent a future
recurrence of the crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers encouraged the adoption of specific measures to
address the impact of the crisis on SMEs, which could include
ensuring the availability of trade financing by exports credit
agencies, expansion of industrial supply and subcontracting
business cooperation, better risk assessment capabilities in
relation to credits for SMEs, dissemination of information on
opportunities to build better business linkages for trade and
investment among SMEs and establishment of an interactive business
matching web site.
</P>
<P>
The ministers directed the Policy Level Group (PLG) on SMEs to
work closely with other APEC fora to assist SMEs to overcome their
difficulties as a result of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Endorse Integrated Plan of Action for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Ministers Responsible for
small and medium-scaled enterprises (SMEs) of Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Tuesday endorsed at their fifth
meeting in Malaysia the proposed Integrated Plan of Action for SME
Development (SPAN).
</P>
<P>
The SPAN will serve as a set of broad guidelines for SME
development in individual economies, Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told a press conference Tuesday
at the end of the two-day meeting held in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint statement issued at the end of the meeting
said the ministers recognized that SPAN, which builds on the
Framework of SME activities approved by Ministers in 1997,
provided a convenient reference point for review of initiatives,
programs and regulatory framework to promote the development of
SMEs and to plan future action at the individual economy level and
collaborative efforts at the APEC level.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers at the meeting emphasized the importance of
focusing the SME work program on key issues which affect SME
development and on sharing best-practice responsible to these
issues.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that SPAN should also promote the development
of new entrepreneurs including technopreneurs and recommended the
inclusion of micro enterprises and women entrepreneurs as an
integral part of SPAN.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing environmental friendly and cost effective
technology should be accessible to SMEs, the ministers agreed that
SPAN should also include environmental considerations.
</P>
<P>
In endorsing the SPAN, the ministers acknowledged that it is
not intended to be prescriptive and that adoption would be on a
voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also stressed the importance of private sector
participation in contributing to and carrying out the objectives
of SPAN.
</P>
<P>
The SPAN will be presented to the Ministerial Meeting and
Leaders in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, the ministers also discussed the
importance of electronic commerce for SMEs, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reaffirmed the need for specific programs to
facilitate and promote the wider use of electronic commerce by
SMEs and also recognized the need for setting-up appropriate
information infrastructure to ensure business access to electronic
networks.
</P>
<P>
Noting the progress on the implementation of the 17 approved
projects, of which 7 have been completed and the remaining 10 are
at various stages of implementation, the ministers endorsed three
new project proposals including a Strategy for
Internationalization of SMEs in Asia Pacific Area, Training and
Certification for Small Business Counselors, and Electronic
Commerce Impact Study for SMEs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministers had a dialogue with representatives
of the business sector during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also addressed in depth the impact of regional financial
instability on the SMEs and stressed the importance of urgently
addressing the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed New Zealand's offer to host the next
Ministerial Meeting in Christchurch in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was represented by all the 18 APEC members
-- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and
the United States as well as three member-designate economies
--Peru, Russia and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Unemployment Yet to Be Worse in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- It was Sunday morning.
Chaichan Wanitthaweewat packed the clothes hangers, laundry
brushes, toothbrushes, clothes pegs and scouring pads he bought
from a wholesale market in Bangkok and headed for a weekend fair,
hoping to make some profits by selling them at retail prices.
</P>
<P>
Chaichan had never imagined he would start his career like this
when he studied ceramics at Sinakharinwirot University.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, his untimely graduation coincided with the
country's worst economic recession in decades. For months, he had
been monitoring newspaper ads for job vacancies and had sent reams
of application letters, but no offer came in.
</P>
<P>
Chaichan is one of the thousands of new university graduates
who became jobless as soon as they left the classroom. The
University Affairs Ministry said there will be 48,000 graduates
like Chaichan at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Chaichan is also one of the 2 million people who are ranked
"unemployed" in the country.
</P>
<P>
In fact, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting
Thailand's economy to contract by 7 percent this year, and little
improvement in 1999, economists agree that the full impact on
unemployment has yet to be felt.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government predicted earlier this year that
unemployment will reach 2 million this year. However, statistics
for the first half of the year showed that the number of jobless
people has already reached 2 million. Some analysts said the
number may reach 3 million by year-end, or 10 percent of the
country's labor force.
</P>
<P>
What's more, experts said Thailand hasn't really felt the
problems of unemployment yet because job losses just started six
months ago. And people still have their compensation payments.
</P>
<P>
But with prolonged unemployment, once savings run out, social
problems will definitely follow, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth letter of intent reached by Thai government and
IMF, the government pledged to make improvement in the targeting
of its social safety net program by increasing the current year
expenditure for the social program.
</P>
<P>
However, only a robust economic recovery can pull the country
out of the mire of mass unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Medicine prescribed by the IMF for Thailand's economic recovery
hinges on positive external factors, such as export growth and
investment flows, to help replenish foreign reserves, increase
liquidity and spur the recovery.
</P>
<P>
The external environment, however, is far from favorable with
Japan, Russia, Latin America being infected with the flu of
economic crisis and the strongest United States hardly immune.
</P>
<P>
Chartchai Parasuk, a former IMF staff member, said the IMF
prescription for Thailand is risky since everything depends on
external events while the clouds of a global recession are looming
large.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Thailand will be unable to absorb the shock
of 10-15 percent unemployment rates since unemployment will cause
purchasing power and consumption to decline with most of the job
losses occurring in the non-agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In turn, private production will slow, feeding back in a circle
as more companies go bankrupt or downsize, leading to more
unemployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Atchana Waiquamdee, director of the economic research
department at the Bank of Thailand, also said with the zero
economic growth next year as forecast by the government and the
IMF, domestic demand and production would continue to fall because
of rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's 1999 fiscal budget calls for a deficit of
3 percent of gross domestic product, used to support additional
spending to help spur employment and ease the social impact of the
recession.
</P>
<P>
However, Atchana said the fiscal deficit spending as targeted
would have little impact on unemployment, considering the increase
in the labor force from newly graduated students.
</P>
<P>
In theory, zero growth should cause employment levels to remain
relatively steady. But declining consumption would force
corporates to restructure, cut costs and downsize, thus increasing
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Though a peddler now, Chaichan still cherishes his dream of
owning and operating a facility where he could put his university
ceramics study to good use.
</P>
<P>
However, at present, what he asks for is a decent job. But even
that seems to be an unreachable dream for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Real IRA Declare Total Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Real IRA, the terrorist
group that bombed Omagh in Northern Ireland last month, said on
Tuesday it was declaring a "complete" ceasefire starting from
Monday midnight.
</P>
<P>
The republican splinter group, which suspended its armed
activities three days after the Omagh blast that killed 29 people
on August 15, issued its ceasefire announcement to Ireland's
national broadcasting network RTE.
</P>
<P>
As a result of intense consultation that has taken place over
recent weeks, and in accordance with the constitution of the Real
IRA, the volunteers...have determined a complete cessation of all
military activity, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was quoted in television
reports as saying the Real IRA statement was important and
positive for the Northern Ireland peace process provided it was
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
But he made clear the British and Irish governments remained
determined to track down the Omagh bombers.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA was formed by a small core of hard-liners who
stormed out of the IRA in late 1997 in protest against the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA), the mainstream republican
guerrilla force, declared a ceasefire in July 1997, which paved
the way for full-scale peace talks and led to the signing of the
historic peace agreement in last April.

<HEADLINE> NAM Summit to Effect Long-term Influence: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao today lauded the recently concluded 12th summit of the
Non-Aligned Movement as an important meeting at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The summit has produced positive results and will undoubtedly
have a long-term effect on the future development of the movement,
Zhu said at today's routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
He termed NAM as an important political force in the world
arena, and said China has always attached great importance to the
movement's constructive role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since it became an observer of the movement, China has enjoyed
considerable progress in its relationship with NAM, and
co-operation between the two sides promises broad prospects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese delegation headed by Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
attended the summit convened from August 29 to September 3 in
Durban of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tang delivered a speech on China's relations with the movement,

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Foreign Minister Tang's Visit to US, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan's upcoming visit to the United States will be helpful in
speeding the implementation of the wide-ranging unanimity reached
by leaders of both nations during their recent summit, and expand
the bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economy, trade,
science, education, energy, environmental protection, judiciary
and military fields.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao made this remark at a
routine news conference today. At the invitation of US Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Tang will pay an official visit to
the U.S. on September 27-29, after attending the United Nations
General Assembly, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
It will be his first visit to the U.S. as foreign minister, the
spokesman said, and the first visit to U.S. by a Chinese foreign
minister in the wake of the exchange of successful visits between
heads of state of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister will hold talks with Albright, and
meet with other U.S. leaders. They will have an extensive and
profound exchange of views on Sino-U.S. relations and important
international and regional issues of mutual concern, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he believed that the visit will also be conducive to
China and the US' efforts to build a constructive, strategic
partnership facing the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that Tang Jiaxuan will also pay an
official visit to Canada from September 30 to October 5 as guest
of his Canadian counterpart Hon Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The visit, first to be paid by a foreign minister of the new
Chinese government, would produce a significant impact on the
Sino-Canadian friendship and cooperative ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Tang will meet with the Canadian prime
minister and parliament leaders, and confer with his Canadian
counterpart Axworthy during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would discuss the further implementation of the
strategy to build an overall Sino-Canadian cooperative partnership
oriented to the 21st century, reached when President Jiang Zemin
visited Canada last year, Zhu said, adding that they would also
exchange views on international and regional issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Canada, Tang will also attend the opening
ceremony of the Chinese Consulate General in Calgary, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Viet Nam to Withdraw From Submerged Reefs in Nansha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China has made serious
representations to the Vietnamese side, strongly demanding it to
withdraw from two of China's submerged reefs which was unlawfully
occupied by the Vietnamese navy, said Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks at a regular press conference here this
afternoon, when asked to comment on the fact that the Vietnamese
navy recently sent warships, suddenly occupying and setting up
permanent facilities on Aonan and Jindun submerged reefs to the
southeast of Nanhuitan of China's Nansha Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Nansha archipelago has been a part
of Chinese territory since ancient times, Zhu said, adding that
China has the indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha
archipelago and its adjacent waters.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Vietnamese side recently occupied the
above-mentioned two submerged reefs by force has seriously
infringed upon China's territory and sovereignty, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China has strongly demanded the Vietnamese side to withdraw
from the two reefs at once, dismantle all the facilities which
were illegally established there and guarantee that such acts of
occupation would never happen again, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Syrian Accusations of Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has rejected Syria's
accusations that it is seeking to form a military alliance with
Turkey and Israel against other Arab countries, a report of
the Jordan Times daily said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian media can say what they want, but our stand is
clear. There is no way that Jordan will enter alliances that
target any Arab country," Jordanian Information Minister Nasir
Judeh told reporters late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that Jordan and Turkey are carrying out
military cooperation, Judeh insisted that the move results from a
concern of "comprehensive security" of the region and is "for the
interests of all the Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials and the state-run media have criticized Jordan
for its relations with Turkey and Israel, which they said are
detrimental to Arab interests. Jordan is one of the only two Arab
countries after Egypt conceiving peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official Al-Baath newspaper said on Sunday that
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's current tour to Jordan and
Israel is "a hostile move Arab and Islamic countries should
confront."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz ended a two-day visit to Jordan and traveled to Israel
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is "wrong" to put the Jordanian-Turkish military cooperation
in the same ranks of the Turkish-Israeli relations, the Jordanian
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel signed a number of agreements in 1996 to
enhance cooperation in military and defense, a move which has met
with sharp criticism and strong opposition from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries accuse Turkey, a predominately Muslim
country, of betraying the interests of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Israel, a Jewish state, is occupying territories of Syria,
Lebanon and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Combat Illegal Recruiters of Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
mounting a fresh crackdown on illegal recruiters following reports
of an international racket engaged in the slaughter and sale of
internal organs of overseas Filipino workers, Press Undersecretary
Lcasiano Gutierrez said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said President Joseph Estrada has ordered law enforcement
agencies and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration as
well as the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration to make
aggressive efforts to unmask and bring to justice the illegal
recruiters and the alleged partners in the trade of human organs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada ordered the concerned departments to launch
a massive information campaign in the provinces so that those
planning to seek employment abroad could be forewarned against
dealing with illegal recruiters, Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
"President Estrada considers illegal recruitment as a crime
more heinous than kidnapping because it victimizes the poor whose
dream to give their children a better life ultimately ends in
tragedy in foreign lands," Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez called on the people to support the government
campaigns by coming out and reporting any lead or information that
will help law enforcers track down and arrest these illegal
recruiters.
</P>
<P>
Families with kin working abroad should also bring to the
attention of the authorities any problem or apprehension confided
to them by their relatives, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, presidential adviser on overseas workers affairs
William Gatchalian reported to the president that some Filipinos
working abroad were killed and their vital internal organs were
sold.
</P>
<P>
Gatchalian said members of the syndicate covered up their
crimes by passing off the death of their victims as suicide cases.
Many of the victims were also reported missing in their host
countries.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Minister Urges Use of IT in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of
Education Arnaldo Nhavoto has called on the use of information
and telecommunication technologies in education in face of an
increasing population of pupils.
</P>
<P>
"Only by employing the information and telecommunication
technologies, can we satisfy the need of the rapidly increasing
population of pupils and train enough qualified teachers,"
Monday's Noticias newspaper quoted Nhavoto as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a launching ceremony of the Project of Information
and Telecommunication Technologies in schools across the country,
the education minister said that the population of the pupils in
Form One to Form Four went from 1992's 1.2 million to 1.9 million
in 1998, up by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, Nhavoto said, all school houses
damaged during the civil war were restored and the current number
of primary schools exceeds 3,110 in 1983.
</P>
<P>
In response to the rapid growth of the pupil population, he
disclosed, 12,000 teachers were recruited.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the fast expansion of primary schools has
brought a great challenge to the Mozambican educational system
and exerted a great pressure upon the higher education.
</P>
<P>
The development of education will be hindered by the
traditional modes of teaching and school construction, the
minister said, adding that television and radio stations will
play active roles in the education in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Nhavoto also said that his ministry will conduct feasibility
study of the tele-educational system after a nationwide
discussion on policies.

</P>
<P>
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity can by no means
be split, Zhu said, adding that if the Taiwan authorities are
sincere they should break away from their stance of "Two Chinas,"
and thus will have no reason to put off procedural talks on
political negotiations.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Develop Huge Zinc Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- South African mining
giant, Anglo American Corporation (AAC) has announced that it
will develop a four-billion-Rand (660 million U.S. Dollars) zinc
mine in Northern Cape Province, producing 200,000 tons a year of
refined zinc.
</P>
<P>
The output of the future mine will be about four percent of
current Western world annual production, the Daily Business
quoted Anglo American Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson as
reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The development will create 2,000 jobs and be situated at
Northern Cape's Gamsberg deposit which contains about 90 million
tons of ore, grading at about 6.4 percent of zinc, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
The resources have been known for many years, but owing to a
troubled metallurgy, was never developed by Gold Fields of South
Africa, the mining house which agreed last Friday to sell its
controlling stake in the deposit to AAC.
</P>
<P>
AAC already had a 45 percent stake in Gamsberg.
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the mine would be a low-cast producer. AAC was
developing new technology which could yield even higher returns
from the investment, he added.

<HEADLINE> Most Ugandan Kids Immunized: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Most of Ugandan kids have
been immunized in the first round of the 1998 National
Immunization Days (NIDs) for polio eradication which was
successfully conducted in early August, a report has said.
</P>
<P>
The report, carried in Tuesday's New Vision daily, was issued
by the Ugandan Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
It said a total of 3,962,701 kids, or 97.7 percent of all
Ugandan children under the age of five years have received
immunization across the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The districts of Sembabule, Ntungamo and Rakai had the lowest
coverage of less than 50 percent while other districts have
continued to perform very well.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the poor turn-up in some areas to
widespread rumors and misconceptions about NIDs and lack of
adequate information and explanation.
</P>
<P>
The association of NIDs Oral Polio vaccine with recent malaria
outbreaks in western and southwestern Uganda adversely affected
the turn-up of children during the immunization campaign,
especially in the districts of Ntungamo, Mbarara, Rakai,
Sembabule and Bushenyi.
</P>
<P>
The health ministry thanked all those who had helped the
successful implementation of NIDs and announced the second round
is scheduled to take place on September 12 to 13.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Economy Forecast to Shrink This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer Bill
Birch submitted a Treasury Forecast to the Parliament Tuesday,
announcing that the economy of the country is to shrink this year
for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, the New Zealand Government will
cling to a surplus of 100 million New Zealand dollars (about 50
million U.S. dollars) this fiscal year, but the economy is
expected to contract 0.5 percent in the year ending March 1999.
This would trim tax revenues and plunge government accounts into
the red in the next two fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
Though the Treasury painted a gloomy picture for the short
term, it held out hope for an economic recovery next year. In its
forecast, the Treasury said that the economic growth of New
Zealand is expected to be 2.9 percent in 1999-2000 and 4 percent
in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said that market volatility, lower business and
consumer confidence, drought, and the Asian crisis prompted it to
revise its 1998-1999 forecast of 2.7 percent economic growth made
in the May 14 Budget.
</P>
<P>
Lower growth is expected to trim the surplus, estimated at 1.2
billion New Zealand dollars (about 600 million U.S. dollars) in
the budget, to 100 million New Zealand dollars this year.
Afterwards, the surpluses run since 1994 will disappear. The
Treasury forecasts a deficit of 700 million New Zealand dollars
(about 350 million U.S. dollars) in 1999-2000 and 300 million New
Zealand dollars (about 150 million U.S. dollars) the year after.
</P>
<P>
According to the Treasury Forecast, the unemployment rate in
New Zealand is expected to rise to 8.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Birch said that despite the downturn, "the New Zealand economy
has shown great resilience and an ability to bounce back."
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind that Asia, which took 40 percent of New
Zealand's exports last year, has suffered massive economic losses,
today's release was "a pretty good forecast," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of the past 15 years meant New Zealand was better
placed to cope with global shocks, such as the Asia crisis, than
previously, Birch said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that U.S. ratings agency Moody's looks almost
certain to downgrade New Zealand's foreign currency debt rating
following today's gloomy economic outlook from the Treasury.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Surging in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued surging in
Tokyo Tuesday, driven by a rise in Nikkei index futures prices.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at 14,913.49, up 123.43
points, or 0.83 percent, after posting a 5.32 percent gain Monday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 1.64 points, or 0.14 percent, from
Monday's close to end at 1,131.01.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the main section came to an estimated 500 million
shares, little changed from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Failed Toa Steel Co., a major electric-furnace steelmaker, was
the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The market experienced sharp fluctuation throughout the day. At one
point, the Nikkei soared more than 500 points and returned to the
15,000 level for the first time intraday since August 26. Investors
then sold to take profits.
</P>
<P>
An hour into trading, the Osaka Nikkei index futures market sprang
to life. The price of the September contract rocketed as high as
15,310 before falling back to end at 14,870, down 60 points from
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei cash index essentially tracked the same course. It hit
a session high 15,294.26 before investors whittled away at the gains
throughout the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
Monday's 747-point rise, the Nikkei's second biggest point gain
this year, was also driven by high-flying futures prices.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, gainers surpassed
losers 612 to 523, with 165 issues remaining unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- At least five students were
reportedly injured in a clash between students and security forces
at dawn here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out when the security officers, mostly from the
police and the marines, tried to evict the demonstrators by firing
teargas canisters at them, prompting the students to retaliate
with stones and bottles.
</P>
<P>
Two students sustained wounds from bayonets and the other three
were either hit by stones or were trampled upon in the incident,
according to Antara News Agency reports.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 students staging a rally at the House of
Representatives (DPR) building here since Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Following the clash, the students decided to march to the
University of Atmajaya, some two kilometers from the DPR, but
threatened to return Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The DPR compound was finally cleared of protesters by 3:20
a.m., but troops began blockading the streets leading to the
building.
</P>
<P>
The students were protesting the spiraling prices of the basic
commodities and were calling for the resignation of President B.J.
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
In the country's second largest city of Surabaya, thousands of
students from 26 universities and colleges Tuesday also staged a

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Literacy Rate up to 90 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's literacy rate rose to
90 percent by the end of 1997, thanks to the continuous efforts in
school education and adult education, according to an official
statement obtained here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released by the Ministry of Education to mark
the International Literacy Day on September 9.
</P>
<P>
It said Jordan's achievement is encouraging in view of a 32.3
percent literacy rate in the kingdom in 1966 when adult education
was introduced, and an average 49 percent literacy rate in the
whole Arab world in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's establishment of schools across the kingdom and
its efforts to improve the quality of education have achieved a
school attendance rate of 98 percent among the children in the
1996-1997 school year, thus helping improve the literacy rate.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's measure starting in 1997 to make education
compulsory until 10th grade also helped achieve a high literacy
rate, the statement added. In 1964, Jordan made education
compulsory until ninth grade, a stipulation that stayed for 33
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement added, the ministry's efforts to
popularize education among illiterate adults also helped push up
the literacy rate. It has offered education classes to a total of
350,000 illiterate adults since the program started in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with a 4.6-million population, had 2,800 government-run
schools, some 950 private schools, 55 community colleges, six
state-run universities and six private universities.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Expects 30 Percent Drop in Sales in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Coca-Cola Company expects a 30
percent fall in sales in Zambia following its price hike by 80
percent in the local market effective Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Post Tuesday quoted Ian Ackerman, general manager of
Zambia Bottlers Limited, Coca-Cola's manufacturer in Zambia, as
saying Monday that his company expected sales to fall by 30
percent after it raised the price from 500 Kwacha (one U.S.
dollar equals 2000 Kwacha) to 900 Kwacha each bottle.
</P>
<P>
The price hike came after the Zambian government's failure to
honor the agreement reached in May with Coca-Cola under which it
will reduce the company's excise duty from 25 percent to five
percent while Coca-Cola in turn pledged to invest 75 million
dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola declared last Thursday that it would raise the
prices for soft drinks, suspend its investment program and scale
down its operations in Zambia. It also said that reluctance of
the Zambian government to honor the agreement will also
facilitate the company's departure from this country.
</P>
<P>
According to Ackerman, his company will scale down its
production with effect from Tuesday and it has now engaged a
"wait and see" attitude towards the government before it takes
further action.
</P>
<P>
Local vendors complained that their daily sales of Coca-Cola's
soft drinks dropped massively Monday due to the price hike.
</P>
<P>
And Zambia Congress of Trade Unions on the same day urged the
Zambian government to honor its agreement with Coca-Cola, warning
that if the agreement was abandoned, there would be 15,000
Zambians to lose their jobs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Deplores Hatred for Ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's foreign ministry
released a statement Tuesday, accusing some Cambodian forces of
instigating hatred for ethnic Vietnamese in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a number of extremist elements in
Cambodia, driven by "political ambitions," have incited hatred for
ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia and intimidated or killed aliens
there.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government and people "vehemently protest these
barbarous acts taken by a number of extremist elements which
seriously violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
Such acts have further complicated the situation in Cambodia,
undermined the friendship between Vietnam and Cambodia, and
poisoned the atmosphere of peace, cooperation and development in
Southeast Asia, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam urged Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, with his
prestige and influence, to prevent the recurrence of "such
racialist crimes against ethnic Vietnamese."
</P>
<P>
It also requested the Cambodian government to take effective
measures to stop the crimes and guarantee the safety of life and
property of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current situation in Cambodia, Vietnam hoped
that a new Cambodian government should be established soon to
stabilize the situation and realize the Cambodian people's
aspirations for peace and development, the statement added.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Central Bank President
Sergei Dubinin offered his resignation Monday and went on leave
while his appeal is being considered, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin's post now is taken over by Deputy Finance Minister
Sergei Aleksashenko until a new head is appointed.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president, Dubinin said that he had found it
"practically impossible" to work amid demands by both the Duma
(lower house of parliament) and acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin, along with former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko, had
offered his resignation immediately after the ruble devaluation
was announced last month. But President Boris Yeltsin had then
refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Dubinin was losing a government
post because of a fall in the ruble's value. He was sacked as
deputy finance minister after the ruble's 21 percent fall on the
so-called Black Tuesday of October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Aleksashenko, who accounted the Dubinin's resignation to the
absence of political support for the bank's operations, said that
he will continue the bank policy, as he does not have any
extraordinary plan, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani has asked Turkey to support his Northern
Alliance in fighting against Taliban, Turkey's Daily News reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's alliance controlling a slice of northern Afghanistan
suffered a serious setback last month when the Taliban captured
Mazari Sharif, a stronghold of the alliance in the north.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani was driven out of the capital Kabul in 1996 by the
Taliban, which is controlling more than 85 percent of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview here with the newspaper, Rabbani said
that external forces were provoking the situation in his country.
</P>
<P>
"We are victims of external interference. If this stops, the
crisis (in Afghanistan) will disappear," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting after arriving here Sunday for an unexpected
visit, Rabbani briefed Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on the
recent developments in his war-torn country, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Demirel as saying that the Afghan crisis will
only be solved through broad-based peace talks aimed at national
unity, not by military means.
</P>
<P>
In another meeting, Turkish State Minister Ahat Andican told
Rabbani that regional countries, including Turkey, would put more
pressure on Pakistan to refrain from supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Andican disclosed that Demirel would hold talks with Pakistani
leaders on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Tailor-Made Food May Be Order of Future: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tailor-made foods made to fit
personal dietary plans aimed at allowing consumers to maintain
their health may well be the order of the future, according to an
Australian nutrition expert.
</P>
<P>
Katrine Baghurst, manager of human nutrition's consumer science
of Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO), said future food trends would be influenced
by consumers starved of time rather than food, with increased
demand for food that met a busy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
She predicted the evolution of foods based on individual
dietary plans which take into account a person's genetic
predisposition to a range of dietary-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
"As medical technology allows people to genetically map the
diseases to which they may be prone, they will be able to develop
a personal health profile and dietary plan which best suits their
needs," she told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"In future years, when we have a better idea of our personal
susceptibility to a condition, we may be able to choose from a
line of foods developed by manufacturers which are suitable for
those with certain conditions."
</P>
<P>
Baghurst will talk about what people will choose to eat in the
future at the CSIRO Human Nutrition's 12th annual food conference
in the southern Australian city of Adelaide, which begins
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from around the world will discuss topics including
foods for cancer protection, trends in health and disease and
foods which influence mood and the immune system.

<HEADLINE> Exports from Hebei Development Zones Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Exports from 21 development
zones in north China's Hebei Province maintained a rising momentum in
the first half of this year despite of impact of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has 19 development zones and two state-level high-tech
development zones, which serve as the leading foreign trade
contributors in this coastal province.

Since the provincial government readjusted its foreign trade
policy at the beginning of the year, exports to the European Union
increased by 13 percent and those to the United States rose 29
percent.

<HEADLINE> World-Class Gold Mines to be Found in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australia-based Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. (BHP) has signed a contract with
southwest China's Guizhou Province to jointly seek gold deposits
in the province's Nanpan River Valley over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
The venture expects to discover gold mines with reserves
exceeding 100 tons in the area, according to Sergvei Diatchkov,
manager of the company's prospecting department.
</P>
<P>
A new gold production base, Guizhou has witnessed a rapid
growth of gold output since 1987 when it began goldmining, and
output achieved a year-to-year increase of 35.7 percent during
1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 300 tons of gold deposits have been found in the
province's Buyi-Miao Autonomous Prefecture, where the cooperative
exploration will begin.
</P>
<P>
Under the six-year contract, the firm will invest six million
U.S. dollars in the first phase of prospecting, the biggest
investment China has ever attracted for gold prospecting, said Deng
Shaoqing, a senior official with the provincial geology and mining
company.
</P>
<P>
The Carlin-type gold mines to be explored in the autonomous
prefecture are of the low-grade and metallurgical refactory type,
prospecting for which was opened to foreign companies in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The company has promised to apply the latest exploring theories
and technologies to this undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning-Kunming Railway which runs across the region has
was completed recently, with a 2.52-million-kw hydropower station
under construction nearby. A program-controlled telephone system
has also begun operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
More foreign firms have shown interest in the district's gold
mines as the investment environment continues to improve, said
Deng.

<HEADLINE> China Should Further Open Its Service Sector: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will not become an
economic giant unless it further opens its service sector and
speeds up foreign service trade.
</P>
<P>
This is the consensus reached by a group of experts attending a
symposium on the growth of China's service sector recently in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to these experts, the service sector covers a host of
industries such as traffic, transportation, telecommunications
finance, trade, education, scientific research, tourism, real
estate, service for production and service for daily life.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said China will never make top world achievements if
it does not open its service sector to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China should open up its post and
telecommunications industry step by step. "The storage capacity of
China's basic telecommunications network ranks second in the
world. However, income from this sector is far less than some
foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
Researcher Dr. Zhang Xiaoji agreed with Long, saying that China
should speed up its pace in this regard. At present, he noted,
the total world output value of the posts and telecommunications
industry has exceeded one trillion U.S. dollars, and trade volume
in this sector (including services and equipment) has surpassed
100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, by so doing, can import new products
and advanced services, reduce costs through competition and
attract foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Regarding some worries that the country could lose control of
the industry and safety concerns, Zhang said that China, as a
sovereign state, can standardize the activities of foreign
companies according to laws, and punish those who violate related
laws and damage the interests and threaten the safety of China
in accordance with laws.
</P>
<P>
Some experts also suggested that China can introduce foreign
funds into its retail sector, in a bid to develop its commercial
circulation system in a way more adaptable to international
practice.
</P>
<P>
China has made some achievements in the opening of its service
sector. Its export volume ranked the 16th in the world in 1997
compared with 27th in 1992; total earnings from tourism was 12
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, 27 times that of 1979; and by the
end of 1997, the country had approved 73,658 foreign-funded
programs in the service sector, involving 207.69 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign investment.

XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is confident of achieving
its eight percent economic growth rate goal this year, maintaining
the value of the Renminbi yuan, and keeping the inflation rate
under three percent, State Councillor Wu Yi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is in charge of China's foreign trade and economic
cooperation, made these remarks here today while meeting with a

</P>
<P>
Wu said she hopes the multinational companies learn more about
the China market and its investment environment through the
ongoing trade fair which she believes could be the link between
these companies and their potential Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
Although China is being affected by the financial crisis in
Asia and the recent heavy flooding, she added, his country is still
confident of meeting the economic growth goal set for this year.
</P>
<P>
Wu also exchanged views with the guests on China's foreign
investment policy, the Asian financial crisis and other related
issues.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Yunnan Province to Expand Coffee Growing Acreage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province will add 3,133 hectares annually to its existing
coffee-growing area within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, by the year 2000 the coffee-growing
area in Yunnan province will total 16,666 hectares producing
15,000 tons of dried coffee beans annually.
</P>
<P>
About 420 million yuan (50 million US dollars) of investment
will be needed to realize this plan, and local governments at
various levels in the province will also investment in water
improving control facilities in coffee-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
Many areas of Yunnan are tropical and subtropical, providing
suitable natural conditions for growing small coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
The province, first in China in the production and processing
of coffee beans, now sows 7,333 hectares of coffee and produces
3,500 tons of dried coffee beans annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the International Coffee Organization say that
small coffee beans grown in Yunnan are nearly the equal of the
well-known Columbia coffee beans in quality.
</P>
<P>
The coffee giants Maxwell and Nestle companies have both signed
contracts with Yunnan to provide them with 10,000 tons of beans by
the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
China now consumes approximately 10,000 tons of coffee beans a
year, 70 percent of which are imported. This number is expected
to rise to 20,000 tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
While working out a plan for developing its coffee industry,
the Yunnan Provincial Government has decided to set up a center
for coffee research and related processing technology.
Preparations have been made to open a coffee bean-trading market,
said local sources.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sees Evil Behind Turkish-Israeli Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz has accused Turkey and Israel of plotting against
their Arab neighbors, citing their increasing military and
economic cooperation, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're very worried about what's happening despite Turkey's
repeated claims that its relations with Israel do not go further
than training and technical cooperation," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
"We see the alliance like a pair of pliers closing in on Arab
states that refuse to make peace with Israel, particularly Lebanon
and Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "No one can be convinced that this cooperation is
merely for training."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz's comments coincided with a visit by Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz to Israel and Jordan. At a news conference,
Yilmaz and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu described as
"baseless" Lebanese and Syrian fears.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but politically secular country,
has signed two military cooperation agreements with Israel since
1996. It allows Israeli jets to use its airspace for training
while Israel agrees to upgrade Turkey's F-4 fighters under a
contract worth 630 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growing Israeli relations with Turkey as well as Jordan
have sparked harsh criticism and fears from most Arab countries,
especially Syria and Lebanon, whose Golan Heights and south
Lebanon respectively are still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
They feared that the three countries will form a military
alliance and threaten the security and interests of other Arab
countries in the region.

the sit-in, which began on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The decision to arrest Sam Rainsy has put off temporarily after
Mehrotra, the UN Secretary General's representative in Cambodia
consulted with Hun Sen and the Co-Minister of Interior Sar Kheng.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen issued the arrest warrant for Sam Rainsy Monday after
Hun Sen's Phnom Penh house was attacked by three grenades.
</P>
<P>
The government accused Sam Rainsy and other opposition leaders
of assassinating Hun Sen in order to bring down the legitimate
government and to create a political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement broadcast on state-owned TV of Cambodia also
accused opposition leaders, especially Sam Rainsy of turning
democracy into a movement instigating violence, anarchy and
splitting the nation.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and several others wounded Monday evening
as police opened fire to disperse demonstrators who gathered
outside the Cambodiana Hotel to chant support for Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday Hun Sen said the protest outside the National
Assembly must end by midnight. But most of the protesters
ignored the order to leave.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition political parties of Funcinpec and the
Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) rejected the election result which Hun
Sen's Cambodia People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
They organized a month-long demonstration and two-week sit-in
in front of the National Assembly boycotting the new government
and demanding Second Prime Minister Hun Sen step down.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Urban Population Exceeds 10 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's urban population
now exceeds 10 million with the expansion of its urban area.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that permanent Shanghai residents
including the city's suburbs has reached 13.05 million, with 10.67
of these urban residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the city's urban population was less than 8 million.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the city's urban population is attributed to three
urban area expansion projects over recent years. In 1993, the
Pudong New Area was added to the city and the Jiading and Minhang
districts were included in Shanghai's urban districts; in 1997,
the city turned Jinshan county into its Jinshan district, and this
year, the city's Songjiang county was made a district.
</P>
<P>
These three projects added 2.58 million to the city's total
urban population.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, population in the city's downtown area has
decreased rapidly because of the transformation of urban
life. Huangpu District, for example, has seen its population drop
to 56,000 per square kilometer from more than 70,000 in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Income Inequality Between Poor, Rich Widens in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A study released Monday
shows that income inequality between the poor and rich in the
United States has widened since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Economic Policy Institute, said the
very lowest-wage workers saw their earnings had risen only by 1.4
percent between 1989-1997, while the executives' pay had more than
doubled during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Working families in the 1990s have faced increased working
hours, stagnant or falling incomes, and less secure jobs offering
fewer benefits, which have all contributed to inequality in wages
and family income compared to the richest families, said Jared
Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
The typical married-couple working family in U.S. worked 247
more hours -- an additional six weeks annually -- in 1996 than in
1989 in order to boost their incomes, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the richest 10 percent of households in the United
States have reaped 85.8 percent of growth in the stock market
since 1989, the study said, pointing out the average pay for the
executives jumped 116 times that of workers.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests the record profitability of U.S. companies
in the 1990s has come partly at the expense of their workers.
</P>
<P>
"Had profitability grown at historically normal levels, hourly
compensation could have been seven percent higher in 1997 than it
actually was," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Re Profit Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) --Kenya Reinsurance Corporation
(KRC), whose privatization started last week, has released its
annual report and accounts for 1997 showing a slight decrease in
profit before taxation.
</P>
<P>
KRC Chairman Andrew Omanga was quoted by Tuesday's national
newspaper as saying that the general economic depression Kenya
experienced last year brought down the firm's pre-tax profit to
170.7 million Shillings (2.87 million U.S. Dollars) from 172.9
million Shillings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
While the world economy continued to expand, he said, Kenya's
performance was dismal at a 2.3 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the company's operating profit before working capital
charges was 689.2 million Shillings, up from 554.6 million
Shillings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Omanga said the corporation's core business continued to be
reinsurance which recorded an underwriting loss of 253.3 million
Shillings compared with 282.9 million Shillings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the corporation's income from investment
amounted to 424 million Shillings, down from 455.9 million
Shillings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that the marginal decline in investment
income was mainly due to a decrease in short term investable
funds following substantial disbursements toward long term
assets.
</P>
<P>
The firm's privatization process started Monday last week the
search for strategic investors to take up part of the
shareholding before the rest of the shares are floated through
the Nairobi Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Omanga said that during the year, the corporation concentrated
on developing strategic relationship with key local business
partners while significant attention was also given to the
African region.
</P>
<P>
On future prospects, the chairman said that the corporation
plans to embrace the opportunities offered by the new information
technology which would enable it to exploit the market
opportunities for the benefit of the shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Legislative Inspections to Promote Integration of Science, Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- To promote the integration of
scientific research and economic growth and stimulate enterprises
to invest more in technological innovation, China's top
legislature will start inspection tours tomorrow to see how a
science law is being enforced in the country.
</P>
<P>
The legislature has spent two days examining reports by eight
ministerial-level government bodies on how they have been
implementing the 1996 law on promoting the conversion of
scientific and technological results. These government bodies
include the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice-chairperson of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, said at the meeting that "it must be
clearly realized that, in general, problems in integrating
scientific research and economic growth have yet to be solved;
only a small proportion of research findings are commercialized or
put into industrial production; and manufacturers and other
enterprises are lax in technological explorations."
</P>
<P>
"China's conversion rate of technologies into productivity and
the contribution of scientific research are rather low as compared
with developed countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
The top legislature expects that this law enforcement
inspection will prompt local governments to increase their efforts
to provide favorable policy guidelines and invest more in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The inspection tours will be headed by Peng and Zhou Guangzhao,
vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, and cover Beijing,
Shaanxi Province and Shanghai. All other provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions will be inspected by their local
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology said that lack of
funds has stalled the conversion of scientific results into
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, statistics show that the annual input for research
and technological exploration in China in the past four years
accounts for only 0.5 percent of the value of Gross Domestic
Production (GDP), while the rates in developed countries range
from two to three percent.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to invest 1.5 percent of the
GDP value in scientific research by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This goal will hardly be reached unless prompt, drastic
measures are taken right now," the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Port City To Upgrade Highways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao, a major port city in
east China's Shandong Province, plans to invest 10 billion yuan in
highways over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
By year 2002, the city will have set up a modern highway
network, eight years ahead of the national schedule, with several
expressways linking all the surrounding cities and the national
highway network, a city communications department official said.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes the Qingdao section of a national expressway
along the east coast of China and an expressway running from Qingdao
to Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China. Construction of the two expressways will begin
this year.
</P>
<P>
The city will also build highways to all of its villages.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Port, the country's largest crude oil depot and the
second largest container shipping port, now has an annual handling
capacity of 84.3 million tons of cargo. Local experts believe
that construction of the new highways will help the port play a
bigger role in promoting the local economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China claimed today that it
has developed a prototype digital high definition television
(HDTV) system to become the fourth country in the world to possess
a self-developed HDTV ground broadcasting system.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, head of the state major high-tech engineering
program said the digital HDTV system today began a five-day ground
broadcasting and receiving demonstration via the Central
Television Tower in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference today, Song, also president of
Chinese Academy of Engineering, said China will begin trial
broadcasting of HDTV programs in around two years, and establish a
number of HDTV ventures.
</P>
<P>
The official said research has paved the way for China
to upgrade its television industry.
</P>
<P>
The research program, absorbing 15 million yuan (1.8 million
U.S dollars) of investment, was completed by more than 200
scientists from nine universities and research institutions after
two years of work.
</P>
<P>
The research units include Shanghai Jiaotong University,
Tianjin University and the Academy of Electronics Science. Most of
the research group leaders are scientists under 35 years old.
</P>
<P>
China is a big television producing country and Chinese
households have 300 million television sets. About 43 percent of
the output value of the country's electronics and information
industries comes from production of television sets, their related
electronics components and recording devices.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tractors, known as iron oxen in
China's countryside, can now be found rushing from one end to the
other over farmland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, leaving yaks,
which used to play a vital role in gathering local crops, idle at
home.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from Tibet show there are now nine
trucks, six tractors and three shellers for every 100 families;
and more seeders and winnowers are also appearing on the
snow-covered land.
</P>
<P>
Fixed production assets held by each household are now valued
at 8,000 yuan, a huge rise from five years ago, according to these
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, agricultural machinery is one of the most popular
items on the Tibetan market.
</P>
<P>
"The sales volume for my company is expected to reach 10
million yuan (1.2 million US dollars)," a young manager said
contentedly. He used to be a farmer, but three years ago he opened
a company in Shigatse selling agricultural machinery.
</P>
<P>
Tibet replaced the traditional wooden plough with iron ploughs
in the 1960s. Ten years later, farmers there greeted the first
tractor to enter Lhasa with a grand ceremony, as if it were a
distinguished bride.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tourists will be able to
realize their dream of a trip to Shangri-La when the Diqing
Airport in southwest China's Yunnan Province opens in next June.
</P>
<P>
Shangri-la, as described in British writer James Hilton's
classic 1930s novel "Lost Horizon," was a peaceful, quiet, and
beautiful land in which human beings lived in harmony with nature.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a team of Chinese experts reached the conclusion that
Shangri-la was actually located in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture in Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties of travel, over 300,000 tourists were
attracted to this mysterious and beautiful mecca in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ping, director of the Tourism Bureau of Yunnan said that
at the cost of 250 million yuan construction of the Diqing
Airport began in this past January. Upon completion next June,
an air route to this Shangri-la will be opened.
</P>
<P>
Diqing is located at the juncture of Yunnan and Sichuan
provinces, and the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is known for
its pyramid-like snow-covered mountain ridges and peaks, steep
valleys, luxuriant grasslands and majestic temples.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Public Finances Hit Troubled Waters: Acting PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is having serious
problems with its public finance in the wake of domestic political
turmoil and the financial crisis in east Asia and Russia, acting
Prime Minister Tsakhiya Elbegdorj said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with People's Rights daily, he said initial
estimates put this year's revenue 10 billion togrog (117.6 million
U.S. dollars) lower than the budget figure, forcing the state to
postpone investments of six billion togrog (70.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Elbegdorj, whose three-month old coalition government was
dismissed on July 24 after losing a vote of confidence in the
parliament, said grave socio-economic troubles were piling up in
the long-time vacancy of the supreme executive power.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, the president and the parliament are
locked in disagreement on the nomination of a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ongoing financial crisis in east Asia and the
worsening economic crisis in Russia are having a direct impact on
Mongolia's social and economic life, said the acting prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund have suspended planned aid totalling 45 million dollars to
Mongolia, which was already included in its budget.
</P>
<P>
The suspension followed the split of the state-owned Renovation
Bank and the private Golomt Bank which had merged in May.
</P>
<P>
To ease the emerging financial crisis, the parliament has
lately approved the issue of 20-billion-togrog (235.3 million
dollars) worth of state bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has recorded a significant reduction in the volume of
its foreign trade in the first six months of this year, with a
deficit of 89.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rapid shrinking of the country's foreign exchange reserve,
from 120 million dollars in January to 75.7 million dollars in
June, has led the Mongolian currency on a steady slide against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's budget deficit in the first half of this year
amounted to 27.2 billion togrog (320 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls Outside Trade More Important for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The share of extraregional
trade will increase significantly in Asia over the next few year,
Adrianus Mooy, secretary of the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said at a seminar here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, titled "Emerging Trade and Investment Scenarios
and Liberalization Agenda for Asia and the Pacific" and opened
Monday, aims to address the effects of the Asian crisis on trade
and investment flows, options available for policy makers within
and outside the region and the likely short-, medium- and
long-term trade and investment scenarios.
</P>
<P>
Mooy said one of the major impacts of the Asian Crisis is
likely to be on intraregional trade, whose growth during the past
decade had been an important component of the Asian success story.
</P>
<P>
However, the region can no longer count on itself as a robust
market for exports. That's why extraregional trade will become
more important for Asia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mooy also said most of the studies and meetings on the Asian
crisis so far have focused on the origins of the crisis and means
to solve it.
</P>
<P>
"What has been largely ignored in current economic analysis,
bailout packages and policy initiatives relates to microeconomic
aspects of the crisis, such as trade and investment policies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This was a glaring omission as the Asian economic model has
been predicated on strong trade growth and inward-flows of foreign
direct investment for most countries, he said.

was leading 14th seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 6-3, 3-2, and
number 12 Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden held a 6-4, 1-4 lead over Jan
Siemerink of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Among the women, second seed Lindsay Davenport of the United
States, in searching of her Grand Slam singles title and the No.
1 ranking, stormed past 10th seed Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-1,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain earned her first
victory in four meetings with Russian teenager Anna
Kournikova,upending the 15th seed 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Also, fifth seed Venus Williams of the United States fought

Amanda Coetzer of South Africa outlasted seventh seed Conchita
Martinez of Spain 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 in a two hour, 38-minute marathon.
</P>
<P>
Davenport will face Coetzer in the quarterfinals, and
Williams, who lost to Hingis in last year's final, will play
Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Kucera seemed ready to close out Agassi after going up a break
in the second game of the third set, but Agassi broke back in the
seventh game on a crosscourt backhand winner. After some spirited
gamesmanship between the two and a bizarre lobbing strategy
employed by Agassi in the ninth game, both players held serve to
force the tiebreaker.

won the next five points. However, Agassi managed to win the next
three points to take the set.
</P>
<P>
Davenport needed just over an hour to reach her second
straight U.S. Open quarterfinals. She broke Tauziat five times
and won 68 points to Tauziat's 50 as she avenged a quarterfinal
loss at Wimbledon. Tauziat had 25 unforced errors and was
successful on only 48 percent of her first serves.
</P>
<P>
Williams dominated the opening set but Pierce made a match of
it after the rain delay. At 5-5 in the second set, Williams and
Pierce battled through nine deuce points before Williams broke
serve and served for the set.
</P>
<P>
Pierce broke back, sending the set to the tiebreak, and
appeared ready to take it when she built a 4-1 lead. But Williams
reeled off six consecutive points to take the tiebreak and the
match.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Steps Up Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is implementing a
national plan of action for education for all with added momentum
and experience gained from the last literacy campaign between
1964 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
The plan, laid down by the World Education Conference on
Education for All held in Thailand in 1990, covers both formal and
non-formal education.
</P>
<P>
Formal education is designed to enable school-age children from
five to nine to go to school and primary school children to
complete primary education.
</P>
<P>
Non-formal education is aimed at enabling illiterates over
school age (over 15) to become literate by means of the
"functional literacy program."
</P>
<P>
The two education programs aim to ensure that 80 percent of the
population complete primary education and to reduce the adult
illiteracy rate from 22 percent to 11 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
A total of 180,035 persons are attending classes in 104
townships under the non-formal education program in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's literacy campaign started in 1964. In 20 years, the
illiteracy rate of the country was reduced by half to only 21
percent in 1983 from 43 percent in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Between 1964 and 1988, 490,398 volunteers took part in literacy
activities with more than 2.4 million illiterates becoming
literate.
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate of women has gone up to 71.3 percent in the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been awarded two international prizes for its
successful literacy activities by the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
They are the Mahammad Reza Pahlavi Literacy Prize in 1971 and
the Noma Prize in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Impose Limit on Presidential Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The five factions of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Indonesia's highest
legislative body, have agreed to impose a limit on the
presidential term, the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Team of Assistants to the body's working committee said
here Monday that the factions agreed that the special MPR session
planned for November should impose a limitation on the
presidential term and abolish the president's extraordinary power
granted by the last session in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The presidential term limitation proposal was made amid growing
public calls for the MPR to act in this field as the 1945
constitution has been criticized for being "too vague" in
regulating the issue.
</P>
<P>
The constitution's Article VII only states that the country's
president could be "elected again" after his or her first term,
without citing how many times.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary power that the team referred to was granted
by the controversial MPR Decree No. V/1998 that gives the
president the right to take preemptive security measures "to
safeguard the development and the state ideology Pancasila."
</P>
<P>
Pancasila is the five basic principles of the Republic of
Indonesia, including the belief in the one and only God Almighty,
humanity that is just and civilized, the unity of Indonesia,
democracy guided by the wisdom of representative deliberation and
social justice for all Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
Tosari Wijaya, a member of the Team of Assistants, said the
proposal agreed by the team would be debated again during the
upcoming meeting of the working committee, which is preparing the
agenda for the upcoming November 10-14 MPR special session.

<HEADLINE> Australia Set to Reap Near Record Wheat Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian farmers are set to
reap a near record wheat crop this financial year, thanks to good
growing conditions, Australia's chief official commodity
forecaster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a significant revision, the latest crop report of the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates
that the wheat crop for the 1998-1999 financial year will hit 23.5
million tons, 4.2 million tons higher than its previous forecast.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 26 percent over last year
and is close to the 1996-1997 record of 23.7 million tons, the
bureau's Executive Director Brian Fisher said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Excellent growing conditions in most regions are expected to
lead to above-average yields for this financial year, which ends
on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Fisher noted that spring weather would play a big role in
determining the final yields and grain quality as extra rain
expected in eastern states following the El Nino effect's
departure raises the risk of further crop damage from waterlogging
and plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
The bureau expects the area planted with wheat to rise to about
11.8 million hectares in the current financial year from 11.1
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"This increase in area is driven largely by a reduction in
sheep numbers, reflecting the pessimistic outlook for wool prices
and the expected favorable returns for wheat relative to other
crops," it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite flood damage to some crops in New South Wales State and
southern Queensland State, two major grain producers in the
nation, Australia is on track to achieve the second highest winter
crop production on record of about 35 million tons, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Supreme Court Drops Case Against Three MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Thailand
has dismissed a lawsuit against three members of parliament about
election fraud, thus defusing a crisis threatening the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that the government under Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai retains its 23-MP slim majority in the 389-seat House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Handing down its verdict late Monday, the court said however
that there had been fraud in Samut Prakan's Constituency 1 on
November 17, 1996, involving current Deputy Interior Minister
Vatana Assavahame and two other Prachakorn Thai Party MPs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has alleged that the three MPs were engaged in
"fraudulent deals" at several polling stations and asked the court
to declare the vote invalid and order a new election.
</P>
<P>
But the court said the constitution, enforced since October 11
last year, states that the three accused MPs' status would be
terminated only at the end of the lower house's four-year term.
</P>
<P>
The constitution also bans new elections to vacant seats in the
lower house. "Even though irregularities may have been involved, a
new election cannot be called," the court said.
</P>
<P>
The Election Act also states that if a new election cannot be
held, a suit challenging election results has to be dropped.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the case, the Supreme Court said that since a new
election can not be held, there is no need to consider the alleged
fraudulent deals in the elections.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Review Rice, Debt Issues With Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) will focus this month's review of Indonesia's reform
program on lowering the price of rice and settling domestic debt
of local corporations.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Indonesian senior economic ministers
here Monday, IMF Asia Pacific director Hubert Neiss said the
current price of rice is too high and actions have to be taken to
correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The rice subsidies will stay as long as necessary because rice
is the people's basic need," he was quoted as saying by newspapers
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the government must limit the subsidies to
the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has allocated more than 15 trillion
rupiah (about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the current fiscal
year, which will end in March 1999, to finance the subsidy for the
staple.
</P>
<P>
Over the past couple of weeks, rice prices have sharply
increased to about 5,000 rupiah (45 U.S. cents) per kilogram,
compared with the Indonesian government's target price of 2,000
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused hoarders and smugglers of causing
the sharp increase in the price.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students staged a major demonstration on Monday at
the House of Representatives (DPR) building, protesting the high
price of rice and demanding that President B. J. Habibie step
down.
</P>
<P>
Neiss arrived here on Sunday for the monthly review of the
IMF-sponsored economic reform program, a precondition for the
disbursement of the agency's 43 billion dollar bailout money, next
scheduled to be delivered on September 25 in a tranche of about 1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the IMF and the Indonesian government were working
on a new letter of intent, expected to be completed by Friday,
which would outline the government's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The other main element of the document would be the
restructuring of local corporations' domestic debts for the
resumption of commercial bank loans to restart production.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the progress (of the reform program)," Neiss
added.

<HEADLINE> Malta's Nationalist Leader Back to Prime Minister's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Eddie Fenech Adami, leader of
Malta's Nationalist Party, was sworn in as prime minister Sunday
night, only 22 months since he stepped down.
</P>
<P>
The Nationalist Party defeated the Labor Party led by the
previous prime minister, Alfred Sant, in the election held
Saturday by winning 51.7 percent of the votes and obtaining 35 of
the 69 seats in the parliament, said reports from Valletta,
capital of Malta.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the 278,000 eligible voters turned out for
the election.
</P>
<P>
Adami would soon announce the list of cabinet members, said
officials of the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Adami's government will make a
priority of reviving Malta's bid for the European Union
membership, stalled by Sant, who held that Malta was not ready for
the sacrifices needed for EU eligibility.
</P>
<P>
Adami will also set about reducing the high utility rates,
which caused many complaints. The rates were imposed by Sant's
government to cut the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Adami, 64, had been Malta's prime minister for nine years until
his party was defeated by Sant's Labor Party in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Internal divisions within the Labor Party forced Sant to risk
moving the election three years forward, in the hope that the
unfavorable situation in his party could be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Sant tendered his resignation to Malta's president after the
results of the election came out.

<HEADLINE> Samsung's New Picture-Tube Joint Venture in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin-Samsung Display
Device Co. Ltd., a new joint venture between Tianjin Electronic
Meters Corporation and Samsung Display Device Corporation, began
formal production recently.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is capable of producing large-screen and
high-definition color picture tubes. By the end of this year,
it is expected to be able to produce 300,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The jointly invested company is located in the Wuqing
Development Zone in suburban Tianjin, and has an area of 220,000
square meters.
</P>
<P>
Some 383 million U.S. dollars were spent for first-phase
building of the joint venture, most of which was used to finance
construction of two production lines -- one for producing color
picture tubes for TV sets and the other for computers. The TV
color picture-tube production line became operational recently.
</P>
<P>
The computer color picture-tube production line, with a
designed annual production capacity of 1.8 million units, has
just finished equipment installation and will begin production
early next year.
</P>
<P>
When both production lines become operational next year, the
company will be able to generate four billion yuan (481 million
U.S. dollars) in output value, said a company executive.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is a major north China city for investment from the
Republic of Korea (ROK). So far, more than 700 projects, with
investments exceeding one-billion U.S. dollars, have been started
by investors from the ROK. The Samsung Group, for example, has
six joint ventures or solely invested businesses in
Tianjin.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The output of summer grain
reached a record high this year in south China's Guangdong
Province with a harvest of over 9 million tons, an increase of
52,800 tons over 1997.
</P>
<P>
A provincial agricultural department official said the province
has achieved increasing output for five consecutive years. He told
that the output per mu (15 mu equals one hectare) reached 4.03
kilograms, one kilogram higher than the record 1997, and the sown
area of summer grain was about 1.5 million hectares, up 2,900
hectares.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this harvest to increased agriculture investment
which has ensured production despite some areas being hit by
floods.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Wants Preview of Starr Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's lawyers asked Monday that they be given an advance copy
of any report to Congress from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
on the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky so they could craft
a written reply to accompany the document.
</P>
<P>
David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, made the
request in a letter to Starr, to ensure "elemental fairness" to
the president, Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
A final report by Starr on his investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky, the former White House intern, and
possible obstruction of justice, perjury and abuse of power could
go to Congress as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
"Elemental fairness dictates that we be allowed to respond to
any `report' you send to the House simultaneously with its
transmission," Kendall wrote.
</P>
<P>
Kendall asked that the president's legal team as well as White
House lawyers be allowed to review a draft of Starr's report and
be given a week "to submit a written reply" that would be
submitted to the special appeals court panel overseeing the
special prosecutor, and then to Congress for possible impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Kendall expressed concern that Starr's report might go beyond a
detail of facts gathered in the seven months of grand jury
investigation into the Lewinsky matter, and include "factual legal
analysis and conclusions" that would be unfair to the president
and contrary to the intent of Congress when it established the
office of independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Kendall argued that Congress in requiring the independent
counsel to report to the House "was also sharply aware of the
potential abuse that the subjects of these reports might suffer...
(that) the power to damage reputations in the final report is
significant".
</P>
<P>
"We believe that fundamental fairness dictates that we have the
opportunity to review such a document and submit simultaneously
any reply we wish to make," Kendall wrote.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter was provided to Associated Press by
Kendall's office.
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan administration, the targets of the
Iran-Contra special prosecutor were allowed to review the
prosecutors' final report before it was released. Their dissenting
views were incorporated into the report released publicly.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Objects to NLD Convening of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government
reiterated its objection to the convening of a national parliament
by the country's National League for Democracy (NLD), according to
an official Information Sheet released here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The NLD is reportedly to sponsor this month the parliament
elected in the 1990 multi-party general election, after its
ultimatum to the government for the move received no response.
</P>
<P>
The government warned that "if such an action is to be
implemented by an individual political party, it can lead to
institutional confusion and adversely affect national security."
</P>
<P>
The government had also warned earlier that "it would amount to
the NLD making herself a parallel government which no government
in the world would accept." It also threatened to take action when
it is left with no choice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD charged in a statement Monday afternoon that
the Myanmar government has been arresting NLD members since last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Up to Monday, a total of 110 NLD members including 50
parliament representatives-elect and 60 state, division and
township party organizers had been detained, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The NLD has repeatedly demanded the convening of the parliament
elected in the 1990 election in accordance with the then Election
Law and on June 23 set a deadline for the ruling State Peace and
Development Council to hold the parliament within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
After it received no response from the government on the expiry
of the deadline on August 21, the NLD declared its intention to
convene the parliament by itself in September.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 election, participated by 93 political parties, the
NLD won 396 out of the 485 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The government began holding a National Convention in January
1993 for drafting a new state constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, all the delegates of the NLD's representatives-elect
withdrew from the convention in November 1995, four months after
Aung San Suu Kyi, the party's general secretary, was released from
nearly six years' house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The National Convention has been in recess for two and a half
years since the last session ended in March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Romania Seeks to Avoid Impact of Russian Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST,September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Russian economic crisis
has hit the Romanian government's ability to carry out this year's
economic plan, said Jan Diaconescu, chairman of the Romanian
parliament's Chamber of Deputies, Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the local Mediafax News Agency, Diaconescu said
that although the economic relationship between Russia and Romania
was weaker than it used to be, Russia's financial turmoil would
cause problems in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors had already withdrawn their capital,
causing turbulence in the stock market and foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies which had intended to participate in the
privatization of big and medium-sized state-owned enterprises also
withdrew, setting back the reform process of those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The normal income channel of the state budget was also affected.
</P>
<P>
To ease the hardship and keep the budget deficit within
allowable limits, the government adopted a series of measures to
increase taxation and cut public spending.
</P>
<P>
Russia ranks as Romania's third largest trading partner. Last
year, bilateral trade amounted to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, of
which Romanian exports accounted for only 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the Russian crisis may not directly affect Romanian
exports, while some economists say it may intensify the fierce
competition with members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
</P>
<P>
Russia is the main importer of goods from CIS countries, but
the withering of the Russian economy has compelled them to seek
new markets.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescue said the Russian crisis
was compounding the difficulties of an already depressed Romanian
economy.

<HEADLINE> Champagne from Sunken Ship Up for Auction in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 7 (Xinhua)-- Twenty-four bottles of
champagne salvaged from the sunken ship Jonkoping will be
auctioned at the British auction house Christies in October,
according to Swedish News Agency TT.
</P>
<P>
Claes Bergvall, leader of a Swedish-Danish diving team that
recovered the treasure, said interest in the champagne has been
overwhelming and he expects the auction price to reach around
3,000 U.S. dollars a bottle.
</P>
<P>
The 2,400 bottles of champagne were recovered from the
Jonkoping that was sunk by a German submarine in 1916 on its way
from Gavle, Sweden to Rauma in Finland.
</P>
<P>
Bergvall said many internationally prominent figures have shown
great interest in the champagne.
</P>
<P>
Bergvall and his colleague Lindberg found the ship last year
off Finland's west coast.
</P>
<P>
The champagne had lain untouched for more than 80 years until
several bottles were recovered by the expedition a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The champagne is the same marque as that stocked aboard the
Titanic when it sank in 1912.

<HEADLINE> Another "Leap Second" Added to This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Timekeepers at the U.S.
Naval Observatory have determined that a "leap second" must be
added at the end of this year to synchronize the nation's official
timepiece, the observatory's Master Clock, with actual time as
measured by the Earth's rotation.
</P>
<P>
The Master Clock is a consensus chronometer based on time
readings from more than 60 independently operating atomic clocks
kept in a dozen sealed vaults.
</P>
<P>
It is accurate to within a billionth of a second per day, which
is problematic since the earth's rotation is not nearly as regular
as that. In fact, the Earth has been "spinning down" of late,
turning a little slower each year. If a second or two were not
added occasionally to the world's atomic clocks, these timekeepers
would eventually be saying it was noon as the sun came up over the
eastern horizon, the Washington Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However the scientists said the adjustment had more immediate
significance. Many electronic navigation and communication
systems, including the global positioning system, depend on
extremely precise measurements of time intervals. A lag of even a
few billionths of a second can lead to significant inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
The leap second will be added to the world's atomic clocks
on December 31 at 6:59:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Reports First Cases of Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Two cases of the mad cow disease
have been recently confirmed in Ecuador, the first time in this
South American country, putting the authorities on alert to
the deadly virus, press reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eight beef cattle had reportedly died of unknown diseases in
the southern province of Zamora-Chinchipe and the Animal Health
Services in Quito confirmed two of them had died of the mad cow
disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
The causes of the other six deaths could not be determined but
experts said they represented symptoms similar to the BSE.
</P>
<P>
The disease might be transmitted by blood-eating bats which
live in large numbers in the Amazon region, according to the
experts.
</P>
<P>
The reports said health authorities have started to vaccinate
cows, horses and pigs in areas threatened by the BSE and will seek
to reduce the number of the bats around Zamora river by taking
urgent measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Ministry has also sent experts to small and
remote towns to help local farmers and herdsmen protect their
cattle against the mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> Study: Most American Workers Welcome Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A new study released
Monday shows that a great majority of American workers appreciate
employer-sponsored training and education.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by The Gallup Organization and commissioned by
three U.S. companies, said that, among 1012 employees interviewed, 80
percent said the availability of company-sponsored training programs
was a factor in deciding whether to accept a new job or stick with a
current one.
</P>
<P>
American workers, especially the yong workers called Generation
Xers, also view training as a way to improve their chances of getting
promoted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show 58 percent of workers 32 years old or younger said
training was useful in preparing them for higher-level jobs.
Forty-two percent of workers older than that had the same opinion.
</P>
<P>
The United States spends something like 60 to 70 billion U.S.
dollars a year in workplace education and training, according to the
study which, however, adding that U.S. companies lag behind their
Japanese and European counterparts in terms of training dollars spent
per worker.
</P>
<P>
"Employees want more training than they are getting," said
Christine Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the three companies that
commissioned the Gallup survey.
</P>
<P>
Rich Wellins, senior vice president of Development Dimensions
International, one of the three companies, said that investing in
worker education can boost employee loyalty as well as corporate
profits.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Booming Development of Marine Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts
to exploit its huge marine resources in the future, which includes
exploring offshore oil and gas, developing seaside tourism and
ocean-related pharmaceuticals, and desalination sea water.
</P>
<P>
Such moves are needed to sustain the rapid economic growth of
the country, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Major oil producers in China are striving to increase their oil
and natural gas output. The Bohai Oil Company, for example, plans
to increase its annual offshore oil output to six million tons by
2000 from the present 2.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China's offshore oil production reached 16 million tons last
year and natural gas reached four billion cubic meters. More than
six billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment and technology has
been used in China's offshore energy exploitation in the past 16
years, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
China is also advancing its oil exploration to deep-sea areas
because the government has realized that the majority of its oil
reserve is there.
</P>
<P>
In tourism, statistics show that seaside resort cities and
offshore islands in China are playing host to 10 million tourists
from inland provinces every summer. Since the early 1990s, the
income of the country's coastal tourist industry has been growing
30 percent every year. This is why many seaside cities are
competing to erect fancy hotels and sporting new golf courses.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the sea is abundant with resources for
producing medicine to treat tumors, heart disease and many other
ailments. No exact estimate of potential profits is available on
this new industry, but some 40 major investors have invested
billions of yuan in this market and created one billion yuan of
earnings last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has listed desalination of sea water and
its direct use as priority projects because around 300 cities do
not have enough fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Sea-water processing bases in China are converting four million
tons of sea water to drinking water each year, and six billion
cubic meters of sea water are used in industrial production such
as cooling.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government also plans to import the latest
desalination systems to form the framework of a new industry
together with homemade machines developed during the past two
decades.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Ex-President to Run for OAS Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Costa Rican President
Rafael Angel Calderon has begun consultations with some of the
Latin American countries on his possibility of becoming the
secretary general of the Organization of the American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
Calderon will compete with incumbent OAS Secretary-General
Cesar Gaviria, who has expressed his desire to take a second term
of the position. The elections will be held in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
As Gaviria has been in the position for five years, the
opportunity should be given to a Central American country, the
newspaper "La Nacion" quoted Calderon as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gaviria, former Colombian president, defeated former Costa
Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus in 1994 to become the OAS
chief.
</P>
<P>
The OAS, founded in 1948, aims to foster peace, security,
mutual understanding and cooperation among the nations of the
Western Hemisphere. The organization is made up of 35 countries
from the American continent.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Yunnan to Expand Coffee Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province will add 3,133 hectares annually to its existing
coffee-growing area within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, by year 2000 the coffee-growing
area in the province will total 1,666 hectares producing 15,000
tons of dried coffee beans annually.
</P>
<P>
About 420 million yuan of investment will be needed to realize
this plan, and local governments at various levels in the province
will also investment in water control facilities in coffee-growing
regions.
</P>
<P>
Many areas of Yunnan are tropical and subtropical, providing
suitable natural conditions for growing small coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
The province, first in China in the production and processing
of coffee beans, now sows 7,333 hectares of coffee and produces
3,500 tons of dried coffee beans annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the International Coffee Organization say that
small coffee beans grown in Yunnan are nearly the equal of the
well-known Columbia coffee beans in quality.
</P>
<P>
The coffee giants Maxwell and Nestle companies have both signed
contracts with Yunnan to provide them with 10,000 tons of beans by
the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
China now consumes about 10,000 tons of coffee beans a year, 70
percent of which are imported. This figure is expected to rise to
20,000 tons by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
While working out a plan for developing its coffee industry,
the Yunnan Provincial Government has decided to set up a center
for coffee research and related processing
technology. Preparations have been made to construct a coffee
bean-trading market, said local sources.

STOCKHOLM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Trade Council
has downgraded its forecast for the growth of exports this year
from six to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for next year's exports has been revised lower to

</P>
<P>
"The market outlook is worse in several parts of the world,"
said the trade council's chief economist Mauro Gozzo.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis has lingered ... and we clearly see further
turmoil in Japan, South Korea, and the countries where the crisis
began, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia," Gozzo said.
</P>
<P>
"We also see a worse outlook in our neighbor Norway which would
weigh heavily on Swedish exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The previous official forecast of 3.1 percent growth in the
Swedish economy for 1999 was "too optimistic", Gozzo said.

items in leading Australian newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The government's failure to pull ahead of Labor Monday
forced Prime Minister John Howard to launch a more frenzied attack
on the Labor Party's tax package. The Australian's Newspoll shows
the Coalition and Labor drawing support away from One Nation
Party, but still neck and neck with 41.5 percent each of the
primary vote.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The return of Defense Land on Sydney Harbor for public open
space, announced by Prime Minister John Howard at the weekend,
will be largely funded by commercial redevelopment of parts of the
sites and may take up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, Monday signaled he
would play a major role in the federal election campaign,
predicting the demise of One Nation Party as a political force and
saying the outcome of the election was more important to him than
anything he had done as Victorian premier.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Business tax reforms proposed by the Coalition and Labor are
causing concern among some industry groups, with claim they would
reduce the incentive for companies to invest in research and
development and infrastructure.

On a national scale, the number of dengue fever cases is still

<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras gave
talented Russian teenager Marat Safin a straight-set clinic today
and moved into a possible quarterfinal showdown with fellow
American Andre Agassi at the U.S. Open tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Safin has been labeled a can't-miss star of
the future but he was no match for the top player of the present
today as Sampras cruised to a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
Sampras registered 18 aces, including three in a row to end
the match, and faced only two break points in the 77-minute match
that was delayed by rain for more than two hours early in the
second set.

Karol Kucera of Slovakia. Agassi has beaten Sampras in two of
three meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
Sampras closed out the match in spectacular fashion. After
falling behind 30-40, he unleashed three consecutive aces as
Safin simply shook his head in awe.
</P>
<P>
A winner of five Wimbledon and two Australian Open
titles,Sampras is seeking his fifth U.S. Open championship to tie
former Australian star Roy Emerson's record for Career Grand Slam
titles.Sampras also is attempting to tie fellow American Jimmy
Connor's modern day record of five U.S. Open titles.
</P>
<P>
Sampras earned his 600 career victory against just 162
losses.He is 152-26 in Grand Slam matches to lead all active
players and his 51-6 record at the Open is the best among active
players.
</P>
<P>
Sampras withstood an early barrage by Safin as he broke to go
up 5-4 and served out the first set. Following a two-hour rain
delay with Sampras leading 2-1 in the second set, the American
broke to go up 4-2 and served out the set.
</P>
<P>
In the final set, Sampras broke Safin to take 3-2 and broke
again to lead 5-2 before taking the match with three consecutive
aces.

<HEADLINE> Graf Wants to Take a Rest After Beaten in U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Five-times U.S. Open champion
Steffi Graf of Germany is feeling upset after losing her match
yesterday and wants to take a rest after the U.S. Open tennis
championships.
</P>
<P>
The veteran said here today: "I'm taking a little break after
this tournament. I've played a lot in the past few weeks. I'll
probably play a couple of tournaments in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Graf, eighth seed at the Open, was eliminated by Patty Schnyder
of Switzerland last night in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking a rest for now. When I started playing my first
tournaments in England, I had no expectations whatsoever. Really,
it
hasn't changed very much. I've really been going into the
tournaments with no expectations whatsoever. At times it has been
difficult to accept that it is going to take a certain time. There
were good and bad moments, but in general I've been pretty happy
the
way it's been going."
</P>
<P>
Graf missed last year's Open due to knee surgery which had
tamed
her more than one year. She only won one title this season and
currently ranks outside of the top 20 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder said: "It's hard to tell if her backhand is vulnerable
now because I didn't play against her wen she won all those
tournaments. I just think there is such a lot of respect towards
her. But I think fear is not the right word."

Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said Saturday that the
Anglo-American proposal of undertaking the trial in The Hague was
a ploy and that the two Libyans could be extradited to Britain
once the trial was over.

A British Foreign Office spokesman said early Monday that the
joint proposal specifically ruled out any kind of extradition

<HEADLINE> Martinez Troubled by Injury in U.S. Open Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Amanda Coetzer of South
Africa
outlasted seventh seed Conchita Martinez of Spain to enter the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open tennis championships here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 13th seed Coetzer beat Martinez 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 in a
two-hour,
38-minute marathon. It was the first time for Coetzer to beat
Martinez, who had won all 12 meetings over Coetzer before.
</P>
<P>
"She's been a very tough opponent for me my whole career," said
Coetzer. "It's great, especially because it's at a Grand Slam. I
think I just never felt like I really went out with a good game
plan
against her. I was getting a little confused and frustrated. I
think
today I set out to not get frustrated, just go out with a specific
game plan and stick with it."
</P>
<P>
The match witnessed both players lofted moonballs from the
baseline and the winner turned out as the one who made less
errors.
After Coetzer won the first set, the conservative play
intensified.
</P>
<P>
The second game of the second set consumed 29 minutes and
consisted of 11 deuces. Martinez finally broke Coetzer on her
fifth
break point and went on to take the set.
</P>
<P>
But Martinez, playing with a severe sprain, had little left in
the third rubber and Coetzer put away the match to earn her third
U.S. Open quarterfinal berth.
</P>
<P>
Martinez said: "It was difficult for me to play my own game
because I was injured. Basically, I'd say I was about 60 percent
of
my abilities today. When you're like that against a player like
Amanda that doesn't give up, it's difficult. I had pain when I was
playing the high balls. You cannot turn. I thought of retiring in
the first set but I decided to hang in there. At least I fought. I
gave it a shot. That's all I could have done."

<HEADLINE> Swedish Players Doing Good in U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Swedish players very quietly
are becoming a major factor at this year's U.S. Open tennis
championships.
</P>
<P>
Magnus Larsson's victory over second seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile Sunday night sent three Swedish players into the round of
16 at the U.S. Open for the first time since 1987. Earlier, Jonas
Bjorkman and Thomas Johansson had earned fourth round berths.
</P>
<P>
At least two Swedes have reached the round of 16 for the third
consecutive year at the Open. Bjorkman and Larsson also reached
the round of 16 last year and eventually both made it to the
quarterfinals. The last Swede to win the U.S. Open was Stefan
Edbergy in 1992 as he completed back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, four Swedes -- Edberg, Mats Wilander, Anders Jarryd
and Jonas Svensson -- made the round of 16 in the Open.

<HEADLINE> Manila, IMF Agree on GNP Growth for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Philippine government have agreed to aim for a
4.1-percent gross national product (GNP) growth rate in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides planned a 3.5-percent growth for the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) next year during a two-week
review of the Philippine economy by an IMF panel, Business World
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The targets paint the Philippines as one of the few economies
in East Asia that will see an expansion next year.
</P>
<P>
Four Asian countries, namely Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and
South Korea, are all expected to experience a recession next year,
according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson said the Philippines'
inflation is expected to slow down to 8.5 percent in 1999 from the
10-percent level expected by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the El Nino-induced drought and the effects of the
Asian financial crisis will be sidelined next year as the economy
starts its slow walk toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the IMF and Manila also agreed to cut the Philippines'
GNP target for 1998 to 1.5 percent from the original 2-3 percent
and the GDP to 1 percent from the earlier planned 1.5-2.5percent.
</P>
<P>
The multinational institution also allowed the country to have
a 40-billion-peso (930 million U.S. dollars) budget deficit this
year, instead of a planned surplus of 5 billion pesos (116 million
dollars).

LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of

His call came as United confirmed that negotiations were

rafford by 12,400 seats.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the matter is to be considered by the Office of
Fair Trading, which we would expect. We are anxious to discuss
this with the Government," Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a responsibility of those concerned with such deals
to explain them to the wider football audience, not least their
own supporters."

<HEADLINE> Man United Supporters Plan Protest Over Proposed Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of English premier
league soccer club Manchester United are planning to take the
opportunity of the home match against Charlton on Wednesday for a
mass protest at media magnate Rupert Murdoch's proposed 575 mil
lion pounds (960.9 million U.S. dollars) takeover of the club.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of leaflets which tells Murdoch to keep his hands
off the club will be distributed to supporters outside Old
Trafford before the match.
</P>
<P>
Fans are also threatening to boycott Murdoch's newspaper
titles and cancel BSkyB satellite television subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hodgkiss, spokesman for the Independent Manchester United
Supporters' Association, said: "The fans will not rest until we
have the outcome we want.
</P>
<P>
"People are talking about a mass boycott of the Sun(newspaper)
and canceling their Sky TV orders to make their feelings known.
</P>
<P>
"Feelings are running very high and I can see a huge backlash
building from Manchester United supporters against Murdoch's
empire.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a measure of everyone's anger if there was a
boycott and I would certainly not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
"There is bound to be a reaction from the crowd during the
Charlton game and the atmosphere should be fairly tense.
</P>
<P>
"We will be handing out leaflets to supporters before the
match to urge the club to pay attention to the supporters'views,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Man United Shares Soar on Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Shares in English premier
league soccer club Manchester United soared on the London Stock
Exchange on Monday after the club confirmed it was in takeover
talks with Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
Its shares rose 35% in early trading, before finishing 30%
higher at 206.5p.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday Manchester United and BSkyB issued
statements through the London Stock Exchange confirming they are
in takeover talks.
</P>
<P>
They said the talks "may or may not lead to an offer being
made "for the UK's biggest and richest football club.
</P>
<P>
The companies said a further announcement will be made in due
course.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB is thought to be willing to offer 225p a share for the
club,a premium of more than 160 million pounds to its closing
market value on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However the bid will face close scrutiny from the British
competition watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry secretary Peter Mandelson said that the
Office of Fair Trading (OFT) would examine any bid for Manchester
United "very completely and extremely searchingly".
</P>
<P>
A bid of this nature would be "of enormous interest and
importance to a lot of people", Mr. Mandelson added.
</P>
<P>
MPs have already raised concerns about the possible takeover.
</P>
<P>
Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Manchester Central said: "There are
and must be questions about the future of the club as a
footballing club."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the concern must be that if Mr. Murdoch and his
broadcasting empire already controls a big part of live football
and with Manchester United as one of the prime football teams, it
potentially gives a degree of control that could be unhealthy
from the point of view of the ordinary supporter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of the talks comes as reports suggest that
leisure group Enic may join the bidding for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times published on Monday reported that the
group, which has extensive interests in European football, is
poised to submit a rival offer to BSkyB's 575m bid.
</P>
<P>
The group owns Vicenza of Italy, Slavia Prague of the Czech
Republic, AEK Athens of Greece and a 25% stake in Glasgow
Rangers.

LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- England team manager Glenn
Hoddle said on Monday that England could make it to the Euro 2000
finals despite a poor start to their qualifying campaign in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle, already under pressure in the build-up to the match in
Stockholm following controversies surrounding his World Cup diary
and criticisms from defender Tony Adams, saw his position further
undermined by Saturday's 2-1 defeat.
</P>
<P>
But he insists he has no intention of quitting his post and
intends to continue with his plan of discussing an extension to
his contract until the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"There's always a disappointment when you have a defeat," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the start of a new campaign and this is a setback -
but there are a lot of points to be gained yet.
</P>
<P>
"We lost a game in qualifying for the World Cup at home to
Italy,responded to it and still managed to top the group, so
there's still optimism within the camp," he said.

TEHRAN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation
of Associated Wrestling (FILA) announced on Monday to change
wrestling match time from present five minutes to two rounds of
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the FILA
made the decision in its annual meeting held here on Monday upon
the demands of several members.
</P>
<P>
The new decision, which will take effect as of the beginning

two rounds of three minutes with a break of 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Many coaches have complained that they can not play an
important role in wrestling matches according to the present
regulation, as they can not contact with their wrestlers during
the matches, a FILA official said.
</P>
<P>
However, the new rule allows coaches to give necessary
instructions to wrestlers during the 30-second break between the
two rounds of match.

<HEADLINE> Crises in Asia, Russia Dampen World Business Climate: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The world business climate has cooled
down considerably due to the financial crises in Asia and Russia, an
economic survey conducted by a German economic institute said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts questioned by the German Ifo institute in 67
countries in July were much less optimistic in their economic
predictions for the next six months than they were three months ago,
the Ifo survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The business climate in Asia, where financial turmoil started more
than a year ago, had further deteriorated, with economic experts
seeing almost no chance for Japan to stop recession within this year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
While predicting more crisis-related impact on many other Asian
economies, the Ifo survey also found rising fears that the Asian
crisis could spill over to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile experts also saw the possibility of an economic slowdown
in the United States, Ifo said.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the business climate in Western Europe continued to be
quite positive with the twin crises in Asia and Russia expected to
have only limited impact on the region.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts still predicted economic slowdown in parts of
Western Europe, especially in Britain, in the second half of this
year, Ifo said.

BUCHAREST, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori Monday evening arrived here on a two-day official
visit to Romania. This is the first visit ever paid to Romania by
an incumbent Peruvian president.
</P>
<P>
"We will exploit every possibility to find ways for a more
fertile exchange between our two countries in all fields,
especially in the economic and commercial ones. I hope that my
visit will contribute to an even better understanding between our
two countries," Fujimori told the press upon his arrival at
Otopeni International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of President Fujimori's visit includes a meeting
with President Emil Constantinescu, Prime Minister Radu Vasile and
with the presidents of the two Chambers of Parliament. The
Peruvian president will also participate in a conference with the
Romanian businessmen in the Latin American House.
</P>
<P>
Among the most important topics to be discussed during the
visit are the identification of new areas of bilateral
cooperation, the development of trade and the possibility of
setting up joint ventures in domains of common interest. A series
of cooperation accords, in the field of tourism, the fight against
drug trafficking and in the cultural and scientific domain, are
expected to be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Romania and Peru established the diplomatic relations in 1939.
The bilateral relations have been increasing over the last years,

ATHENS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece reiterated Monday that
it still opposed the ban to be imposed by European Union (EU) on
flights by Yugoslav carriers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a working talks here with visiting Bosnian Serb
Prime Minister Milorad Dodid, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said that Athens was still against the EU flight ban
decision which was made two months ago because the present
situation in Kosovo was different, and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had expressed willingness to begin peace talks with the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Milosevic had accepted the international
community's condition of wider autonomy for Kosovo, although the
Albanian community continued to seek independence, which was
unacceptable to the international community.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Dodik said that the EU decision to ban Yugoslav
carriers flights was the worst and did not help a resolution of
problems in Yugoslavia or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Both men agreed that there had to be an end to hostilities as
soon as possible and it was the right of each state to defend its
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
As for the scheduled general elections in Bosnia, Dodik said
that it would provide the Bosnian Serb Republic with the
wherewithal to implement the 1995 Dayton peace accords.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Reaffirms Commitment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar has reaffirmed his government's
commitment to hand over an elected civilian government by May
next year.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the at a press conference in
the capital city Monday, he said: "The officer and men of the
Nigerian armed forces and police, like the generality of our
people yearn for democracy in a united and peaceful country."
</P>
<P>
While Abubaka has seemingly won the trust of many people about
his sincerity, still some doubt that the military forces might
want to stick to power, which they have managed to do in most of
the time since Nigeria won independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Asked under what circumstances he or the military might think
it is necessary to take over again, Abubakar said he hoped it
will never happen.
</P>
<P>
Repeating his appeal to the country's exiles abroad to return
and join the so-called all inclusive democratic process, Abubakar
disclosed that he has given instructions to the Ministry of
Justice to withdraw charges against them.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he thinks his administration has done enough to
satisfy the international community's demand to democratize
Nigeria, Abubakar said democratization is the need of Nigeria
itself and its success should not be measured by the satisfaction
of the international society.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Abubakar reaffirmed his
administration's transpancy to sustaining the independence of
and transparency of the new independence electoral committee,
which he inauguarated on August 11.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Canada to Stop Gas Flaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Canada are expected
to seal a comprehensive blueprint to put out the flaring of
associated gas at Nigeria's oil wells at a follow-up forum to be
held in Abuja later this month.
</P>
<P>
Representatives attending the forum will discuss emission
reduction strategies including the clean development mechanism,
the clean air strategic alliance, and the voluntary challenge and
register program, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The gas flaring which has lasted for the past 40 years in the
West African country would be virtually eradicated in the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting held last June in Canada between the
National Committee of the Nigerian Vision and the Canadian
Petroleum, the blueprint is to be tabled at the scheduled forum
for endorsement.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria recognizes the need to make a major effort to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating the flaring of gases,"
a senior Nigerian official said.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja forum will explore innovations already developed by
Canadian oil industry operatives concerning industry-wide
initiatives targeted at encouraging corporate commitment to
flaring reduction strategies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian oil fields produce up to two billion standard cubic
feet of natural gas daily as by-products of oil exploration, out
of which about 90 percent is routinely flared at flow stations.
</P>
<P>
With natural gas resources estimated at 3,500 billion cubic
feet, Nigeria is rated as having the 10th largest reserves of
natural gas in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has recently introduced a series of
generous incentives for the use of natural gas in the country and
also invested billions of Dollars in the Nigeria Liquefied
Natural Gas Ltd. in order to produce more liquefied gas for
export.
</P>
<P>
All the major oil companies operating in the country have
embarked on projects to use gas associated with oil production
with the biggest project under construction at a cost of 3.8
billion U.S. Dollars.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Most children with
disabilities in Uganda are from very poor families which cannot
afford nursery school fees, a health official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten Kristensen, a coordinator in the Ministry of Health,
made the remarks when opening a five-day workshop near Kampala
for nursery school and infant teachers on early intervention on
children especially those with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
A Radio Uganda report quoted the coordinator as saying that
many schoo do not admit children with disabilities because
they fear that these children may lower the standards of schools.
</P>
<P>
Veronica Mpagi, a consultant on early intervention, said
nursery teachers play a crucial role in the development of a
child and the child's education.
</P>
<P>
With more children with special needs than ever before, she
added, nursery teachers as basic educators should know what is
needed for the early intervention in a child's development and
they are urged to pay more attention and care to children with
visually and hearing problems.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Declares War on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA (Nigeria), September 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military
leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar has declared war on corruption
in the country that has been dubbed as one of the most corrupt
nation in the world by some sectors of the world community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the capital Monday, Abubakar
said his administration is committeed to instilling transparency,
accountability and probity in public life.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government has started investigations
into the conduct of certain government departments in the
disbursement and application of public funds.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that routine audit and investigations of various
accounts in the office of the National Security Adviser and other
government departments and agencies are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The former national security adviser to the late head of
state, General Sani Abacha, has been accused of stealing tens of
thousands of U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investigations are aimed to recover advancement payment
for contracts that have not been executed or whose prices were
over inflated and monies that were not properly used.
</P>
<P>
Noting that these investigations are not formal administrative
or judicial inquiries, he said they have achieved appreciable
results.
</P>
<P>
"All those that have been questioned have co-operated and
voluntarily refunded some money, which are being kept in a
special account in the Central Bank of Nigeria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also announced the re-organization of the Ministry of
Petroleum Resources and the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC), which he said is central to the
revitalization of the Nigerian economy.
</P>
<P>
The two above-mentioned bodies have been widely accused of
mismanaging Nigeria's huge income from oil exporting, which
amounts to more than 10 billion U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
During his recent reshuffle of the cabinet which he inherited
from late head of state, General Sani Abacha, Abubakar did not
appoint a new petroleum minister.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he appointed a special adviser to help him supervise
the ministry directly.
</P>
<P>
For the future, Abubakar said he will create an independent
commission to regulate and monitor the petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
A special adviser on energy will be appointed to coordinate
the activities of the NNPC and the independent commission, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Refutes Libyan Complaints Over Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government Monday
dismissed Libyan complaints about plans to try the two Libyans
accused of undertaking the Lockerbie bombing, saying there was no
agreement of extraditing the two Libyans if they were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said Saturday that the
Anglo-American proposal of undertaking the trial in The Hague was
a ploy and that the two Libyans could be extradited to Britain
once the trial was over.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman said early Monday that the
joint proposal specifically ruled out any kind of extradition
after the trial and guaranteed the two men would be returned to
Libya if they were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been any suggestion of a transit point.
Gaddafi is building on a word which doesn't have any relevance.
Gaddafi is either not reading the small print or he is
prevaricating," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After being moved to the Netherlands the two men would be
extradited from Dutch jurisdiction to Scottish jurisdiction in the
form of the Scottish court in The Hague. That's all," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Britain was ready to give
assurances about the plan but made clear this had to be done
through the offices of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Some 270 people were killed when a Pan AM airliner exploded
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 and the
U.N. imposed strict international sanctions on Libya in 1992 after
the Libyan government refused to hand over the alleged bombers.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Stage Strong Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- An across-the-board rally in
Asia on hints from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
that U.S. rates could be cut spread to European bourses, which
staged a general rally on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The London Footsie finished strongly holding onto big gains
after Alan Greenspan's hints that he is prepared to lower interest
rates if necessary. The FTSE 100 index finished just off the day's
highs, up 180 at 5347.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on Friday, Greenspan said that the Fed had shifted
away from its tightening bias on interest rates. His pessimistic
assessment about the likely impact of Asian and Russian turmoil on
the U.S. economy also suggested that he was beginning to favor a
U.S. rate cut.
</P>
<P>
The bullish mood infected Asian markets and most of the
continent and paved the way for a big rally on the footsie.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment was further lifted by talk that UK rates had peaked
and would head down in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks joined the global rebound but the
dollar's decline and a second prime ministerial vote in Russia
tempered gains.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax index closed at 4945, up 81 points with key
stocks slipping in late trade from large gains seen earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks benefited most from early trading activity, as
fears over their exposure to Russia dissipated once again. Merck
Finck &AMP; Co.'s Eckhard Frahm said "The market is slowly beginning
to understand the message" that the Russian crisis isn't a major
concern for German banks.
</P>
<P>
Traders said comments by Alan Greenspan Friday hinting at a
potential interest rate cut gave trading a boost, even though U.S.
markets are closed due to a public holiday, although Labor Day
also ensured that Frankfurt trade was thin.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks moved ahead with other European markets
although trade was disturbed by technical problems in the
afternoon. The leading Cac-40 index 3795 closed up 104 points.
</P>
<P>
Traders said market players are still very concerned about
political developments in Russia and are trying to evaluate which
kind of stocks are safest before making any moves.
</P>
<P>
"Investors are asking questions to figure out the sensitivity
of various business sectors," said Richard Morisseau, a salesman
at brokerage house Meeschaert Rousselle.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Bus Drivers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Commercial vehicle
operators Monday went on strike in Lagos, paralyzing the city all
the day.
</P>
<P>
The striking drivers carrying placards and chanting songs
embarked on a peaceful protest against the recognition by the
Lagos government of officials of the National Union of Road
Transport (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association
(RTEAN).
</P>
<P>
The drivers are protesting against the return of the NURTW and
RTEAN officials who, they alleged, have been extorting drivers at
the motor parks, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported.
</P>
<P>
They stormed the Victoria Island office of the Nigerian
Television Authority (NTA) in five over-loaded buses and then
went to the office of the Lagos state military administrator to
formally register their grievances.
</P>
<P>
In a nine-point resolution contained in their public notice,
the striking drivers called for the "total disengagement of NURTW
and RTEAN from all motor parks".
</P>
<P>
The notice advised all vehicle owners to keep their vehicles
within their domain until the vexed issues were settled.
</P>
<P>
"All sectors of commercial drivers should cease work as from
Monday, September 7, until further notice," it said.
</P>
<P>
As there were no commercial buses in Lagos Monday, many
commuters had to walk to their destinations and most offices were
empty.
</P>
<P>
The striking drivers belong to five associations including
Lagos State Taxi Drivers' Association and Urban Commercial Bus
Drivers' Association of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Capture Bonnie's Cloud Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- NASA researchers said
they had captured images of Hurricane Bonnie's "sky-scraping"
cloud using the first space-bone rain radar, orbiting aboard the
U.S.-Japanese spacecraft Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Monday's Washington Post, the
cloud rose 59000 feet into the sky out of the Hurricane's
central eye wall. This is the first time that the radar has seen
a structure of this type in a hurricane approaching the U.S.
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists believe that the vast amount of warm, moist
air carried aloft in such a tower, and the subsequent release of
latent energy in the form of rain, is the precursor for an
intensification of the hurricane. That was what happened to
Bonnie a day or two later, they said.
</P>
<P>
They said the cloud probably formed because Bonnie was moving
very slowly. The lack of movement kept funneling warm moist air
into the upper atmosphere, thus raising the entire height of the
tropopause which is normally around 45000 feet.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Rejects Union Calls for Economic Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair rejected demands for a change in government economic policy
during a meeting with union leaders in Downing Street Monday.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that any relaxation in the tough policy would risk
destroying the major strides already made towards building a
stable economy.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that he understands the difficulties manufacturing
industry is facing as a result of high interest rates and the
strong pound. What business fears most is "a return to boom and
bust and 15 percent interest rates" which led to company failures
and job losses under the previous government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Labor's policy has been taken to get inflation under control
and in the long term interests of the economy, not for short term
political considerations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after a week in which 600 workers at the
Fujitsu plant in Tony Blair's own Sedgefield constituency became
the latest casualties of the slump in the world market.
</P>
<P>
But critics are blaming the government's economic policy, high
interest rates and the level of the pound for domestic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
As the economic situation abroad worsens and its effects
continue to be felt in Britain, trade union leaders urged Blair to
set up a special task force to stop the manufacturing industry
"sliding into recession."
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the meeting, Ken Jackson, general secretary of
the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said an
immediate cut in interest rates is needed to avert massive new job
losses.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to the prime minister will be quite simple, that
there are something like 250,000 jobs at risk out there if
immediate action isn't taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
And senior Labor MP Martin O'Neill, chairman of the Commons'
trade and industry committee, also called on ministers to show a
"greater awareness of the concerns of business."
</P>
<P>
"At the present moment there is a sense that responsibility for
interest rates has been passed to the Bank of England Committee,
and at the same time there is not an appreciation by government of
what is happening in manufacturing industry," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Insists Lamb Is Safe to Eat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
advising the public Monday that lamb is safe to eat amid claims by
experts that the mad cow disease may have spread to sheep.
</P>
<P>
There was no "no evidence" to justify a ban on lamb sales, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But it said investigations into any possible risk to human
health would continue.
</P>
<P>
National anxiety was generated after a senior government
adviser on mad cow disease revealed that it is possible sheep may
have been infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy(BSE), the
so-called mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jeffrey Almond, head of the sheep subcommittee of the
government BSE watchdog SEAC (the spongiform encephalopathy
advisory committee), told a radio program that there is "distinct
possibility that BSE is out there in the sheep population."
</P>
<P>
The problem had been known about since 1996, Almond said Monday
in BBC radio's early morning program Farming Today. He warned that
if the BSE is found in the sheep, it would be a national
emergency.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of BSE in Britain has been linked to the use of
cattle feed that included the remains of sheep infected with
scrapie, a form of BSE.
</P>
<P>
But humans are not thought to be at risk from the conventional
form of scrapie that has infected sheep for centuries.
</P>
<P>
If firm evidence is produced that BSE can pass to sheep, it
could lead to the mass destruction of the 42 million-strong flock
in Britain.
