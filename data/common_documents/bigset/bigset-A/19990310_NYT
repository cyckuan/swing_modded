REPUBLICANS RIP DEMOCRATS OVER EDUCATION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political sniping over an education bill turned
sharper Tuesday as five congressional Republicans _ all former
governors _ accused Democrats of using the issue in a ``cynical''
attempt to score political points.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called education flexibility bill would give states the
power to waive federal rules on certain education programs so that
schools could channel the money where they saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 governors support the bill, and a dozen states, including
Kansas, have the flexibility under a trial program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned,'' said Sen.
George Voinovich, an Ohio Republican and former governor whose
state was among the first to receive the waiver. ``Why should this
be tied up in partisan politics? Let's get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Voinovich were Sens. Kit Bond and John Ashcroft of
Missouri, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Rep. Michael Castle
of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Democrats see the politically popular ``ed-flex'' bill
as a chance to make good on last year's promise to hire 100,000 new
teachers. Congress approved a $1 billion down payment on the
program last year. Democrats want to attach an $11.4 billion
amendment to ed-flex that would pay for the teachers over the next
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed-flex is a good idea...but flexibility and accountability
mean little if we don't also give communities the support they need
to implement school reform strategies that work,'' Sen. Edward
Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A procedural vote expected Wednesday could determine whether the
Senate would be allowed to vote on the Democratic amendment. And
that may determine what happens to the ed-flex bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who is running for re-election next year, led the five
Republicans on Tuesday in decrying the time that schools and
teachers were forced to spend on federal paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute spent on forms is a minute not spent on students,
and these are people who love students,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who has emphasized education as both governor and senator,
said the depth of Washington's intrusion into education policy was
like ``the nose of the federal camel under the education tent.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Democratic effort to alter the ed-flex bill
was designed to deny Republicans a political victory after the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, Bond said yes, and the
others appeared to agree.
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd argue that the Democrats made this a top priority during
Clinton's entire term in office, but it's only recently that the
Republicans have gotten some religion on this issue,'' Laura
Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy aide James Manley said the Republicans were ``desperate
to get out from under the cloud caused by the impeachment process
and are trying to find legislation they can move through the Senate
and demonstrate they are moving on an agenda that will impact the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, national Republicans held a town meeting on
education outside Philadelphia to demonstrate their support for an
issue that polls show resonates with voters in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chafee and Castle said the bill's appeal was clear by the
fact that every governor _ Republican, Democrat and Independent _
supported it.
</P>
<P>
   They said the other education issues that Democrats wanted to
talk about, such as teachers, class size and technology, should be
dealt with when the Senate took up reauthorization of the more
expansive Elementary and Secondary Education Act, presumably later
this year.

NCAA PONDERS FUTURE AFTER RULING BARRING USE OF SAT TO DETERMINE
ELIGIBILITY  
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE WITH LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now in his senior year at St. Patrick's High School in
Elizabeth, N.J., Jamal Jackson has a 2.4 grade-point average in the
classroom to go with his 11 points and eight assists a game on the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   He has received inquiries from Division I schools like St.
Peter's and Fairfield, but in two attempts at the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, he has failed to make the NCAA minimum score of 820
required for an athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Now he, as well as hundreds of high school athletes across the
country, may not have to. On Monday, a federal judge in
Philadelphia struck down the NCAA's minimum test score requirement,
or Proposition 16, saying that it discriminated against
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling removed from the NCAA's control the issue of college
athletic eligibility, and for now placed it with the individual
schools. It left college administrators and the NCAA in limbo
Tuesday, with many officials acknowledging that in the absence of
guidelines, confusion would reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does present somewhat of a chaotic environment,'' said the
NCAA president, Cedric Dempsey. ``It leaves a lot of unanswered
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson and other students, the window of opportunity may be
brief. The NCAA will ask Judge Ronald I. Buckwalter Wednesday for a
stay of his decision, saying the chaos among its member schools
would be counterproductive. In the mean time, it will prepare an
appeal. Elsa Kircher Cole, the organization's general counsel, said
she expected a response from the judge ``within a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials said they have been studying eligibility
standards since last summer and are prepared to move quickly in
establishing a new standard. Charles Wethington, the University of
Kentucky president and chairman of the NCAA executive committee,
said that coming up with an acceptable standard has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   He said the NCAA has not strayed from its goal of having initial
eligibility standards in an effort to improve graduation rates and
insure that student athletes are prepared for college work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly concerned at this moment with the effect this
ruling will have on academic preparedness of prospective student
athletes,'' Wethington said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when NCAA officials conceded they had more questions
than answers, they also announced that the NCAA would pay $54.5
million to about 2,000 Division I coaches who had sued over the
restricted earnings rule, which had capped their salaries at
$16,000 for a calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the settlement of a $75 million judgment against the NCAA
in a case challenging its decision to limit the earnings of
entry-level coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Buckwalter's ruling on one of college sports' most
enduring challenges _ how to improve graduation rates without
excluding economically disadvantaged students _ that left coaches,
administrators and college presidents uncertain of who is eligible
for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Without Proposition 16, there are no guidelines by which to
decide if incoming freshmen are academically eligible.
</P>
<P>
   It poses immediate problems in the NCAA basketball tournament,
which begins on Thursday. The NCAA estimates that 500 to 1,000
athletes have been affected by the existing test score minimum
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Until a stay is granted, the NCAA said Tuesday, athletes sitting
out their freshman year because they failed to meet the minimum
requirements are free to play _ including the Temple basketball
player Alexander Wesby, who was one of the four plaintiffs in a
class action suit in Philadelphia. He won't play in the tournament,
said the Temple sports media director, Brian Kirschner.
</P>
<P>
   Wethington said he wouldn't approve an ineligible player if the
situation arises at his school. ``I think this situation is too
fluid, too undecided and there's too much at risk,'' Wethington
said, emphasizing that he was speaking only for himself. ``I think
it would be sending the absolute wrong signal.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ruling touched on an issue that resonates among coaches and
athletes. If it is upheld, the ruling could restore a lost year of
eligibility to athletes like Rasheed Brokenborough, the Temple
senior guard who sat out his freshman year because of the SAT
cutoff and ran up $15,000 in debt because he could not qualify for
a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in coaching has been affected by the NCAA test
rules,'' said Lute Olson, the Arizona coach. ``There are a number
of kids we would have recruited had they not had test scores
standing in their way. This particular kid pops into my mind _ he
is from southern California and he's playing in the pros now. He
did not have high enough test scores in the initial period that we
needed them to make the decision. We went with the kid with the
test score. We would have opted for the southern California kid.
Later, he got the test score at the end of the year. His first
choice was us, but we couldn't wait and take the chance on him
getting the score.''
</P>
<P>
   New York high school coaches, athletic directors and school
administrators applauded the judge's ruling. Wade Williams, for 10
years the basketball coach at Bronx Regional, an alternative high
school for students with academic problems, remembered the players
who didn't meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them were intimidated by the SAT because they hadn't
had academic success,'' said Williams, who has placed at least 40
athletes on scholarships at junior colleges or Division III
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, who is black, also worried that the ruling might
have a damaging effect on those it aimed to help: black students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that kids will think they don't have to do
anything,'' Williams said. ``It also exposes kids to unscrupulous
coaches who will accept them for their talent, then cast them
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   That situation, with embarrassing admissions by college students
that they were not being educated or even had trouble reading, was
what prompted the NCAA to institute minimum test scores in the
first place back in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For St. Patrick's Jackson, a change in the requirements for
athletic eligibility would bring an opportunity to be rewarded for
the hard work he has done in the classroom. He is the second oldest
of five children and would be the first in his family to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the judge's rule stands because I'd get a lot more
offers,'' Jackson said Tuesday by telephone as his team prepared
for the state sectional tournament. ``Right now, schools are scared
to take me because of my SAT scores. They're afraid they may have
to park me on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Kevin Boyle, said Jackson has steadily raised his
grade-point average over his four years. ``He came in not as a
great student,'' said Boyle. ``But he stayed on the straight and
narrow, worked hard and we made sure he didn't slip through the
cracks. He's really tried to improve his SAT scores, but he doesn't
test well on big tests. This is a kid that deserves a break.''

JOHN ATWOOD, AVIATION EXECUTIVE, DIES AT 94
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Texas, Ky., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Leland Atwood, an engineer who rose through the executive
ranks at North American Aviation as it built the P-51 Mustang, the
most powerful fighter plane of World War II; the F-100 Super Sabre,
the first supersonic fighter, and the Apollo capsule that took men
to the moon, died on March 5. He was 94 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, who was known as Lee, retired in 1970 as chairman of the
North American Rockwell Corp., a company formed three years earlier
by the merger of North American Aviation Inc. of Los Angeles and
the Rockwell-Standard Corp., an auto parts maker in Pittsburgh. The
company became Rockwell International in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Don H. Davis, the chief executive of Rockwell International,
said Atwood's contributions ``helped the United States to attain
aerospace superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood was assistant general manager of North American Aviation
in 1940 when he persuaded the British government to pay for
development of a new plane instead of modifying the Curtiss P-40.
Pilots flying the new plane, the P-51 Mustang, were responsible for
almost half of the enemy aircraft downed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Luther Smith of Villanova, Pa., one of the Tuskegee Airmen, a
unit of black fighter pilots, flew 50 of his 133 World War II
combat missions in a P-51. He said Tuesday that the Mustang ``could
outmaneuver all of the German fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The P-51 was so powerful, with its Rolls-Royce engines, and so
maneuverable, that we would give Germans 10 seconds to parachute
out once we got behind them,'' he added. ``They knew, and we knew,
that we had them and we would have our gun cameras on, and as soon
as we got a picture of them bailing out we would shoot down the
plane and let the pilot live.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood also played a key role in designing the B-25 Mitchell, a
medium-range bomber, 16 of which were used by Gen. Jimmy Doolittle
in the raid over Tokyo in 1942, an attack that had little military
value but helped raise American morale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Atwood disclosed that the F-100, which his company
built, had become the first production jet fighter to operate at
supersonic speeds in level flight. He also helped North American
Aviation win the contract to build the X-15 rocket plane, which
Capt. Pete Knight flew at more than 4,500 miles an hour in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood was born in 1904 in Walton, Ky. He graduated from
Hardin-Simmons University in 1926 and two years later earned a
master's degree in civil engineering at the University of Texas. He
then went to work as a junior airplane engineer for the Army Air
Corps at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, he was hired at Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica,
Calif., and he moved to North American Aviation in Los Angeles as
chief engineer and vice president. He was promoted to assistant
general manager in 1938, to first vice president in 1941, to
president in 1948, chief executive in 1960 and chairman in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when the company merged with
Rockwell-Standard, Atwood was named chief executive, a post he held
until he retired in 1970. In 1996, Boeing acquired the aerospace
operations of Rockwell International.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood is survived by his wife, Patricia, Rockwell International
said.

<P>
   For many years after World War II, North American Aviation was
the biggest military contractor, relying on Washington for
virtually all of its revenue. Atwood was called to Washington
several times for hearings by congressmen about how well the
company spent taxpayer money, as well as its relationship with
Robert G. Baker, the Senate Democratic secretary whose outside
business dealings were the subject of a 1964 congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, North American Aviation abruptly reduced by half its
contract with a vending machine company to make room for another
company, U-Serv, in which Baker was a major shareholder. The deal
was valued at $2.5 million, the equivalent of $13.6 million today.
Atwood told the Senate Rules Committee in 1964 that he was unaware
of Baker's role or that his company's lobbyist was also a major
U-Serv shareholder. Ten days later, Atwood announced that he had
dismissed the lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Atwood was again called on the carpet after a fire
killed three Apollo astronauts during a pre-flight test of the
space capsule. Atwood said that in designing the capsule no one had
considered the possibility of a fire on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The government's own inquiry found shoddy work that was not
caught by inspectors of North American Aviation, including a socket
wrench left inside the Apollo capsule. The moon project was not
only a huge political issue but also an economic giant that
accounted for almost 1 percent of the gross national product at its
peak.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood told a House committee that ``overconfidence'' was behind
some of the problems, which he vowed to correct without delaying
the national goal to put a man on the moon before the end of the
decade. He installed new managers on the project and made other
changes. On July 20, 1969, Neil A. Armstrong put his boot into
lunar dust and later that year the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration gave Atwood its Public Service Award.

ERIC R. WOLF, 76, AN ICONOCLASTIC ANTHROPOLOGIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Conn., Calif., Vt., Va.)  (nk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric R. Wolf, an accidental anthropologist whose cultural
studies of Latin American peoples and European peasants helped
enrich an already eclectic field even as he challenged some
established cultural assumptions, died on Sunday at his home in
Irvington, N.Y. He was 76 and had taught at Lehman College and the
Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who had had an intense fascination with the
sometimes striking cultural differences of diverse peoples since
his grade school days in polyglot Vienna and his teen-age years in
strife-torn Sudetenland, Wolf _ whose father was Austrian and
mother Russian _ did not immediately see anthropology as his
natural academic outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he came to the United States with his parents and
settled in Queens, Wolf, whose father had operated a textile
factory in the Sudetenland before the 1938 Nazi takeover, saw
biology as the best bet to explain human differences.
</P>
<P>
   But after enrolling in Queens College planning to major in
biochemistry, he stumbled into an anthropology class one day and
realized that the broad field embraced just about everything he was
interested in, which was just about everything about every aspect
of the human experience.
</P>
<P>
   After interrupting his education to serve with the Army in the
Alps in World War II, Wolf received a degree in anthropology in
1946 and went on to Columbia University on the G.I. bill, receiving
a doctorate in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining City University in 1971 as a distinguished
professor, he had brief teaching stints at the University of
Illinois, the University of Virginia, Yale University and the
University of Chicago and nine years as a professor at the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   By then he had already established his reputation as an
innovative and iconoclastic academic, whose credentials included
helping to organize one of the earliest Vietnam teach-ins, at
Michigan in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His 1959 book about Mexico, for example, ``Sons of the Shaking
Earth,'' raised eyebrows among established anthropologists _ even
as it established a fertile trend _ by drawing on archaeology,
history and other alien fields to trace the diverse cultural
development of Mexico. It is a reflection of the book's power, as
well as of Wolf's clear and graceful writing style, that it is
still used in introductory anthropology courses.
</P>
<P>
   In writing the book, Wolf not only made unorthodox use of
scholarship from other fields but also refined some of his own
unorthodox ideas about the very nature of culture. Long seen by
anthropologists as a stable set of attitudes and practices that
defined various peoples and differentiated them from others,
culture, as Wolf came to see it, was a far more dynamic process
that involved endless practical, psychological and other reactions
to changing economic and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To Wolf, who outlined his position in a 1964 book,
``Anthropology,'' the notion of unified and unchanging cultures
amounted to little more than misleading ethnic stereotyping,
sweeping generalizations that failed to notice or account for the
variety of differences within a single culture.
</P>
<P>
   Having concluded that established cultural anthropologists
tended to neglect many nonconforming elements of a given society,
Wolf helped rectify things with his 1966 book, ``Peasants,'' which
traced the common threads of peasantry in otherwise diverse
European cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 he developed another favorite theme, the sometimes
cataclysmic impact of colonial capitalism on indigenous cultures,
with ``Europe and the People Without History,'' which tracked the
impact of colonial economic expansion on less developed societies.
</P>
<P>
   If Wolf was a champion of the idea that all people, even tribal
societies and peasants, are equally important, he also practiced
that philosophy in his life as a teacher or, as he saw himself, as
a perpetual student for whom life was an endless and delightful
field trip.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant man known for his charming and uncanny ability to
make even ordinary people feel he was intensely interested in them,
as indeed he was, Wolf was such a nurturing teacher that he was the
preferred go-to guy when his students came up with brilliant but
untested ideas. While other professors, they knew, might dismiss
such brainstorms as harebrained, Wolf could be counted on to become
as excited as they were.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his retirement in 1992, Wolf, who was awarded a
$375,000 MacArthur Foundation ``genius grant'' in 1990, continued
his quest for new answers to old questions, among them the
explanation for the Nazis' rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   Finding parallels between the rise of Nazi Germany and both the
widespread human sacrifice by the Aztecs and the development of a
frenzied tradition of Potlatch feasts in the Pacific Northwest,
Wolf examined them in his last book, ``Envisioning Power:
Ideologies of Dominance and Crisis,'' published this year by the
University of California Press.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, whose first marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his
wife, Sydel Silverman; two sons from his first marriage, David, of
Burlington, Vt., and Daniel, of Los Angeles; two stepdaughters, Eve
Silverman of Wilton, Conn., and Julie Yorn of Santa Monica, Calif.,
and three grandchildren.

PEGGY CASS, 74, AN ACTRESS; WON TONY IN `AUNTIE MAME'
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peggy Cass, a brassy-voiced comedian best known for
her portrayal of the pregnant, unwed secretary in ``Auntie Mame,''
died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan.
She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, Eugene Feeney, her husband and only
survivor, said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boston, Mary Margaret Cass succumbed to the lure of
Broadway and moved to New York at 19 after spending three years in
the Cambridge Latin School drama club without winning a single
speaking role.
</P>
<P>
   After turns as a stenographer, telephone operator, advertising
solicitor and model, she finally convinced a producer that she was
an actress. She was cast in a USO tour of ``The Doughgirls'' and
spent seven months in Australia without stepping into costume
because the U.S. Army had by then moved to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Her break came when, as an understudy, she took over for Jan
Sterling in Chicago in the national tour of ``Born Yesterday.''
Soon after, the producer George Abbott hired her for the 1949
Broadway musical ``Touch and Go.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the role of the dimwitted secretary, Agnes Gooch, in
the 1956 Broadway show ``Auntie Mame'' with which Ms. Cass was most
associated. Her performance earned her a Tony Award for best
supporting actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her
work in the 1958 film version.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, Ms. Cass' facility for brash repartee landed
her regular appearances on the television quiz show ``Keep
Talking.'' She also appeared often on ``The Jack Paar Show'' in the
late '50s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The possessor of an encyclopedic mind, she could be seen during
the '60s as often as seven times a week on the quiz shows ``Match
Game,'' ``Password'' and ``To Tell the Truth.''

ACCOUNTING IS QUESTIONED IN LAWSUIT AGAINST iVILLAGE 
 (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just days before the planned initial public stock
offering of iVillage Inc., a New York Internet service for women, a
former chief financial officer of the company has filed court
documents accusing iVillage of ``inappropriate'' accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were made in connection with a lawsuit filed in
January by a former employee, Todd L. Kenner. Kenner contends that
iVillage reneged on a promise to give him stock options, a benefit
that could prove valuable if the offering, expected next Monday, is
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Tuesday that it could not directly respond to
the allegations since it is restricted in its public statements
because of the pending offering. But it did say that it stood by
its financial statements, which have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting allegations were made in a sworn declaration
filed in federal court in Nashville, Tenn., last Friday by Joanne
O'Rourke Hindman. She wrote that she joined iVillage in September
1997 as chief financial officer and almost immediately raised
questions about the company's accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the company was recognizing revenues prematurely
(indeed, in some instances even before letters of intent were
signed),'' the declaration said. In general, companies must wait
until they are assured of receiving revenues before claiming them
in financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hindman wrote that she told Candice Carpenter, the company's
chief executive, that iVillage should ``clean up our act'' with
regard to accounting for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks after being hired, Ms. Hindman wrote, she was
demoted from chief financial officer and assigned to run the
company's Better Health subsidiary. She was dismissed two months
later, she wrote. Her declaration asserts that she was denied stock
options that were promised her when she was hired.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was filed in an unusual legal maneuver. The case
is at an early stage, with arguments pending over whether it should
remain in Tennessee, where Kenner lived before joining iVillage, or
be moved to New York. So evidence on the facts would not normally
be entered yet. But lawyers for Kenner applied to the court for
permission to file declarations by Ms. Hindman and by Steven D.
Carter, another executive who says he was let go by iVillage and
denied promised stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver had the effect of making public the allegations of
Ms. Hindman before the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hindman declined to comment Tuesday, referring calls to her
lawyer, R. Paul Yetter in Houston. Yetter, who is also representing
Kenner, did not return a call.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers say that the offering is likely to proceed as
expected and that the company will rely on the reputation of
PricewaterhouseCoopers as its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that this filing, in itself, was unlikely to
derail the offering. After all, they said, Ms. Carpenter has long
had a reputation as a mercurial manager, and there has been far
more turnover at iVillage than at typical Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know that the women running the show over there are
fairly aggressive and can rub people the wrong way,'' said Mark S.
Basham, a new-issue analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``Investors who
like the company's go-for-broke style will still like the company.
Those who don't like that way of doing business didn't like it
before and won't change their mind.''

NEW YORK STATE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR BIGGER TAX CREDIT FOR
LOW-INCOME WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Taking up one of the favorite causes of advocates
for the poor, the Republicans who control the state Senate called
Tuesday for an expanded tax credit for more than a million
low-income workers, most of them with children.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was a first for the Senate Republicans, and it is
sure to make their overall tax cut package more palatable to a
skeptical Democratic majority in the Assembly as the two houses
negotiate the 1999-2000 state budget. It also greatly increases the
chances that the increased tax credit, which has been approved in
the past by the Assembly, will become law.
</P>
<P>
   As he announced the plan, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L.
Bruno, also warned that with just three weeks left before the start
of a new fiscal year, Senate and Assembly leaders remain billions
of dollars apart in their projections of how much money the state
has to spend.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a gap of ``a couple of billion'' between the
Senate estimate and the Assembly's higher figure, later adding,
``that's conservative,'' though he and other lawmakers said the
exact difference was unclear. Aides to the Assembly speaker,
Sheldon Silver, confirmed that the two sides were wide apart.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on how much money is available is a crucial precursor
to serious budget negotiations between the two houses. This year,
there is added pressure on them to pass a budget on time for the
first time since 1984 because a law enacted in December that gave
legislators a pay raise also requires that their salaries be
withheld as long as the budget is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gov. George Pataki proposed a 1.8 percent rise in
state spending, to $72.66 billion, despite a surplus that is
expected to exceed $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republicans, led by Bruno, had called for tax cuts
worth $800 million a year, and Tuesday they increased that figure
to $1.1 billion. But the Assembly Democrats are leery of deep tax
cuts that will inhibit their ability to restore spending cuts that
the governor has proposed in education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Democrats released the first concrete part of
their own budget plan, calling for $289 million more for higher
education than Pataki had proposed. Most of that would simply be
rejecting cuts that the governor is seeking in tuition aid for poor
students and other programs, but about $16 million would go toward
hiring 300 more professors in the State University and City
University systems.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office reserved judgment on the proposals from
the Legislature. ``We're always willing to look at ideas that
follow the governor's lead in cutting taxes,'' said Joseph Conway,
a spokesman for the governor's budget office. Of the Assembly plan,
he said, ``We can't comment because we haven't seen any details on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Senate Republicans' tax cut proposals have
mostly benefited businesses. But this year, the centerpieces of
their package are tax deductions for college tuition, and tax-free
accounts for people to save to buy their first homes, ideas with
broad appeal to middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   Today's proposal would expand the state's earned income tax
credit by half. The state credit, modeled on a federal credit, was
established in 1994, and it benefits childless workers who earn
less than $10,000 a year, and families with children and incomes up
to $30,000 a year. New York is one of just nine states with such a
credit.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.1 million wage earners in New York qualify for the
credit, most of them parents. And most are in New York City.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wedneday, March 10:
</P>
<P>
   The achievement gap between affluent and disadvantaged children
is a challenge to American education and a threat to national
prosperity. Unfortunately, a bipartisan bill that is scheduled for
debate and a vote today in Congress could widen that gap by
allowing states to use federal dollars targeted at the poorest
students for other educational purposes. The so-called Ed-Flex
proposal could damage the poorest districts, which have
traditionally been underfinanced by the states and cities even
though they bear the burden of teaching the least prepared
students.
</P>
<P>
   Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was the
federal government's way of assuring impoverished children a chance
at the supplemental services they need to succeed. Title I money,
about $8 billion a year, pays for special courses like remedial
reading and math as well as services like counseling. Over all,
federal dollars make up only about 8 percent of the public school
budgets. But in the poorest schools in the deep, rural South, Title
I can account for more than a third of school spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Ed-Flex proposal would allow states to apply for waivers to
do what they wish in education with the poverty money, on the
premise that the states might use it more wisely than federal law
allows. The proponents of this process point to ongoing Ed-FLex
experiments conducted under the Clinton administration in 12
states. But a report from the General Accounting Office suggests
that the experiments have been sloppily handled and should not be
duplicated without careful guidelines and performance criteria. The
GAO found that of the 12 experimental states, only Texas had
established clearly defined goals for employing the waivers and
laid out criteria for evaluating the experiment. The Ed-Flex
expansion being debated in Congress would extend waivers even to
states that have no intention of innovation and no means in place
of evaluating what they do.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. George Miller, D-Calif., and Dale Kildee, D-Mich., have
proposed an amendment to the plan that would allow waivers only if
the states employ serious assessment plans and commit themselves to
closing the achievement gaps between disadvantaged students and
their peers. The wise thing to do would be to put Ed-Flex aside
until later in the session, when Congress re-authorizes the entire
Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But if Congress insists on
moving forward now, to do so without the Miller-Kildee amendment
would be socially irresponsible.

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S OBLIGATION IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 10:
</P>
<P>
   To many Americans, and probably most Europeans, the acquittal of
Capt. Richard Ashby by a military jury may seem a miscarriage of
justice. Twenty innocent tourists died last year in the Italian
Alps when his low-flying Marine Corps jet severed the cable of
their ski gondola in the Italian mountains. But the evidence
presented at his court-martial showed that many others in the
Marine Corps chain of command shared the blame. That gave the jury
reason not to hold Ashby criminally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and his crew were allowed to fly with unclear flight
plans, out-of-date maps that did not show the cable line, faulty
radar altimeters and poor communications with Air Force officers
permanently assigned to the base at Aviano, Italy, where he and his
crew were training. He may well have been flying his plane too low,
too fast and in the wrong place. But the responsibility for those
mistakes was not his alone.
</P>
<P>
   That blurring of individual accountability in no way diminishes
the responsibility of the U.S. military. Washington must generously
compensate the victims' families. The Pentagon must also make sure
that other pilots do not misinterpret the Ashby verdict as a
license for the kind of indifference to safety rules portrayed in
the trial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has repaid Italy for the $60,000 in
compensation Rome gave to each victim's family and has added a
further $5,000 each for transportation and burial costs. America
has also agreed to pay up to 75 percent of any further civil
compensation later awarded by Italian courts for wrongful death.
But such court judgments could take many years, and some of the
victims' families have lost their main wage-earners and are in
immediate need. President Clinton rightly declared last week that
America would ``unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what
happened.'' He should live up to those words by offering
substantially increased compensation without delay.

EDITORIAL: THE EDGY LEGACY OF STANLEY KUBRICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The adjectives that cluster around Stanley Kubrick and his work
_ cool, distant, reclusive, savage, brilliant _ are words that
measure discomfort. Moviegoers love nothing more than certainty,
but Kubrick, who died Sunday at age 70, rarely gave them that
consolation. Hollywood, which also loves certainty and is deeply
distrustful of artistic independence, found Kubrick an
unquantifiable sum, a man driven by perfectionism and the ideal of
artistic control in an art form where collaboration, not to say
compromise, is the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paths of Glory,'' ``Lolita,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``2001: A
Space Odyssey,'' ``A Clockwork Orange,'' ``The Shining,'' ``Full
Metal Jacket'' _ these are movies governed by the passion of
Kubrick's unflinching eye and by his implacable visual
intelligence. That they are also sardonic and discomfiting goes
without saying. ``Dr. Strangelove,'' which appeared in 1964, is an
unforgettable send-up of the Cold War, but it also embodies an
ironic view of America that would characterize the counterculture
of the late 1960s at its best. Yet by the time that counterculture
reached its peak of dissent, 1968, Kubrick had released ``2001: A
Space Odyssey,'' a film that transcends irony completely.
</P>
<P>
   What Kubrick's choice of projects reveals is a keen literacy _
he drew, after all, from Anthony Burgess and Vladimir Nabokov _ and
a taste for the extremes of logic, the conclusions our culture's
unexamined premises lead us to. That is the point of Jack D.
Ripper, the base commander in ``Dr. Strangelove'' who is obsessed
with the purity of his bodily fluids, and of Dr. Strangelove
himself, played memorably by Peter Sellers, a one-man embodiment of
the arms race. That is the point, as well, of Humbert Humbert, who
is equally besotted with the adolescent lure of 1950s America and
with his pubescent Lolita. The visions that get at difficult truths
are not usually the ones that soothe us, and those were Kubrick's

EWING HURT AS KNICKS FALL TO BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the same opponent, the same unsettling scene.
There was Patrick Ewing, the New York Knicks' center leaping to tip
off the game against the Milwaukee Bucks. Then he came up limping
and wincing, and he left the court in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Just 29 seconds into the Knicks' 87-86 loss to the Bucks Tuesday
night at Madison Square Garden, Ewing walked off the court with a
sore left Achilles' tendon. A magnetic resonance imaging
examination showed no tendon disruption, according to the team
physician, Dr. Norman Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was listed as day-to-day with tendinitis, a far better
prognosis than the one he was handed the last time he left the
court and went to the hospital. On Dec. 20, 1997, Milwaukee's
Andrew Lang put a hard foul on Ewing that sent him crashing to the
floor at the Bradley Center. A day later, Ewing had surgery to
repair torn ligaments and a dislocated bone in his shooting hand.
He missed the last 56 games of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks reached the second round of the playoffs last season
without Ewing before being eliminated by the Indiana Pacers.
Tuesday night, they came undone against the Bucks. Latrell Sprewell
was left exposed in a defensive mental lapse. Sucked in by a
pick-and-roll, he left 3-point artist Dell Curry alone in the right
corner of the court. Curry shot a perfect arching 3-pointer with
3.4 seconds left to give the Bucks a comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's chance at redemption, a 25-footer at the buzzer,
banged off the rim. The Knicks, who had played with an awakened
sense of urgency in Ewing's absence, were left crestfallen and
wondering how they let go of a four-point lead with 54 seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   All of the energy Larry Johnson had poured out to score a
team-high 19 points and grab seven rebounds to counter Robinson's
27 points.
</P>
<P>
   All of the right things that Sprewell accomplished off the bench
in scoring 17. All of the good turned bad in the time it took Curry
to release a smooth 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Dell and it was totally my fault,'' Sprewell said.
``Knowing how good of a shooter he is, I should have stayed on him.
You're reacting to what's going on. It was my fault.'' The blame
had to be shared, though.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston disappeared during the game under a 4-for-16
shooting night. And in the last 54 seconds of the game, mistakes
and misses put the Knicks (10-8) in position to lose only their
second game at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a defensive stop, the ball ended up in Chris
Childs' hands. Trying to dribble among three defenders, he lost the
ball, turned and had to foul Terrell Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks' point guard hit two free throws to cut the Knicks'
lead to two points. A miss by Johnson with 17 seconds left opened
the door for the Bucks to send the Knicks to another loss at the
buzzer. It was their third in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't finish games right now,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ``Other teams are making and we're missing. Without Patrick,
we need guys to step up and be efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing missed Monday's practice and Tuesday's shoot-around
because of the soreness he has felt since the Cleveland game nine
days ago. ``I felt it pull and was concerned,'' he said, ``so I
took myself out of the game. I hope to return soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led by 78-71 after a 3-pointer by Childs with just
over 7 minutes left in the game. But the Bucks were not ready to
buckle just yet. In a game of catch, the Bucks (11-5) kept pace
with the Knicks and then tied them at 82-82 when Robinson uncorked
a 3-pointer in front of a late-arriving Sprewell with two minutes
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Childs hit two free throws with 1 minute 24 seconds left to give
the Knicks back the lead, 84-82. That effort was topped when
Sprewell popped up for an 18-foot jumper over Ray Allen to put the
Knicks ahead, 86-82, with 54 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, in the second year of his four-year, $68 million
contract, had been remarkably healthy until last season. He has
played with tendinitis in both knees for years, but at 36, he has
shown some signs of wear.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was working himself back into shape after losing
precious workout time due to his leadership during the pro
basketball lockout, Ewing has had a couple of nagging injuries. He
had a sprained right knee in the preseason, and then injured his
Achilles' tendon against Cleveland last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby, Sprewell and Ewing's insurance man, Chris Dudley,
were pressed into heavy minutes last night. Dudley, who was signed
to a 4-year, $28 million deal before the season as a safety net for
Ewing, can rebound and defend the post but is an offensive
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Camby can play center, but can be tentative around the basket
and is not an assertive force on the defensive boards.

`NOODLES' HAS HIT REBOUNDING STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To fans and foes, he's freshman forward JaRon
Rush. To UCLA coaches and teammates, he's Noodles _ a nickname
given him by guard Baron Davis to describe Rush's dancing technique
and his limber physique.
</P>
<P>
   Sleek and slender, Rush uses his frame to slither through the
lane and establish rebounding position against bigger, stronger
opponents in the low post. He is UCLA's top rebounder (7.1 per
game) and has six double-figure rebounding games. No one else has
more than three.
</P>
<P>
   Rush credits quickness and positioning for his success: he was
taught years ago that most errant shots carom long, so he creates
space for himself opposite the shooter's side of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Davis credits instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Dennis Rodman,'' Davis said. ``He has a knack for
knowing where the ball is. He's a baby Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush played center in high school but never expected this
success, especially in his first season. He figured to grab two or
three rebounds per game and help the big men, Dan Gadzuric and
Jerome Moiso. His approach changed when he returned from Christmas
break a few days late because of homesickness, and guard Earl
Watson, his closest friend, was waiting with a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had seen DePaul freshman Quentin Richardson corral at
least 10 rebounds in several December games, and he dared Rush to
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do what he's doing,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   He almost did, grabbing 32 rebounds in the next three games.
Suddenly, Noodles was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he is,'' Davis said. ``He's a noodle.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad seed: The No. 5-seeded Bruins must overcome Detroit and
their own tournament history Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NCAA field expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the Bruins
have been a No. 1 or 2 seed three times (1992, 1995, 1997) and
always advanced to the regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   However, of the eight times they have been lower than a No.2
seed, they've survived the first weekend only twice: in 1990, when
they upset Kansas, and last year, when they surprised Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have lost in the first round three times in the 1990s
_ twice as a No. 4 seed (Penn State, Princeton) and once as a No.5
seed (Tulsa).
</P>
<P>
   Over the wall: Watson endured a mid-February stretch in which he
averaged 8.8 points, made 11 of 31 shots and committed 17 turnovers
in four games. The trainers offered some advice: Take a load off _
and in the last three games, Watson has scored 57 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hit the wall in the Bay Area,'' he said of the Feb.
11-13 road trip. ``The trainers told me to take a day off and have
less contact work when I practice, and that's helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everything's easier. It's just coming to me. Since I got
my health back, I'm more patient.''

DEVILS EDGE JAGR BY ONE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Credit Coach Robbie Ftorek for the success of the
Devils this season, and credit his decision to form a line of Jason
Arnott centering for the two young wings from the Czech Republic,
Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora has particularly established himself as a top player for
the Devils. After drifting between the minor leagues and the Devils
for the last three seasons, the 22-year-old right wing is anchoring
the Devils' attack, leading the team in scoring with 55 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora and Arnott had a goal and an assist each Tuesday night in
leading the Devils to a 3-2 triumph over the Penguins, whose two
goals were scored by Jaromir Jagr. Elias also had an assist, giving
the line 44 points in their last 11 games for the Devils, who
improved to 36-21-8 overall and 22-8-2 away from New Jersey, the
best road record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora has been the most consistent member of the line. His
points Tuesday night marked the 18th time that he had multiple
points in a game, leading the team in that category. This was also
the sixth consecutive game in which he registered at least a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really starting to blossom,'' Ftorek said earlier this
week about Sykora, who has 23 goals and 32 assists and leads the
Devils in both categories. ``He's played well offensively and
defensively, and he has played physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek's last remark merits more attention because Sykora had
problems withstanding physical play in his first two seasons.
Although he has been targeted by some teams this season, he has
absorbed some crunching hits without serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people try to hit me,'' Sykora said, ``but for me the
best way to take revenge is get points against them. I was very
happy tonight because we played against their best line.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the line with Jagr, who is the league's leading scorer.
Jagr could have had one or two more goals in the third period were
it not for Martin Brodeur, who made 21 saves to earn his 30th
victory (30-18-8).
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur became only the sixth goaltender in the history of the
league to record 30 or more victories in at least four consecutive
seasons. Brodeur accomplished the feat in his ninth consecutive
start and 14th in the last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered to be with those big names,'' Brodeur said,
referring to goaltenders such as Terry Sawchuk and Ken Dryden.
``I'm happy to get it. I didn't know about it until this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's only blemishes Tuesday night were Jagr's 30th and 31st
goals, marking the eighth consecutive season he has scored at last
30 goals. His first goal came from the low slot after a pass from
behind the goal by Robert Lang, 10 minutes 13 seconds into the
game. His second came with 2:59 left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the Devils scored all their goals, all in the late
stages of the first period. Brendan Morrison scored his 10th of the
season with 4:07 left in the period and Sykora got his 23rd with a
blast from the outer perimeter of the left circle 33 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott extended the lead to 3-1 with his 20th goal with 31.1
seconds left in the session, and Brodeur took it from there.

STATE COMPTROLLER URGES COUNTY TO OVERHAUL PROPERTY TAXES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ For the first time, New York's state comptroller
has called for the complete overhaul of Nassau County's archaic
property tax system, which the federal government says
discriminates against black and Hispanic homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the system is not fair, and all of Nassau County's
residents are paying the price,'' the state Comptroller, H. Carl
McCall, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a Democrat, who has been critical of the assessment
system since 1994, said he had repeatedly urged the
Republican-controlled government of Nassau County to update the
system. But after reading a Justice Department report that said
black and Hispanic homeowners were assessed at higher rates than
white homeowners, he said, he decided that a completely new system
was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it discriminatory,'' he said of Nassau's property
tax, ``but inequities within the system are costing the county
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nassau's property tax system has generated a large number of
lawsuits from taxpayers who have successfully argued that their
property was overassessed. And to pay claims in these judgments,
the financially strapped county has had to issue more debt in what
has become a never ending downward spiral, said McCall.
</P>
<P>
   That debt now totals $818 million, fully 45 percent of the
county's total outstanding debt of $1.8 billion, according to a
recent state review of Nassau's finances by the state comptroller.
While nearly 85 percent of the total debt is due to judgments for
overassessed commercial properties, the judgments for homeowners
add at least $100 million a year to the debt.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has been required by state law to issue regular reports
on Nassau County's finances since 1994, after the county issued
debt to end a 1992 general fund deficit of $65 million. With the
county again experiencing fiscal difficulties _ a projected deficit
of $150 million for 1998 and at least $100 million for 1999 _
McCall has urged a review of its assessment practices, which are
based on 1938 construction costs and 1964 land values.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Vieser, a spokesman for Nassau County Executive Thomas S.
Gulotta, said the county executive had no immediate comment on
calls for the system's reform. But he said Gulotta was now working
on a plan aimed at reducing the debt and meeting other concerns
raised earlier by McCall.
</P>
<P>
   He said the county executive would be announcing the details of
the plan soon, perhaps as early as next week. Gulotta, who has held
the line on taxes to stay in office, has not proposed new taxes
since 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gulotta also declined to comment on a ruling on Monday by a
state judge rejecting a move by the county to dismiss a suit by six
Nassau property owners challenging the county's tax assessment
system as racially discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Fredrich, the lawyer who handled the case for the
county, said the county hadn't decided yet whether to appeal or go
to trial, but added that it would rely on past court rulings that
upheld the county assessment system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, there were challenges that claimed that the
county assessed at different rates in different areas, creating
inequities, but the county proved the differences were
insignificant and that all areas were assessed under the same
methodology,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's decision added weight to the Justice Department
charges. U.S. Attorney Zachary W. Carter sent a letter to Gulotta
last week stating that a government investigation ``revealed that
owners of residential property in predominantly minority areas
unfairly pay millions of dollars more in county property taxes than
they would pay if property were assessed on a nondiscriminatory
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the government would delay filing a suit if the
county made an effort to settle the matter through negotiation.
Gulotta, in a letter to Carter, rejected the government's view,
and, like Ms. Fredrich, insisted that the county's tax assessment
system was fair and that its constitutionality had been upheld in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawyers noted, however, that all past court rulings were
not in favor of the county. For example, 10 years ago, a state
Supreme Court justice, Leo McGinity, found that the assessment
system was irrational, inequitable and illegal, and he ordered the
county to reassess. While McGinity's ruling was overturned in 1994,
the case never addressed the question of racial or ethnic
inequities.
</P>
<P>
   McGinity's decision also encouraged a study of the assessment
process by the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee. Phoebe Goodman,
executive director of the private panel, said it would cost between
$30 million and $40 million for the county to reassess. She said
that under state law, part of the cost would be absorbed by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled Tuesday that the study determined that close to
half of the county's residential property owners would see an
overall tax decrease, while a quarter of all owners would see an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman said the committee concluded that the most equitable
way to assess property was at full market value and recommended
that reassessments be made often and on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said last week's ruling and the action taken by the
Justice Department against the county added credence to what he has
been telling county leaders for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the convergence of these two events will bring
about a complete overhaul of this unfair assessment process,'' he
said.

PAVANO NO LONGER FEELS LIKE MARKED MAN
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-EXPOS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ It happens so often now that Carl Pavano
minds only when it's a family member who introduces him as the man
who gave up Mark McGwire's 70th home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not mom or dad,'' Pavano said with a laugh here after
facing his former team, the Red Sox, in Montreal's 6-5, 10-inning
exhibition win Tuesday at City of Palms Park. ``But it's been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up to me and say, `Oh, so you're the guy who gave
up the home run to McGwire.' Maybe I should just tattoo it on my
forehead. No name. Just the number 70.''
</P>
<P>
   The words are delivered without rancor and seasoned with humor.
Maybe it's because he understands that history permits no do-overs,
but Pavano has come to terms with a moment that at first gripped
him with shame.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano, in his only relief appearance of the 1998 season,
delivered the fastball that McGwire launched into legend last Sept.
27 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was the end of the world,'' he said.
``I flew home after the game ashamed of it.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months earlier, he had done a TV interview in which
he said he never would want to be the pitcher watching the ball
going over the fence. ``And that's exactly what happened,'' he
said. ``I'd turn on the TV, and there I was, watching it go over.''
</P>
<P>
   But once he was safely back in Southington, Conn., Pavano
stepped back and developed a different take on the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on,'' he said, ``I realized this was not
something that was going to hinder my career. It wasn't something
that was going to help it, but it wasn't going to hurt it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of history, part of the game. Every year, something
has happened to me. In '97, I was traded for Pedro Martinez. In
'98, the 70th home run. This year, I don't know what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As a native New Englander, he knows how a single play affected
Bill Buckner. This, he said, wasn't Mookie Wilson's ground ball
dribbling between Buckner's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``For Buckner, that kind of ruined his
career. Hopefully, I have a lot of years left.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no reason to believe otherwise. This winter, Pavano
bought a house in Palm Beach Gardens, close to the Expos' training
facility in Jupiter, worked out religiously, and has avoided the
kind of arm ailments that traditionally plague him during camp.
After a debut season in which he went 6-9 with a 4.21 ERA for the
Expos, Pavano could come out of camp as Montreal's No. 2 starter,
behind 14-game winner Dustin Hermanson.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching against the Red Sox Tuesday could not compare to the
first time he took the mound in Fenway Park last July, when the Sox
rocked him for six runs on eight hits and drove him from the mound
in the fifth inning of a 15-0 loss. Pavano gave up a long home run
to Mike Stanley in his three innings of work, but he was satisfied
with his outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just spring training,'' he said. ``You just go out and
do what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavano said he never had trouble accepting being traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that was a no-brainer,'' he said. ``You're going to
trade a guy with no major league experience for a guy who won the
Cy Young Award.''
</P>
<P>
   And he harbors no ill feelings toward the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't thank the organization enough,'' he said. ``They gave
me all the opportunities in the world. I was 20 years old and I was
in Double A, 21 and in Triple A. A lot of my success I owe to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an adjustment. New manager, new pitching coach,
new teammates, and old friends now on the other side of the
Canadian border. The transition took time. It helped, he said, to
read the good things Martinez said about him even after he was lit
up by the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to hear those things from a fellow competitor,''
he said. ``He's a first-class guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos share their training complex with the Cardinals, but
the clubhouses are so far apart that Pavano has yet to encounter
McGwire. He's thought about asking McGwire to sign a few things for
him, especially a T-shirt they're selling in the stadium souvenir
shop on which both players are featured.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has sent word through the Expos' clubhouse man that
he'll sign whatever Pavano asks him to sign.
</P>
<P>
   But a word to fans: Don't ask Pavano to sign a photo of McGwire.
A picture of the two of them together, OK. But he says it would be
as ludicrous for him to sign a photo of McGwire as it would for the
home run king to sign a photo of the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're ever introduced,'' he said, ``I wouldn't be
embarrassed. I'd say hi.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavano laughed. ``I don't think he'd go, `Oh, so you're Carl
Pavano.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than exchanging pleasantries, Pavano said he is looking
forward to standing on the mound when McGwire steps into the
batter's box. The last time, Expos manager Felipe Alou had told his
pitchers to challenge Big Mac.

   ``He said he wasn't going to mess with fate,'' Pavano said.
``There were 52,000 people yelling and screaming. It was a big
carnival. Every time a pitcher threw a ball, there were boos.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will happen the next time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it all the time,'' he said. ``I visualize it all
the time. Yesterday, I went to a game and watched him hit, and I
was visualizing how I was going to get him out the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably throw him sliders and changeups.''

KARL UNABLE TO BURY BITTERNESS WITH WEALTH, POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ He talks endlessly about being liberated. Then,
George Karl wants badly to show you why he feels this way most
days.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with a 10-minute drive along the city's lakefront.
Karl has traveled the half-scenic, half-industrial route to the
Milwaukee Bucks practice facility in his red Ford Expedition a
hundred times already.
</P>
<P>
   However, you get the impression that every trip reinforces his
appreciation for a new quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get in your boat and sail to Chicago or Detroit,''
says Karl, pointing toward Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   These are fine times for Karl. The winningest coach in Sonics
franchise history is in his first season as coach of the Bucks.
That life is good is most noticeable when Karl steps into his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Karl's coaching existence wallowed in disarray.
But the only mess present on this day are papers scattered about
his wooden desk _ on which sits the same Sonics-logo-bearing name
plate he used in Seattle _ and moving boxes misplaced throughout
the room.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, Karl says he finally has peace of mind. That goes
well with a four-year, $20 million contract, a young team with
playoff hopes, and bosses that respect his desire for personnel
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more futile arguments with Sonics president Wally
Walker. No more worries about contract status. No more feeling of
disrespect. Everything is basketball, and in Karl, the Bucks
completely trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I've coached more in 15 games than I've coached in 50 in
Seattle. I'm coaching like I'm in the playoffs every night. It's
uplifting. It's invigorating,'' Karl said. ``I actually talk to my
owner (Sen. Herb Kohl) often. It's tedious but I like that. There's
a togetherness here.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what I take out of Seattle is a tradition of excellence
that we built. Now it's like, can we re-identify that in another
place? Can we have some tradition and a championship? It gets you a
little juiced.''
</P>
<P>
   Juice turns to bittersweet Wednesday night when Karl and his
Bucks face his former team for the first time. While Karl says he
is content, a large part of him still wishes the Seattle franchise
could have gratified him more.
</P>
<P>
   But Karl said that became increasingly impossible as his
relationship with Walker rapidly deteriorated the past two seasons.
Still bitter about the split, Karl remains dumbfounded 10 months
after the Sonics let his contract expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally totally discontinued the communication,'' Karl said.
``He said it's because I talked too much. I say it's because he's
incompetent. You could say (his reason for firing me) was an attack
of character and you could say it was laughable because the league
was laughing about it. There were very few things negative about
Seattle outside of Wally. I believe in doing the right things and I
don't think he does. He's a politician. He's a trickster. And
that's opposite of how I handle my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Karl, at 47, hasn't changed one bit.
</P>
<P>
   He still is the same fiery coach who kept Seattle's ear bent
with his candidness. And Seattle, it seems, is never far away; his
wife and two children still live in their Eastside home.
</P>
<P>
   The team picture hanging on the wall in his office is not of the
Bucks, but the 1992-93 Sonics. ``The best team I ever had,'' Karl
said. He even owns a brick from Safeco Field with his name and
``Respect the game'' inscribed on it.
</P>
<P>
   Karl doesn't own a home in Milwaukee. He lives in a hotel suite
three blocks from the Bradley Center where the Bucks play.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Karl's coaching enthusiasm has been sparked by the
opportunity to turn Milwaukee around. After eight losing seasons,
Karl has his team positioned to earn a playoff berth for the first
time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the team being new and the city being new, it's
refreshed George,'' said Bucks assistant coach Terry Stotts, who
was Karl's top assistant in Seattle. ``There's always pressure in
coaching. The challenges here are obviously different than in
Seattle. But you see a bounce in his step. The freshness carries
over in a lot of aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics arrive, they will immediately sense Karl's
influence on the Bucks. His picture graces the team's media guide,
magnet calendars and billboards around the city. He demands that
his players run around the court, trapping and pressing on defense.
He has imparted the same winning attitude in Milwaukee that he did
upon arriving in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great fit because when you see him, he's not straight
across the board,'' Bucks guard Ray Allen said. ``He doesn't have
to conform. He does things his way. I think that's important. He's
come in here and he's made it our program, our franchise. He allows
us to do it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also the type of person who will humble you. He's like,
`So what, you're talented? You still have to work hard.' And that's
been good. You need that to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, Karl doesn't have the superstar point guard that
he had in Gary Payton, or veteran leadership up and down the
roster. Karl is getting used to players with a much lower threshold
for pain, and he's had to rid the team of a few bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   There are internal conflicts. Free-agent-to-be point guard
Terrell Brandon won't commit to the team. Forward Tyrone Hill wants
to be traded if Brandon goes. Karl is already resigned to the fact
it will take a couple of years to mold the Bucks into a consistent
winner.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Karl is getting the most out of his players,
just as he did with the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's intense,'' Bucks forward Glenn Robinson said. ``He likes
to win, and he knows how to get his players fired up and get us
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Two nights ago, the Bucks trailed the Chicago Bulls by 15 points
in the first half. Milwaukee trailed the entire game until the
fourth quarter. Karl detonated, trimmed his rotation to seven
players and called upon his ``attitude team.'' The Bucks turned up
the heat defensively, stifled the Bulls down the stretch and won
the game, 81-76.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very successful because of my energy every day, my passion
every day,'' Karl said. ``There's daily leadership and direction
here. It's harder now, but it's a good challenge. In Seattle, we
were on cruise control.''
</P>
<P>
   That was on the court. Off the court is where Karl often
experienced bumpy rides.
</P>
<P>
   Everything isn't smooth in Milwaukee, but it's close enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days I'm scared,'' Karl said. ``The strangest thing
about it is I don't know my team like I knew my team in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Karl believes coaching against his former players
will be fun. He's kept one eye on the Sonics' transition while
going through his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know their personality. I know when to double-team. I know
who to put on Gary if it's a fourth-quarter game,'' Karl said. ``We
present some problems to them. We've got some (players) who give us
an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no, I'm not happy when they (the Sonics) lose. I wish the
players could win and Wally lose. But I don't think that can
happen. The game itself is going to be 90-percent positive. Seeing
Wally sitting over there ... the game should be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of memories in Seattle. I love it here and I'm
enjoying the change. But Seattle will always be in my life.''

By NANCY L. MARRAPESE 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coach had started to get a little anxious about his top
goaltender. Byron Dafoe at times had shown a tendency to wander a
little too far, to take a few too many chances, to put himself in
danger during games.
</P>
<P>
   So several days ago, Pat Burns took Dafoe aside, telling him to
wait that extra second, to make the opposing players come to him
instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of that powwow at practice and partly because of
some flat-out remarkable saves, Dafoe earned his 14th career
shutout and seventh of the season Tuesday night in a 2-0 win over
the Florida Panthers at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Bruins into sole possession of the eighth
and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, 2 points ahead of
the Rangers and 3 ahead of the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tendency at times, especially when we as a team are
struggling, to try to do too much,'' said Dafoe. ``I force the
shooter, I dive out at pucks that I shouldn't. Pat talked to me
about that last week a little bit. He told me I'm quick enough to
just sit back and wait for them to make the first move.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe had 19 saves for win No. 22. The game-saver came with
Boston clinging to a 1-0 lead in the third period. At 9:14, with
Florida at the tail end of a power play, Ray Whitney fired a shot
from the right circle that Dafoe kicked out with his right pad.
Defenseman Robert Svehla swooped in for the rebound and tried a
shot from the slot. Dafoe dived across the crease from right to
left and threw out his stick in time to block Svehla's shot that
was earmarked for a spot inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a rebound I kicked out, and all I could do really
was fall back and put my stick on the ice,'' said Dafoe. ``He had
the whole net and obviously he was pressured and he just shot it on
the ice and it hit my stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ray Bourque gave the Bruins the only goal they would
need at 9:45 of the second period, scoring on the power play. Jason
Allison drew the penalty _ a holding call on defenseman Paul Laus _
and assisted on the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Khristich, who had a pair of assists, set up Bourque by
skating the puck into the far left circle and pulling up along the
boards. He caught Bourque coming down the slot and fired a quick
pass over. It was Bourque's seventh goal of the season, one of his
five shots in the period. It was the 150th power-play goal of
Bourque's 20-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after killing off a two-man disadvantage for 31 seconds
midway through the third, the Bruins got an insurance goal.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich took a shot from the slot that caromed off the right
pad of goalie Sean Burke and over to Allison at the left post.
Allison tried to get his stick on the puck but it ricocheted off
his right skate and into the net at 11:38.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Boston skaters _ Landon Wilson (who left with what was
reported as a mild concussion at 3:05 of the second) and Ken
Belanger (who had just 3:32 of ice time) _ did not land a shot on
Burke (39 saves).
</P>
<P>
   It was a dominant performance by the Bruins and another
star-making performance by Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe a lot of that to the guys in front of me,'' the goalie
said. ``I'm thankful to Pat Burns for giving me the opportunity and
I'm thankful for the guys in front of me who play a system that is
great for goaltenders.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't savor this one for long. The Bruins face the Rangers
and Sabres in back-to-back road games Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play .500 from now until the end of the year, it will
give us about 83 points or so,'' said Burns. ``That won't be
enough. We're going to have to play more than just .500 hockey.
It's going to be tough.''

 OFF THE COURT, MacCULLOCH SHOOTS FOR THRILLS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the basketball court, Todd MacCulloch goes with the
percentages. His repertoire consists of layups, put-backs and
tip-ins along with occasional bank shots and jump hooks. All, of
course, are taken within five feet of the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   It is fundamental and effective, but boring. It will be on
display again Friday night when the Huskies play Miami of Ohio in a
Midwest Region first-round NCAA tournament game at the New Orleans
Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   Matching his game, MacCulloch plays without much expression,
plodding about, seemingly indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   You can picture Donald Watts or Thalo Green with lampshades on
their heads in New Orleans this week, sampling the night life and
cutting loose.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch? Someone who won't even take a 10-footer getting
crazy? Well, here's a news flash. To those who know him, MacCulloch
is a risk-taking, thrill-seeking wild man.
</P>
<P>
   How many of his teammates have launched themselves from the top
of the West Edmonton Mall on a bungee cord? How many have
parachuted over the Manitoba prairie after hanging onto the strut
for dear life before being coaxed to let go? And who else has the
courage to jump off a cliff into a lake in British Columbia,
jeopardizing his future for a little fun in the present?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not on a death wish or anything, but I made up a list,''
he said. ``I don't have too many things left on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   He always wanted to parasail over the Mediterranean, so he paid
$30 to do that in Nice.
</P>
<P>
   That was as conservative as his buzz cut. The other stuff was
outrageous. His best friend, Jeff Krahn, watched MacCulloch climb
some rocks near Invermere, B.C., last summer. It was a serene spot
until 7 feet and 280 pounds hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a pretty good splash going,'' Krahn said. ``I was
looking at him, thinking: `NBA career.' And there he is standing on
the top of a rock somewhere about to jump. `Is this something he
should be doing?' The rest of us are going nowhere so it really
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Krahn also parachuted with MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't jump the way the rest of us did,'' Krahn said,
alluding to MacCulloch's size. ``He had to hang behind the blade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Superman hanging on the strut,'' MacCulloch said.
``I let go and a couple of seconds later, the chute fully opened. I
thought, `Well, I'm alive.' It was pure peacefulness. The prairie
looked like perfect squares on a quilt.''
</P>
<P>
   The bungee jump at the Edmonton Mall was just as exhilarating.
MacCulloch paid $60 to be thrown down toward a wave pool with his
choice of music from Canadian rockers Our Lady Piece wailing in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm so tall, there were some beams, and I had to watch
my head,'' he said. ``They told me to jump out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial jump was fun, but after that you got jerked
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Picturing MacCulloch doing any of the above is difficult given
his basketball personality. But when you talk about MacCulloch,
there are misperceptions and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   NBA scouts love his size and touch. Everyone talks about his
great hands, which he partially developed by juggling as a
youngster. His fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Matas, was a master juggler
who taught his students during the noon hour.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch went on to win a provincial ``joggling'' contest, a
competition combining running around cones in a gym while juggling.
The skills that he learned from juggling might turn him into a
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd's name consistently comes up in the top 30 names,'' said
Billy McKinney, Sonics executive vice president of basketball
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But then you'll hear something about his lack of passion.
``Barring injury, he could have a 12-year career if he wants it,''
said Jay Hillock, Vancouver Grizzlies director of scouting. ``He's
got the foreign mentality of seeing it (basketball) more as
recreational.''
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, it was. MacCulloch wants a pro career now. Coach Bob
Bender said the unseen passion is evident to him.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch remains laid-back only when he's elsewhere, when a
fishing rod is in his hands instead of a basketball. Growing up in
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, MacCulloch loves the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets uptight, MacCulloch imagines being at Red Deer Lake
on a summer day, water skiing at dawn, returning to a
bacon-and-eggs breakfast. His mom and aunt would pick blueberries
and whip up pancakes for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch has a watercolor painting that shows him paddling his
canoe by the boathouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see anyone,'' he said. ``There's no running water,
no electricity, just a bed, kitchen, couch, coffee table and
cupboard space. In tough times, I picture myself there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the passion is ever missing, compassion is not. MacCulloch
wants to help people. His major is an unusual one for an athlete _
speech and hearing science. If the NBA does not work out, he could
become a speech pathologist, helping others communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a very, very sensitive youngster,'' said Lois
MacCulloch, Todd's mom. ``He shows great concern for other people's
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   It extends to animals. MacCulloch releases the fish that he
catches. Growing up, he was close to his dog, a Yorkshire Terrier
named Chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   On one winter night in Edmonton when the temperature dropped to
40 below, MacCulloch took his dog for a walk. Chainsaw went up to a
metal light standard and licked it. His tongue got stuck to the
frozen pole.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch blew on the pole. He rubbed his mitts together. He
did everything he could to warm it up and loosen the grip. Finally,
Chainsaw was freed, but MacCulloch was shaken, returning home in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Now he will laugh about the incident, saying Chainsaw ``didn't
have taste buds for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes will continue, but the college career is about to end
for MacCulloch. Nothing will change, however. His size 19s are
where they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``His value system is where it needs to be,'' his mom said.
``He's managed to keep his feet firmly on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, anyway.

GARNETT SLAMS HOME POINT: SONICS REELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They used to strut. They used to swagger. The
Sonics used to never lose more than three games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But after Tuesday night's 85-84 loss to the Minnesota
Timberwolves, it has become clear the Sonics are a team losing more
than games.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, they have lost their edge.
</P>
<P>
   Once a dominant force in the Western Conference, the Sonics
suddenly look no better than average. If four straight losses,
including two straight to the Timberwolves, doesn't indicate an
unthinkable dropoff, the standings do.
</P>
<P>
   Once 6-0, the Sonics fell to 9-8 and are off to their worst
start since the 1990-91 season. The last time they dropped four
straight regular-season games was the 1991-92 season.
</P>
<P>
   The team that ruled the Pacific Division with four titles in the
past five years is suddenly in fourth place. Even worse, they are
eighth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday marked the second time in four games the Sonics lost
on the final possession. They know the questions well, and it is
getting tougher and tougher for the Sonics to find the right
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think things are that dire,'' Sonics coach Paul
Westphal said. ``But obviously we need to put wins together.''
</P>
<P>
   Astounding to all, the Paul Westphal era is stuck in
mediorcrity. The good news is there are 33 games remaining for the
Sonics to snap back to form. The bad news is the timing of their
skid.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight they're in Milwaukee for a game against former coach
George Karl and his 11-6 Bucks. However, proving something to Karl
is the least of the Sonics' worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has mentioned George,'' Sonics guard Hersey Hawkins
said. ``The reporters bring up George more than we do. We're
concerned about getting out of this skid. Four (losses) in a row is
unheard of. It's getting tough for the coaching staff and the guys
who've been here. You're used to winning and all of a sudden you're
9-8. You kind of wonder what the heck is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is plagued by the same ills that were evident from Day
One. The offense is out of sync, and forward Vin Baker is nowhere
near the player he was a year ago. For the second straight game,
Baker took just six shots.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with six points, again crippling the Sonics with
virtually no inside presence. Baker has been bothered by
inneffective play all season and didn't bother to talk to reporters
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin's not doing what he's supposed to be doing,'' reserve Dale
Ellis said. ``Once he comes to play basketball, we'll be a better
team. We're better than this. Once we get a few guys playing up to
their potential on a consistent basis, we'll win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting 41 percent from the field, the Sonics still had
a chance to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 81-75 with 2:27 to play, Ellis hit back-to-back
3-pointers to tie the score. Hawkins eventually sank a wide-open
3-pointer to put the Sonics ahead 84-83 with 27.6 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota quickly went back in front and stayed there.
Stephon Marbury handled the ball at the top of the key with Gary
Payton guarding him. But the Wolves' Kevin Garnett screened off
Payton, which caused Baker to switch out and defend Marbury, who
blew right to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's layup fell off, but Garnett followed with a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had a chance to score the game-winner on the final
possession. But the Timberwolves double-teamed Payton, forcing him
to make a pass to Billy Owens that was muffed out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got what we wanted,'' Westphal said. ``We wanted to get
Gary in the post and let him operate. ... From what I saw, it
looked like they hammered Billy and Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton finished with 10 assists and 10 points. But he was just 4
of 16 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a good job of executing and playing together to get
back in the ballgame,'' said Detlef Schrempf, who led the team with
18 points off the bench. ``But we seem to find a way to lose. I
can't remember being 9-8. I don't think I've been that since

CELTICS HIT A LOW POINT
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-HORNETS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By PETER MAY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ He's been around for a while. He has a Rookie
of the Year trophy and he's matched threes with Larry Bird in the
heat of the playoffs. Chuck Person may not be headed to Springfield
soon, but he thinks he knows the game of basketball a little.
</P>
<P>
   What he saw Tuesday night wasn't right. He said so himself.
</P>
<P>
   And he was on the winning side.
</P>
<P>
   Person was one of seven Hornets in double figures as
injury-marred Charlotte, dressing only nine players, mugged the
Celtics, 105-87, before an announced gathering of 18,342 at the
Coliseum. (They count appendages here.) Boston shot poorly (41
percent) and played uninspiring basketball from start to finish,
and what looked to be a sure road kill given Charlotte's state of
chaos and depleted roster instead turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Person had one theory: The Celtics rely far too much on Antoine
Walker, who led them with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killer for them was that Antoine Walker,'' Person said.
``He had a bad 32. A very bad 32. I don't think that's good
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Person then said, as an aside, that he doesn't like to trash
other players, but he couldn't stop himself. He said a lot of the
same things about Keith Van Horn last week, when the Hornets beat
the Nets. He said one player should not get all the touches because
it can tune out the others, who want theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust each other, that's the key,'' he said. ``How
can you have that much talent and not share it? One guy is getting
all the touches on that team and that's not the way it should be.
When one guy gets all the touches, it's tough on the other guys.
You gotta play together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics definitely are not doing that now. Rick Pitino said,
``I don't think we have great chemistry,'' and added that he was
disappointed with the effort. That's a mild understatement. If the
team thought it had bottomed out in Toronto _ and it graded the
lowest of the year in that game _ this one was exponentially worse,
given the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte already was without Glen Rice and Anthony Mason.
Derrick Coleman also missed the game with a foot injury. Then, just
before game time, Bobby Phills was scratched with a possible stress
fracture. Charlotte still won handily, with J.R. Reid (26 points,
12 rebounds) leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets led at every checkpoint and pulled away in the
second half, outscoring the Celtics by 15 points. Paul Pierce
sprained his right ankle, Ron Mercer got cramps in his hamstrings,
and Kenny Anderson pronounced himself ``totally frustrated'' by the
proceedings. It was not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played really frustrated,'' said ex-Celtic David Wesley.
``And they didn't look real fresh out there. But the frustration is
what came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson agreed. He and Wesley have been rivals for years, ever
since they were on the Nets. There's not a lot of love lost between
them _ they even exchanged words Tuesday night _ but Anderson owned
up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally frustrated now, but I've been in this situation
before,'' Anderson said. ``I gotta play through it, that's all.
Right now, it's very frustrating. I can't really pinpoint what it
is. But I have to keep my head up and play hard. This is what I've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Walker, ``To lose to a team which isn't healthy and has a
lot of turmoil, it's hard to explain. I don't have an answer for
it.'' He said the offense, which stagnated again, was well
designed, ``but when the first option isn't there, we act like it's
the end of the world. We don't go to the second or third option and
that's what separates us from being a good team from being an
average team.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino likened the situation to last year, when the Celtics lost
at Denver and Golden State. But he added that at no time last year
did the team grade out as poorly as it is grading it out now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start losing and play poorly, it can steamroll,'' he
said. ``If you have great character and veterans, you can turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino didn't bother to finish the thought, because he knows
what we know: The Celtics have neither. And if we want to check for
sure, just ask Person. He'll be more than happy to explain it.

HUNGRY M'S EYE DODGERS PITCHING FEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The Mariners have what the Los Angeles Dodgers
need. The Dodgers have what the Mariners need.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone had this to say
about the Mariners as he watched his team in Florida Tuesday:
``That's an organization I think we'd be compatible with.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most teams, the Mariners badly need a starting pitcher. The
Dodgers are one of the few teams that have a starter to give.
Further, the Dodgers' farm system was stripped of many top
prospects in trades for veterans last summer. The Mariners'
minor-league pitching is the organization's biggest source of
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has targeted Los Angeles as one of several teams in
Florida with pitching to give, and has contacted the Dodgers. The
Houston Astros and New York Mets are other clubs with a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers seem to be in the strongest position to deal,
with a starting corps of Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes,
Carlos Perez, Darren Dreifort and Dave Mlicki. Malone said he's
content to wait until later this spring before making a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got six starters, so maybe we could help our bullpen by
keeping all six, or try to build up the farm system (with a
trade),'' he said. ``It's early in spring, but we'll keep a couple
of these guys for a while and let it work itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   With pitching at such a premium around baseball, Malone isn't
sure he wants to give up that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know with pitchers, because so many of them seem to
go down or get hurt,'' he said. ``The worst-case scenario is that
we trade someone and someone else gets hurt. Then we'd be down to
four and looking around ourselves. I don't want to get in that
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tried to acquire a starting pitcher during the
winter, but could not afford a top free agent and had no luck in
trades. After Jeff Fassero and Jamie Moyer, the projected rotation
falls off sharply, with talented but unproven Ken Cloude in the
third spot and an assortment of prospects and veterans competing
for the other two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners vice president of baseball operations Woody Woodward
said he remains committed to holding onto the team's young pitching
unless he gets a young, big league pitcher in return. He said he's
contacted every team about pitching but didn't sound optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're in the market to take on some high-salary player
that may be a risk, it's a tough market to find somebody,''
Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   One eminently available starter is Kansas City's Kevin Appier,
who fits that description. The former All-Star has impressed
several clubs this spring, but he is coming off an injury and makes
$5 million, well out of Seattle's range.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR A LEFTY: Manager Lou Piniella has not been
overwhelmed by any of the left-handed relief candidates in camp,
including Mike Bertotti, Huck Flener, Damaso Marte and Greg
McCarthy, and it seems more and more likely that a left-handed
starting hopeful will have to break camp in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance that (John) Halama or (Butch) Henry will
end up in the bullpen,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry had success as a reliever with the Boston Red Sox in 1997,
but Halama has not relieved at all since Class A ball in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Halama, acquired from Houston in the Randy Johnson deal, will
pitch three or four innings in his start tomorrow against Colorado
in Tucson. Piniella said he wasn't sure he would make that trip,
but decided to go because he didn't want to miss Halama's start.
</P>
<P>
   GAME NOTES: Moyer worked three strong innings in Tuesday's 6-2
win over the San Francisco Giants. The left-hander struck out four
and allowed one run, throwing all of his pitches. He will build to
four innings his next start and five the next. ... Ken Griffey Jr.
went 2-for-3 with a double and his second homer, which cleared the
right-field bullpen. ... Raul Ibanez has hits in his last five
at-bats, and Piniella said he's swinging the bat as well as anyone
in camp. Ibanez credits hitting coach Jesse Barfield with helping
him stay back when he hits. ``It's the first time I've had a
foundation in my whole life,'' said Ibanez, who is out of options
and is bidding for a spot as a reserve outfielder/catcher/first
baseman. ``When I went south, I didn't really have anything to go
back to. He's helped me make tremendous strides.'' ... Second
baseman David Bell continued to impress in the field, turning three
double plays and ranging far to his left to rob Bill Mueller of a
hit in the fifth. ... For the second day in a row, Bobby Ayala
threw a shutout inning, this time striking out the side despite
allowing two hits. ``Everything's going great so far,'' Ayala said.
``I'm happy and satisfied and it's great to be getting the ball.''
... Piniella expects to make five or six cuts after this morning's
``B'' game against San Diego. Cloude starts Wednesday's ``A'' game
against Milwaukee, with Henry to follow.

EVEN IN A FORGOTTEN SEASON, BULLS ARE BETTER THAN NETS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The New Jersey Nets, now known around the National
Basketball Association for being unable to back up their boastful
words, entered the season bragging about how they scared the World
Champion Chicago Bulls in the first round of last season's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being swept like a pile of dust in three games, they
talked of gaining poise and confidence from the series. Coach John
Calipari mentioned repeatedly that the Nets scored more points
against the Bulls than anyone, and unbelievably, Chris Gatling said
the stretch of games taught the team how to win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both clubs are mere shadows of themselves now, the
Bulls because Michael Jordan retired and Scottie Pippen and Dennis
Rodman joined other teams. And the Nets because their combination
of shaky coaching and shoddy play has proved powerless.
</P>
<P>
   But despite being built to lose in order to get a high draft
pick and expensive free agents at season's end, the Bulls somehow
are still superior to the certifiably hapless Nets. With Toni Kukoc
and the aged Ron Harper acting as Jordan and Pippen, Chicago played
steamroller to New Jersey's aluminum can, blowing out their guests
by 103-87 at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc owned the second half, scoring 18 of his game-high 28
points after intermission, and Harper owned the first, scoring 20
of his 25, as the Bulls, who average a league-low 80 points a game,
reached 100 points for the first time this year. Chicago, also the
worst shooting team in the league, made 45.7 percent of its shots
against the Nets' soft defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams led the Nets (3-14) with 23 points and 12
rebounds, while Keith Van Horn added 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, who improved to 5-13, grabbed a 5-point lead at
halftime and increased it to double digits midway through the
fourth quarter. Kukoc opened the lead almost singlehandedly,
hitting long jumpers or driving to draw fouls. He made 13 of 20
shots from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets have been much maligned for their woeful
shooting, it was their defense that did them in in the first half.
Allowing Harper to experience a Jordanesque half, they surrendered
20 points to the 35-year-old guard. Somehow able to blow by and
shoot over Kerry Kittles, Scott Burrell and Kendall Gill, Harper
made 9 of 10 shots before the break. He scored 15 in the first
quarter, when the Bulls shot 58 percent to build a 29-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Harper wasn't the only Bull to play above his head at the
expense of the Nets. Randy Brown, the unheralded point guard who
was a reserve during Chicago's golden years, scored 12, 4 above his
average, in the first half and picked Doug Overton of his dribble
at half court on one play.
</P>
<P>
   With defense at a minimum, the Nets competed by shooting 44
percent over the first two quarters, a low percentage for most but
blazing for New Jersey. Williams, who has of late been roasted by
legitimate centers, took delight in his matchup with Dickey
Simpkins, scoring 10 points and grabbing 6 rebounds before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   In displaying his power during one second-quarter sequence,
Williams grabbed two offensive rebounds and made a putback to give
the Nets a 38-32 lead, their biggest of the game. But with Harper
sinking jump shots, the Bulls began chipping away at the lead and
went ahead by 45-44 when he hit a 12-footer with 3 minutes 33
seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Simpkins became active, scoring on a tip-in and
fastbreak slam off a nice feed from Kukoc that gave the Bulls a
52-47 lead. Kukoc was one of the few Bulls who could not find the
range in the first half, but he made up for it by drawing fouls.
Shooting 1 of 6 from the field, but 8 of 12 from the line, he
scored 10 first-half points to help Chicago take a 54-49 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The halftime score was surprising because, with the Nets and the
Bulls at the tail of the league rankings in field-goal percentage,
the game was billed as the battle of the bricklayers. The Nets,
shooting 39 percent on the season, entered with a 1/100th of a
percent point advantage over the last place Bulls (.389).

BENDER KEEPING COOL DESPITE MARCH HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He is not a ``hot'' coach at this particular moment,
though that could change.
</P>
<P>
   If University of Washington coach Bob Bender gets his Huskies on
another NCAA tournament run this coming weekend in New Orleans, you
never know.
</P>
<P>
   This is the season for hot coaches, every bit as much as it is
the season for Dick Vitale, Digger Phelps and office pools.
</P>
<P>
   Bender knows all about this topic. Last year, thanks to the
Huskies' Sweet 16 appearance, Bender's name was hotter than a bowl
of French Quarter gumbo.
</P>
<P>
   From Virginia to Texas, Bender was the next great savior of
college hoops, or something like that. But after a week or two of
flirtation, Bender decided _ after one bike ride through the Lake
Washington Arboretum _ that he liked it in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching intrigue is all part of March's madness, not that
Bender gets terribly caught up in this game within the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a hot coach. I've been a cold coach. But I think I'm
best described as lukewarm. I'm just lukewarm,'' Bender said, then
flew off to the Big Easy with his team.
</P>
<P>
   Humor is a good quality in basketball coaches, especially those
whose programs demand not only an appearance in the NCAA tourney,
but that you actually go and do something.
</P>
<P>
   Bender may not have that kind of pressure on him, yet. His two
wins and Sweet 16 run last year gives him a nice cushion.
</P>
<P>
   He is really just getting rolling at Washington, where it should
take only a few more seasons of losing recruits to Stanford and
Arizona before Bender has to worry whether he made a mistake by not
taking advantage of his hot status last year.
</P>
<P>
   You can string together all sorts of 18- or 20-win seasons. You
can win your conference championship. You can even have a hand in
developing NBA stars.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, right or wrong: What you do in March is
ultimately what makes or breaks your reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why Bender, a former Duke player and former
assistant to Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski, has called upon his
Duke mentor several times the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got off the phone with him a few minutes ago,'' Bender
said.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of proportion and history and where things fit in helps
during these crazy days of March, even if Coach K is working toward
``coaching god'' status with his 32-1 Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rollie Massimino wins a national championship at Villanova. He
coaches what many say is the perfect game (in 'Nova's 66-64 upset
of Georgetown in the 1985 championship game). But he can't get back
to that and expectations grew and, suddenly, some people start to
question you,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   That is Bender's best example of the trouble March brings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common affliction, which is why Jim Boeheim at Syracuse
has spent years fighting the demons that say his NCAA
``shortcomings'' have blotted his reputation _ even if it was
Derrick Coleman's missed free throws that killed Syracuse during
the 1987 championship game, not Keith Smart's last-second shot for
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Knight, the coach Bender played for during the Hoosiers'
1976 NCAA championship season, has a tough first-round game against
George Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Will Knight win and dampen criticism that his time is past at
Indiana, where first-round busts have made some of the Hoosier
faithful impatient?
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about coach Knight, he isn't worried about the
match-up. He's only worried about Indiana,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   It also is why Jim Calhoun of Connecticut, the No. 1 seed in the
West, heads into his eighth NCAA tournament in the '90s still
looking for UConn's first Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Bender's Huskies were just one Richard Hamilton
buzzer-beater away from being part of Calhoun's NCAA nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make it to the Final Four, I won't be any better of a
coach, and if we don't, I won't be any worse,'' Calhoun said last
week when the touchy subject was broached.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all around the country, Calhoun's bretheren in the
Division I coaching fraternity know that Calhoun is whistling
Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   It does matter. What happens in these next two weeks carries
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Does Jim Harrick, gone in semidisgrace from UCLA and now at
Rhode Island, again prove himself a NCAA stalwart by upsetting
UNC-Charlotte in the first round?
</P>
<P>
   Does Mike Jarvis, in his first season at St. John's, further
embellish his credentials by leading the Red Storm to the Sweet 16
or beyond?
</P>
<P>
   Does ex-Texas coach Tom Penders, now at George Washington, have
his next moment of glory, upsetting Knight and the Hoosiers?
</P>
<P>
   Does Paul Hewitt at little Siena become the next candidate for
Pittsburgh, exactly 10 years after former Siena coach Mike Deane
got hot in the 1989 NCAA tournament, when the Saints upset
Stanford?
</P>
<P>
   March brings answers. March also raises questions. This is why a
well-schooled coach like Bender said he inspected the tournament
brackets. He had to check up on his fraternity mates, guys like
Delaware's Mike Brey, New Mexico State's Lou Henson, former Oregon
coach Jerry Green, and Rick Barnes, who went from Rhode Island to
take the job Bender bowed out of at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's part of our game. It's part of our business,
especially if you have somewhat of a relationship,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys Bender was most interested in was Gonzaga's Dan
Monson, whose Bulldogs are the No. 10 seed in Seattle, going up
against No. 7 Minnesota Thursday at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hot coaches, there is talk that Monson could have
his name in the hopper for coaching jobs in bigger conferences,
especially if Gonzaga (of the West Coast Conference) can get hot
and knock off the Gophers.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, a close friend of Monson, said that so far the two have
not addressed the hot-coach issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dan) did ask about travel parties. He's just getting killed
for requests for tickets and hotels,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the minor hassles and anxieties of March. For
coaches _ be they hot, cold or even lukewarm _ there is a lot more
on the line.

VOSKUHL HAS TO WATCH STEP
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-UCONN-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By JOE BURRIS 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In a couple of weeks the NCAA Tournament will be
complete, and Jake Voskuhl can find a comfortable place to recline
and stay off his left foot for as long as it takes to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the University of Connecticut junior center is like
an automobile trekking along a desolate stretch of road, miles away
from the desired destination, with the ``check engine'' light on.
</P>
<P>
   He must take things slowly, do as much maintenance as possible
and pray for the best until he reaches the end. And Voskuhl plans
to do just that, knowing that this UConn team has arguably the best
chance of any of making it to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I ice three times a day,'' said Voskuhl Tuesday,
minutes after UConn's first practice since arriving in Denver
Monday night for Thursday's West Regional first-round game against
Texas-San Antonio. Battling a recurring stress reaction in his
foot, he played a total of 30 minutes in the Huskies' final two Big
East tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ice when I wake up, before practice and after practice,''
said Voskuhl. ``I also have two bone stimulators that I use, one
for 20 minutes, twice a day. The other one I keep on for 8-10 hours
a day. Whenever I'm not doing anything I just wrap it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl said he expects to play and be effective during the
Tournament, and whether he's correct might determine how far the
Huskies go. His presence is invaluable: Though he averages just 5.9
points a game, Voskuhl is second in rebounding, is one of the
team's best defenders, and he forces opponents to respect UConn's
interior.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl missed both Syracuse games because of his foot injury;
the latter contest was the Huskies' season finale. Yet he came back
in the Big East tournament and played steadily. Meanwhile, his foot
_ which once bothered him so much in high school he required a
wheelchair to get around until it healed _ has been progressing
steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good, really good,'' he said. ``Coach (Jim Calhoun) has
been with me 100 percent through this. There are certain drills in
practice I don't do. I think it's important up here for me to
practice, because I have to start getting my wind back.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun Tuesday limited Voskuhl to one hour of the
1-hour-40-minute practice session. ``We'll push him a little more
in practice but pull him out, hopefully, at the appropriate times
so he won't have three days of straight practices,'' said Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun expects Voskuhl to play about 20 minutes a game. The
center played 21 minutes in the Huskies' first-round game against
Seton Hall in the Big East tournament. He has not played 25 minutes
of a game since Feb. 13 at Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to do is make sure he doesn't have pain, as opposed
to, `When you have pain you tell me,' said Calhoun. ``On the MRI
that was done 12 days ago, he actually had healing going on, which
is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he really gets it sore, he can't play, because the pain
is too much and he's limping. When he gets sore, he makes the coach
look bad because he's limping and people say, `That (expletive),
he's worse than we thought he was; he's playing that kid.' But
structurally we see nothing but improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl said he will play through as much pain as he can stand
during the NCAA Tournament. He said there are signs that tell him
he is in for a struggle, adding sometimes he can't run as fast or
jump as high. ``But it's almost healed up, so I'm just working on
it every single day,'' he said. ``All the things humanly possible
that can be done, we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely Calhoun had Voskuhl in mind when he decided to come to
Denver Monday night to get his players acclimated to the high
altitude. He said the team will spend the days leading up to the
game working on sprinting and added he will rotate more players in
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said the same approach worked in 1995, when UConn played
in the first round in Salt Lake City, beating Tennessee-Chattanooga
in the first round and Cincinnati in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those games, we made a conscious effort to try to get
people in early, so in the last 10 to 12 minutes we had people in
who were fresher,'' said Calhoun. ``We took it as a factor to deal
with. Is it a major factor? Well, when you're talking about 19, 20
year olds, probably not. But if it it causes one of your real good
players to not be able to play 28 minutes, but 22 minutes, then
it's a factor.''

COMMENTARY: DISMEMBERING RJR NABISCO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's over. A decade after RJR Nabisco was bought in the largest
leveraged buyout in history, the company is being sliced into three
pieces. It is a sad saga for almost all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is what happens when you really overpay for a
company, and the debt levels are just too high,'' said Stephen F.
Goldstone, who will be the last person to hold the job of chairman
and chief executive of RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   When all is finished, the only real winners will be those who
cashed out in 1989 _ primarily the shareholders who sold and the
investment bankers who arranged the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The losers include R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco, which almost
certainly would have been more vigorous competitors had they not
been saddled with more than $25 billion in debt from the buyout.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the leveraged-buyout firm that engineered
the deal, lost more in reputation than it made in money.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sufferers are investors who bought RJR Nabisco stock
in 1991, when the company went public again, two years after
Kohlberg Kravis took it private. A $100 investment then is now
worth $51. Over the same period, the Dow Jones industrial average
more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis gave up in 1994, trading its RJR Nabisco stock
for ownership of Borden Inc., the troubled food company. So far
that looks like a doubtful investment at best.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong at RJR Nabisco? The tobacco business proved not
to be as good a cash cow as the buyers thought it would be. The
great advantage of selling to addicted customers was reduced when
price wars broke out among cigarette companies. Tobacco litigation
proved to be a significant threat.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems hurt RJR Nabisco more than its competitors.
Philip Morris, the largest tobacco company and the owner of Kraft
Foods, has seen its share price about double since 1991, while RJR
Nabisco's price has been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   One difference was that Philip Morris had enough financial
flexibility to invest in promoting its products, including Marlboro
cigarettes and Maxwell House Coffee, while debt-ridden RJR Nabisco
was forced to cut back on promotional spending for Winstons and
Oreos. Over time, it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Now RJR Nabisco will sell its international tobacco business for
$8 billion to Japan Tobacco. That money, after taxes, will go to
pay debt. Then the domestic tobacco business will be spun off into
a separate company, with just $1 billion of debt. Shareholders of
the current RJR Nabisco will get the shares in that operation.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder will be Nabisco, which will have two kinds of
common stock. One type, the Nabisco Holdings shares that already
trade, will have a stake in the profits from such products as Chips
Ahoy and Ritz Crackers. The other will have a stake in the same
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But as the former parent of the tobacco company, it will also be
burdened with the possibility of residual liability if lawsuits
manage to bankrupt the tobacco company. The discount between those
two prices will show just how scared investors are of tobacco
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   When all that is done, things will be almost back to where they
were in 1985, before R.J. Reynolds acquired Nabisco. Nabisco will
again be an independent company, albeit a weaker one than its
predecessor. R.J. Reynolds will also be independent, with a smaller
market share in this country and an international business that had
to be sold to pay debt taken on in one of the most misguided deals
in Wall Street history.
</P>
<P>
   In a more just world, the investment banks that made hundreds of
millions from the RJR Nabisco buyout might now join in the
suffering. Instead, they will collect more fees for their services
in dismembering the hobbled company.

A BOSTON HOME BOY RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-TYLER-MIAMI-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MARK BLAUDSCHUN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Elton Tyler never knew for sure. Some days seemed so
normal. His mother, Eleanor, would be home, along with other family
members. Brothers. Sisters. Aunts. Uncles. Grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many as 12 of us,'' Tyler was saying Tuesday with a smile
as he and his University of Miami teammates prepared for their NCAA
first-round East Regional game against Lafayette Friday night at
the FleetCenter. ``All living in a three-bedroom apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days Eleanor would be there when Tyler came home. Some days
she wouldn't. Elton's father, Elton Elmore, was just as elusive,
moving in and out of his son's life.
</P>
<P>
   Some days Elton would come home. Some days he wouldn't; he might
hang out at a friend's house, depending on his mood.
</P>
<P>
   Usually he would be playing ball, listening and watching as the
street stories of Roxbury unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   All of it seemed normal, because that's all he knew. There was
support, although it may have been loosely structured. Sometimes
there was too much, too many opinions on how he should do things.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, Elton took off. Not for long. He always came
back, catching up with the family business and the doings of his
older brother Kareem and his younger sister Nichelle.
</P>
<P>
   What Elton Tyler wanted to do was play basketball. Oh, not at
first. At first he just wanted to chill with his buddies. But
across the street at Marcella Park in Roxbury, Tyler would watch
the pickup basketball games that took place every night during the
summer. He saw an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``A way out,'' said Tyler on a March day, sitting 1,500 miles
away in Florida, where the temperature was 50 degrees warmer than
in Roxbury and in an atmosphere that has given him so much
stability the past two years. ``Going to college was going to be a
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As a seventh grader, Elton Tyler was 5 feet 10 inches. Two years
later he was 6-5. Eleanor Tyler encouraged her son to use the
opportunity. So did his coach at West Roxbury, Thom McNair. So did
Leo Papile, whose Boston Amateur Basketball Club AAU teams were
stocked with kids like Elton Tyler looking for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tyler was a senior, he was more than just another
kid who would do some trash-talking at Malcolm X Park, where the
big-city pickup games were played.
</P>
<P>
   He was a prospect, recruited by schools nationwide. It didn't
matter, though. Tyler's first step was going to be a small one. He
was going to Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Mention BC and Tyler's face clouds up. ``I can't talk about
that,'' he says, at first, not explaining whether he means
``can't'' or ``won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him? Recruited by former Boston College coach Jim
O'Brien, Tyler was part of a recruiting class (along with BABC
teammate Jonathan DePina) that was going to make the Eagles a Top
20 program.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler felt secure because he was a qualifier, someone who had
met the NCAA's minimum academic standards. He was set.
</P>
<P>
   And then he was told he wasn't. The BC admissions office swatted
away his application, deeming him unworthy, not qualified, whatever
description you want. The bottom line was that Tyler was not headed
to BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `What am I going to do now?' '' said Tyler,
who has had no glitches academically or athletically in two years
at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly he was a free agent, not sure of anything anymore. His
father, whom Elton says he was not close to, had died a year
earlier. Life at home was chaotic, especially since the recruiting
window again had been opened on a 6-9, 215-pound prospect.
</P>
<P>
   UConn called. So did George Washington and Michigan. And then
came Leonard Hamilton and Miami, who offered not only an
opportunity to stay in the Big East, but to do it in a program that
was building a foundation and in a place where you could walk
around in a T-shirt and shorts in mid- January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my visit on Martin Luther King Day,'' said Tyler,
``Once I got here, it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler went to Miami with no great expectations. Nor did anyone
expect too much from him.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, he has been the primary backup to Big East
Co-Player of the Year Tim James. ``What I do,'' said Tyler, ``is
bring energy into the game. The tempo picks up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton thinks Tyler can do more. ``He's got to be a more of a
tiger,'' Hamilton said. ``He hasn't come close to reaching his
potential, which is to be a very, very good ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton knows that coming back to Boston in a tournament format
can be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was two years ago,'' Hamilton said with a sigh when asked
about the recruitment process. ``He's at the University of Miami
now. He's happy and all that stuff is behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said he is eager to come home, but not overwhelmed. He had
his stage fright last season when he scored just 2 points in 16
minutes in Miami's first and only visit to BC's Conte Forum. He
wasn't much more productive in two games against the Eagles this
season, but the Hurricanes won both nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   As the competition gets tougher with each round, the Hurricanes
will need more than minutes from Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to coming back to Boston,'' he said. ``I'm
not sure how many of my family and friends will be there, but it's
going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler says it will be more like a business trip than a
homecoming. He won't head back to Roxbury for any quick visits.
``The focus is going to be on basketball,'' he said. ``I can come
back and visit my friends after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   As for BC and what might have been, Tyler only shrugged. ``It's
time to move on,'' he said. ``What happened, happened.''

WORKERS PRODUCE, EARN MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Employees and their bosses each received good
economic news on Tuesday with the release of reports that showed
workers produced more -- and made more money doing it.
</P>
<P>
   American workers' productivity grew at a 4.6 percent annual rate
during the final three months of 1998, the most in six years, the
U.S. Department of Labor reported. For all of 1998, productivity
gains totaled 2.2 percent, a big improvement over the 1.2 percent
gain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year also saw inflation-adjusted hourly wages and benefits
jump 2.6 percent, the largest gain in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   And a salary report by a New York-based human resources
consulting firm concluded that California salaries are among the
nation's highest.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity gains are especially important because they
determine a country's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are producing more, you can pay higher salaries
without raising prices and shooting your profits right in the
foot,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While salaries are on the rise, growth in unit-labor costs, a
key indicator of underlying inflation pressures, slowed. Those
costs rose 1.9 percent last year compared with 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are now reaping the benefits of the surging
economy,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``Both continued productivity gains
and the exceedingly tight labor market are allowing employees to
garner a bigger share of the increasing economic pie.''
</P>
<P>
   A big piece can be had in California, where there is no
tarnishing the gilding of the Golden State, concluded the wage
comparison survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paychecks in major California locales -- like Los Angeles,
Ventura and Orange counties -- are among the highest in the U.S.,
said the 1999 Geographic Salary Differentials Report compiled by
William M. Mercer Inc., the human resources consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer's methodology is as straight-forward as the result is
predictable. The company takes a salary for a middle-management or
technical position that averages $50,000 nationally and figures out
what employers would have to pony up to fill that job in various
cities and communities.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list this year is San Jose, where the job would
command $60,200, or 20 percent above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, it would be $58,150, or 16 percent above the
average; in Los Angeles, it would be $56,900, or 14 percent above
the average; and in Ventura County, it would be $53,150, or
approximately 6.3 percent more than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a place like Brownsville, Texas, is Nowheresville
salary-wise. The same job in that city on the Texas Gulf Coast
would pay $41,750, or 17 percent below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's Texas, that money would probably go
farther.
</P>
<P>
   And mid-America is middle of the road in wage-earning potential.
Companies would have to pay someone $50,300 a year in Wayne, Ind.,
and Louisville, Ky., to perform that $50,000 job.
</P>
<P>
   The survey does not address where the employer would get the
most work for his or her bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said California's high salaries reflect a continued strong
economy in the Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of ... high intellect jobs, everything from
technology through the entertainment industry to management
consulting,'' he said. ``And even some in international trade. We
know that the longshoremen get paid very well.''

TOURNEY HAS HAD NEW ENGLAND ACCENT
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-RYAN-NCAATOURNAMENT-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By BOB RYAN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New England may not be known as a mecca of college basketball,
but we can say this much: when the NCAA Tournament began in 1939,
we were there.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was, anyway. Yup, Brown, that trendy school of the late
'90s. The first New England team to participate in the NCAA
Tournament was a 16-4 Brown team coached by George E. Allen and
captained by George Truman. They were paired against Villanova, and
they fell by a 42-30 score.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one national champion from these parts, the
1947 Holy Cross team, which knocked off Navy, CCNY, and Oklahoma to
win the title in Madison Square Garden. Most people associate that
team with Bob Cousy, but the fact is that The Cooz was an auxiliary
part of the puzzle. His great college days lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen New England schools have taken part in the most famous
of all NCAA-sponsored events. Connecticut has been the most
frequent competitor, this current trip to the tournament being the
Huskies' 21st. But the most successful team, aside from those early
Holy Cross clubs, has been Providence, which numbers Final Four
appearances in 1973 and 1987 among its 13 trips to what we now
refer to as the ``Big Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the New England participation in the NCAA
Tournament:
</P>
<P>
   One and out
</P>
<P>
   Springfield: 1940
</P>
<P>
   One trip to The Show, and whom do you get? The eventual champion
Indiana Hoosiers, who, according to the Springfield Student,
``overwhelmed'' the ``courageous Maroon basketeers'' by a 48-24
score at the legendary Butler University Field House, the site some
13 years later of the Milan (i.e. ``Hoosiers'') triumph. Were they
nervous? Well, they shoot 13 percent (8 for 63!), Rip Redding leads
Springfield with 8, as the Maroons cannot compete in any category _
save one. ``Mid-western observers marveled at the fact that the
Springfield players taped their own ankles,'' reports the Student.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts: 1945
</P>
<P>
   For some utterly inexplicable reason (other than the fact that
it was war time and in terms of athletics absolutely anything could
happen) a 10-6 Tufts five is invited to play in a tournament that
includes Kentucky, Utah, and Bob Kurland-led Oklahoma A&AMP;M. NYU
defeats the Jumbos, 59-44, and a Globe correspondent observes that
``perhaps because they did not respect the opposition too much the
Violets were careless and sloppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard: 1946
</P>
<P>
   With a 20-1 record, the Crimson seem to belong in the august
company of defending champion Oklahoma A&AMP;M, NYU, and North
Carolina. The Globe's Jack Barry notes in his preview that ``should
Wyndol Gray be `on' in his one-hand shooting and intricate passing,
the Crimson quintet will be a pushover for no one.'' The game is
scheduled in Madison Square Garden for 8 p.m., we are told, in
order that ``Harvard can catch the 11 o'clock plane.'' (Hey, there
might have been a Greek class to monitor). Alas, Gray, fellow
future Celtic Saul Mariaschin, and the rest of Floyd Stahl's team
flame out against Ohio State, losing, 46-38. ``Harvard literally
froze cold,'' writes Barry. ``Harvard exhibited its worst
basketball of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like so many of those Penn-Princeton weekends to come,
eh?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: 1955
</P>
<P>
   Brainiest bunch ever to play in the tournament? The only way
they weren't is if someone could produce five Dean's List guys, and
then they'd need to include a Phi Beta Kappa, such as Tom Moro. At
17-1 in the regular season, Moro, Ron Wilson, Bob Buse, and Wally
Jensen can play a little, too. The student ticket allotment for the
game in Madison Square Garden is sold out in 20 minutes. The end
result is respectable, but predictable: Canisius 73, Williams 60.
</P>
<P>
   A taste or two
</P>
<P>
   Brown: 1939, '86
</P>
<P>
   Brown earns an inaugural invitation, losing by a 42-30 score to
Villanova in Philadelphia. Writes Associated Press, ``After loafing
throughout most of the battle, the Rhode Island boys hit a hot
streak and scored eight futile points in the closing minutes.'' . .
. Forty-seven years later, Brown returns as Ivy League champs and
draws second-seeded Syracuse. Oops. Syracuse 101, Brown 52 . . .
The Bruins shoot 8 for 32 in the first half with 15 turnovers and
'Cuse has one 27-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   Yale: 1949, '57, '62
</P>
<P>
   Eli drop close one (71-67) to Illinois in '49 and not-so-close
one (70-54) to eventual champ North Carolina in '57 . . . Has great
shot at powerful Wake Forest in '62, missing chance to win in
regulation when David Schumacher misses a free throw at :02. Wake
(Lenny Chappell, 25) wins, 92-82, and rolls into Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfield: 1986, '87, '97
</P>
<P>
   Bombed by Illinois (75-51) in '86 and Indiana (92-58) a year
later after entering tourney as a 15-16 Cinderella conference
tourney winner . . . With guard Greg Francis nailing eight threes,
Stags frighten North Carolina in '97 and almost thwart Dean Smith's
record-tying 846th victory. ``They were like mosquitoes,'' marvels
Antwan Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University: 1959, '83, '88, '90, '97
</P>
<P>
   1959: Inspired by fiery captain (and future UMass mentor) Jack
Leaman, the Terriers of Matt Zunic surprise UConn and Navy to earn
shot at Jerry West and West Virginia. Crowd noise from back home at
Sargent Gym is piped into arena in Charlotte for Navy game.
Hook-shooting Bob Cummings, a 24-year-old service vet, torments
Mountaineers with 22, but BU gets into foul trouble and is finally
undone by West (33), who runs off 14 straight WVU points in one
stretch. Down 2 with 10 seconds left, BU can't get rebound of
missed West Virginia free throw . . . 1983: Rick Pitino's boys lose
first-rounder to La Salle when injury to Gary Plummer forces Pitino
into such things as a four-guard offense . . . 1988: Hang in pretty
well against Duke (85-69). ``I thought we did a helluva job,'' says
coach Mike Jarvis . . . Blown away by pressing UConn (76-52) two
years later . . . In 1997, sustain what coach Dennis Wolff calls a
``total breakdown'' in 81-52 loss to Tulsa . . . Star Tunji Awojobi
held to 7.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern: 1981, '82, '84, '85, '86, '87, '91
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be battling Northwestern for last place in the Big
10,'' sneers Al McGuire before NU, with backcourt stars Pete Harris
and Perry Moss, stops Fresno State, 55-53. Utah, with Danny Vranes
(27) and Tom Chambers (21) too big and athletic in 94-69 loss . . .
1982: Eric Jefferson's two free throws push Huskies over St. Joe's,
setting up epic battle with Villanova. Dave Leitao's put-back hangs
on rim and won't drop at end of first OT. Jefferson's tip gets NU
into a third OT. Villanova prevails, 75-71. ``People think we
rolled off a cow truck,'' says coach Jim Calhoun, ``But I want
everyone to know this is Northeastern University of Boston, Mass. _
a damned good team.'' Broadcaster Ted Sarandis is scraped off
Nassau County Coliseum ceiling two days later . . . 1984: Dispatch
LIU, 90-87, before playing in one of weirdest NCAA games ever.
Huskies shoot 74 percent, hardly turn it over and get 31 (15 of 17)
from freshman Reggie Lewis _ and lose. Rolando Lamb hits one while
falling down at the buzzer to give Virginia Commonwealth a 70-69
triumph . . . 1985: Lewis makes only 2 of first 11 shots as
Illinois prevails, 76-57 . . . Next year Reggie has 35, but
Oklahoma has three over 20. ``We can best them,'' says Calhoun, but
final is 80-74, Sooners . . . 1987: Calhoun is off to UConn, but
Karl Fogel has team in tourney against Purdue. A 104-95 Boilermaker
win deteriorates into ugly mess and Messrs. Keady and Fogel have
still not shaken hands . . . 1991: North Carolina blasts NU,
101-66. Dean Smith had just watched No. 15 seed Richmond beat
Syracuse and said, ``That's my meeting.'' Says NU's Leroy Hodge,
``It was unbelievable how fast they were.''

   Dartmouth: 1941, '42, '43, '44, '56, '58, '59

   It's the early '40s, and Dartmouth rules. Ozzie Cowles and his
boys from Hanover take two-day train ride to New Orleans before
victories over Penn State and Kentucky (``there was no comparison
between the two clubs as they played tonight'' _ AP) propel Indians
(pre-P.C. days) into championship game against Stanford. George
Munroe, Jim Olsen, and Marvin Akers meet their match against
Stanford, which wins crown, 53-38, without even bothering to employ
star Jim Pollard, who, while recovering from illness, could have
played . . . After first-round loss in '43, Dartmouth roars back in
'44, blowing by Catholic U (63-38) and outlasting Ohio State
(60-53) before meeting Utah in the finals. A Dick McGuire hoop gets
Dartmouth into OT, but Utah's Herb Wilkinson scores at the buzzer
to give the Utes their only NCAA crown . . . 1958: After advancing
to second round two years earlier, Doggie Julian takes what he says
is ``my best team'' into battle, beating UConn and Manhattan before
running afoul of Temple and its great Guy Rodgers-Pickles Kennedy
backcourt, 69-50 . . . (Roughhouse) Rudy LaRusso leads Big Green
back a year later, but Jerry West and West Virginia are too much,
82-68.

   1947: We knew the Crusaders were good, but this good? Yup. With
players such as George Kaftan, Frank Oftring, Joe Mullaney, Dermie
O'Connell, Andy Laska, Ken Haggerty, Bob Curran, and, of course,
freshman whiz Bob Cousy, Holy Cross turns out to be the best team
in the land. First to fall is Navy. Then CCNY goes down, 60-45.
That leaves Oklahoma, and with tourney MVP Kaftan in charge, the
Sooners fall, 58-47. It is an astonishing achievement for a little
Catholic school. According to the Globe, ``the only semblance of a
home court is the confines of a red barn atop Pachachoag Hill.''
Says our own Barry, ``It will be a long time before another
combination so smooth, so balanced, and so adaptable is seen again
in Madison Square Garden.'' A crowd of 10,000 greeted the train in
22-degree weather at Worcester's Union Station. 1948: No repeat.
Kentucky, with Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, &AMP; Co., wins, 60-53 . . .
There is another one-round KO in '50 . . . Bob Pettit (29) leads
LSU past Crusaders in '53, and Temple wins by a 74-72 score against
a Tom Heinsohn team in '56 . . . 1977: Without ailing (ankle)
Ronnie Perry, HC hangs very tough against Michigan, but Wolverines
take it, 92-81, despite stout efforts of Mike Vicens (23) and Chris
Potter (20) . . . Final two NCAA appearances in '80 (Iona, 84-78)
and '93 (Arkansas, 94-64) are one-and-outs.

   1961: Tourney debut spoiled by St. Bonaventure duo of Fred
Crawford (34) and Tom Stith (29) in 86-76 setback . . . 1966: Lefty
Driesell's Davidson squad, led by Mike Maloy and Fred Hetzel, is
much too much for overmatched Rams, 95-65 . . . 1978: Painful loss
to eventual finalist Duke. Rhody there all the way, and even leads
by 3 with 43 seconds left. Mike Gminski hits huge jumper and Irv
Chatman misses a key layup for Rams. Two free throws by Gminski win
it, 63-62 . . . 1988: Tom Penders inherits a Brendan Malone squad
and gets it past Missouri (Tom Garrick, 29) and haughty Syracuse in
touted A-10/Big East showdown as Garrick has 28 more and rugged
Kenny Green owns paint with 23. Says Penders, ``This is the biggest
thing ever to happen to this program.''. . . Dream ended when Duke
runs out to 18-5 lead. Bill King (now Sixer GM) defense holds
Garrick (30 ppg in entire postseason) to 14 in 74-72 Duke win . . .
1993: Rams squashed in Round 2 by Carolina, 112-67 . . . Four years
later Purdue wins first-round game in OT (83-76) . . . 1998: Jim
Harrick plays '98 Penders role, inheriting a veteran team from Al
Skinner and taking it on tourney joyride. Murray State goes down
first, as six Rams hit double figures. The reward is a meeting with
No. 1 seed Kansas, but the Jayhawks have no clue what to do with
guards Cuttino Mobley and Tyson Wheeler, who combine for 47 (8
threes). Rams control final four minutes of 80-75 conquest. Next to
go is lovable Valparaiso, which cannot offset Rhody's great
balance. What follows is the Ending From Hell. Leading by 6 (71-65)
with 59 seconds to go against Stanford, the Rams come undone less
than a minute from the Final Four. Stanford's Arthur Lee first
makes a great leaning three and then a coast-to-coast 3-point play
(he has 13 points in final 2:06), there is a steal and there is a
zig-when-should-have-zagged Wheeler bad pass turnover. Just an
amazing, mondo bizarro finale. ``We experienced a 180-degree change
of emotion in the final minute,'' says Stanford's Mike Masden.

   Tourney intro short and sweet in '58: Maryland 86, BC 63. Eagles
can't get it done with a 6-3, 6-5, 6-4 front line . . . Cousy
returns nine years later with some bigger lads. Eagles stop
stalling UConn in opener (14-13 at half), 48-42, then beat St.
John's, 64-62 as Billy Evans makes game-saving steal and Eagles
sink final 21 free throws. BC grabs quick 12-3 lead on North
Carolina, but Bobby Lewis (31) leads comeback, as Tar Heels give
Dean Smith his first Final Four berth, 96-80. Thirty-two years
later, this 23-3 squad ranks as BC's best team ever . . . Bill
Butler sticks 'em for 34 and Bob Lanier owns the paint as
undefeated St. Bonaventure wins Kingston (R.I.) Relays a year
later, 102-93 . . . Eagles return under Bob Zuffelato in '75,
defeating Furman and losing to Kansas State when Chuckie Williams
erupts for 32, including 24 in second half . . . Tom Davis
establishes his tourney credentials in '81 as BC beats Ball State,
93-90 and Wake Forest, 67-64 (John Bagley, 35). But ride ends in
messy 42-41 loss to a St. Joseph's team that had just shocked
top-ranked DePaul . . .
</P>
<P>
   Not much expected from 19-9 team in '82, but Eagles first stop
San Francisco and then take care of DePaul themselves, 82-75.
``We've found our style,'' says Dr. Tom. A win over Kansas State
(69-65) gets BC to Final Eight for second time. Team gets lift when
athletic director Bill Flynn leads fog-frustrated delegation that
includes a roaring band into Reunion Arena early in second half.
But Houston handles Eagle press and sub Reid Gettys buries 10
straight free throws in stretch. Even Michael Adams dribbling
through Akeem Olajuwon's legs isn't enough to get BC to the Final
Four . . . Gary Williams is in charge a year later as BC beats
Princeton (14 passes before first shot), 51-42. Trailing by 1 just
23 seconds into second half, BC watches Ralph Sampson head to bench
with fourth foul. A lift? Sure, for UVa. BC goes six minutes-plus
without a field goal, and Virginia wins, 95-92, with Rick Carlisle
making all his foul shots in the end. ``We relaxed too much when
Ralph went out,'' laments forward Jay Murphy . . . 1985: Williams's
final BC tourney team beats Texas Tech on Adams's buzzer-beater
(55-53), and then stuns Duke with a 1-3-1 zone and equal backcourt
speed. Next up: a coulda/shoulda/woulda loss of the worst kind.
Tied with Memphis State, and in possession of the ball, Roger
McCready turns it over and Andre (Little General) Turner, wins it
with foul line jumper at :01. Says an ultra-emotional Williams,
``What hurts is how hard these guys worked . . . I wouldn't mind if
the season went until June with these guys . . .''
</P>
<P>
   1994: Jim O'Brien brings senior-oriented team back to tourney,
and the Curley Gang responds with wins over Washington State, North
Carolina, and Indiana, meaning that Obie beats Dean and Bob
back-to-back. Oh, yeah, North Carolina is a No. 1. Probably should
mention that. BC put five starters in double figures against Heels.
Dean Smith whines that freshman Danya Abrams is a bully. Boo-hoo.
Against Indiana the guards shoot 17 for 30. In third trip to Final
Eight, BC again stopped, this time by Florida and guard Craig
Brown, who nails three straight threes in clutch to give Gators a
74-66 trip to Final Four . . . 1996: Eagles whip Indiana again, but
are trashed by hot-shooting Georgia Tech (Stephon Marbury, six
threes, 29 points and 9 assists . . . 1997: BC beats Valparaiso and
dangerous Bryce Drew, 79-66, but O'Brien era closes out with 81-77
OT loss to A-10 champs St. Joseph's, which fires up awesome 43
threes and connects on 14. ``Single most bizarre stat sheet I've
ever seen after a game,'' O'Brien says.

   1962: ``We're a year ahead of schedule,'' says Matt Zunic, who
has relocated from Comm Ave. to Amherst since last heard from. But
State U shoots 17 for 68 and succumbs to NYU, 70-50 . . . 1992:
It's a new hoop world now, in every way, and UMass is in it to
stay. John Calipari's squad toys with Fordham (85-58) and then wins
landmark 77-71 OT struggle with Syracuse. Harper Williams clinches
it with a three, only his second of the season. Coach Cal had asked
for ``bankers with basketballs on their heads'' to show up for the
'Cuse game, and he got them. Run ends in mild controversy when
87-77 Kentucky victory is marked by ridiculous technical called on
Coach Cal by noted showboat ref Lenny Wirtz when Minutemen were
down 2 (70-68) with 5:47 left . . . There was no spark at all in
'93. UMass squeaks by Penn before losing untidy game to Virginia.
``We've done this about 16 times,'' says an exasperated Coach Cal.
``Put ourselves in a hole.''. . . More distress a year later when
lackluster opening win over Southwest Texas (78-60, but not that
big a rout, really) is followed by 95-87 loss to Joe Smith and
Maryland, a team the Minutemen had already beaten in Baltimore.
``They wanted it more than we did,'' says the mentor . . . 1995:
UMass makes first trip to the Final Eight. It starts with
tooth-pull win over St. Peter's (UMass needs 13-0 run in second
half to pull away), and continues with easier victories over
Stanford (75-53) and Tulsa (76-51, as playmaker Edgar Padilla
sprains his ankle). Final Four is beckoning, but Bryant (Big
Country) Reeves is too much of an obstacle. He gets 24 points and
10 rebounds. Marcus Camby gets 6 and 4. Big Country goes to the
Final Four. Camby goes home and decides he isn't quite ready for
the NBA . . .
</P>
<P>
   1996: With a chastened Camby a Player of the Year sort, UMass
makes its greatest run. After rolling over feisty Central Florida,
UMass beats ever-improving Stanford with three perfectly-executed
plays in final three possessions. Arkansas is no sweat at all, as
UMass starts off with 13-0 how-do-you-do. One game away from the
Final Four, the Minutemen put together a masterpiece, flattening
Georgetown and Allen Iverson (6 for 21) as Camby has 22 and Carmelo
Travieso tosses in 20. UMass can't match that effort in national
semis against Kentucky, but team makes nice run after falling
behind by 15 and get it to 3 with 4:51 left. Kentucky wins national
title, 81-74, but winning coach Pitino (UMass '75) is proud of his
alma mater. ``Ninety-nine percent of the teams in the country would
have gone under with the pressure we applied,'' he marvels . . .
The NCAA later strips UMass of its honor because Camby is found to
have consorted with agents, but the games were played and the
memory will never fade . . . UMass returns to the tournament in
both '97 and '98, but exits quickly with a pair of flat efforts
against Louisville and Saint Louis.

   As tyrannical rulers of the old Yankee Conference for more than
a decade and a half, UConn could count on an NCAA automatic bid
most every year. But UConn's first eight trips to the tournament
produce just one W, a 1956 triumph over Manhattan . . . 1964: A
breakthrough! The Huskies first beat Temple, and then they upset
Bill Bradley and Princeton, 52-50 (with Dom Perno sealing things by
swishing two free throws), earning a shot at Duke, led by Jeff
Mullins and Art Heyman. Crash. Duke hits poor UConn with a 62-point
first half, Mullins goes for 30 and the Blue Devils win, 101-54 . .
. After more first-round losses to St. Joe's ('65), BC ('67,) and
Syracuse ('79), UConn returns to The Dance in a whole new guise
under Jim Calhoun in '90. Armed with a No. 1 seed, the Huskies
smash both BU and California (which turns it over under the
relentless Husky press nine of its first 11 possessions), before
heading to the Meadowlands to play Clemson. Losing by a point with
one second left, the Huskies get a miracle accomplished when former
high school quarterback Scott Burrell throws a full-court pass to
6-5 guard Tate George, whose right baseline turnaround beats the
Tigers, 71-70. Ah, but live by the sword, etc. Two days later it is
UConn with the lead against Duke and a second left. But Christian
Laettner takes an inbounds give-and-go feed from roommate Brian
Davis and hits a double-clutch jumper to deprive Calhoun and his
kids a trip to the Final Four in Denver. Calhoun will always see
George making a steal of a Bobby Hurley pass with that 1-point
lead, but being unable to stay inbounds at midcourt and thus giving
the ball back to Duke. It is the beginning of tournament
frustration for Calhoun . . . 1991: Huskies earn a second tourney
shot at Duke after dispatching LSU and Xavier, but this time Duke
needs no late heroics. Blue Devils lead, 44-27, en route to an
81-67 triumph. ``We let a good Duke team get the jump on us,'' says
Calhoun . . . After one tourney win in '92, UConn returns in '94
with reasonable hopes and a No. 1 seed. They beat Rider and George
Washington to get to the East Regional, and, despite a sluggish
effort, they are primed to beat Florida when All-American Donyell
Marshall steps to the line with 3.4 seconds left and the score
tied. He clanks 'em both, and UConn loses in OT. ``He's done too
much for UConn to be concerned with a couple of missed free
throws,'' says Calhoun . . .
</P>
<P>
   A year later Calhoun comes back with another wagon, and his team
rolls right to the Western finals against UCLA after taking care of
Tennessee-Chattanooga, Cincinnati, and Maryland while averaging 98
points a game. But the Huskies get engaged in one shootout too
many, trying to outrun the one team in the land that can't be
beaten in a running game. Despite 36 points by Ray Allen, the
Huskies lose, 102-96, as Tyus Edney goes for 27 and Toby Bailey for
26. ``We ran into a team that had more answers than we did,'' says
Calhoun, who to this day regrets not trying to slow down the tempo
(well, he should, anyway) . . . 1996: By this time merely winning
two tourney games isn't good enough, and so there is disappointment
all around when, following triumphs over Colgate and Eastern
Michigan, the Huskies lose to Mississippi State, 60-55. The Huskies
were forced to play with defensive standout Ricky Moore (ankle),
and Mississippi State's predictably unchecked Darryl Wilson goes
for 27 . . . 1998: More frustration for the Huskies, as another
good Calhoun team can't catch a break. This time UConn survives 43
from Elijah Allen to beat Fairleigh-Dickinson and then stops
Indiana before being forced to play North Carolina in, of all
places, Greensboro. UConn is only down one (59-58) with 5:37 left
when star forward Richard Hamilton is forced out with a deep thigh
bruise . . .

   Providence: 1964, '65, '66, '72, '73, '74, '77, '78, '87, '89,

</P>
<P>
   After winning the still-prestigious NIT in 1961 and 1963, Joe
Mullaney brings Providence into the NCAA Tournament for the first
time in 1964, losing to Villanova, 77-66. He comes back with a
stronger crew in '65, because this time he has Jimmy Walker. The
Friars beat West Virginia in the first round, setting up a showdown
with No. 3-ranked St. Joe's. Combined, the teams were 49-2, and so
it is no surprise when 40 minutes aren't enough to settle matters.
PC survives, 81-73, and is only a perfunctory rout of Princeton
away from a trip to the Final Four in Portland. Oh, really? Coach
Mullaney is worried, even if no one else is. ``Bill Bradley hasn't
really had a great game in the tournament yet,'' he says. ``I hope
he doesn't have it against us.'' Good call, coach. Bradley has 41
points (14 for 20 from the floor and 13 for 13 from the line), to
go with 10 rebounds and 9 assists. Princeton 109, Providence 69.
Ouch . . . St. Joe's knocks PC out in Round 1 again in '66, and so
then it is a seven-year wait to get back into the tourney. It is
all worth it, for this is the great Marvin-Ernie team. With Marvin
Barnes and Ernie DeGregorio giving PC the greatest 1-2
inside-outside punch in New England history, Providence rolls over
St. Joe's and Maryland. It doesn't even matter that Ernie D has big
foul trouble against the Terrapins. Kevin Stacom simply takes over
the show. The Memphis State game in the national semis leads to the
greatest PC what-if? ever; namely, what if Marvin doesn't hurt his
knee in the first half while PC is kicking the Tigers' butt? But he
does, and despite Ernie D's brilliance, it is Memphis State
advancing to play UCLA by a 98-85 score (Hah! Bill Walton drops 44
on their heads). Be it known that this is the greatest New England
team of them all . . .
</P>
<P>
   PC returns behind Marvin and Stacom in '74, beating Penn, but
loses to eventual champ David Thompson and NC State, 92-78 . . .
The Friars lose first-round games to Kansas State and Michigan
State (there was this guy named Magic) the next two times . . . By
1987 Pitino is here and a long dry spell is ending, not that anyone
is expecting great tourney results from a No. 6 seed. But with
Delray Brooks, Billy Donovan, and Pop Lewis raining threes on
everyone, PC gets by Alabama-Birmingham (Donovan, 35), Austin Peay
(after trailing by 10 with 5:52 left), and then Alabama (14-22 on
threes) to get a game with powerful Georgetown. Pitino changes up,
attacking the Hoyas from the inside, and it works. PC wins, 88-73,
to earn Final Four berth No. 2. But the spell is broken by Big East
foe Syracuse, which beats Providence for the third time as PC
shoots 36 percent and Donovan goes 3 for 12 . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Friars lose close first-round games in '89 (Virginia), '90
(Ohio State) and '94 (Alabama), but there is a big shock in store
for everyone in '97. This is a strange team that isn't supposed to
like each other or the coach very much, but for some reason it
comes together in the tournament. Operating from a 10th seed, Pete
Gillen's Friars knock off Marquette by 22 as Austin Croshere goes
for 39 and then astonishes the entire basketball world by stopping
Duke, 98-87. No one can figure it out. ``Duke is Duke,'' says
Gillen. ``They're on TV more than `Leave It To Beaver' reruns.'' PC
continues with a 71-65 win over UT-Chattanooga. ``The starters
dislike me,'' jokes Gillen, ``and the four guys on the bench hate
me. Then they change roles.'' One game away from what have been the
most improbable Final Four appearance in anyone's memory, PC takes
Arizona into overtime before losing, 96-92. PC's Corey Wright can't
nail the last shot in regulation, and everyone wonders what would
have happened if Croshere hadn't been in foul trouble or if referee
Dick (Froggy) Paparo hadn't gone off the deep end and called three
second-half techs on PC. Arizona goes on to win the national title.
``It would have been a hell of a story,'' shrugs Gillen, who heads
off to Virginia.

A FOLKIE PLUGGED IN TO THE CURRENTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Anthony DeCurtis is the author of ``Rocking My Life Away: Writing
About Music and Other Matters.''  
 By ANTHONY DECURTIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the music industry slices itself into ever thinner market
fragments, the language of music critics is dutifully following
along. Performers are extolled or denounced for crossing boundaries
invisible to the eye (or ear): divisions that often have little to
do with how people actually create music.
</P>
<P>
   The English singer-songwriter Beth Orton, for example, has on
several occasions collaborated with the Chemical Brothers, whose
block-rocking electronic beats made a big impact a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   She has also worked with William Orbit, who is now best known as
the co-producer of Madonna's techno-flavored album ``Ray of
Light.'' For those reasons, Ms. Orton has been widely praised for
bridging the vastly disparate worlds of folk traditionalism and
electronic innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But in her spellbinding 1997 album, ``Trailer Park,'' Ms. Orton
was hardly seeking to be a boundary-shattering revolutionary.
Rather, she was simply using whatever materials came to hand to
enhance the atmosphere of her songs.
</P>
<P>
   At 28 and living in London, she had many styles and sounds to
choose from. But for any listener unfamiliar with the trends of the
moment, ``Trailer Park'' sounded gloriously as if it could have
been made at any point in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Ms. Orton's equally transporting new album,
``Central Reservation'' (Deconstruction/Arista, CD, ARCD-9038).
Once again, the songs wander a misty terrain of romantic yearning,
of loves lost and sought. Fewer electronic touches surface this
time: a steady hip-hop beat undergirds ``Stars All Seem to Weep,''
which is also colored by an eerie keyboard figure and what she
describes as ``abstract sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   A percolating remixed version of the title track, produced by
Ben Watt of Everything But the Girl, closes the album. Beyond that,
however, subtle string parts adorn many songs, and guest musicians
like the New Orleans pianist Dr. John and the American folk singer
Terry Callier, a cult figure from the 1960s whose career Ms. Orton
has helped revive, ground the album in a long musical history.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orton's distinctively husky voice and her acoustic guitar
are always at the center of her music. The rough grain of that
voice and how Ms. Orton uses it are precisely what attracted the
likes of the Chemical Brothers and Orbit to her. Ms. Orton may be
drawn to traditional musical virtues; she has a lovely, if dark,
sense of melody and her songs, though ranging only from slow to
midtempo, typically rise from well-defined verses into elegant
choruses.
</P>
<P>
   But as a singer she does everything she can to escape those
structures. Like Rickie Lee Jones, one of her idols, she slurs
words, stretches syllables, slides one phrase into another, sings
over line breaks and circles the beat, often lingering sensuously
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   At those times she is using her voice like an instrument, like
pure sound. At other times she sings with a detachment that is both
cerebral and erotic, as if she were a voyeur occupying some
langorous space at one step removed from the song itself. That
combination of distance and desire, of dreaminess and
impersonality, perfectly mirrors the characteristics of
contemporary electronic music and makes Ms. Orton one of the few
singers who can move gracefully in that world.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Ms. Orton often calls on her skills as a stylist
to rescue lyrics that fail to meet the expectations created by her
eloquent music. In ``Stolen Car,'' a song about a lover's
deception, she flirts with meaning but settles for cleverness in
lines like ``Why should I know better by now/ When I'm old enough
not to?''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Ms. Orton burdens cliches, which have a time-honored
place in popular music, with too much emotional weight. ``Why must
people always want what they can't have?'' she wonders in ``Blood
Red River.'' On ``Pass in Time,'' she concludes, ``You might as
well smile/ Because tomorrow you just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Orton's lyrics may not find their way into poetry
anthologies, they are only one part of the textured sonic landscape
she is creating, a quality she shares with sound-shaping electronic
musicians. She may be mining a folk tradition, but she is not
writing the message songs for which the 1960s version of that
movement is known.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in her career, Ms. Orton is far more noteworthy
for the sound, rather than the sense, of her songs. That sound is
so evocative that it conveys an intelligence and allure all its
own.

REVISITING STEVE REICH FOR THE DANCE FLOOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)

<P>
   From Marcel Duchamp to Robert Rauschenberg, artists have created
new work out of found objects, the humble products of mass culture.
In recent years, however, DJs in the club scene have reversed the
process by recycling high art for popular ends. Thanks to such
appropriation (or, as some think, sacrilege), liturgical chant and
Italian opera, Herbie Hancock and John Coltrane have all found a
second home in dance music, where rhythm trumps everything.
</P>
<P>
   On the new album ``Reich Remixed,'' American, British and
Japanese DJs pay tribute to the American minimalist composer Steve
Reich, at the invitation of his label, Nonesuch (CD, 79552-2).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the DJs, notably DJ Spooky (aka Paul Miller) were versed
in his music; others just saw it as an archive of cool sounds.
Either way, their attraction to Reich's work is anything but
arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   Drumming phases and sampling _ the central components of
contemporary dance music _ have formed an integral part of his
style since the mid-1960s. Reich's 1965 electronic piece ``It's
Gonna Rain,'' in which a street preacher's voice was transformed
into a reverberating band of sound, is a particular favorite of
remixers.
</P>
<P>
   And though Reich became a convert to acoustic instruments in the
70s, he shares a place alongside Karlheinz Stockhausen, Brian Eno
and Miles Davis in contemporary electronica's pantheon of
distinguished forerunners. Bands like Tortoise have flirted with
Reichian phasing, while Orb used his ``Electronic Counterpoint'' as
a setting for their 1991 song ``Fluffy Little Clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd (even a little masochistic) that Reich has
licensed a group of DJs to reassemble his life's work according to
their whims. In fact, it's a shrewd endorsement, coming less than
two years after the release of Reich's 10-CD career retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   The album not only flatters Reich; it may provide him free
advertising in the club scene, where he's unknown beyond the sound
booth. Even so, there's no reason to doubt his enthusiasm for the
project. Reich has long aspired to reconcile the refinements of
concert hall music with the pleasures of pop, building his pieces
on the repetition of infectious rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Reich Remixed,'' the composer adapts well and even
gloriously at times to his new environment. And a new environment
it is: ``Reich Remixed'' is a dance record, albeit an unusually
cerebral one. Reconfigured by Jonathan More and Matt Black of the
English duo Coldcut, the wordless, vibratoless vocals and
percussive waves in Reich's ``Music for 18 Musicians'' retain their
lush aura. And yet the overall effect is different.
</P>
<P>
   Reich, who studied drumming in Ghana and Bali, uses polyrhythms
and timbral inflections in order to generate patterns that repay
the attentive listener with small, fragile epiphanies. Coldcut's
version, by contrast, emphasizes drama over process. Ultimately,
the subtler qualities of Reich's art _ the details that might get
lost on the dance floor _ tend to resist remixing.
</P>
<P>
   The best tracks on the album dare to deconstruct Reich's work.
In ``Megamix,'' Tranquility Bass (aka Mike Kandel) weaves together
nine Reich pieces into a slow, ethereal montage that could well
serve as a primer on Reich's music.
</P>
<P>
   At the other, minimalist, extreme, the DJ Nobukazo Takemura
demonstrates the power of concision by obsessively repeating a
simple, plaintive vocal figure from Reich's 1995 work ``Proverb.''
It's a maddeningly static yet enjoyably bleak work that suggests
Morton Feldman more than it does Reich.
</P>
<P>
   It is the techno composer Ken Ishii, however, who makes the most
interesting case for remixing Reich's music. Ishii has intriguingly
reworked ``Come Out,'' a 1966 electronic tape work that Reich
originally presented at a Town Hall benefit for the retrial of six
young men arrested for murder during the Harlem riots of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The voice in ``Come Out'' belongs to one of those men, Daniel
Hamm, who survived a beating by the police. Hamm says, ``I had to
... let some of the bruise blood come out to show them.'' Composed
just a year after ``It's Gonna Rain,'' ``Come Out'' produced a
comparable distortion of Hamm's speech _ an effect that may have
undercut the work's value as agitprop.
</P>
<P>
   In his ominous remix, Ishii restores clarity to Hamm's
testimony. By laying bare the catalyst for ``Come Out,'' Ishii
reminds us that Reich's timeliness as a composer is not merely
musical.

IN A TABLOID COMEDY, THE SERIAL KILLER IS SENSITIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)

   NEW YORK _ On a recent Sunday, as the subscriber audience at
Playwrights Horizons filed into the venerable 140-seat house on
Theater Row, Christopher Durang poked his head out from behind a
door for a moment and then retreated. ``Looking at them,'' he said
of the mostly older crowd known to be armed with opinions as sharp
as their umbrella tips, ``we could be in for some trouble today.''
</P>
<P>
   The acerbic Durang's latest play, ``Betty's Summer Vacation,''
directed by Nicholas Martin and opening Sunday night, was in its
second week of previews. The author had already seen audiences love
and hate his sendup of tabloid culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With comedy,'' said Durang, who watches from the lighting
booth, then flees to the basement to avoid direct interaction,
``it's hard not to pay attention to the audience.'' Especially when
a dozen members of it walk out at some intermissions.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's been through it before. After all, his first hit
play, ``Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' offended
its share of Roma Catholics. Now, the cherubic Durang is poised to
draw attention to himself with the only comedy in town that has
more bile and murder than ``Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This play is like a roller coaster,'' Durang said. ``People
who like it sit back and enjoy the strange ride; the ones who don't
feel they're being abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the laughter during the first act, the audience was
ready for the ride. Sure, they were watching characters inspired by
Jeffrey Dahmer and Lorena Bobbitt, as well as a sex-maniac surfer,
a flasher and one overbearing mother mixing it up in a Jersey Shore
summer share that would make the Hamptons seem tame.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, there was a laugh track coming from the ceiling,
torrents of obscenities and venomous tabloid dialogue. But at
intermission, only a few people departed. Not bad for a mostly
older, matinee crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, conversation was brisk. ``It's interesting when
tragedy becomes comedy and a serial killer is attractive because
he's so sensitive,'' said Walter Krumholtz, a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters remind me of your family,'' said his date,
Lauren Ezersky.
</P>
<P>
   The action grew more intense in Act II and, by the time the play
was over, some offended people were storming out. ``It's a
sophomoric idea to suggest that the world is a trash-TV talk
show,'' said one man.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, Durang worried about his second act and his
audience. ``I'm not a confrontational person,'' he said. ``It's not
my intention to offend anybody.'' Especially a devout Catholic aunt
whom he had to warn about the play, even though it has no nudity
and no (prolonged) religious attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in her 70s, and gets upset easily,'' Durang said. ``I
mean, she told me she had to stop watching `Touched By an Angel' on
TV because it was too sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a couch in his tweedy jacket and checked shirt,
Durang squirmed and sighed. It was almost as if his latest Swiftian
nightmare, which he had originally intended as a lighthearted
memory play about summers at the beach, was upsetting
(italics)him.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just starting it when I got distracted by the Menendez
trial on Court TV,'' said Durang, who lives in Bucks County, Pa.
``I watched the whole thing. Then I got hooked on the Bobbitt
trial. One of the dangers of being a writer is that you have a lot
of free time on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing could be said, of course, about serial killers.

 Valerie Gladstone is a contributing editor to Dance magazine.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From his office window, Arthur Mitchell, artistic
director of Dance Theater of Harlem, was looking out on an
undistinguished block of West 152nd Street near Amsterdam Avenue,
not far from where he spent his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, next to an overgrown lot, are a couple of
abandoned buildings. ``We'll be putting dorms in there soon so our
out-of-town students won't have to stay with local families,'' he
said, standing up behind his desk for a better view. ``They're
being made landmarks. Look at the details.'' The bright winter sun
cast stark shadows on the elaborate cornices.
</P>
<P>
   It is a landmark year for Mitchell. In the coming months, he
will be celebrating his 50th year in dance, the 30th anniversary of
Dance Theater and his 65th birthday. Dressed in a black silk shirt,
black jacket and black slacks, he makes as striking an impression
now as he did as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet
in the 1950s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   On his bookcase are photographs of himself with Balanchine,
another with Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House and a more
recent shot with President Clinton in 1993, when Mitchell won the
Kennedy Center Honors. He seemed self-conscious about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me you were supposed to display these kinds of
things,'' he said, then changed the subject by joking about the
imposing 19th-century pulpit he installed on the far side of his
office. ``My mother always said I'd make a good preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Many artists strive to escape from their beginnings; instead, at
35, Mitchell returned to his. He had always known his experience
would rarely be repeated by others _ receiving a full scholarship
at the School of American Ballet and, at 21, becoming the first
black man to be a permanent member of a major ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   But the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968
made that knowledge intolerable to him. ``I could no longer wait
for others to change things,'' he said. Abruptly, he made a
remarkable move for a dancer at the height of his powers and
resigned from the New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Peabody, who served on Dance Theater's board for many
years, called it ``an extraordinarily courageous thing to do.'' It
turned out to be historically significant as well.
</P>
<P>
   When he founded Dance Theater in 1969 with Karel Shook, his
mentor and ballet teacher (Shook died in 1985), few schools offered
ballet classes to blacks and even fewer ballet companies had black
members. ``It's hard to imagine now,'' he said, ``that most people
then thought we were totally unsuited to ballet.'' His school and
troupe soon proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Johnson, a principal dancer with the company from its
inception until 1997, recalled: ``We went to small towns where
they'd never seen blacks before. We had an enormous impact on many
narrow-minded people. Not just whites. Some of our people felt: Why
do ballet? It's only the white man's art. Our repertory showed that
many classics were applicable to blacks. That's why Mitchell
commissioned a Creole `Giselle' and an African `Firebird' for us to
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company's repertory of more than 112 works includes
ballets by Balanchine and contemporary choreographers like Geoffrey
Holder, Dwight Rhoden, Alonzo King and a South African, Vincent
Mantsoe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But despite Dance Theater's breakthroughs, no other
predominantly black ballet company has yet been established, and
black dancers still find acceptance in ballet hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, racism is worse now,'' Mitchell said. ``It's caused
by the increased migration of people from around the world into our
country, for with it comes increased competition for jobs and
places in schools. It makes some Americans see anyone different
from themselves as a threat.'' But he doesn't let the situation
depress him. ``I have a large ego,'' he said. ``I've always figured
there isn't anything I can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one expected his enterprise to last. Even today,
rumors spread every year that financial problems will close it
down. ``Yes, of course, we always need money,'' Mitchell said.
``Who in dance doesn't? But we finished last year in the black.''
</P>
<P>
   To insure continuity at Dance Theater, Mitchell and his board of
directors have just appointed James S. Keeler Jr., the former
president and chief executive of the Arthur Ashe Foundation, as the
company's executive director. ``Although I'm not planning to
retire,'' Mitchell said, ``I realize I must get my house in order
administratively.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To keep Dance Theater going, Mitchell has often had to make
difficult decisions. A few years ago, he determined that it was too
expensive to have regular seasons at City Center and at Lincoln
Center. Dance Theater now performs more often at Aaron Davis Hall
in Harlem and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Only the company's
30th anniversary prompted him to plan a three-week season at the
City Center in September and October.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere the company's visibility is up. In the last two
years, it performed in Monte Carlo and at the Festival of Two
Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. And in February it made its first tour of
historically black American colleges while students from the
company school were performing in Hong Kong for the Chinese New
Year. Dance Theater is probably now better known outside Manhattan,
except in Harlem, where it is a cultural mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this isn't surprising. From the beginning, Mitchell's
primary purpose was to give minority children a complete education
in music, dance, theater and art. Today his school enrolls 1,000
students a year, ages 3 through 17, and offers dance and exercise
classes to adults. It also spreads its influence to other cities
with outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of youngsters have learned about dance, costumes,
lights and scenery from company members. At the end of each
session, Dance Theater gives a performance at a local theater.
``Audiences for the last two or three generations have grown up on
television,'' Mitchell said. ``If you don't go into the community
and teach them about theater, they're never going to have any
interest in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dance Theater's monthly open houses are all about theater and
the arts. On a recent wintery Sunday afternoon, families and
children streamed through the company's doors at 152nd Street for a
program of music and dance. The big upstairs studio quickly filled
to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Coles, the widow of the legendary tap dancer Charles
(Honi) Coles, began the proceedings by offering to teach the
shim-sham to all comers. Before long, several couples were giddily
gyrating to the music. In the wings, Mitchell, smiling, danced to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   After the demonstration, he came out and proudly told everyone:
``I used to be a hoofer. Did gigs with Eartha Kitt when City Ballet
wasn't performing. Pearl Bailey taught me how to work a house.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusually rich program continued with young violinists, an
opera singer, ballet dancers and a gospel chorus all entertaining
the crowd. At the close, Mitchell announced an open house that is
to take place Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Dance Theater headquarters to
celebrate the forthcoming anniversaries. People rose to their feet
to applaud and then made their way to an adjoining studio for juice
and homemade desserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year,'' he said later, ``someone tells me that we should
move downtown, that we'd get more attention and more money. What
they don't understand is that Harlem is our heart _ and that to
most of the world Harlem is a magical word.''

TAKING UP CHOREOGRAPHY AS A PATH OUT OF MOURNING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (af)  
 Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
about the choreographer Susan Marshall.  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not often that someone starts making dances
after turning 60. Lucia Dlugoszewski, who makes her choreographic
debut on March 23 at Playhouse 91, is not a total neophyte, though.
A seasoned composer and musician, she carried on a creative
partnership, and marriage, with the choreographer Erick Hawkins for
more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   When Hawkins died at 85 in 1994, Ms. Dlugoszewski briefly lost
interest in making music. ``I was sick with mourning,'' she said in
a recent interview. '`I wanted to die with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now that she's working again, she wears her black the way
older women in Europe do: as an expression of grief, not a nod to
downtown fashion. But that and a caginess about her age (61, she
said, though her alma mater puts it at 73) are her only traits that
could be called old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in Detroit, she first caused a stir in New York
in the early 1950s by inventing new instruments, and new ways of
playing old ones, and often sharing the stage with her husband's
troupe, the Erick Hawkins Dance Company. On the piano, she likes to
play the strings with mallets, picks and bows.
</P>
<P>
   Her compositions are equally unorthodox: frenzied at times, but
also strangely lyrical. The critic Virgil Thomson once
characterized her idiom as ``far out music of great delicacy,
originality and beauty of sound.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hawkins died, Ms. Dlugoszewski set about staging three
pieces outlined in a notebook he kept at his deathbed. Mikhail
Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project performed the first of these
posthumous works, ``Journey of a Poet,'' to mixed reviews at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1997. The Hawkins company will present
the two others during its one-week run at Playhouse 91, which wraps
up the 92d Street Y's monthlong Harkness Dance Project.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of a static repertory, the troupe's board also began urging
Ms. Dlugoszewski, who succeeded her husband as artistic director,
to make her own dances. After all, she had taken over Hawkins'
course in dance composition some 15 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And there were other skilled choreographers, like Susan Marshall
and Boris Eifman, who had never danced professionally. What sold
her on the idea was the chance to work with Pascal Benichou, a
former Joffrey Ballet dancer who took her course two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I'm choreographing,'' she said. ``Pascal got me
out of my mourning.'' Her first dance, ``Taking Time to Be
Vulnerable,'' is a 50-minute solo for Benichou. With his long
auburn hair and earthy sensuality, he looks as if he had stepped
out of a Pre-Raphaelite painting. Like the rest of the program, it
will be danced to live musical accompaniment by Ms. Dlugoszewski.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe her dances, she drifts into reveries about
D.H. Lawrence, Pablo Neruda and Basho, whose haikus she regards as
the pinnacle of verbal expression. Or she discourses on esthetics,
with frequent references to the philosopher F.S.C. Northrop, who
championed ``direct experience'' over ``naive realism.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, these mystical digressions shed some light on her
work, which concerns itself less with how a dance looks than with
what its audience feels. ``I've always been very interested in
poetry, but it's (italics)about(end italics) something instead of
it is something,'' she said. ``Only music gives you direct
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, dance intrigues her. Her second effort, a set of duets
for 10 dancers called ``Radical Ardent,'' pairs Benichou with
Katherine Duke, who joined the troupe in 1986. As the couple
rehearsed a veritable decathlon of amorous lifts last month, Ms.
Dlugoszewski reiterated her artistic creed: ``Direct experience is
a hard thing to achieve. Emotion interferes. Intellect interferes.
But as the haiku poets found, you can disable the intellect with a
clash of opposites.'' Ever straddling the romantic and modernist
camps, she added, ``I want you to see beauty where you never
thought you'd see it.''

BARING THE INTRICACIES OF DESIRE AND SHAME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the Iranian film ``The Apple.''  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands _ If you can't dazzle them, shock
them!'' the adolescent heroine of Catherine Breillat's 1989 film
``36 Fillette'' declares, with a glance at her own daring
decollete.
</P>
<P>
   Could that be the French director's motto? Ms. Breillat, who is
50, is no stranger to scandal. From her first novel, written when
she was 17, to her most recent film, ``Romance,'' her candid
dissections of human sexuality have ignited debate at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make moral films,'' the director says. ``But mine is a
rather ambiguous, Dostoyevskian morality. I believe that human
beings are forever torn between their worst and best impulses. And
nothing represents that better than sex _ what is most trivial,
most obscene, most debased and most beautiful in human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' enjoyed a noisy premiere last month at the
International Film Festival here alongside a retrospective of Ms.
Breillat's six previous films. (``Romance'' is being shown as part
of the series ``Rendez-Vous with French Cinema Today'' at the
Walter Reade Theater on Friday and next Sunday and has just been
acquired by Trimark Pictures for an American release.)
</P>
<P>
   Filmed with almost glacial control, in the manner of a moral
fable, it centers on Marie (Caroline Ducey), a primary school
teacher whose boyfriend (Sagamore Stevenin), a fashion model,
refuses to have sex with her. Setting off in search of adventure,
Marie finds herself in bed with Paolo (Rocco Siffridi), a Latin
lover, and literally tied up with her headmaster, Robert (Francois
Berleand), in a sadomasochistic relationship that proves to be the
most tender of the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' alternates florid bedroom philosophizing with
explicit (and at times violent) sexual scenes. The casting of
Siffridi, a star of European pornograhic films, caused a stir; his
presence on the set was revealed to the other actors only after
they'd signed their contracts and was disturbing to some.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real shock of ``Romance'' is its weirdly hybrid nature;
it's both a serious exploration of female masochism and a farce
about contemporary sexual relations. With an outrageous final scene
of childbirth that brilliantly overturns the conventions of both
romantic films and pornography, it's a scandal that challenges one
to think.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely source of so much commotion is the mother of three,
whose mild appearance belies her ferocious intelligence and
self-assurance. She grew up in the French provinces, ``in a deadly
little town,'' she said in Rotterdam, ``conventional and
narrow-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the age of 11, I was already developed, with a woman's
figure, and so my parents locked me up. But I read Lautreamont,
Sade, the most violent things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breillat escaped by enrolling in the Paris university
system's College of Oriental Languages. She used her first year as
a student to write ``L'Homme Facil'' (``The Easy Man''), a novel
published in May 1968 and immediately banned as licentious for its
frank tone and language.
</P>
<P>
   Her first film, ``Une Vraie Jeune Fille'' (``A True Young Girl''
1976) _ an adaptation of her third novel ``Le Soupirail'' (``The
Sigh'') _ is shot from the perspective of a brooding adolescent who
takes refuge in wild and vaguely surreal erotic fantasies.
Hilariously abject and audacious, it's a portrait of the artist as
a sexually obsessed young solipsist, whose preoccupation with her
own bodily fluids mingles with her first, hesitant creative
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Denied distribution in France, where for many years it was
considered a shameful film, but acclaimed in Rotterdam, ``Une Vraie
Jeune Fille'' may finally be released in France, 23 years after it
was made.
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Ms. Breillat specializes in explorations of the
psychological terrain of feminine shame and desire. ``Tapage
Nocturne''(``Night Noises'' 1979), a dark film about a married
woman consumed by adultery, was criticized for its sexual boldness.
</P>
<P>
   In the more buoyant ``36 Fillette,'' which was shown at the New
York Film Festival in 1989, a sullen 14-year-old girl on holiday
with her family considers losing her virginity to a jaded older
man. ``Parfait Amour'' (``Perfect Love''), a 1996 film based on a
crime story, details the destructive passion that erupts between a
37-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man. Its analysis of the need
and despair that underpin romantic love is radically unsentimental
and stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sale Comme un Ange'' (``Filthy as an Angel''), a 1991 police
thriller in the style of Ms. Breillat's mentor, Maurice Pialat,
tells the story of a worn-out detective (Claude Brasseur), who
falls in love with his partner's wife (Lio). Her seduction is
filmed in one long take in which the woman's face fleetingly
records shame, fear, longing and rapture.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The contradictions of that moment interest me intensely,'' Ms.
Breillat remarks. ``Because the closer you get to an actress in
that state of physical rapture, the more she offers herself to you,
the more distant she becomes, the more she escapes you. And it's
something you can only film _ the simultaneous desires, for example
of a woman who says no, and thinks it, and yet says yes at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Breillat, filmmaking is a passionate act. ``It happens
under the eye of the camera,'' she explains, ``that the actors are
transfigured, like people in love. Because the camera is a way of
loving people. The way you look at them transforms them totally.
That's why directors sign their films, even though they're not the
ones holding the camera, or saying the words. But their vision
transforms things so totally that the film belongs to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breillat is a leader in the growing ranks of French women
who are directing films. Unifrance, an agency that promotes French
cinema, lists 39 women whose films have been released commercially
over the last two years including Claire Denis (``Nenette et
Boni''), Daniele Dubroux (``Diary of a Seducer'') and Anne Fontaine
(``Dry Cleaning'').
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to the wealth of opportunity
for female directors in France. One is a government-sponsored
system in which a percentage of profits from all films are
reinvested in projects chosen according to merit. Another is the
willingness of public television to co-finance risky material.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boidin, the director of cinema at Arte, the
French-German cultural television channel that co-produced both
``Perfect Love'' and ``Romance,'' finds little in the latter film
that shocks him. ``Every day, television news programs project
images of greater violence against women,'' he says. ``What's
extraordinary about `Romance' is that it lets a woman's desire
speak. So-called sexual films are almost always presented from a
man's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ``Romance,'' this year's ``Rendez-Vous'' series at the
Walter Reade Theater includes four films directed by women,
including Tonie Marshall's ``Venus Beaute (Institut),'' a
bittersweet comedy of manners about customers and attendants in a
Parisian beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a radicality to Catherine's work,'' Ms. Marshall said
from Paris in a telephone interview, ``which links her to the
preceding generation of directors _ people like Marguerite Duras
and Agnes Varda, who really opened doors for women. She frightens
people at times. She's always bothered people a bit. But she's
extremely stubborn, and she follows her own path.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that path involves a marked and rather
unfashionable indifference to social concerns. It's an attitude
that distinguishes Ms. Breillat's work from the miserabiliste
strain in contemporary French filmmaking exemplified by Bruno
Dumont's ``Life of Jesus,'' Phillippe Grandrieux's ``Sombre'' (in
the ``Rendez-Vous'' series) and Gaspard Noe's ``I Stand Alone,''
opening this week at the Film Forum. But her films do share
something of their dark tone and preoccupation with violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen, I pay attention to social problems, but as a
filmmaker, they don't interest me,'' Ms. Breillat says.
``Metaphysics, sentiment and passion are more important to me than
the kind of jobs people do.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``I don't make films in order to present a realistic
vision of society, but rather to track down the truths we are not
supposed to see. It's not realism that interests me, but reality,
truth, which is very incorporeal.'' &QL;

TRANSFIXING MOTION AND EMOTION IN A SHUTTER'S BLINK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photography does some things poorly and others too well. For a
long time it could not stop motion, and then, when it could, the
results were too good to believe: people were uncomfortable with
Eadweard Muybridge's pictures of galloping horses because no one
had ever seen a horse look exactly like that.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually viewers grew accustomed to seeing what was invisible
to the eye and counted it as a kind of miracle. Conventions created
by the camera were accepted: blur signified speed, and a
stroboscopic series of figures in a single frame indicated motion,
although if the eye takes in blur and such tiny increments of
motion, it does not register them.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of stopping movement and making it credible
meant that cameras had trouble portraying dance for quite some
time. Early in this century, dancers were sometimes held up by
cables to last through a long exposure.
</P>
<P>
   When Edward Steichen photographed Isadora and Therese Duncan on
the Acropolis in 1921, they were standing still in dance poses,
sometimes with the wind blowing their garments. Even now, when the
camera can catch the least flicker of a foot, it is still difficult
to convey a sense of a fluid and unfolding event in such a
minuscule scrap of time. But splendid approximations have been
made.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Morgan showed the way in the 1930s. At the James
Danziger Gallery, in Manhattan, a retrospective exhibition of 47 of
her photographs presents some of her landmark images of Martha
Graham and other dancers from the late 1930s to the early 40s. In
good retrospective fashion, the show, which runs through March 27,
includes numerous photomontages and light drawings, genres that
Morgan experimented with seriously at an earlier date than most
American photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a painter and printmaker and recognized with shows in
California museums, Morgan (1900-1992) married a photographer and
learned to photograph but said she had no desire to make it her
profession. After moving to New York in 1930, and having a second
child in 1935, she turned to photography because she thought it
would take less time away from her children. She also considered it
the only medium that could capture the 20th-century metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1935 that she saw Martha Graham dance for the first
time and began to photograph her and members of her company. Morgan
had seen an exhibition commemorating Isadora Duncan and been
stunned to realize how little remained of the great dancer's art.
</P>
<P>
   She soon began to document modern dance, in part to give form to
her admiration for pioneer dancers who, though they had little to
live on during the Depression, continued to create art that
affirmed life and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was the perfect subject for Morgan and Morgan the perfect
photographer for the task. They began a close professional
relationship that sometimes entailed working together for an entire
day in the studio and darkroom to get one flawless print.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan would watch rehearsals and performances until the pivotal
instants were locked in her memory, then photograph in her studio
or at the theater. (She never took pictures during a performance,
however, because that would have meant the loss of control over her
dramatic lighting system.)
</P>
<P>
   Graham brought many new movements to the dance repertory, and
Morgan had a knack for finding the moment when motion and emotion
most keenly intensified each other. Look at Erick Hawkins' taut
leap in Graham's ``Penitente,'' a rope in his hand flying out to
the side; or Merce Cunningham jumping with legs tucked up and palms
outstretched in ``Totem Ancestor.''
</P>
<P>
   (Cunningham danced with Graham for six years.) Morgan also used
moments of stillness or completed movement that were meaningful in
Graham's choreography: look at Graham with her knees spread and her
hands, clasped, uplifted in a tortured piece of fabric in
``Lamentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also took full advantage of Graham's remarkable costumes
to suggest the vector of movement before, during and after the
split second that her camera halted it. In the well-known image
``Letter to the World (Kick),'' Graham's voluminous skirt
momentarily arcs back toward her head as her foot, invisible
beneath the fabric, kicks up behind her; the skirt must have
subsided as soon as the shutter clicked.
</P>
<P>
   In other photographs, a swirling garment billowing out to the
side traces the previous instant and hints at what's to come. Dance
photography (and other photography that stops movement) magnifies
the sense of interrupted time that the camera cannot help but
produce, the awareness that something happened the instant before
the lens opened and the instant after it closed.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan did not ignore Graham's personal beauty and remarkable
dancer's body. In a tight close-up from ``Ekstasis,'' Graham, seen
from collarbone to ankle in a tight tube dress, with light
caressing the long curve of her right side, becomes a sinuous
column emblematic of the female form, life and the potential for
movement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Improved photographic capacity and Barbara Morgan's talent and
devotion gave history a larger and finer record of an era called
the golden age of American modern dance than we have of dancers
like Duncan or Ruth St. Denis. One writer has suggested that
thousands of Americans first got an inkling of the look of modern
dance, which was not widely seen outside major metropolitan centers
in the 1930s, when a show of Morgan's photographs traveled to more
than 150 universities and other exhibition spaces beginning in
1938.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition that opened at the Museum of Modern Art in 1945
was shown at the first United Nations conference and toured Latin
America under State Department sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dance photography has changed and acquired a
virtuosity and elasticity beyond what it formerly had, but Morgan's
expressiveness and ability to imply a trajectory of motion in just
one tiny, stopped moment has continued to influence important
photographers of the dance like Martha Swope and Lois Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple, contrasting, chaotic rhythms of the modern city
and modern life also attracted Morgan. Photomontage, with its
superimposition of incidents or forms from different realms, looked
like the one medium capable of containing the simultaneity and
diversity of contemporary experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 she wrote: ``Photomontage originates in this multiple
kind of life we are living. We are elated by the spectacle. Life
roars indifferently on. We are saddened by the spectacle. Life
roars indifferently on. The chief function of montage is that of
mirroring this complex life.'' She also used montage to mirror the
complexity of dance, superimposing related moments of a ballet,
sometimes with figures in different scales.
</P>
<P>
   European and Soviet artists had made montage an important part
of their repertory in the 20s and 30s, but America was initially
hostile to the idea (and even in Europe very few women touched it).
Here the doctrine of straight, unmanipulated photography and a
virtual worship of the documentary approach in the 1930s put other
forms of photography in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who was familiar with European art and a good friend of
Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, who had written about montage and continued to
use it when he came to America from Europe, was one of the earliest
Americans to work with this form regularly. Her most hopeful
montage, ``Spring on Madison Square'' (1938), is a now classic
image of people trudging through snow while above them looms a huge
silhouette of Erick Hawkins striding boldly, confidently, with the
white shape of an enormous tulip looping across his form.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Morgan's photomontages refer to social concerns.
``Hearst Over the People,'' a laughing, distorted face of William
Randolph Hearst with octopus tentacles hovering over a crowd,
comments on the power of the media in a manner entirely relevant
today.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples are not quite so clear. ``City Street'' (1937), a
view of the Empire State Building, symbol of money and power,
leaning in two directions and juxtaposed with an aerial view of
pedestrians in fedoras buying pretzels, was said by Morgan to be an
image of ``desperate souls marching across the street in utter
despair, searching, not knowing what was their future.''
</P>
<P>
   But these desperate souls look like nothing so much as
pedestrians in fedoras buying pretzels. Perhaps it was clearer at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The label of ``Brainwashed'' doesn't say so, but this unfocused
image of a woman's face with a huge black hole where one eye should
be and an odd series of lights streaming across her face was
inspired, according to Morgan, by a school teacher who was
distressed by the effect of television violence on students and who
told Morgan, ``Our children are being brainwashed!'' This was in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan would earn a mention in American photographic history for
her early dedication to photomontage at a time when this country
was leery of European art and single-minded about what kind of
photography it would tolerate. But her major contribution was to
have preserved, in elegant form, the pioneering works of American
modern dance: one art turning another into a feast for the eyes
while offering a plum to history.

HOLLYWOOD APPLIES BRAKES TO PRODUCTION COSTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Hollywood has temporarily halted its financial
insanity, the industry's top spokesman proclaimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie industry may have begun taming that fiscal Godzilla
slouching around movie budgets for so long,'' said Jack Valenti,
chairman of the Motion Picture Association in his state of the
industry keynote address at the ShoWest convention in Las Vegas.
``The industry is trying to apply more disciplined habits in one of
its periodic fits of cost control.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti's comments came as part of his report that Hollywood's
seven major studios saw average production costs dip 1.3 &UR;  &LR; percent
last year to $52.7 &UR;  &LR; million per movie, following a stunning
34 &UR;  &LR; percent jump for 1997 films. Of course, 1997 included the
$200 &UR;  &LR; million spent on ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti acknowledged the decline was ``small, small, small,''
but it is also the first concrete evidence to back up studios'
claims that they have actually been holding a line on expenses and
putting the brakes on excessive spending.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti noted that although ``Titanic'' had goosed 1997's cost
significantly, that impact had been more than canceled out by
several megabudget projects last year such as ``Armageddon'' and
``Godzilla.'' The decline in ``negative'' costs  &UR; -- &LR;  industry
jargon for the money needed to complete a movie  &UR; -- &LR;  was the first
since 1991. The cost of prints and advertising shot up 13 &UR;  &LR; percent
to $25.3 &UR;  &LR; million per film, which Valenti blamed on soaring ad
rates for top-rated TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing we can do about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day convention, sponsored by the National Association
of Theater Owners, also saw release of the final 1998 domestic box
office statistics which came in slightly higher than earlier
projections, with a 9.2 &UR;  &LR; percent gain to $6.95 &UR;  &LR; billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fiscal arithmetic is not founded in illusion,'' Valenti
said. ``With inflation about 1.6 &UR;  &LR; percent, this huge gain in box
office is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Admissions for 1998 rose 6.7 &UR;  &LR; percent to 1.48 &UR;  &LR; billion, the
highest level in four decades. ``We are clearly outpacing the
growth of the population,'' said William Kartozian, president of
the theater owners association.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti and Kartozian also shrugged off the 1999 slump at the
box office, which trails last year's comparable period by
8 &UR;  &LR; percent, mainly due to the success of ``Titanic.'' ``Wait until
May,'' Kartozian said, referring to the opening of ``Episode One:
Phantom Menace.'' ``We'll catch up very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti also said the increase in box office was particularly
impressive given the competition from such areas as satellite TV,
the Internet and DVD. ``Not only did families want to get out of
the house to be entertained,'' he added, ``they also wanted an epic
viewing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Valenti was not entirely upbeat, warning of the
dangers of copyright theft, particularly in Asia where he recalled
seeing vendors hawking pirated video copies of ``Titanic'' outside
theaters showing the film. ``Consider the potential for looting the
Internet of digital movies where the thousandth copy is as pure as
the original,'' he said. ``Unless we find suitable technological
armor, we will soon be standing in the ruins of a once great
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Kartozian acknowledged that the success of megaplex theaters,
which have become key drivers in the last year's addition of more
than 2,300 screens nationwide, has created a significant problem
for older theaters in nearby areas. ``Evolution is not always
pretty,'' he said. ``The ugliest part is the obsolescence of
multiplexes that are sometimes only 5-8 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the new screens being built in the United States
are in megaplex theaters which offer at least 16 screens with
stadium seating and massive concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   Two surveys released Tuesday showed that the movie business
remains heavily dependent on frequent moviegoers. The theater
owners group reported that customers who visit a theater at least
one a month comprise 28 &UR;  &LR; percent of the population and account for
83 &UR;  &LR; percent of all admissions.
</P>
<P>
   A separate survey by ACNielsen EDI found that 49 &UR;  &LR; percent of
Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 average at least one visit
to the movies per month, well above other age groups. That compares
with 22 &UR;  &LR; percent of those in the 25-34 range, 16 &UR;  &LR; percent of those
35-44 and 15 &UR;  &LR; percent of those 45-54.

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There's nothing like the NBA trade winds to
blow an issue out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   With the league's swap-meet deadline scheduled for Thursday, the
proposed deal involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Charlotte
Hornets continues to gather steam.
</P>
<P>
   As has been reported for the last few weeks, the Lakers would
ship guard Eddie Jones and center-forward Elden Campbell to
Charlotte in exchange for hotshot small forward Glen Rice, power
forward J.R. Reid and guard B.J. Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I do is deal with me,'' Jones said before Tuesday's game
with the Clippers at the Sports Arena. ``It'll work out no matter
how it comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   But recent breezes indicate the Lakers are considering a trade
with Milwaukee that would bring free-agent point guard Terrell
Brandon in exchange for Campbell. That would give the
playoff-contending Bucks a low-post presence, but require the
addition of a floor leader to replace Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league source, Lakers owner Jerry Buss isn't wild
about dealing Jones, but would love the opportunity to jettison
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Deadlines for Clippers: News of a trading deadline hasn't
escaped the Clippers, who continue to field inquiries from teams
eager to steal something from a team that lost its first 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Another approaching deadline arrives Saturday, the last day
teams can offer contract extensions to current players. The roster
of Clippers in the last year of their contracts includes Lamond
Murray, Lorenzen Wright, Rodney Rogers and Eric Piatkowski.
</P>
<P>
   According to a team source, the Clippers aren't expected to make
any contract-extension offers until after July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Playing not to lose: Maintaining a winning streak in the NBA is
no cinch, and it's an even bigger chore when the next opponent is
absolutely starving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tough game for us,'' Lakers point guard Derek
Harper said of playing the winless Clippers. ``You have to guard
against playing to your opponent's level. It's important for us to
take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the threat of eclipsing the league record for
season-opening losses (17 by Miami in 1988) add pressure to the
Clippers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Clipper forward Maurice Taylor said. ``I really
don't think it's a factor. There's a lot of basketball left to
play. If you worry about losing streaks and that sort of thing,
you're too busy thinking about the wrong stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   `Kandi' update: According to Clippers rookie center Michael
Olowokandi, his visit to the injured list (left ankle) is expected
to end tonight at the Forum. The 7-footer from Pacific injured the
ankle the last time the Clippers played at the Forum.

CSUN's JERRO HAS WRITE STUFF 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And how much have you slept, Cal State Northridge
coach Frozena Jerro, since learning your team will play Colorado
State in the NCAA Tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up watching film all night,'' Jerro said. ``I probably
won't get much sleep tonight, either.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Jerro has spent a lot of time dissecting the Rams and
building a game plan. But she also has been discovered by the
national media, who want to know about the coach who took over
after the head coach was arrested and a second coach resigned
before coaching a game.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today interviewed her for an hour. The San Jose Mercury News
flew a reporter down to talk to her. The Colorado media,
understandably, is very interested, and some of the newspapers that
cover the Big Sky Conference told Northridge Sports Information
Director Ryan Finney they will cover Northridge in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro also has spent plenty of time talking to newspapers and
radio stations from Montana, Arizona and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The late show: Ask players if they like the 9 p.m. PST starts
and most don't mind because they'll be on television. ESPN2 has the
Northridge game on Friday, and ESPN will televise UCLA on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as UCLA's Marie Philman says, ``I've never played that
late of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Only UCLA's Erica Gomez says she loves the late start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a morning basketball person,'' she said. ``It takes me
awhile to get my knees in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez also is used to playing late. In high school, she and her
older sister, Audrey, often went to local gymnasiums as late as
10:30 p.m. and shoot around.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, they were still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go in and stay there, and time passes you by,'' Gomez's
father, Larry, said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Tickets are on sale for the NCAA West Regional at
the Sports Arena on March 20-22. UCLA and Northridge will play
there if they win two games in their respective sub-regionals.
</P>
<P>
   A three-game ticket package is $30 for a reserved seat on the
lower level and $25 in the upper level. Youth packages are $12.
</P>
<P>
   Semifinals are March 20 at 7 and 9 p.m. The final is March 22 at
9 p.m., with the winner advancing to the Final Four in San Jose.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Scottie Pippen blocked a shot, batted the ball upcourt, chased it
down, reached for one of Calvin Murphy's cookies and passed to
Michael Dickerson for an open-court layup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets' 84-75 win over the Nuggets at Compaq Center on
Tuesday should have been that easy. Fill the highlight tapes, erase
the memory of the Trail Blazers _ and have a tasty snack.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. Had Pippen kept in step with the Rockets' night, the
play would have been spectacular (not that it wasn't), but the
cookie would have slipped from his hand and the Nuggets' Danny
Fortson would have been there to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets shot well, ran their offense as expertly as they
have in weeks, played outstanding defense and did almost everything
they could hope to do to win easily. Instead, they won ugly.
</P>
<P>
   And though Pippen did actually wait until the ensuing dead ball
to (unsuccessfully) raid Murphy's cache, he had offered a clue as
to how easily he would later take over, knowing he could if needed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets inexplicably unable to put away the game as
late as midway through the fourth quarter, Pippen scored 10 of his
17 points in a span of three minutes, each on a more remarkable
play to finally let the Rockets surge safely past the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and didn't take care of business early,'' Pippen
said. ``We should have played a lot better. We should have allowed
our bench a chance to come out and have some fun. We got outworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity was there, and I was able to make some shots
down the stretch. I felt like I had to be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich: ``Scottie was great. He
made big play after big play, defensively and offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets needed someone to take over, despite pushing the
Nuggets into the worst shooting night ever in the building. While
the Nuggets could make just 23 of 77 shots (29.9 percent, the
third-worst night in franchise history), the Rockets shot well,
passed well and ran their break well. They also got the ball inside
routinely, outscoring the Nuggets 52-26 in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   But because they were careless with the ball, committing 20
turnovers, and routed on the boards, they were unable to put the
Nuggets away. Fortson, the Nuggets' burly 6-7 center, had 21
rebounds, 11 on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
   With Fortson immovable inside, the Nuggets scored 19
second-chance points, a number held down only because he was able
to make just four of 12 field goal attempts and seven of 13 free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles (Barkley) made me play harder,'' said Fortson, who
drew a technical for looking to retaliate after a hard Barkley
foul. ``He was creating a monster, and he didn't know it. I still
respect him, and he's one of my favorite players. Those type of
guys you can't listen to, or you'll go crazy. You just have to go
out and play hard. Charles was trying to get me to go over the
edge, and I knew it. It was a smart, veteran move.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who grabbed 13 rebounds but never could control
Fortson, would not comment after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounding is `rrrrrrr,''' Tomjanovich said. ``It's `my man is
not getting it this time. I'm going to put my butt on him, and he
is not getting it this time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Failing that for much of the night, the Rockets found themselves
in an odd sort of toe-to-toe battle. They had seen an 11-point lead
turn into a three-point deficit, and they lost all of a five-point
lead in the third quarter, falling into a three-point hole.
</P>
<P>
   But almost as if shifting into another gear that had been
dormant all along, the Rockets turned up their defensive intensity,
took care of the boards and began to roll. The Rockets took off on
a 12-0 run, all on layups, dunks or free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen set up Hakeem Olajuwon for a layup, Cuttino Mobley drove
for a dunk, and Pippen had his block and pass to Dickerson. By the
time Brent Price cut down the lane to convert a pass from Olajuwon
into a layup, the Rockets had rebuilt their 11-point lead, 65-54,
two minutes into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They could not, however, make that lead hold up. The Rockets'
penchant for coming up with every sort of turnover _ they had seven
in the first seven minutes of the fourth quarter _ would not allow
them to expand their lead.
</P>
<P>
   It did not even matter that the Rockets were shooting well _
they were 7-of-9 in the first 10 minutes of the fourth quarter _ or
that the Nuggets were shooting horribly. The Rockets' turnovers
limited their chances. And Fortson continued to dominate on the
offensive boards to keep the Nuggets within range.
</P>
<P>
   But then Pippen took over. He drove for a layup before taking a
pass from Barkley for a 3. The next drive was even better, with
Pippen cutting across the lane and past the basket before flipping
a shot in. And finally, he took off on a fast break, then after
drawing hard contact from Nick Van Exel, flipped the ball under the
Denver guard's arm and somehow in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got fouled and just tried to get it up to the basket,'' said
Pippen, who seemed to enjoy the moment far more at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the sort of game _ like the cookie Murphy
successfully guarded _ that was difficult to find satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Price said. ``Scottie made the big plays we
needed to secure the victory. We won ugly, but it's a win.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Basketball is a non-contact sport in which the
imagination provides the only restriction on movement.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the way it is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   But the game has gotten physical, very physical. Especially at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That is a significant change for the Longhorns, who in recent
years had been known for their guard play _ little guys who played
as if there was a ``No Trespassing'' sign posted at the 3-point
line.
</P>
<P>
   Remember BMW? Lance Blanks, Travis Mays and Joey Wright? They
led Texas to the Midwest Regional final in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it is the Big Three. Chris Mihm, Nnadubem ``Gabe''
Muoneke and Kris Clack hope to do as well, or better.
</P>
<P>
   Big because they are bigger than most and are responsible for
Texas turning around a dismal start to claim the Big 12 Conference
regular-season title and a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament's East
Regional, where it will face Purdue on Friday at the Fleet Center
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The trio enters games expecting to win the matchup down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chris Mihm is the best center in the nation,'' said
Muoneke, a junior power forward who leads the Longhorns in scoring.
``I sat and thought about it the other day, and it's hard to say
about a sophomore, but I think Chris is mature enough to hear it. I
don't think there is a true center out there that's better than he
is. That gives us an advantage right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we always have an advantage at the `3' spot _ Clack is too
big and too athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   That description of the versatile Clack _ who leads the team in
3-pointers and is second in steals and third in points, rebounds
and assists _ is one that Big 12 coaches use in describing the
difficulty in matching up with all three players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick one _ they are all bigger and stronger than anyone we can
put on him,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said. ``And I'm
pretty sure almost every team in the country will say that. They're
big, strong and can shoot outside _ all three of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult matchups up front are why Texas coach Rick Barnes
believes a grind-it-out style of play suits his team best.
</P>
<P>
   That get-it-low philosophy is why the trio accounted for 61
percent of the field goals attempted by the Longhorns during the
regular season. They are 1-2-3 on the team in scoring, rebounding
and blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're supposed to carry a big part of the load _ our
teammates expect us to do that every night,'' Clack said.
</P>
<P>
   They lead in nearly every category and, of course, are 1-2-3 in
foul shots attempted as teams resort to all sorts of tactics to
contain them.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to see:
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke working his way to the basket with an opponent's knee
poking the back of his thigh with every movement and the foe's
forearm lodged in that ever-so-uncomfortable spot in the small of
his back. The collisions come at rhythmic intervals, like football
players attacking a blocking sled.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, low post position already established, with a defender
draped all over him, an elbow against Mihm's biceps and a hand on
his hip, and a 5-11 pest fronting Mihm with an elbow poised near
the solar plexus.
</P>
<P>
   Clack in his usual spot on the baseline, trying to get to the
other side of the floor where he can get free for his favored
fadeaway jumper from the corner but being denied by a defender
engaging in an extended hand-to-hand tussle with a few body blows
mixed in.
</P>
<P>
   One would think activity like that would lead to complaints from
Texas' frontcourt stars, but that is the kind of game they long
for.
</P>
<P>
   That also is the type of game they expect in the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get away with a lot of stuff too,'' said Muoneke. ``For the
most part over a 40-minute period, that plays more to our liking.
Chris can take a lot of contact and score anyway, and so can Clack.
When (a defender) gets physical with Clack, especially a guard,
it's no match whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to a physical game and the referees aren't
calling the contact, I think it works to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas does pack a solid punch across the board. Teams like
Purdue need not be warned of what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Texas shooting guard DeJuan ``Chico'' Vazquez tips the scale at
about the same weight as the heaviest player on Purdue's roster,
6-8, 230-pound Brian Cardinal. The Boilermakers run a three-guard
offense, with Cardinal as a forward. Their center is 6-7, 215-pound
Greg McQuay.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three outweigh the Boilermakers' heftiest three starters
by a combined 102 pounds. That is an average of 34 pounds a man.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what the Longhorns' game plan will be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going into games, Gabe and I feel like we can
dominate,'' Mihm said. ``It's just a matter of if we come to play
together and play as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that our frontcourt has gotten some respect this
year. The turnaround has helped us start to get some team
recognition as well as some individual recognition. It's something
to be proud of, but we don't really pay that much attention to it,
because if we don't play well it's going to be, `What a
disappointment the Big Three are.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Rockets told us not to read too much into the 40-point loss at
Portland two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was deceivingly one-sided, they said. Don't worry. Don't
punch the panic button. And certainly don't go postal, or even
Mailman, about the ugly possibilities on the Rockets' horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But don't snuggle up to a warm fire and embrace Tuesday's
nine-point victory against lowly Denver, either.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice, timely and at times entertaining tale that
certainly had a happy ending _ Rockets win 84-75.
</P>
<P>
   But it might have been scripted as much by William Faulkner as
Rudy Tomjanovich. It was so much a flowing story, yet awkward, so
much a classic Rockets exhibition and yet difficult to get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out doing what we wanted. We were running the
ball,'' Cuttino Mobley said. ``But then, I don't know if it was
because we were tired, but we weren't doing it. I guess it's hard
to expect to have everything together at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   One moment you understood what this Rockets story could be all
about _ ah, yes, this is how it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson, he of the young legs and soft shot, bolts in
front of the pack for a layup on the fast break. On the next
possession, Mobley, he of the sly smile and clever game, slides
between bodies and lays in another fast-break bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we were trying to establish,'' Dickerson said.
``Get out and run. Establish something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, on the way to 20 points, shook like a dream.
Scottie Pippen, seemingly on the way to finding his place in this
Rockets story with 10 points in a span of three fourth-quarter
minutes, sealed the win the way champions do.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Rockets' defense held the poor Nuggets to
29.9-percent shooting and left them dangling there, exposed and
helpless, like participles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that 29-percent,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I don't remember
having a stat like that. When you look at the defense, that's good.
That's the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the next moment, the story fell flat. The Rockets'
effort made you cry as much as it made you laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets hadn't won a road game all year _ they are 0-10 now
if you're keeping track _ yet took a couple of brief leads on the
Rockets and made a game of it into the fourth quarter despite the
horrendous shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess flew spectacularly through the air, while Danny
Fortson threw elbows with Charles Barkley and wound up with a
pointed 15 points and 21 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was as confusing in victory as the Trail Blazers loss was
confusing in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the Rockets still were not sure if they wanted to
be Showtime or Slowtime, sometimes impressively moving up the
floor, sometimes content to pitch it into Olajuwon or Barkley and
simply watch what happened.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many signs that this story is unfolding exactly
the way Tomjanovich would like to write it. Pippen on the run,
finally knifing through the lane. Mobley earning his place at the
point, while Bryce Drew sat and Matt Maloney watched.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the early review of this one should be that
Cuttino is beginning to cut it at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's coming,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We made big plays.
We rebounded. I see Mobley doing a good job (at point guard).
Scottie made big play after big play defensively and offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there also were signs that the story remains an unsolved
mystery, as if the Rockets still are not sure what they want to be
and are not always comfortable with where they are on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Those 20 turnovers are a sure sign of indecisiveness. The
Rockets' 19-7 deficit on offensive rebounds can only partially be
blamed on the brick-throwing Nuggets getting more shots. The flat
feet while watching Olajuwon and Barkley work the post was like a
bad novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got outworked tonight,'' Pippen said. ``They had more
energy than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. But the Rockets won. It was a good win and a
much-needed win, but how much should be read into it?
</P>
<P>
   Not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it all over the league: Teams that have been together
for years are getting out of what they do,'' Tomjanovich said.
``But I like what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't read too much into it.

WOODEN'S FIRST UCLA TEAM IS STILL A FAVORITE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It began 50 seasons ago, with several uneventful
meetings neither party remembers well. The rookie coach inspected
his players and didn't see much. A few were transfers and one was a
returning letterman. It was easy to tell why they had been picked
to finish last.
</P>
<P>
   The players, meanwhile, knew nothing of their coach. Apparently,
he was a former All-American and had just arrived from Indiana
State Teachers College, a small school near the Illinois border.
</P>
<P>
   The no-names and the new coach would stun the experts, race
through the division with their fast-breaking style and help
establish a dynasty and a legend. But back then, as the 1948-49
season approached, the Bruins had no idea who Johnny Wooden was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know us and we didn't know him,'' said Ralph
Joeckel, a forward on the 1948-49 team. ``We had no idea what would
eventually happen. It's not like we looked at him and thought,
`Here comes the next John Wooden.' ''
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY FOR WESTWOOD
</P>

   UCLA as a basketball power almost never happened. Alcindor,
Walton, Hazzard, Goodrich, 88 straight wins, 10 national titles _
it almost never happened, because in the spring of 1948, two years
removed from a non-combat army tour, John Robert Wooden had no
intention of coaching UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   He was the basketball coach, baseball coach, athletic director
and English teacher at Indiana State, and his performance on the
court caught the attention of three schools: Minnesota, UCLA and
his alma mater, Purdue, which he quickly eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden favored Minnesota. It was Big Ten country, his country,
and he didn't know much about UCLA. ``It was just four letters,''
he said. There was one glitch: The Gophers wanted Wooden to retain
his predecessor as the assistant; he wanted his own man, Ed Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The issue went to the Minnesota Board of Regents, and Wooden
asked for an answer on a prearranged day at 7 p.m. He told UCLA
athletic director (and outgoing coach) Wilbur Johns to call him at
8.
</P>
<P>
   History headed west that evening, for there was silence at 7
o'clock. The phone finally rang at 8 _ it was Johns _ and Wooden,
clearly disappointed, accepted UCLA's offer.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the Gophers called. Sorry, they said, a
late-season snowstorm had knocked out the phone lines, but they
were glad to report the issue had been resolved and the job was
his. Stunned, Wooden said thanks ... but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not go back on my word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Wooden, then 37, loaded his tan Lincoln
Mercury and headed west on Route 66 with his wife, Nell, and their
children, Nancy and James. The trip took several weeks as they did
some sightseeing.Upon arrival, they settled in a university-owned
home in Culver City, near the MGM Studios.
</P>
<P>
   He shared a small office at UCLA with several coaches on the top
floor of Kerckhoff Hall with a spectacular view of nothing. No
Drake Stadium, no Morgan Center, no Ackerman Union, no Medical
Center and no Pauley Pavilion. Westwood was a fledgling suburb
built around two theaters. UCLA was just a few decades old.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played in the 2,200-seat Men's Gym, a cramped,
stuffy, brick structure endearingly called the B.O. Barn. It was
loud and intimidating, a definite homecourt advantage. Opponents
constantly accused Wooden of turning up the heat. He never did, but
he never denied it, either.
</P>
<P>
   Truth was, Wooden despised the place. For one thing, he had to
share the practice court with the gymnastics and wrestling teams
and two trampolines frequented by women athletes in leotards _ a
distraction not even he could overcome. For another, there were no
locker rooms. Every player from every sport had to share a huge
dressing area that lacked private showers and toilets. It was not
popular with recruits, and Wooden fought doggedly for his own
facility until Pauley was built in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   No one gave the Bruins much chance that first season. They had a
new coach with a strange style. They had no returning starters from
Johns' 12-13 team, no star like Bill Sharman at USC, and average
size. They were unanimously slotted for last place in the Pacific
Coast Conference's southern division, behind Stanford, USC and Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, Wooden was asked to assess UCLA's chances.
His answer startled the press and touched his players: ``I have
never played on or coached a losing basketball team, and I don't
intend to start now.'' (That was a slight exaggeration. His first
season as coach at Dayton, Ky., High School, when he was right out
of college, was a losing one.)
</P>
<P>
   He revamped UCLA's philosophy. Instead of using the slow,
halfcourt style favored on the West Coast, he installed a
fast-breaking system that became his signature and revolutionized
basketball. Throughout the 1948-49 season, the L.A. press wrote
about Wooden's ``racehorse style,'' but its structure was sound as
DNA. The Bruins moved the ball quickly, each player taking a
predetermined path to the attack zone. If there was no numerical
advantage, Wooden ordered the Bruins to pull back and run their
high-post offense.
</P>
<P>
   To support the style, he turned UCLA into the best-conditioned
team in the division, and he used an eight-man rotation to keep the
legs fresh. His practices were organized to the second, his
preparation immaculate. Everything that happened in games was
carefully rehearsed in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one game against Cal,'' said Powell, the former
assistant. ``We had a player throw a low bounce pass to a cutter on
the fast break, and the cutter had trouble catching it. By the time
he did, his shot hit the bottom of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next week in practice, coach Wooden told the players to
run downcourt at full speed. He rolled the ball to them, and they
had to reach down, grab it and make a layup. He figured there was
no pass lower than a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden's first game was Dec. 3, against Cal-Santa Barbara before
2,200 in the Men's Gym. The Gauchos rallied early in the second
half and grabbed a 26-25 lead before the Bruins dashed to a 43-37
win. Center Carl Kraushaar, a transfer from Compton JC, was the
high scorer with 15 points. Newspaper accounts called referred to
``Johnny'' Wooden and ran a small photo of the handsome young coach
_ his face long and thin, his hair army short.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started 6-1 and the conference took notice of Johnny
Wooden's team. One newspaper report tagged the Bruins, ``darkhorse
threat for division laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Wooden's system was slowly taking hold, and his
coaching style _ no favorites; all playing time earned in practice
_ injected confidence throughout the roster. Sure, the best
early-season player was Chuck Clustka, ``the loose-jointed forward
with the sloping shoulders and sharpshooting eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wooden also relied on Kraushaar, guard George Stanich, an
Olympic high jumper, and forward Alan Sawyer. The bench was
versatile and productive, with Joeckel and his horned-rimmed
glasses, Don Seidel, an army vet who snuck cigarettes, and Eddie
Sheldrake, a jokester who was once detained by the Secret Service
for tresspassing on Harry Truman's property in Independence, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was based on Wooden's ability to put
extraordinary self-confidence in individual players,'' Joeckel
said. ``Without him saying we were invincible, we all believed it,
and we won a lot of games we shouldn't have. I don't know how he
did it. I never have.''
</P>
<P>
   At the inaugural Pacific Coast Conference tournament _ a
three-game, eight-team event in the Cow Palace _ the Bruins lost to
the conference's best teams, Stanford and Oregon State. A few days
later, they dropped their third straight, to Stanford in the
division opener.
</P>
<P>
   Before a mid-January break for exams, Wooden faced USC for the
first time in a two-game series. The Bruins rallied from a
nine-point deficit with eight minutes left to win 74-68 in overtime
in the highest-scoring game in PCC southern division history. A
night later, USC responded with a 59-52 win that featured 53 fouls.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper account said, ``There were enough fouls to start a
poultry farm.''
</P>
<P>
   When exams arrived, the Bruins were 9-5 overall and 2-2 in the
PCC, good for third place in the four-team division. But Wooden's
system solidified each week, each practice, and UCLA returned from
exams oozing confidence and efficiency. The Bruins smashed Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, Fresno State, 20th Century-Fox and Pittsburgh
during a four-game nonconference series.
</P>
<P>
   Clustka injured his back in the Pitt game, but it made no
difference. The Bruins were in high gear by that time and Sawyer,
the ``baby-faced bean pole,'' became the top scorer. He totaled 31
points as the Bruins rolled through the Bay Area, then scored 22 as
UCLA defeated Stanford in the Men's Gym without Wooden, who had the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the final weekend, UCLA and USC were tied at 6-2. The
Bruins were 9.5-point underdogs and without several top players at
the Olympic Auditorium. Sawyer, the leading scorer, had suffered a
ruptured appendix 48 hours earlier and listened to the game with a
bedside radio at a Hollywood hospital. Clustka's back had not
healed and starting guard Ron Pearson had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven ties and neither team led by more than six. In
the end, though, Stanich held Sharman to eight points and a reserve
center named Ray Alba _ it was someone different every night _ made
a free throw with 13 seconds remaining to give the Bruins a 51-50
win. ``One of the most stunning, nerve-tingling basketball upsets
ever witnessed on a local court,'' one newspaper account said.
</P>
<P>
   Another report called UCLA a ``team of destiny,'' and said the
Bruins ``Wooden-be-beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA trounced the Trojans 63-55 the next night in an
anticlimactic game at the Men's Gym, clinching the division title.
Although they would lose a three-game series at northern division
champ Oregon State _ and with it, the PCC title _ the Bruins had
carved a special place in their coach's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider that team as successful as any I had,'' Wooden
said. ``It was as close to reaching its potential as any I had.
That's a credit to the players. I had a lot to learn about college
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do badly that first season.

KINGS' TEMPERS FLARE IN PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Some of the struggling Los Angeles Kings'
frustration boiled over during Tuesday morning's skate, when goalie
Jamie Storr and winger Donald Audette exchanged a couple of
harmless punches before being separated by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred when Storr objected to a high shot by
Audette as the Kings were practicing at the Forum for Tuesday
night's game against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of frustration out there, but nothing
happened,'' Audette said.
</P>
<P>
   Storr added, ``It's no big deal. It's part of hockey. Over the
course of a season, you're going to have confrontations and
controversies. It doesn't mean you don't like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said he had his back turned during
the brief incident. Asked his reaction, Robinson said, ``At least
it shows they're a little bit (ticked) off, which they should be.
Those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fond memories: Robinson returned Monday from Canada, where he
attended the funeral of his mother, Isobel, who died last week at
78.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long couple of days,'' Robinson said. ``I'm hanging
in there. I'm trying to get my hockey mode back. I can't say I've
been thinking too much about hockey the last few days. But life
goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a native of Ontario, added, ``We grew up on a farm. My
dad didn't have a lot of time to take us places. It was mom who
took us to the rink, who fed us and took care of us when we were
sick, because dad didn't have time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne scratched: Defenseman Steve Duchesne, who has struggled
all season, was a healthy scratch for the 4-2 victory over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen and hear, over the last two or three
games, he's still not willing to pay the price to make a play,''
Robinson said. ``We can't afford to wait. We've got to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson gave no guarantee Duchesne would return to the lineup
Saturday against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Murray struggling: Winger Glen Murray scored 15 goals in his
first 37 games this season, putting him on pace for 33 goals in an
82-game season. But a knee injury on Jan. 2 sidelined him for seven
weeks, and since returning to the lineup on Feb. 19, Murray was
without a goal in eight games entering Tuesday night's meeting with
the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I thought I'd come back in and play the way I was
playing (before the injury),'' said Murray, who admitted he's had a
difficult time adjusting to the brace he now wears on his right
knee. ``Obviously, it's not true. I feel like I'm still one step
behind every play. Maybe I'm thinking too much. I've got to keep
everything simple and do my own job, not everyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Puck-less plans: Two weeks ago in Detroit, Robinson skated his
players for 40 minutes without pucks, and threatened that for the
rest of the season he would repeat the grueling practice regimen
one minute for every minute he is dissatisfied with the team's
effort in games.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson - who missed key home losses Thursday and Saturday to
Nashville and Calgary while attending his mother's funeral in
Canada - said Tuesday he intends to stand by that threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys aren't paying the price,'' Robinson said when asked to
evaluate the Nashville and Calgary losses. ``You can have all the
game plans you want. I look at (Eastern Conference leader) Ottawa.
I don't think there's a huge difference from their personnel to
ours. But everyone from (Alexei) Yashin on down goes hard and pays
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Winger Vladimir Tsyplakov may return from his knee
injury Saturday against Vancouver, and winger Steve McKenna may
return next week from the abdominal injury that has sidelined him
for most of the season.

KINGS BEAT RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Maybe the Los Angeles Kings should play the
Detroit Red Wings every day.
</P>
<P>
   They lose consistently to lesser teams in the NHL, but give them
a meeting with the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions and the
Kings suddenly come alive.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, they beat the Red Wings in overtime in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Kings came alive again, ending a losing
streak of four games losing streak with a crucial 4-2 victory
before a crowd of 13,741 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (24-36-5) got timely goals, key saves, and an
outstanding effort from their penalty killers, especially during
the first 12 minutes of the third period, when they were clinging
to a one-goal lead and playing eight of those minutes shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   The victory enabled the Kings to remain within seven points of
San Jose, which holds the final playoff berth in the Western
Conference. Rob Blake, Doug Bodger, Ian Laperriere and Russ
Courtnall (an empty-netter in the final minute) scored the Kings'
goals, and Stephane Fiset stopped 38 of Detroit's 40 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as significant as the victory was the spirit shown by a
Kings team so often lacking that quality this season. The Kings
gave a 60-minute effort, and showed a willingness to take
punishment as well as dishing it out.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere was at the focal point of much of the second-period
action, both before and after his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Before his goal, he served a stint as a punching bag for Darren
McCarty, accepting a punch to draw a penalty. Sixteen seconds after
his goal, Laperriere fought Aaron Ward to a standstill, rallying
impressively after some early difficulties. Joining in the fun,
Mattias Norstrom won a wrestling match with fellow Swede Tomas
Holmstrom later in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually, the displays of emotion and discipline might
not have amounted to much. Taken in total, it means the Kings still
have hope in the season's final 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's goal was his fourth in the last seven games, and came
when he alertly jumped on a Detroit turnover and blasted a 45-foot
slap shot from above the right faceoff circle that beat Red Wings
goalie Chris Osgood to the glove side 2:46 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, four seconds after the Kings had survived
a harrowing shorthanded situation in which the Wings controlled the
puck for almost the entire two minutes, Bodger made it 2-0, beating
Osgood with a shot from the top of the left circle off a Courtnall
pass. It was Bodger's second goal of the season, and his second in
as many games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings could not escape the period with the two-goal
margin intact. With 7.2 seconds left in the opening period, Fiset
misplayed a long shot by Martin Lapointe, the puck trickling
beneath him. Bodger was in position to clear the puck, but before
he could do so, Igor Larionov reached around from behind the net
and tapped it in.
</P>
<P>
   Larionov tied the score with his second of the game and 13th of
the season 6:51 into the second period, beating Fiset with a
40-foot slap shot after Slava Kozlov stripped Blake of the puck in
the Detroit zone.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike so many other games this season, the Kings didn't
allow a momentary setback to crush them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they withstood the change in momentum and got a break
when a point-blank shot by Kirk Maltby rang the crossbar and
bounced out with 8:24 left in the second period. It was one of
three instances in the game in which a Red Wings shot hit the post
or crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   And when Laperriere got his opportunity, he buried it like a
40-goal scorer, which he was back in his days of junior hockey in
the early 1990s. Laperriere received a centering pass from Luc
Robitaille in the slot, controlled the puck on his stick and
snapped it past Osgood with 7:36 to play in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Kings simply hung on during a third period in which
they were outshot 13-3.

SHORTSTOPS BATTLE FOR BACKUP JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ One might think the shortstops in camp would see
Gary DiSarcina's injury as an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   If DiSarcina, out since Feb. 21 with a broken bone in his left
forearm, can't make it back by opening day, one of these guys will
be the Anaheim Angels' shortstop on April 6 against the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not necessarily true for the season. DiSarcina will
be back eventually, whether it's by opening day or a week into the
season, so Jeff Huson and Luis Rivera are simply fighting for a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys in my situation come to camp having to do everything they
can to begin with,'' Huson said. ``There's no margin for error.
Even if Gary didn't get hurt, there's still no margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's a battle every day; it's a battle every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Huson and Rivera have been around a while; Huson, 34, has played
professionally since 1986. Rivera, 35, has played professionally
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize it's easy for starters to come to camp,''
Huson said. ``It's hard for part-time players. If I don't perform
for six weeks (during spring training), I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   Huson and Rivera have split the starts at shortstop in the
Angels' first five Cactus League games, Huson starting three of the
five. Huson is 2 for 9 and has not made an error. Rivera is 2 for 5
with one error.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've got to show them is that I can play defense at
shortstop,'' Huson said.
</P>
<P>
   Angels have arms to spare: A Randy Johnson-Roger Clemens duel in
late September would have been something.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, however, barely missed out on signing Johnson, and
the Texas Rangers came within a whisker of trading for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   So, we'll have to settle for Chuck Finley vs. John Burkett, or
Ken Hill vs. Rick Helling with the AL West up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case in the division known for the Mo Vaughns, Juan
Gonzalezes and Ken Griffeys, not the Steve Sparkses or Mark Clarks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels won't hesitate to admit their strength is a
lineup that has Vaughn, Darin Erstad, Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds
among others, they aren't whining about lacking quality arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have choices,'' said new Angels pitching coach Dick Pole.
``We're not in a situation where we have to make a pitching staff
up. We've got guys competing for spots ... We've got people who
will compete, and when you've got people who compete like that, you
have a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Pole was speaking about the likes of Finley and Tim Belcher. At
ages 36 and 37, respectively, both are past their prime. But both
are known for keeping their team close and eating up innings over
the course of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Health is always an issue. And when it comes to the Angels, the
most important health question involves Hill's surgically repaired
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 2 1/2 months last year after having arthroscopic
surgery to remove bone chips, and wasn't at full strength when he
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Hill's the key,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``If
Ken Hill's arm is healthy, he will give us 200 innings, 200 quality
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I don't worry about the bullpen. If the starters give
us what we anticipate they'll give us, the bullpen sets itself up.
They don't get overworked and stay in their roles.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case last year, when the starters completed only
three games. It took a toll on the bullpen late in the season.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched 97 1/3 innings last year, the most by a
reliever in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have Sparks penciled in as their No. 4 starter, with
Omar Olivares, Jarrod Washburn and Jason Dickson competing for the
fifth spot. Closer Troy Percival anchors the bullpen; Rich DeLucia
joins Hasegawa as the primary set-up men. Mike Holtz will be the
situational lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Pole has his work cut out for him getting to know his pitchers,
but he has former pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, now the
organization's roving pitching instructor, helping with the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said he likes what he sees in the Angels' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the old baseball adage says you never have enough
pitching,'' Belcher said. ``But I feel our pitching is as good, if
not better, than anybody in our division. It's equal to Texas, and
I think we have the edge in experience. They have (closer John)
Wetteland; we have Percival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle's got quality starters, but no Cy Young candidates.
Over the course of 162 games, I'll take our chances.''

LAKERS HAND CLIPPERS 16TH LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is a tale of one city and two streaks ...
mean and lean.
</P>
<P>
   The former is maintained by the mighty Los Angeles Lakers, whose
103-99 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers in front of 13,380 at
the Sports Arena on Tuesday was their eighth in a row since hitting
the ejector button beneath the seat of coach Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is attached like a barnacle to the Clippers, who have
modeled the agony of defeat for the first 16 games this season. A
similar result in tonight's rematch at the Forum would equal the
NBA record for season-opening failure _ 17 _ established in 1988 by
the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Our subplot stars both coaches _ Kurt Rambis, who has yet to
lose while sitting in the Lakers' catbird seat, and Clippers coach
Chris Ford, who must be saving a fortune on victory cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have games like these,'' said Rambis, sounding
almost apologetic about the margin of victory. ``You just have to
gut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, while refusing to take any consolation bows, did take
comfort in his team's willingness to scrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the guys laid it on the line,'' Ford said. ``That
was a man's game out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The main man was Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, whose trouble
with fouling kept him on the bench long enough for the Clippers to
rally in the fourth quarter. A lead that had swelled to 17 points
in the third quarter was trimmed to four, at 88-84, when Darrick
Martin, the gutty little ex-UCLA Bruin, bagged two free throws with
4:08 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq returned in time to contribute two mammoth,
streak-preservation dunks over 7-foot-3 Clipper Keith Closs, who is
more than 100 pounds _ give or take a gumdrop _ lighter than
O'Neal. O'Neal finished with 31 points, 12 rebounds and five
blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty,'' said O'Neal, showing a flair for
understatement, ``but we did some key things down the stretch and
got the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Laker Dennis Rodman high-stepped off the bench for a
season-high 20 rebounds. Eddie Jones and backup center Elden
Campbell, on the hook at press time as trade bait, contributed 16
and 11 points, respectively. Kobe Bryant was reduced to 28 minutes
because of frequent fouling but contributed two big plays down the
stretch and finished with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have nothing to lose at this point,'' Bryant said,
perhaps unaware that the Clippers have 34 more games remaining.
``There's no pressure. They can just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper who did the most playing was rookie free agent
Tyrone Nesby, who scored 13 of his 16 points in the opening half.
Included in his catalog of fearless maneuvers was an attempt to
slam dunk over O'Neal. The only slamming was done by O'Neal, who
was credited with a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inconclusive act of defiance by Nesby, but it did
demonstrate that a least some Clippers refuse to go gently into the
record books. Unfortunately, they also refused to go gently at the
free-throw line, missing 11 of 15 attempts in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have to nail the free throws,'' Nesby said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easier if they had the hammer.

 SCIENTISTS FIND EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF VIOLENT SOLAR STORMS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists studying violent electrical storms that erupt from
the surface of the sun say they have discovered the first warning
signs that could help them prepare for the potentially destructive
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Hurling more than 10 billion tons of hot, electrically charged
gases from the sun's surface, the storms carry the equivalent of a
billion atom bombs and travel at speeds of up to 1 million mph.
</P>
<P>
   If the powerful storms head toward Earth they can expose
spacecraft crews to radiation, endanger sensitive electronics in
unmanned satellites, trigger blackouts along electric power grids,
and disrupt communications around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The bursts from the sun's surface take nearly four days to reach
Earth. But an international team of researchers reported Tuesday
that S-shaped structures that form in some storms on the solar
surface can provide an extra three or four days of early warning
before an eruption occurs.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reported that the S-shaped regions of
electromagnetic activity _ called coronal mass ejections, because
they originate from electrical storms in the sun's corona, or outer
atmosphere _ are closely correlated with the most violent
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``early warning'' of impending eruptions, they said,
appears to be signaled when sunspots in the sun's inner atmosphere,
the photosphere, are unusually large.
</P>
<P>
   Storms on the solar surface that do not show the S-shaped
sigmoids are very unlikely to erupt dangerously, as are sunspots of
normal size, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific team, headed by physicist Richard Canfield of the
University of Montana, described its findings Tuesday at a NASA
press conference in Washington, D.C. A detailed report is also
being published in the March 15 issue of the journal Geophysical
Research Letters.
</P>
<P>
   The sigmoids on the sun's surface were detected by an unmanned
Japanese satellite whose instruments, developed by U.S., British
and Japanese scientists, are tuned to X-ray frequencies. The
researchers spent two years examining fiery images of all the
coronal mass ejections from the sun taken by the satellite in the
years 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If the storms appeared merely as irregularly shaped patches of
storm activity, they did not turn into major eruptions, Canfield
said. But when they assumed the sigmoid shape, they turned into far
more violent blasts within three or four days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The S-shaped areas are huge: typically 50,000 to 100,00 miles
long on the sun's surface, and 10 to 20 times larger than the
average sunspot. They can remain on the surface for several months,
observable month after month as the sun rotates on its axis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those X-ray images will tell us when something is likely to
happen,'' Canfield said. ``As soon as we can recognize that a
region is S-shaped, we know that it is more likely to erupt. They
could be developed into a powerful predictive tool, and we could go
from three or four days of warning to six or seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although power companies on Earth can usually protect their
grids from the intense surges of energy caused by solar storms,
many of the delicate electronic instruments aboard satellites can
be extremely vulnerable to damage from the electromagnetic energy.
And astronauts _ whether they fly in low-Earth orbit, as the crews
of the U.S. space shuttle and the Russian Mir do, or head farther
out to the moon and beyond _ can be endangered both by radiation
from the solar blasts and by damage to their spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The advance notice would allow satellite operators, for
instance, to shut down high-voltage equipment that is vulnerable to
the magnetic storms and give utility companies time to protect
valuable transformers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the effects of coronal mass ejections are dangerous,
however. The streams of charged particles from some &LR; ;s ahY[ can
interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce the aurora
borealis and aurora australis _ the beautifully shimmering northern
and southern lights that enchant residents of the far North as well
as Alaska-bound tourists.

 FEINSTEIN AIMS TO TIGHTEN GUN BAN  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced
legislation Tuesday to close a loophole in the 4-year-old assault
weapons ban that allows millions of rounds of ammunition to be
imported into the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before an arsenal of assault weapons and ammunition,
Feinstein called it ``illogical and irresponsible'' to permit
foreign companies to sell items that domestic companies are
prohibited from selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stopped the flow of these clips from domestic
manufacturers _ it is only common sense that we must now stop the
flow from foreign manufacturers as well,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation marks the latest effort by the former San
Francisco mayor to impose restrictions on rapid-fire assault
weapons. Her assault weapons ban, passed in late 1994, prohibited
the sale of clips that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies, however, have taken advantage of a loophole
that permits the sale of clips manufactured prior to 1994. While
domestic producers must date their ammunition, many foreign
producers do not, making it impossible for the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to enforce the prohibition, Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF estimates that since the the ban took effect, 128
million rounds of ammunition have been imported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now four years after the ban went into effect,''
Feinstein said, ``more than enough time to use up any clips
manufactured prior to the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that her staff was able to order a 75-round, foreign-made
clip over the Internet in a matter of minutes, Feinstein said:
``These deadly high-capacity clips are all too accessible for
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein introduced a similar measure during the last
legislative session that attracted just 46 votes. Asked Tuesday who
opposes her legislation, Feinstein responded: ``Moses and his
cohorts _ Charleton Heston and the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston is president of the National Rifle Association. No one
from the NRA was available to comment on the legislation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a strong opponent of
the assault weapons ban, said it is entirely possible that some
overseas manufacturers still have stockpiles of old clips that are
completely legal and legitimate to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein announced her legislation surrounded by law
enforcement officials and fellow politicians in a Senate office
building. As television cameras recorded the scene, Feinstein
picked up automatic weapons and displayed how easy it is to load
the imported clips.
</P>
<P>
   She was accompanied by San Diego Mayor Susan Golding, and Rep.
Diana DeGette, D-Colo., who is sponsoring a companion measure in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no purpose for these clips other than to kill
people,'' DeGette said. The measure did not even come to the House
floor for a vote last year, but DeGette said she was hopeful the
GOP's narrow six-seat majority would make it more difficult for
them to thwart the latest effort.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the news conference was Oakland Deputy Police
Chief Brad Kearns, who said it was an imported clip that killed
Oakland police officer James Williams on January 10.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been searching for a weapon along Interstate 580
when a sniper opened fire using an AK-47 style rifle produced in
Hungary, along with two Chinese-made foreign clips. A bullet
pierced Williams' bullet proof vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so sudden, so violent, so quick, it was over before
they even knew what happened,'' Kearns said. ``Legislation to ban
these types of clips is long overdue.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinhip clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

<P>
   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over a weekend last August some 700 enthusiasts arrived for the
society's founding convention held at the University Memorial
Center. They are passionate about getting to Mars. And for many,
paradoxically, the very attraction of Mars is that it is distant
and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Zubrin is working himself up to the climax
of his opening address to the conference. He has told the assembled
throng how to get to Mars; now he's telling them why to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind, says Zubrin, has always grown through adversity. Only
with a new frontier to conquer will we rise to greater
technological and human heights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience knows this stuff. It's been reiterated in
Zubrin's many speeches over the past decade. It's in his book,
``The Case for Mars,'' the response to which inspired him to start
the Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, while working at Martin Marietta in Denver,
Zubrin came up with a new way to get people to Mars that looked
remarkably cheap. The key lay in tackling Mars as two separate
problems _ getting there and getting back.
</P>
<P>
   The first could be solved with existing technology; the second
could be managed with a crewless mission that could make fuel for
the return journey on the Martian surface before the first
explorers even left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin and his colleague David Baker called this plan ``Mars
Direct'' because the spacecraft involved would be small enough to
be launched to Mars straight from Cape Canaveral. And Zubrin set
out to get it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional'' plans for crewed Mars missions involved huge
spacecraft built in orbit. These, to Zubrin, are the Death Stars _
too big, too slow to develop, and too expensive ever to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Death Stars were NASA's Mars missions of
choice. Now, in large part thanks to Zubrin's efforts, NASA talks
of a much more feasible mission, ``Mars semi-direct,'' but it's
just talk. NASA has no active plans for putting people on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So, having made the case to aerospace engineers that we can get
to Mars, Zubrin wants to convince the rest of the world that we
should. That's where the Mars Society comes in. It's a lobby, a
scientific network, maybe something of a cult. Its members in
Boulder are predominantly male, mostly American and overwhelmingly
white. Some are scientists devoted to Mars, others are aerospace
engineers, artists, priests and many are just believers who have
read Zubrin's book and want to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zubrin is neutral on the question of government on
Mars, there's a fair amount of antigovernment rhetoric during the
convention weekend. Edward Hudgins, a libertarian from the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., gave a paper on a Martian utopia
with no central government. Most of the antigovernment views stem
not from a deeply felt ideological view like Hudgins' but from
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of Mars is not just that it is attainable, it is
that many people think it should already have been attained. The
literature of their youth told them so. And yet since the successes
of Apollo there has been not just stasis in space exploration but
retreat. Feeling let down by government, many would-be Martians
turn to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. One is that no private company
will put up the funds to go to Mars without cheaper, more reliable
space technology and the promise of real profit. The second is that
for quite a few of the convention participants, a lot of this stuff
is simply not fitting. Do you really want to go to Mars as a TV
show? Sponsored by Tang?
</P>
<P>
   In the original Mars underground, in much of science fiction and
in the Mars Society, the idea of Mars having once fostered life has
become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

 By KAREN WRIGHT  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>

   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of

heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.

<P>
   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over a weekend last August some 700 enthusiasts arrived for the
society's founding convention held at the University Memorial
Center. They are passionate about getting to Mars. And for many,
paradoxically, the very attraction of Mars is that it is distant
and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Zubrin is working himself up to the climax
of his opening address to the conference. He has told the assembled
throng how to get to Mars; now he's telling them why to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind, says Zubrin, has always grown through adversity. Only
with a new frontier to conquer will we rise to greater
technological and human heights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience knows this stuff. It's been reiterated in
Zubrin's many speeches over the past decade. It's in his book,
``The Case for Mars,'' the response to which inspired him to start
the Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, while working at Martin Marietta in Denver,
Zubrin came up with a new way to get people to Mars that looked
remarkably cheap. The key lay in tackling Mars as two separate
problems _ getting there and getting back.
</P>
<P>
   The first could be solved with existing technology; the second
could be managed with a crewless mission that could make fuel for
the return journey on the Martian surface before the first
explorers even left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin and his colleague David Baker called this plan ``Mars
Direct'' because the spacecraft involved would be small enough to
be launched to Mars straight from Cape Canaveral. And Zubrin set
out to get it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional'' plans for crewed Mars missions involved huge
spacecraft built in orbit. These, to Zubrin, are the Death Stars _
too big, too slow to develop, and too expensive ever to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Death Stars were NASA's Mars missions of
choice. Now, in large part thanks to Zubrin's efforts, NASA talks
of a much more feasible mission, ``Mars semi-direct,'' but it's
just talk. NASA has no active plans for putting people on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So, having made the case to aerospace engineers that we can get
to Mars, Zubrin wants to convince the rest of the world that we
should. That's where the Mars Society comes in. It's a lobby, a
scientific network, maybe something of a cult. Its members in
Boulder are predominantly male, mostly American and overwhelmingly
white. Some are scientists devoted to Mars, others are aerospace
engineers, artists, priests and many are just believers who have
read Zubrin's book and want to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zubrin is neutral on the question of government on
Mars, there's a fair amount of antigovernment rhetoric during the
convention weekend. Edward Hudgins, a libertarian from the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., gave a paper on a Martian utopia
with no central government. Most of the antigovernment views stem
not from a deeply felt ideological view like Hudgins' but from
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of Mars is not just that it is attainable, it is
that many people think it should already have been attained. The
literature of their youth told them so. And yet since the successes
of Apollo there has been not just stasis in space exploration but
retreat. Feeling let down by government, many would-be Martians
turn to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. One is that no private company
will put up the funds to go to Mars without cheaper, more reliable
space technology and the promise of real profit. The second is that
for quite a few of the convention participants, a lot of this stuff
is simply not fitting. Do you really want to go to Mars as a TV
show? Sponsored by Tang?
</P>
<P>
   In the original Mars underground, in much of science fiction and
in the Mars Society, the idea of Mars having once fostered life has
become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited Spirit Cave Man, in a museum laboratory on
the outskirts of Carson City, Nev., that smell served as a pungent
reminder that I was not inspecting just another Paleo-Indian
artifact. I was in the presence of a human being whose story, along
with that of his ancestors, is as intriguing as his mummified
remains _ and so far, just as incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   When Spirit Cave Man was unearthed in 1940 from a dry
rock-shelter in western Nevada, his discoverers assumed that he had
been buried a couple of thousand years ago. But in 1994,
radiocarbon dating of his bones and hair put his age closer to
9,400 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional textbook interpretation has the first human
populations coming over into the New World about 11,500 years
ago,'' says Doug Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the National
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, the story goes, trekked across the Bering
land bridge from the Old World into the New in search of happier
hunting grounds, then made their way south between retreating
sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of this time period, you imagine those people
running around chasing big game, wearing skins, throwing spears,
looking like today's Siberians,'' Owsley says. ``That probably
isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spirit Cave Man, it certainly isn't true: not the skins, not
the spears, and not the modern Siberian looks. He did not wear
primitive skin clothing; instead he wore a carefully constructed
blanket woven from thin, twisted strips of rabbit pelt and cords of
hemp. The contents of his abdominal cavity reveal that his last
meal was fish, not game.
</P>
<P>
   From the shape of Spirit Cave Man's skull, it's clear that he
had a longer, narrower head, flatter cheekbones and a more
prominent chin than those typical of both northern Asians and
Native Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   But Spirit Cave Man and his contemporaries aren't the only ones
challenging old textbook scenarios. In 1997 a renegade archeologist
published convincing evidence of human occupation in southern Chile
that predates by a thousand years any well-established site in
North America _ in particular, the site in Clovis, N.M., that has
long been the oldest undisputed human settlement this side of the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent archeological findings hint that the first
Americans may have arrived by sea rather than by land. Studies of
Native American genes suggest that people have called the New World
home for 20,000 years or longer _ maybe much longer. And
archeologists working in North and South America claim to have
found signs of these proto-pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent techniques for radiocarbon dating allow researchers to
retrieve age estimates from minuscule samples of organic material _
like human bones _ without doing much damage. And personal
computers enable anthropologists to perform mathematically
sophisticated comparisons of skull shapes among different
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Owsley and his colleague Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville have spent 20 years compiling a database of
craniometric profiles of modern Native American tribes in the Great
Plains, Great Basin and Southwest regions of the United States. By
comparing the dimensions of a given skull with these profiles, they
can often tell which people the deceased most resembles, and who,
in turn, his ancestors might be.
</P>
<P>
   But when Owsley and Jantz examined some of the oldest North
American remains, the skulls didn't provide the kinship clues they
expected. Measurements from Spirit Cave Man and two Minnesota
skulls _ one 7,900 and the other 8,700 years old _ were off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were impressed with how different the older skulls are from
any of the modern-day groups,'' Owsley says. ``They do not have the
broad faces, they do not have the big, prominent cheekbones that
you think of as the more traditional features of the Chinese and
American Indians.'' Instead they looked more like the inhabitants
of, say, Indonesia, or even Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, most prehistoric Americans don't really look like
anyone alive today, and they don't all look like each other,
either. According to Owsley, Spirit Cave Man's closest match might
be found among the Ainu, the indigenous people of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists contend that the founding populations of
first Americans came from somewhere in Asia more than 8,000 years
ago. They were small bands of hunter-gatherers who followed the
Bering land bridge in search of food and established scattered
outposts in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence of far earlier immigration into the
Americas, and it doesn't come from skulls. Southern Chile is home
to an extraordinary archeological site called Monte Verde.
Excavated by Tom Dillehay of the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, the Monte Verde artifacts convinced most archeologists
that humans set up camp in the nether regions of South America some
12,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans, whoever they were, left a confounding
heritage, one that makes even the most modern analytical techniques
look primitive. The New World may have been settled long ago, but
the way it happened is still uncharted territory.

   Not long ago we thought the first humans in the New World were
mammoth hunters from Siberia who crossed the Bering Strait at the
end of the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are learning, none of that may be true. Spirit Cave Man
is one of a dozen or so early Americans who are helping rewrite the
prehistory of human habitation in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect someone who has been dead for more than 9,000
years to have any odor left, nor do you expect him to have any hair
or skin or clothes left, either, and Spirit Cave Man has all of
those: long, soft brown hair, gray skin the texture of parchment,
and shoes crafted from animal hide and lined with bulrushes. Though
little of his flesh remains, his smell _ a musty, thick sweetness _
is wholly intact.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``Mars,'' the physicist and science-fiction author Gregory
Benford tells me, ``is like the moon'' _ he pauses for effect _
``with bad weather.''
</P>
<P>
   We're sitting close to the mountain creek that runs through
Boulder, Colorado. We are sampling, in Sunday lunchtime moderation,
the various offerings of one of the town's oldest microbreweries,
and if you avoid the beer made with blueberries, this is about as
nice a setup as the planet has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, up the hill on the campus of the University of Colo.,
hundreds of earnest people are talking about the need to head out
for Mars _ a place that, as Benford points out, is not just nastier
than idyllic Boulder. It's nastier than anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s a bunch of graduate students and fellow travelers
started holding conferences about Mars here. When NASA was
resolutely ignoring the Red Planet to concentrate on space
shuttles, this Mars underground was dedicated to telling the world
how scientifically vital and technologically feasible Mars
exploration was.
</P>
<P>
   Now aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin is trying to turn the
enthusiasm of those ``Case for Mars'' conferences into a mass
movement, a new Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   Over a weekend last August some 700 enthusiasts arrived for the
society's founding convention held at the University Memorial
Center. They are passionate about getting to Mars. And for many,
paradoxically, the very attraction of Mars is that it is distant
and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Zubrin is working himself up to the climax
of his opening address to the conference. He has told the assembled
throng how to get to Mars; now he's telling them why to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind, says Zubrin, has always grown through adversity. Only
with a new frontier to conquer will we rise to greater
technological and human heights.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience knows this stuff. It's been reiterated in
Zubrin's many speeches over the past decade. It's in his book,
``The Case for Mars,'' the response to which inspired him to start
the Mars Society.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, while working at Martin Marietta in Denver,
Zubrin came up with a new way to get people to Mars that looked
remarkably cheap. The key lay in tackling Mars as two separate
problems _ getting there and getting back.
</P>
<P>
   The first could be solved with existing technology; the second
could be managed with a crewless mission that could make fuel for
the return journey on the Martian surface before the first
explorers even left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin and his colleague David Baker called this plan ``Mars
Direct'' because the spacecraft involved would be small enough to
be launched to Mars straight from Cape Canaveral. And Zubrin set
out to get it accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional'' plans for crewed Mars missions involved huge
spacecraft built in orbit. These, to Zubrin, are the Death Stars _
too big, too slow to develop, and too expensive ever to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Death Stars were NASA's Mars missions of
choice. Now, in large part thanks to Zubrin's efforts, NASA talks
of a much more feasible mission, ``Mars semi-direct,'' but it's
just talk. NASA has no active plans for putting people on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   So, having made the case to aerospace engineers that we can get
to Mars, Zubrin wants to convince the rest of the world that we
should. That's where the Mars Society comes in. It's a lobby, a
scientific network, maybe something of a cult. Its members in
Boulder are predominantly male, mostly American and overwhelmingly
white. Some are scientists devoted to Mars, others are aerospace
engineers, artists, priests and many are just believers who have
read Zubrin's book and want to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zubrin is neutral on the question of government on
Mars, there's a fair amount of antigovernment rhetoric during the
convention weekend. Edward Hudgins, a libertarian from the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., gave a paper on a Martian utopia
with no central government. Most of the antigovernment views stem
not from a deeply felt ideological view like Hudgins' but from
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of Mars is not just that it is attainable, it is
that many people think it should already have been attained. The
literature of their youth told them so. And yet since the successes
of Apollo there has been not just stasis in space exploration but
retreat. Feeling let down by government, many would-be Martians
turn to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two problems here. One is that no private company
will put up the funds to go to Mars without cheaper, more reliable
space technology and the promise of real profit. The second is that
for quite a few of the convention participants, a lot of this stuff
is simply not fitting. Do you really want to go to Mars as a TV
show? Sponsored by Tang?
</P>
<P>
   In the original Mars underground, in much of science fiction and
in the Mars Society, the idea of Mars having once fostered life has
become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

become inextricably bound to the dream of getting it to do so
again. ``Terraforming'' is the most literal-minded working out of
the proposition that Mars can be a New World _ and it is a New
World where ideals begin to clash, as they did at the convention's
open forum on terraforming.
</P>
<P>
   To anti-Edenists, like Zubrin _ who made up most of the platform
at the session _ terraforming is the frontier we need. To the
arcadians, who view Mars as a beautiful blank slate where something
new and better can start, such talk is dangerous: Manifest Destiny
was a slogan of 19th-century American genocide and racism. Mars,
they say, is a fresh start, a place to get away from guilty
historical baggage. It deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Society's disagreements over terraforming are
relatively small. For the time being, their dreams, even if they do
not all match each other, are enough to unite the membership.
</P>
<P>
   They left the convention with pledges to recruit members, lobby
for missions, protest budget cuts and argue the case for Mars to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, they hope to set up a small base
in the Canadian Arctic by next year as a prototype for aspects of
Mars exploration.

 &HT;    Monica not 'used,' just the nation
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's get this straight: The day
President Clinton apologized to the nation but not to Monica
Lewinsky, the poor thing felt dirty and used.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, who considered herself the president's ``sexual
soulmate,'' is sorry for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, she didn't intend to cause the president
public embarrassment. She was fully prepared to lie in the Paula
Jones investigation. That would be ``like putting on a team
jersey.'' Really? To play offense, defense or both?
</P>
<P>
   I gleaned these meager details from the pre- and post-hype of
Barbara Walters' tour through the sewers of Monica's mind last week
on 20/20. What I know of this excursion is secondhand. I refused to
watch. Instead, I spent the evening listening to the liquid gold
soprano of Kathleen Battle and five accompanists who rendered every
note a musical adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But even had I stayed home, I would not have watched. I see no
redeeming value in further examination of this woman, who doesn't
seem to have a clue as to how action yields consequences or that
one can talk too much. I also am convinced that she's already had
far more public exposure of her private parts than is good for her
or the rest of us. We have arrived at a precipitous point in public
propriety and lingered there so long that we can no longer
distinguish between analyzing the news and stirring in filth. Proof
of our desperation is evident when such a respected journalist as
Ms. Walters _ under pretense of enlightening viewers about
important matters _ fawns over an egotistical, spoiled child-woman,
encouraging her to service us with titillating details of past
sexual exploits.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks prior to the broadcast, Ms. Walters was widely
acclaimed for having ``won'' ``the interview of the century,'' more
appropriately the booby prize of trash journalism. With her usual
aplomb, Ms. Walters prepared the public for the unveiling of the
full Monica by stating unequivocally that she found her to be a
``very smart, very articulate girl in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   How smart do you have to be to lift your skirt and flash your
thong? How articulate do you have to be to master the art of phone
sex? Apparently, Ms. Lewinsky developed the poise and
self-confidence that so impressed Ms. Walters over the duration of
at least three affairs, two with married men. Consider also the
elaborate preparations made to spotlight Monica's interview. A
group of viewers was wired to an electronic machine to
scientifically record their reactions on a graph. Would stations
pay for such an analysis on the issue of public schools? Even
Nightline, a program of the highest journalistic integrity, was
scheduled to devote its first post-interview segment to a follow-up
of the perils of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The morning shows followed suit by inviting varied experts to
analyze Monica's performance. At no point did any network official
or respected news anchor say what desperately needed to be said,
``This craziness has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. About 70 million people watched. According to The
Washington Post, a 30-second ad spot during the Monica interview
went for $800,000 _ four times the usual rate. Given that kind of
profit incentive, we can expect more dirt-as-analysis journalism.
</P>
<P>
   And we will get it. Diane Sawyer has interviewed Charles
Manson's women so we can share their memories of the slaughter of
pregnant movie star Sharon Tate and her house guests in 1969. Thank
God Ted Bundy is dead, or he would be the subject of an interview
during the next TV sweeps period. Increasingly, only the
sensational and bizarre seems to command mass public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we don't need censorship. Our greatest need is to
demonstrate the sense and self-discipline required to stop buying
salacious trash as important news. Our appetite for such garbage
convinces those who show contempt for morality that they have
legitimacy in society.

 &HT;    Creative film funding
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Action. Lights. Camera. Oil filter.
</P>
<P>
   Austin filmmaker Steve Mims is auctioning off his 1980 Honda
Civic on the Internet to help pay for the low budget film he's
about to introduce at the South by Southwest Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should know that the air conditioner blows cold,'' said
Steve, who also owns a 10-year-old Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Steve is borrowing $20,000 to pay for the final print of his
film, ``The Perfect Specimen.'' To help repay the loan, he's
selling the older car, which is not a perfect specimen.
</P>
<P>
   Steve says State Farm Insurance has declared the '80 Civic
totalled twice, after two different wrecks. Something tells me
Steve isn't going to get quite $20,000 for this car, unless
somebody like Michael Dell has a weak moment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if Steve could get Sandra Bullock to sit on the hood it
would jack up the bidding war. ``We could just auction off the warm
spot,'' Steve said. But that's not likely to happen because Steve
doesn't know Sandra Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   The car has a crinkled left front fender. ``If you see this car
in a movie, it's the one that's going to go off the cliff,'' Steve
said. Still, the Civic runs well.
</P>
<P>
   Steve says he will drive the car to the winning bidder. ``I have
sworn I'll deliver this anywhere in North America,'' said Steve,
39. Let's hope he doesn't have to rent a tow truck to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Specimen,'' Steve's first feature, will have its
world premiere Sunday at South by Southwest at the Paramount
Theater. The movie is getting a fancier unveiling than the car.
Steve will show off the Honda at 1:30 p.m. today at a press
conference at Putt-Putt Golf &AMP; Games at 6700 Burnet Road.
</P>
<P>
   You can get in on the auction _ it starts Thursday at noon _ by
calling up ebay.com, Steve said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far as we know, nobody has ever done this,'' Steve added.
And I'll bet that includes Cecil B. De Mille.
</P>
<P>
   I drove the car. My big problem with it is that it doesn't have
an outside rearview mirror. ``But it used to,'' Steve said. Now
there's a selliing point.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Steve's new movie is a romantic comedy about two
young people whose desires are interrupted by technology.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they try to drive this heap to a cheap motel and
the engine bursts into flames en route? That's not the plot, Steve
says.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Steve doesn't expect to get the $20,000 he needs from
the auction. Steve and his friends have a pool going on what the
actual bid will be. The guesses on the high bid range from $400 to
$2,200.
</P>
<P>
   The car fits the movie, however. ``The Perfect Specimen,''
filmed at various locations around town, including the Continental
Club, was an extremely low- budget venture, Steve says. For
example, a tuxedo company loaned him the tuxes for the prom scene
that he filmed at the Texas School for the Deaf.
</P>
<P>
   I drove the 19-year-old Civic to Howdy Honda in South Austin to
see what I could get for it. Hey, a sharp talker like me might be
able to settle this deal before we have to go to all the trouble to
auction the car, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you said the name of the film is ``The Perfect Specimen?''
said used car sales manager Steven Walker, laughing a lot as he
looked the car over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In real money to a dealer, this car is probably a $700-$800
car,'' he said. ``But a dealer wouldn't even keep this car. They'd
sell it to a second-chance dealer on South Congress. What would
happen is they'd put '$1,995' on the windshield, then they'd take
$200 down and charge him $25 a week until it blew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, in the case of this car, might not be too long.

 &HT;    Things you can learn during a blizzard
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Being snowbound has its advantages. I have, for
instance, recently learned everything I could ever want to know
about Stonewall Jackson and Grand Funk Railroad. Everything and
more.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you longed for some time to sit down, relax
and converse with your spouse? During the recent inclemencies, Jim
and I have had the opportunity to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful what you pray for.
</P>
<P>
   Last time we were snowbound, Jim buried himself in a 9,000-page
biography of Stonewall Jackson. This time, he's on a spree of
watching VH1 biographies of aging pop stars you were only too
grateful to have forgotten _ the Bee Gees, Leif Garrett, Grand Funk
Railroad _pointing out with glee that the hair bands of the '70s
are losing their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, as I brushed my teeth, Jim regaled me with some
convoluted story about how Grand Funk Railroad, opening for Led
Zeppelin in the summer of '69, whipped the crowd into such a frenzy
that the Led Zeppelin folks pulled the plug. Literally. They shut
off the electricity and the concert degenerated into a riot. ``Here
they were, 20 years old, from Flint, Mich.,'' Jim chuckled, ``and
they blew Led Zeppelin off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   I spat out my toothpaste. ``Frankly, my dear, I don't care if
they set their pants on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last blizzard, I learned what kind of grades
Stonewall brought home on his second-grade report card. I learned
that he sweated so much during the oral entrance exam at West
Point, he left a puddle on the floor. After a while I knew more
about Stonewall Jackson than I knew about myself, but Jim refused
to cease and desist. ``Did you know that, during the Shenandoah
Valley campaigns, Stonewall Jackson defeated three Union armies,
each of which was larger than his?''
</P>
<P>
   My eyes glazed over. ``And,'' he persisted, ``his tactics are
still being taught at military academies worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Jim is, normally, a scintillating
conversationalist, so long as you catch him on the right topic.
Fortunately, the night we met _ 12 years ago at a Christmas party _
he talked books.
</P>
<P>
   Jim spotted me at the hors d'oeuvres table and boldly made his
way over. He was on a reading spree then, too, but luckily not a
biography of an eccentric zealot on the wrong side of the Civil
War, but the collected works of Sinclair Lewis. ``Wow! What a
guy!'' I thought. ``He reads the classics for fun.'' He looked cute
in a flannel shirt and blue jeans. I made a mental note to marry
him.
</P>
<P>
   We often speculate about what would have happened if he had
picked one of his other favorite topics _ cars, for instance, or
reminiscences of obscure childhood events. Or, worse yet, a
combination: The '64 Mercury he had as a child, with the window
that slanted backwards. What if I had enthralled him with a
treatise on journalism ethics or gossip about newspaper pals he'd
never met?
</P>
<P>
   We'd have grabbed one more Swedish meatball and beat a hasty
retreat from the hors d'oeuvres table, in search of the next Mr. or
Ms. Charming. Our children would have had to find other parents.
I'd have gone through life as a Stonewall Jackson illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, things could have turned out a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   He could have watched The Sonny and Cher Story.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a lot in the news last year about a commercial
videotape version of a home movie of President Kennedy's
assassination. Supposedly it was to be made available to the
public. Where can I get a copy?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to ``Image of an Assassination: A New Look
at the Zapruder Film,'' a 45-minute, digitally enhanced version of
an 8-mm home movie Abraham Zapruder made Nov. 22, 1963, when
Kennedy's motorcade passed the Texas School Book Depository and
Dealey Plaza in Dallas. If you can't find it at a video store, one
option is to try Blockbuster Entertainment, 1-800-800-6767. A
representative can tell you which Blockbuster location near you has
it. We were told that it can be ordered for purchase at any
Blockbuster store by referring to film 634853.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is in charge of the American Red Cross, now that
Elizabeth Dole has resigned as president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steve Bullock, chief executive officer of the organization's
Greater Cleveland (Ohio) Chapter, has been serving as acting
president since Dole announced her resignation Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the eradication of polio is expected by next
year. I always understood that Rotary Clubs were involved in this
worldwide effort, but that wasn't mentioned. Can you explain the
Rotary's role?
</P>
<P>
   A: Much of the impetus and money that has gone into quashing
polio did indeed come from Evanston, Ill.-based Rotary
International. Polio vaccines developed in the United States in the
1950s and early '60s virtually rid the United States and Western
Europe of the disease by the 1970s. But only 5 percent of all Third
World children were immunized by then, and polio continued to cut
down millions. In the 1980s, a coalition of international agencies
launched a plan to finally make the vaccines available to all
children.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Rotary International came into the picture. In
1988, as the plan to destroy polio came together, Rotary raised
$400 million to help it along. The Rotary money _ which bought
vaccines to immunize more than a billion children _ has been a
handy stick that Rotary has used to keep squabbling at a minimum
among agencies, governments and experts as they struggle toward the
goal. So Rotary indeed did play a role, and a crucial one, to bring
an end to the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Deviled eggs are a favorite treat at family gatherings. Where
does the ``devil'' part come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: In cookery, to ``devil'' a food item means simply to prepare
it with hot or savory seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to singer Tommy Edwards of ``It's All in
the Game'' fame? A brief part of the song is in the current movie,
``October Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The rhythm and blues singer, pianist and songwriter died in
October 1969 at age 47. ``It's All in the Game'' was his biggest
hit, peaking at No. 1 in October 1958 and staying on the charts for
22 weeks. Edwards recorded more than a dozen songs, but only three
others made the Top 20 list: ``Please Mr. Sun,'' ``Love Is All We
Need'' and ``I Really Don't Want to Know.'' The 1958 version of
``It's All in the Game'' was a rerecording by Edwards of his own
1951 hit, a feat that started a rush of rerecordings by various
artists.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a bet-you-didn't-know tidbit: The melody to ``Game''
was written in 1912 by Charles Dawes, who later would become
President Calvin Coolidge's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the digits in the three sequences of a Social
Security number represent?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first three digits indicate the state shown in the
mailing address on the original application. The lowest Social
Security numbers were assigned to the New England states, and the
numbers grew progressively higher in the South and West. However,
in recent years this geographical relationship has been disrupted
somewhat by the need to allocate numbers out of sequence as state
populations changed.
</P>
<P>
   The middle two digits have no special significance, but serve to
break the numbers into blocks of convenient size. The last four
digits represent a straight numerical progression of assigned
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent voter unrest in Africa brings to mind the Mau Mau
rebel violence of the 1950s. What present-day country or countries
constitute where the Mau Mau were then?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mau Mau African nationalist movement originated among the
Kikuyu people of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported on TV that a 1943 penny was worth half a
million dollars. Can you provide any information about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: That item generated considerable interest from people who
have pennies from this era. But the American Numismatic Association
says the most ever paid for a 1943 penny was $86,500, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story, however, as reported initially by the AP: Zane
Mangum, owner of Mangum's Automotive near McCall, Idaho, had a 1943
copper penny, known among collectors as a ``wheatie.'' It was a
rare coin _ only about 40 were created, because copper was too
valuable in wartime for such use _ that Mangum had had for about 14
years. Mangum said he had been told by collectors that the last
time one of these pennies was sold, in 1981, it went for $10,000.
Estimates that he received recently said the penny could fetch more
than $100,000, and possibly $500,000, if sold at auction, he told
the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mangum, last August he apparently mixed the
rare coin with his regular change and spent it. He said he wanted
his story published in hopes of ending the sick feeling he gets
when he thinks about the penny.
</P>
<P>
   The television report in Atlanta said magnets won't attract the
copper pennies, as they will the steel pennies minted that same
year. But a coin expert has warned that some 1943 steel pennies
were coated with copper. The best advice to people people who think
their 1943 penny is rare to take it to a coin dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After Jordan's King Hussein died, I saw a report referring to
him as a Hashimite. What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Hashimite (also spelled Hashemite) is a member of any Arab
dynasty in the Middle East founded by Husein ibn-Ali or his
descendants. The line traces to the prophet Muhammad, a member of
the house of Hashim, a subdivision of the Quraysh tribe. The most
revered line of Hashimites passed through Hasan, son of the
prophet's daughter Fatimah, and her husband, Ali. The modern
Hashimite dynasty was founded by Faisal and Abdul Allah, the sons
of Husayn ibn Ali, emir of Mecca, who became kings of Iraq and
Jordan, respectively. The official name of Jordan, by the way, is
Al-Mamlakah Al-Urdiniyah Al-Hashimiyah (Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie ``L.A. Confidential,'' someone uses the
expression ``Q.T.,'' in the sense of ``hush, hush,'' as in when you
tell somebody something ``on the QT.'' Where does this come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: The initials stand for ``quiet,'' according to the Facts on
File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins. An early recorded use
was in a British ballad, circa 1870, containing this line:
``Whatever I tell you is on the Q.T.'' The expression gained more
popularity in 1891 when it appeared in a minstrel show
number,``Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay.'' According to accounts of the time,
London ``went stark mad'' over the refrain:
</P>
<P>
   A sweet Tuxedo girl you see,/ Queen of swell society,/
</P>
<P>
   Fond of fun as fun can be/ When it's on the strict Q.T./
</P>
<P>
   I'm not too young, I'm not too old,/ Not too timid, not too
bold, /
</P>
<P>
   Just the kind of sport I'm told _/ Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain a copy of the congressional ``Pig Book
Summary,'' which lists costly government spending projects that
benefit few people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those with Internet capability can read it at
http://www.cagw.org, the home page of Washington-based Citizens
Against Government Waste. Or call 1-800-BE-ANGRY (1-800-232-6479)
to order it for $5. Those who join CAGW for $25 get it free, along
with quarterly newsletters and other mailings, a spokeswoman said.
Information: Citizens Against Government Waste, 1301 Connecticut
Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20036.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My brother-in-law told me that Ghana is offering dual
citizenship for blacks living in the United States. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A representative of the Ghanaian Embassy in Washington said
there has been discussion on the matter of dual citizenship for
both Ghanaians wanting U.S. citizenship and U.S. citizens of any
race wanting Ghanaian citizenship, but nothing has been
implemented. She declined to speculate on a timetable or on the
outlook for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. State Department, the government of Ghana
at present recognizes dual nationality only for minors younger than
21. A dual national who enters Ghana with a Ghanaian passport is
treated as a Ghanaian citizen only, the State Department adds. If a
dual national Ghanaian-American enters Ghana on a Ghanaian passport
and is later arrested for any reason while there, the U.S. Embassy
normally is not notified of the arrest by Ghanaian authorities. As
a result, consular assistance for dual U.S.-Ghanaian citizens may
be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Embassy of Ghana, 202-686-4520.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent ``Jeopardy,'' one of the answers was that tons of
chicken feet are sent to China. What do the Chinese do with chicken
feet?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are cooked and eaten or used in recipes for such things
as chicken foot soup. You sometimes can find items like braised
chicken feet at Chinese restaurants in the United States, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received in change a 1999 quarter with the image of George
Washington on one side and a man on a horse, under the word
Delaware, on the other. Will all the states have such coins?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, eventually. Delaware is the first of the U.S. Mint's
``50 States Quarters Program,'' which will recognize all the states
over a 10-year period. Distribution of the Delaware coin began in
January. A series of five quarter-dollars with new reverses will be
issued each year through 2008, in the sequence that the states
entered the union. To date, designs have been selected for the
first five state quarters: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Georgia and Connecticut. The reverse side of the Delaware quarter
depicts Caesar Rodney on horseback en route to Philadelphia to cast
the tie-breaking vote in the Delaware delegation in favor of
independence in 1776. Information is available online at the U.S.
Mint's site: http://www.usmint.gov

<P>
   Q: I'm curious about Tubby Smith, the basketball coach at the
University of Kentucky. Is that his real name? Also, his son, who
played basketball for the University of Georgia Bulldogs, is called
G.G. Where does that come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: The real first name of both father and son is Orlando. The
son's full name is Orlando Guffrie Gibson Smith.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen anything in print lately about actress
Katharine Hepburn. Can you update those of us who are longtime
fans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hepburn, who will be 92 in May, keeps a low profile, having
moved permanently from her Manhattan townhouse to a mansion in Old
Saybrook, Conn. Her father, a Connecticut doctor, built the mansion
in the early part of the century. While Hepburn generally stays out
of public view, she does pop back into the news occasionally. In
October, for instance, the New York Post published an account of a
dinner visit with Hepburn by longtime friend and neighbor Max
Showalter. In it, Showalter, an actor and artist, said she was in
``wonderful condition'' and showed no signs of the acute stomach
flu that landed her in a hospital earlier last year.
</P>
<P>
   That same item included a comment by Ellsworth Grant, who lives
near Hepburn and who was married to her late sister, Marianne.
Grant said Hepburn walks a little and talks a little, but her
memory is pretty much gone. In an interview with the Boston Herald
the day after Hepburn's 91st birthday, her brother, Robert, said
she spent the birthday quietly. ``She doesn't like old age. She
doesn't particularly approve of old age.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Frank Wills, the security guard who
discovered the Watergate break-in during the Nixon administration?
I had heard he was unemployed and couldn't get a job.
</P>
<P>
   A: Wills was last known to be living in virtual obscurity in
South Carolina, having become almost a footnote in history since
his date with destiny at Washington's Watergate complex. It was on
June 17, 1972, when he noticed suspicious tape on a doorway of the
Democratic Party offices. He eventually called the District of
Columbia police, setting in motion a momentous chain of events that
included political burglary, conspiracy, obstruction of justice,
illegal use of the FBI and CIA, and illegal campaign contributions.
And brought down the presidency of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wills was the focus of media attention for a time, his
moment in the sun didn't last long. Comedian-activist Dick Gregory
put him to work for a while, and during the 1980s he drifted from
one security job to another. By 1990 he had returned to South
Carolina to take care of his invalid mother, living off her Social
Security and odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, on the 25th anniversary of the Watergate break-in,
Wills was interviewed by several newspapers. He admitted that he
had grown bitter and lashed out at political leaders and civil
rights groups that, he said, didn't help him during his
post-Watergate troubles. ``The people of the cause . . . not one of
them came to say: `Can we do anything to help you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles have mentioned a pay boost for active duty
and retired military personnel. Is this retroactive to Jan. 1 of
this year, or does it begin Jan. 1, 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pay raises and sweetened pensions contained in the
measure, called the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmens' and Marines' BIll
of Rights, would take effect Jan. 1, 2000. The Senate
overwhelmingly approved the bill Feb. 24. It authorizes a 4.8
percent raise next year, allots bonuses of up to 10.3 percent, and
provides for slightly better pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several weeks ago, a woman sailing solo in an
around-the-world race had to abandon her capsized boat in the South
Pacific. A competitor saved her. What was the end of the story?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, famed French sailor Isabelle Autissier was
still aboard the boat of Giovanni Soldini, the Italian sailor who
rescued her. The incident occured Feb. 15 when Autissier, competing
in the Around Alone sailboat race, was capsized by a huge wave.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier, the leader of the competition's third leg as it left
New Zealand and headed around Cape Horn, was saved thanks to a
revolutionary transmitter known as an Emergency Positioning Radio
Beacon. After her 60-foot vessel rolled onto its topside, remaining
afloat by virtue of an air pocket inside the hull, Autissier was so
confident that her emergency message would be heard that she
collected her lifesaving gear and went to sleep. Soldini, 200 miles
away when her beacon sounded, spent a day and a night to get to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Even that isn't the end of the story. Nine days after he rescued
Autissier, Soldini was diverted again to assist race leader Marc
Thiercelin, whose vessel was flooded when its broken mast punched a
hole in the deck. The 27,000-mile race, held every four years,
began in September in Charleston, S.C., and is expected to end in
late May.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall an article saying the Red Cross was investigating a
method of numbing a small area of a blood donor's arm with a patch.
Is that available yet? If they promise to get me numb, I'll promise
to give blood.
</P>
<P>
   A: The subject came up last year when Elizabeth Dole, then
president of the American Red Cross, was visiting Atlanta. Among
the projects talked about was a bandage called a ``numby'' that
would be applied to the spot on the donor's arm where the needle
was inserted to collect blood. The bandage would transfer just
enough anesthetic to the needle-stick area to numb it and allow for
a painless collection procedure. The numby is still in the research
phase, with implementation several years down the road, according
to the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that washing your hands with ordinary soap
doesn't get rid of bacteria. What about the new alcohol-based,
waterless hand sanitizers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Handwashing with soap is intended to remove bacteria from
skin surfaces by the action of the water, and not necessarily kill
them. The key is to wash thoroughly in water as hot as the hands
can stand comfortably, said Elizabeth Andrews, a professor and food
safety specialist at the University of Georgia Extension Service.
Rub hands together with lather for at least 20 seconds and dry with
a new paper towel. If necessary, use a brush for nails.
</P>
<P>
   Hand sanitizers can provide an extra measure of protection,
Andrews said, but they aren't necessary if proper hand-washing
techniques are followed. They work best on clean hands, anyway, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A has responded to several questions about Air Force One.
My question: Is there also a Marine One?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. If the president is, for example, aboard a Marine Corps
helicopter flying between the White House grounds and Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland, it goes by that designation. If it's a Navy
or Army craft, it would be Navy One or Army One. And by definition,
Air Force One has to be an Air Force aircraft and not, say, a
commercial airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that Lee Iacocca was going to market electric
bicycles. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The E-Bike is being manufactured by Los Angeles-based EV
Global Motors. Iacocca, former chairman of Chrysler Corp.,
describes his Light Electric Vehicles as ``an all-new breed,'' the
first of their kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The E-Bike has a sealed battery unit and electric hub motor,
with a thumb throttle allowing the rider to control its speed. It
operates in three modes: power only, letting the hub motor do all
the work; rider power, in which the motor is disengaged and the
rider pedals just like on a traditional bicycle; and combination,
which allows the battery power to supplement the rider's effort,
such as on hills or to maintain cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   The bike will be available in three versions, standard
(manufacturer's suggested retail price, $995), ``comfort'' ($1,145)
and ``touring'' ($1,295). Top speed is said to be 15 mph; cruising
range is 20 miles. A spokeswoman for EV Global Motors told Q&AMP;A that
the bikes will be available for sale in April. They will be sold
through automobile dealers, but they haven't yet been finalized.
Information: on the Internet, http://www.evglobal.com, or toll-free
at 1-800-871-4545.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Robert Shaw, after his death, won a Grammy for the best
choral performance of the year. Can you list his other Grammys?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maestro Shaw won 16 in all, said Meredith Harris, Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra spokeswoman. Before joining the ASO, he had won
these four: 1961, Bach, B-Minor Mass; 1964, Britten, ``Ceremony of
Carols''; 1965, Stravinsky, ``Symphony of Psalms'' and Poulenc,
``Gloria''; and 1967, Handel, ``Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ASO, these were the winners (some recordings received
two Grammys): 1986, Berlioz, ``Requiem'' (classical album and
choral performance); 1986, Faure, Suite from ``Pelleas and
Melisandre'' (orchestral); 1988, Hindemith, ``When Lilacs Last in
the Dooryard Bloom'd'' (choral); 1989, Verdi, ``Requiem,''/Opera
Choruses (classical album, choral performance); 1989, Rorem,
``String Symphony/Sunday Morning/Eagles'' (orchestral); 1990,
Britten, ``War Requiem'' (choral); 1991, Walton, ``Belshazzar's
Feast'' and Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms'' and ``Missa brevis''
(choral); 1998, Adams, ``Harmonium'' and Rachmaninov, ``The Bells''
(choral); 1999, Barber, ``Prayers of Kierkegaard,'' Vaughan
Williams, ``Dona Nobis Pacem,'' and Bartok, ``Cantata Profana''
(choral performance and classical album).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The NCAA Final Four basketball championship tournament will
be played in Indianapolis in 2000. How can I apply for tickets?
Also, can you list other Final Four sites after that?
</P>
<P>
   A: For information about tickets to the 2000 tournament, wait
until after March 30 and then call the NCAA's headquarters in
Overland Park, Kan., at 913-339-1906, to request an application.
Or, toward the end of March, check the NCAA's Web site,
http://www.ncaachampionships.com, and register there to have an
application sent to you. Other Final Four cities have been selected
through 2007: 2001, Minneapolis; 2002, Atlanta; 2003, New Orleans;
2004, San Antonio; 2005, St. Louis; 2006, Indianapolis again; and
2007, Atlanta again. This year's finals are being played in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A travel publication says Israel and the Occupied Territories
are on the State Department's advisory list for American travelers.
Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latest State Department advisory, dated Feb. 17, says
this: Although they have not been targeted for attack, U.S.
citizens have been injured or killed in past terrorist actions in
Israel, Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. The most recent attacks
have been in highly frequented shopping and pedestrian areas, and
on public buses. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General have warned
their employees and American citizens to exercise caution when
utilizing public transportation, and when in the vicinity of bus
stops and other crowded areas. Travelers should remain aware of
their immediate surroundings, and should not touch any suspicious
object.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations by Palestinians and Israelis have led to
confrontations and clashes with the police and military, with some
turning deadly. Stone throwing and other violence in the West Bank
and Gaza can occur without warning and can escalate quickly.
Hebron, in particular, presents a significant risk of confrontation
and should be avoided. In view of the continued potential of
violence, the State Department advises all American citizens to
exercise extreme caution when trveling to these areas.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department posts information online at
http://travel.state.gov/travelwarnings.html, or you can call
202-647-5225.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at

<P>
   Q: There was a lot in the news last year about a commercial
videotape version of a home movie of President Kennedy's
assassination. Supposedly it was to be made available to the
public. Where can I get a copy?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to ``Image of an Assassination: A New Look
at the Zapruder Film,'' a 45-minute, digitally enhanced version of
an 8-mm home movie Abraham Zapruder made Nov. 22, 1963, when
Kennedy's motorcade passed the Texas School Book Depository and
Dealey Plaza in Dallas. If you can't find it at a video store, one
option is to try Blockbuster Entertainment, 1-800-800-6767. A
representative can tell you which Blockbuster location near you has
it. We were told that it can be ordered for purchase at any
Blockbuster store by referring to film 634853.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is in charge of the American Red Cross, now that
Elizabeth Dole has resigned as president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Steve Bullock, chief executive officer of the organization's
Greater Cleveland (Ohio) Chapter, has been serving as acting
president since Dole announced her resignation Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the eradication of polio is expected by next
year. I always understood that Rotary Clubs were involved in this
worldwide effort, but that wasn't mentioned. Can you explain the
Rotary's role?
</P>
<P>
   A: Much of the impetus and money that has gone into quashing
polio did indeed come from Evanston, Ill.-based Rotary
International. Polio vaccines developed in the United States in the
1950s and early '60s virtually rid the United States and Western
Europe of the disease by the 1970s. But only 5 percent of all Third
World children were immunized by then, and polio continued to cut
down millions. In the 1980s, a coalition of international agencies
launched a plan to finally make the vaccines available to all
children.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Rotary International came into the picture. In
1988, as the plan to destroy polio came together, Rotary raised
$400 million to help it along. The Rotary money _ which bought
vaccines to immunize more than a billion children _ has been a
handy stick that Rotary has used to keep squabbling at a minimum
among agencies, governments and experts as they struggle toward the
goal. So Rotary indeed did play a role, and a crucial one, to bring
an end to the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Deviled eggs are a favorite treat at family gatherings. Where
does the ``devil'' part come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: In cookery, to ``devil'' a food item means simply to prepare
it with hot or savory seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to singer Tommy Edwards of ``It's All in
the Game'' fame? A brief part of the song is in the current movie,
``October Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The rhythm and blues singer, pianist and songwriter died in
October 1969 at age 47. ``It's All in the Game'' was his biggest
hit, peaking at No. 1 in October 1958 and staying on the charts for
22 weeks. Edwards recorded more than a dozen songs, but only three
others made the Top 20 list: ``Please Mr. Sun,'' ``Love Is All We
Need'' and ``I Really Don't Want to Know.'' The 1958 version of
``It's All in the Game'' was a rerecording by Edwards of his own
1951 hit, a feat that started a rush of rerecordings by various
artists.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a bet-you-didn't-know tidbit: The melody to ``Game''
was written in 1912 by Charles Dawes, who later would become
President Calvin Coolidge's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the digits in the three sequences of a Social
Security number represent?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first three digits indicate the state shown in the
mailing address on the original application. The lowest Social
Security numbers were assigned to the New England states, and the
numbers grew progressively higher in the South and West. However,
in recent years this geographical relationship has been disrupted
somewhat by the need to allocate numbers out of sequence as state
populations changed.
</P>
<P>
   The middle two digits have no special significance, but serve to
break the numbers into blocks of convenient size. The last four
digits represent a straight numerical progression of assigned
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent voter unrest in Africa brings to mind the Mau Mau
rebel violence of the 1950s. What present-day country or countries
constitute where the Mau Mau were then?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mau Mau African nationalist movement originated among the
Kikuyu people of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported on TV that a 1943 penny was worth half a
million dollars. Can you provide any information about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: That item generated considerable interest from people who
have pennies from this era. But the American Numismatic Association
says the most ever paid for a 1943 penny was $86,500, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story, however, as reported initially by the AP: Zane
Mangum, owner of Mangum's Automotive near McCall, Idaho, had a 1943
copper penny, known among collectors as a ``wheatie.'' It was a
rare coin _ only about 40 were created, because copper was too
valuable in wartime for such use _ that Mangum had had for about 14
years. Mangum said he had been told by collectors that the last
time one of these pennies was sold, in 1981, it went for $10,000.
Estimates that he received recently said the penny could fetch more
than $100,000, and possibly $500,000, if sold at auction, he told
the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mangum, last August he apparently mixed the
rare coin with his regular change and spent it. He said he wanted
his story published in hopes of ending the sick feeling he gets
when he thinks about the penny.
</P>
<P>
   The television report in Atlanta said magnets won't attract the
copper pennies, as they will the steel pennies minted that same
year. But a coin expert has warned that some 1943 steel pennies
were coated with copper. The best advice to people people who think
their 1943 penny is rare to take it to a coin dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After Jordan's King Hussein died, I saw a report referring to
him as a Hashimite. What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Hashimite (also spelled Hashemite) is a member of any Arab
dynasty in the Middle East founded by Husein ibn-Ali or his
descendants. The line traces to the prophet Muhammad, a member of
the house of Hashim, a subdivision of the Quraysh tribe. The most
revered line of Hashimites passed through Hasan, son of the
prophet's daughter Fatimah, and her husband, Ali. The modern
Hashimite dynasty was founded by Faisal and Abdul Allah, the sons
of Husayn ibn Ali, emir of Mecca, who became kings of Iraq and
Jordan, respectively. The official name of Jordan, by the way, is
Al-Mamlakah Al-Urdiniyah Al-Hashimiyah (Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie ``L.A. Confidential,'' someone uses the
expression ``Q.T.,'' in the sense of ``hush, hush,'' as in when you
tell somebody something ``on the QT.'' Where does this come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: The initials stand for ``quiet,'' according to the Facts on
File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins. An early recorded use
was in a British ballad, circa 1870, containing this line:
``Whatever I tell you is on the Q.T.'' The expression gained more
popularity in 1891 when it appeared in a minstrel show
number,``Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay.'' According to accounts of the time,
London ``went stark mad'' over the refrain:
</P>
<P>
   A sweet Tuxedo girl you see,/ Queen of swell society,/
</P>
<P>
   Fond of fun as fun can be/ When it's on the strict Q.T./
</P>
<P>
   I'm not too young, I'm not too old,/ Not too timid, not too
bold, /
</P>
<P>
   Just the kind of sport I'm told _/ Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain a copy of the congressional ``Pig Book
Summary,'' which lists costly government spending projects that
benefit few people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those with Internet capability can read it at
http://www.cagw.org, the home page of Washington-based Citizens
Against Government Waste. Or call 1-800-BE-ANGRY (1-800-232-6479)
to order it for $5. Those who join CAGW for $25 get it free, along
with quarterly newsletters and other mailings, a spokeswoman said.
Information: Citizens Against Government Waste, 1301 Connecticut
Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20036.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My brother-in-law told me that Ghana is offering dual
citizenship for blacks living in the United States. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A representative of the Ghanaian Embassy in Washington said
there has been discussion on the matter of dual citizenship for
both Ghanaians wanting U.S. citizenship and U.S. citizens of any
race wanting Ghanaian citizenship, but nothing has been
implemented. She declined to speculate on a timetable or on the
outlook for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. State Department, the government of Ghana
at present recognizes dual nationality only for minors younger than
21. A dual national who enters Ghana with a Ghanaian passport is
treated as a Ghanaian citizen only, the State Department adds. If a
dual national Ghanaian-American enters Ghana on a Ghanaian passport
and is later arrested for any reason while there, the U.S. Embassy
normally is not notified of the arrest by Ghanaian authorities. As
a result, consular assistance for dual U.S.-Ghanaian citizens may
be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Embassy of Ghana, 202-686-4520.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent ``Jeopardy,'' one of the answers was that tons of
chicken feet are sent to China. What do the Chinese do with chicken
feet?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are cooked and eaten or used in recipes for such things
as chicken foot soup. You sometimes can find items like braised
chicken feet at Chinese restaurants in the United States, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received in change a 1999 quarter with the image of George
Washington on one side and a man on a horse, under the word
Delaware, on the other. Will all the states have such coins?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, eventually. Delaware is the first of the U.S. Mint's
``50 States Quarters Program,'' which will recognize all the states
over a 10-year period. Distribution of the Delaware coin began in
January. A series of five quarter-dollars with new reverses will be
issued each year through 2008, in the sequence that the states
entered the union. To date, designs have been selected for the
first five state quarters: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Georgia and Connecticut. The reverse side of the Delaware quarter
depicts Caesar Rodney on horseback en route to Philadelphia to cast
the tie-breaking vote in the Delaware delegation in favor of
independence in 1776. Information is available online at the U.S.
Mint's site: http://www.usmint.gov
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about Tubby Smith, the basketball coach at the
University of Kentucky. Is that his real name? Also, his son, who
played basketball for the University of Georgia Bulldogs, is called
G.G. Where does that come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: The real first name of both father and son is Orlando. The
son's full name is Orlando Guffrie Gibson Smith.

 &HT;    Good Stuff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One good pepper
</P>
<P>
   Foodies who read the New York Times or magazines such as Gourmet
and Saveur have heard of Piquilla Peppers, the sweet, slightly
piquant beak-shaped peppers from the Spanish Pyrenees. Given that
trendy chefs are so eager to feature them, it's surprising to learn
that the fire-roasted pimientos are a canned product. They're
available at Dorothy Lane Market stores ($8.99 for an 8-ounce jar).
Stuff them, saute them or serve them as is as an appetizer, maybe
with a few slices of Spanish Manchego cheese and a chunk of bread.
</P>
<P>
   One good question
</P>
<P>
   Can food be flambeed in a nonstick pan? The answer is no, not
using conventional nonstick pans. Many manufacturers of nonstick
pans use plastic-based coatings that could burn off if subjected to
a direct flame as lighting brandy or a sauce . That's why cookware
directions warn against placing such pans under the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes rebound from early freeze
</P>
<P>
   Remember that December freeze that nipped produce production in
California? Well, artichokes were literally nipped in the bud, but
such farm catastrophes are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, winter-kissed _ frosted _ artichokes were all that
were available, but the plants shook off the chill and artichokes
are back in the supermarket this month. The harvest is good, if not
great, and supplies should last through May.

 &HT;    Panko adds punch with its crunch
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As ethnic ingredients go mainstream in American
supermarkets, cooks no longer have to seek out small specialty
markets for basic supplies. Ingredients ranging from Thai coconut
milk to Japanese soba noodles are readily available in
``international'' sections of the superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Even panko.
</P>
<P>
   What's panko? Well, any '90s chef worth his toque can tell you
about panko.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing more than Japanese bread crumbs _ and the secret to
a crisp, crunchy exterior on fried foods.
</P>
<P>
   While Japanese chefs traditionally use panko to bread foods such
as pork cutlets ( tonkatsu ), imaginative Americans have extended
the use to the list of all the recipes where crumbs are used, from
baked fish and pan-fried crab cakes to familiar casseroles.
</P>
<P>
   What's different about panko is visible when you pick up a bag.
These are untoasted and coarse, more accurately described as bread
flakes than bread crumbs. The result, quite simply, is more crunch.
</P>
<P>
   In ethnic markets such as Koyama Shoten, 5256 N. Dixie Drive,
Harrison Twp., panko is sold in an 8.8-ounce bag labeled ``bread
flakes'' for $1.79. The Dynasty brand panko is available in
3.5-ounce boxes for about $1.60 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us don't deep-fry food, but the coarse crumbs come in
handy as a topping for baked fish or in pan-fried fillets.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is a variation of one of my family favorites for
cooking walleye.
</P>
<P>
   CRISPY WALLEYE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 to 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   dash of cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1 cup panko
</P>
<P>
   peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pounds thick fish fillets such as walleye
</P>
<P>
   In a shallow plate such as a pie tin, beat the eggs with a fork.
Add salt, pepper and cayenne, then mix.
</P>
<P>
   Place the panko crumbs on waxed paper or foil and spread out.
</P>
<P>
   Pour oil in a large skillet to a depth of inch and heat over
medium high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Using tongs, turn the fish in the beaten eggs. Let excess drip
off, then roll in the crumbs and place in the hot skillet. Cook
until brown on both sides, turning only once. Fillets inch thick
will be done in 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve on a
warm platter.
</P>
<P>
   Fish fillets at least inch thick are best.
</P>

 &HT;    For `fanboys' eagerly waiting, the Net is a friendly cantina in
a lonely, sometimes hostile galaxy
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people can't figure out what
they'll be doing next week, much less in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Not Joseph Helmsorig.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, May 21 has been a sacred date. That's when
the new Star Wars movie, Episode I: The Phantom Menace, debuts in
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And the day before, the 29-year-old emergency medical technician
from Sunrise, Fla. will don a homemade costume and transform
himself into Boba Fett, an obscure character who had all of six
lines of dialogue in the three previous films.
</P>
<P>
   Then he'll trudge down to the local theater _ in his $1,100
get-up _ and camp out overnight so he can party with hundreds of
others who have waited since 1983 for a fresh Star Wars movie. And
after seeing Phantom the first time, he plans to go to as many
showings as he can get into that day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Helmsorig is truly devoted. His TV remote control is a
light sabre. His apartment is decorated top to bottom in Star Wars
clutter. He's all set to get a tattoo with an insignia used by bad
guy Darth Vader's troops. And when he isn't working or studying to
be a paramedic, he spends hours combing through Web sites and chat
rooms that analyze the most arcane hints of the new film's plot and
characters. Even his computer makes Star Wars sounds when it's
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fascination with Star Wars knows no boundaries,'' he says,
almost solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of company in his galaxy of adoration. If Internet
traffic is any indication, an untold legion is lurking in a
parallel universe waiting for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   In computer parlance, they're known as ``fanboys,'' obsessive,
tenacious Star Wars fanatics who spend hours scouring the digital
globe for tidbits about the upcoming ``prequel.''
</P>
<P>
   They discuss alien adventures and sword fights. Some confess to
dressing up and going out in public _ for no apparent reason. One
even talks about wanting to play the movie in the delivery room
when his wife gives birth to their first _ though as yet
unconceived _ child.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the real world plays along. Helmsorig's
girlfriend, Stacey Moskowitz, has never seen the first movie all
the way through. The 29-year-old paralegal, who describes herself
as a ``Star Wars widow,'' usually nods off right after the film
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing the same 15 minutes,'' she said. ``I can't even
tell you who Han Solo is. I'll go see the new film, but I'm not
going to stand in line overnight. I didn't camp out to see Duran
Duran in 1986, so I'm definitely not doing it for this.''
</P>
<P>
   For a fanboy, this is good news. The fewer people in line, the
more times they can see Phantom the first day. And the second. And
the third.
</P>
<P>
   The hysteria has remained at this pitch since the trailer for
the prequel hit movie screens in November. Star Wars Web sites have
been bombarded with the kind of urgent traffic you might have seen
from crowds racing to catch the last chopper out of Saigon. There
are thousands of unofficial fan sites, and a half-dozen of them
receive more than 15,000 hits a day. Every day, these sites post
new tidbits about the trailer, the prequel and the Skywalk
convention in Dallas that will coincide with the release of the
film. So many assume the film's box office draw will eclipse
Titanic's more than $1 billion worldwide total that it's passe to
even mention the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In ways, the November trailer was almost cruel for the way it
torqued their thirst. Some paid the $7.50 it cost to get into A
Bug's Life or Meet Joe Black just to see the 2.5-minute snippet.
Later this month, fans will get another trailer, purported to have
more than 100 fresh sequences from the film.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Pepsi USA will launch an ad campaign for soft drink
collectibles that will likely include a gold Pepsi can sporting
Jedi instructor Yoda and the Episode I logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only saw the first trailer once and I saw it on MTV,'' said
Jim Brogan, 27, of West Palm Beach. ``I went to go see A Bug's Life
because I heard the preview was running before the movie and all I
got to see was a (expletive) preview for Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogan, who works at Past Present Future Comics on Military
Trail, grew up with the series. ``Every three years, my life
revolved around going to see the next film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even turned Star Wars into a drinking game at college,'' he
said. ``You'd have to pick a character and recite a line of
dialogue. If you screwed it up, you'd have to drink the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phantom Menace mania on the Internet is tame compared with
the mainstream media's handling of the movie, devotees say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense in the press is that (the film) is the second
coming,'' says Ira Mayer, publisher of the Entertainment Marketing
Letter. ``The truth is there is no next Beatles, there's no next
Elvis. There is just what there is.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, too high expectations may doom the film.
</P>
<P>
   But to devotees like Lou ``T-Bone'' Tambone, a Web master for
www.starwarz.com, that kind of talk is heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Tambone's credentials: He got married on May 25, 1997, the 20th
anniversary of the release of the first Star Wars film. Their
wedding cake was graced with Han Solo and Princess Leia figurines,
and they marched into their reception to the forceful strains of
the John Williams theme.
</P>
<P>
   He admits his fixation is unusual. ``But some guys think it's
their responsibility to inform the world about every little thing
that every Star Wars person does, like `Jake Lloyd (the 8-year-old
boy who plays young Darth Vader in the prequel) scratched his head
today,''' he says. ``OK, that's obsessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsession, though, is a word fanboys are used to hearing. Most
wear it like a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends laugh and make fun of me and say I'm too
obsessed,'' said Josh Burton of Boca Raton, whose Star Wars
collection includes bed sheets, posters, collectible figures and
the working R2-D2 phone. He has about 20 Star Wars T-shirts, he
sells Star Wars comic books at the store where he works and he's a
member of the official fan club.
</P>
<P>
   And, etched into his back _ in Gaelic _ is a
shoulder-to-shoulder tattoo with the movie's catch phrase, ``May
The Force be with you.'' (Roughly translated, it's An Bhru Leat.
It's a symbolic nod to his other passion: Celtic history.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like when someone has a really big hobby,'' he says.
``If it was a boat or something like that, no one would say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Internet fan groups, these folks are not
competitive, choosing to share their discoveries and observations
with fellow fanboys. And for the most part, Lucasfilms hasn't
struck back at the fans for posting images and inside information
on the Web. (The production company has issued a few
cease-and-desist orders to sites that sell Star Wars memorabilia.)

   There is a peaceful, almost childlike quality about the on-line
community, which is what the whole thing is really all about,
fanboys say. It's about escape, entering a universe where good
conquers evil and the heroes get the best costumes.

   ``As a kid, you want to do all that stuff,'' Joseph Helmsorig
said. ``You want to save the world and the universe and get the
girl.''
</P>

   But Tambone cuts to the chase. ``When I was 7, my parents were
going to get divorced,'' he recalls wistfully, his voice taking on
the timbre of Princess Leia in the 1977 classic. ``Star Wars was
out in full force, and it became a safe place, a hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew attached to it. It distracted me from the real world.''

 &HT;    A galaxy of Web sites
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Thousands of unofficial fan Web sites
are up and running, in anticipation of Episode I: The Phantom
Menace.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the main sites that will help even the biggest
Star Wars novice catch up to diehard fans:
</P>
<P>
   http://www.starwars.com _ Think of this official site by
Lucasfilm as the mother ship of all the Web sites. Not only will
you find updates on Episode I, character details, hints of the plot
and an on-line dictionary of the terms found in the movies, there's
also a behind-the-scenes documentary and a store where you can buy
trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.theforce.net _ This is the big daddy of the
unofficial fan sites. It gets so much traffic its operators had to
hire a staff to keep it stocked with fresh news and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.countingdown.com _ Reminiscent of the disciples who
camped out for Grateful Dead tickets, this site caters to those who
wait in front of theaters overnight to be the first to see Phantom.
They can download a clock that counts down the time until the film
opens.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.jedinet.com _ For the filmgoer who wants the film to
be a surprise, this site's is a minefield. Click the wrong link and
you'll trip over a batch of gossip about the plot. The best find
here: home made mini-movies made by fans with miniature Star Wars
figures.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.starwarz.com _ Plan to skip the film and avoid the
throngs? Or maybe you just can't wait? Check out this site, which
is full of spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.thx.com _ The ``prequel'' film was recorded with
Lucas' own mind-blowing THX sound. This site helps you find a
theatre nearby that uses the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.landspeeder.com _ Discussion board, chat rooms and
lots of rumors. Plus, there are good pictures of the new villain,
Darth Maul.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.sirstevesguide.com _ Lots of toy information here,
along with a lineup of the prequel characters.

 &HT;    Busch's Kenseth rising fa
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most drivers get pretty irritated when NASCAR starts
tinkering with their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Busch series driver Matt Kenseth probably would like NASCAR
to get down to some serious changes _ like installing a
compact-disc player in his yellow-and-black No. 17 Chevy Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, who turned 27 Tuesday, is an avid music fan. But it's
not that same longtime love affair between NASCAR drivers and honky
tonk. No, Kenseth likes his music to sound like his race car _ loud
and fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy a lot of types of music,'' Kenseth said. ``Metallica
is probably my favorite band, but I like a lot of the new
alternative stuff, too. I like a lot of the new stuff that's come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth is one of several drivers on the Busch circuit who are
changing NASCAR's dial from country. And he's one of the young ones
that probably will lead Winston Cup racing into the next century,
along with multi-generation drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr., Glenn Allen
Jr. and Adam Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth enters Saturday's Yellow Freight 300 Busch race at
Atlanta Motor Speedway as one of the circuit's hottest drivers.
Dating back to July's DieHard 250 at Milwaukee, Kenseth has 14
top-10 finishes in the past 18 races, including 11 top fives and
one victory.
</P>
<P>
   Until he finished 30th in last week's Sam's Town 300 at Las
Vegas, Kenseth had four top-five finishes in a row. He was running
in the middle of the pack in that race, which was dominated by
Winston Cup regulars, until he lost a lug nut on a wheel and was
called back to the pits. Kenseth trails Randy LaJoie by 55 points
in the Busch standings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth made the jump to the Busch Series in April 1997 after
being hired by longtime friend Robbie Reiser, a native of Allenton,
Wis., who raced against Kenseth on numerous occasions. Reiser spent
a few seasons driving in the Busch Series, but by 1996 he had
switched to ownership. When Reiser's driver was injured early in
the '97 Busch season, Kenseth was the first driver he called.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to race Late Model cars together in Wisconsin,''
Reiser said. ``In 1993, I won four championships, and Matt was
second or third in all of them. When I went to the Busch Series, I
was the driver and trying to do everything else _ ownership, crew
chief, everything. When I decided to move over to only the
ownership side, I chose Matt because he's good and he's young.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth competed in 21 Busch Series races for Reiser during the
'97 season, grabbing two third-place finishes. During his first
full season on the Busch circuit in '98, Kenseth captured his first
victory at Dover Downs International Speedway in Delaware in only
the second race. Kenseth also had the most top fives and 10s in the
Busch Series last year, finishing only 48 points behind close
friend and series winner Earnhardt Jr. in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   That was a long way from his obscure beginning in racing. When
Kenseth was 13, his father bought a stock car. His father drove it
for three years while Kenseth maintained and repaired it. Three
years later, his father turned over the driving duties.
</P>
<P>
   In just his third race in 1988, Kenseth, then only a junior in
high school, won his first feature event. Two weeks later, he got
another victory. By age 19, Kenseth had moved up to the
ultra-competitive Wisconsin Late Model division, battling the likes
of Dick Trickle, Ted Musgrave and Rich Bickle, all of whom are
racing in the Winston Cup Series this season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Kenseth became the youngest driver to win a feature
event in the ARTGO racing series, winning at LaCrosse Fairgrounds
in Wisconsin. That record had been held by Winston Cup star Mark
Martin. Kenseth still owns the record of 12 feature wins in the
Late Model division at Madison International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth and Reiser plan on jumping to the Winston Cup circuit
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the direction everybody would like to go in,'' Reiser
said. ``We'd like to go to Winston Cup and keep this team
together.''

 &HT;    Where do old models go? Back to work
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dayle Haddon blames the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes like this: Aging former model lives in Paris,
making movies. Husband dies. Seeking a change of scenery and the
means to raise her daughter, she moves to California, where she
learns her European acting means squat.
</P>
<P>
   Too old for modeling (so they said), she takes a job as a
receptionist in a tiny ad agency, making coffee and answering
phones. While going over reports, she discovers that the coyote _
the coyote _ in one photo shoot is making more than she earns in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, she decides. Grabs Rolodex. Visits cosmetics
companies. Tries to point out the potential of the aging Baby
Boomer market. Doors slam. Keeps trying.
</P>
<P>
   Starts a modeling agency for older models, including herself.
Gets picked by Clairol as a spokesperson. Then Estee Lauder. Then
L'Oreal.
</P>
<P>
   Then she writes a book.
</P>
<P>
   Ageless Beauty: A Woman's Guide to Lifelong Beauty and
Well-Being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told when I was 38 that my life was over,'' Haddon says.
</P>
<P>
   She's 50 now. Recently, Vogue magazine reunited the top models
of the 1970s for a photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz. Lauren Hutton
was there, Isabella Rossellini, Iman, Christie Brinkley. . . and
Haddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we all looked more beautiful than in our heyday,''
Haddon says.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do they airbrush your photos, or do you ask them not to?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't do much about it, but I ask them. I don't like to
airbrush too much.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think about plastic surgery?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that's an individual choice. I don't think there's
anything wrong with it. It's like makeup or a great dress _ if you
don't feel great about who you are . . . At this stage, you've got
to develop your inner life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you had plastic surgery?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I don't know if I would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your morning routine?
</P>
<P>
   A. The moment I wake up, I like to stretch. Then I meditate. I
shower, drink coffee and read the paper. I like to watch the sun.
Then I have a mini-trampoline _ $49.95 _ and I turn on music and I
jump. Or I take a very early morning walk. It helps you in
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much time does all of this take?
</P>
<P>
   A. As much time as I can. I'm always late (laughs). I like to
have a half-hour that's mine. And I organize my outfit the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about makeup?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm very big into cleaning and moisturizing. And I make sure
to put sunblock on my hands, too. (She suggests Neutrogena's
Sensitive Skin SPF 17.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are some of the mistakes older women make, beauty-wise?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some think the older you get, the more makeup you put on. And
applying blush in stripes. We don't blush in stripes! And hair
coloring _ going too dark. That kabuki look, jet black.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you color your hair?
</P>
<P>
   A. I definitely color, yeah. My hair was almost blue-black. You
can't keep that up. (She uses Clairol for her roots between visits
to the salon.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any exercise advice?
</P>
<P>
   A. Exercise! I use (resistance bands) while washing dishes, I do
squats while vacuuming. I do side bends while brushing my teeth.
When I'm with friends, we take a walk instead of getting a big ol'
danish.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about people a generation older than 50, in their 70s
and 80s?
</P>
<P>
   A. Go walking. Do mini-weights. I keep weights by the TV and use
them while I watch.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happens to all the other models who get old?
</P>
<P>
   A. They get sent to a farm far away (laughs). They kind of
disappear into the sunset. They either marry, or marry very well,
or get into other parts of the beauty business or do other things.
I call myself a dinosaur in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Q. During the Vogue photo shoot, was everyone checking each
other out, thinking, ``Look at what's happened to her!''
</P>
<P>
   A. No! I think women are more beautiful when they're older.
There's more freedom. A merging of who they are and what they look
like. How you've lived shows up after a certain age in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does your face say?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's up to others to say. Behind it, I feel great.

 &HT;    How to pick the cruise that's right for you
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I have cruised on a lot of ships.
</P>
<P>
   I've taken enormous mega-ships and small vessels _ the humongous
Carnival Destiny and the cozy little OceanBreeze.
</P>
<P>
   I've sailed on clipper ships (Windjammer's Polynesia _ renamed
the Polynausea on my voyage) and glided along on European river
boats (KD Cruises' Austria).
</P>
<P>
   I've taken legendary, and expensive, ships and those less
storied, and less expensive _ the Queen Elizabeth 2 and Carnival's
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   I've been on family ships such as the Disney Magic and those
that tend to attract sophisticated adults like Windstar's Wind
Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mention this to impress you, but to tell you firsthand
that there are huge differences between cruise lines and ships.
</P>
<P>
   Your choice will determine whether you have a wonderful or
disappointing cruise vacation.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of contented cruisers and many unhappy, and even
irate, passengers.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen seniors trapped on ships filled with late-night, and
loud, young partiers, and I've seen a pair of 20-something
honeymooners marooned on a ship filled with retirees.
</P>
<P>
   I've run across first-time cruisers with movie visions of brass
portholes and polished teak stuck on new mega-ships that have all
the shipboard atmosphere of a Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   And I've seen passengers hoping for the neon and glitz of new
ships stranded on old vessels with as much glamour as a freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Which ship is for you? With more than 24 cruise lines and more
than 120 ships serving North America, the choices are overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   But never fear.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, easy to choose the right ship. We will help
guide you to the right ship. Read on.
</P>
<P>
   Want a dream boat? ask lots of questions
</P>
<P>
   How do you choose a ship?
</P>
<P>
   There are expensive ships and ships known for good value; ships
legendary for their cuisine and others known for their
Broadway-caliber entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips for choosing your dream boat.
</P>
<P>
   Write down your priorities for a great cruise _ gourmet food,
entertainment, luxury, low cost, mostly adults, mostly families,
etc. And most important _ what ports do you want to see? Want a
no-smoking cruise? You'll want to consider Carnival's new Paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a bookstore and buy a guidebook, preferably one that has
non-biased reviews of cruise lines and ships. One good bet is
Frommer's '99 Caribbean Cruises and Ports of Call (Macmillan Co.;
$19.95). Some people hesitate to spend the money on a guidebook,
but it could save them from landing on the wrong ship. Cabins,
public areas, service and food are rated for each ship.
</P>
<P>
   Visit a cruise-only travel agency. Cruises are all they do and
they should be able to guide you to the perfect ship.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the agent exactly what you are looking for. Agents get
frustrated when people come in and want to take a cruise but have
no idea what they want. And don't expect to take the QE2 for
bargain-basement prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a lot of questions and take home brochures. What is a
certain ship known for? Food? Entertainment? Maybe your top
priority is good value and you don't need a fancy room or a spa. On
the other hand, if it's your 50th anniversary (and the kids are
buying), you might want a luxury cruise. If you're 25 and looking
for late-night fun, don't be shy about saying it. Do you want a
casual ship or an elegant atmosphere that warrants bringing along a
tuxedo?
</P>
<P>
   Find out the age of the ship. Some people love the old ships
that have teak decks and brass portholes. Cruises on the older
ships are usually cheaper. Other people like the new, modern ships,
which look more like floating hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the brochures carefully. They offer a lot of clues. Are
there families in the photos or retirees? Look at the public areas,
decks and rooms. There shouldn't be many surprises when you board
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Ask friends about their favorite ships. But listen closely.
Things they like may not be important to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never been on a cruise, try a weekend cruise to the
Bahamas to test the waters. If you don't like it, you won't have
invested that much time and money in it. A cruise isn't for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Think creatively. How about a riverboat on the Mississippi
River? Or a cruise around Hawaii?
</P>
<P>
   You can rest easy in the right cabin
</P>
<P>
   There can be huge differences between cabins even on the same
ship. Here are some tips to make sure you get the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Look closely at the photos of cabins in the cruise line
brochures. What do the rooms in each category look like? Would you
be happy on that narrow, single bed? Does it look like you could
stand in the middle of the cabin and touch both walls with
outstretched arms? Would that bother you? It might not if you plan
only to sleep there.
</P>
<P>
   If a double bed is important, ask for it. Or else, you and your
mate will be spending your cruise sleeping in twin beds like Desi
and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your travel agent a lot of questions. Does the room in your
price range have double beds or singles or bunks? Is your outside
cabin facing a deck so that you have to keep your drapes closed for
privacy? Are the windows partially obstructed by lifeboats? Is
there a tub or just a shower? Is there a minibar? (This might be
important if you have children or need to keep medicines cold).
</P>
<P>
   Ask for a cabin located midship. There's less movement and less
chance of seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive lower decks also have much less movement than top
deck suites.
</P>
<P>
   Is it an outside or inside cabin? In other words, does the cabin
have a window? A windowless room can seem like a cell, especially
if there's bad weather and you end up spending lots of time in your
room. One of the joys of traveling by ship is watching the scenery
and going to sleep with reflections of moonlight on the water. A
few ships, such as the Clipper Cruise Line ships, have all outside
cabins. But on most ships you have to pay more for a window. The
price difference usually is not that much.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about upgrades. Are you a repeat customer? Is it an
anniversary or honeymoon? Your agent may be able to get you an
upgrade, especially if the ship isn't full.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be smooth sailing if you shop for deals
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to get inexpensive fares and cabin
upgrades without paying extra. These aren't sure-fire methods, but
you might as well give them a try.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the best way to save money is to travel with friends and
family. The magic number to qualify for a ``group rate'' is usually
eight cabins, and the savings and upgrades are substantial. Have
that family reunion at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your cruise-only travel agent if you are on a honeymoon,
celebrating a big anniversary or if you have traveled with the
cruise line before. Cruise lines often give cabin upgrades to
honeymooners and loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines usually offer big savings on reservations made more
than six months in advance. But buy trip cancellation insurance in
case your plans change or someone gets sick.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting until the last minute to make reservations is a good way
to get better cabins at lower prices. Of course, you're risking not
getting on the ship at all if it is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your travel agent about ``low season'' for cruises in
certain parts of the world. Make travel plans when rates are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about ``repositioning cruises.'' That's when ships are moved
from one part of the world to another, such as from the Caribbean
to Europe or from the Caribbean to Alaska. These cruises often are
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Think about exotic locales. Mediterranean cruises are
exceptional deals especially when you consider how much it would
cost to fly to the cities you would visit by ship. And often, the
cruise lines' charter overseas flights are far better than fares
you could get on your own.
</P>
<P>
   How to pack for a cruise
</P>
<P>
   Now's the time to be your most glamorous self. How often do you
get to wear an ankle-length gown or tux? Don't worry about packing
light, but keep in mind that most shipboard closets are small.
</P>
<P>
   Pack a couple of things for warmth, even on Caribbean cruises.
Public areas often are cold and the decks can get nippy at night.
In Alaska, you can always identify cruise ship passengers huddled
in their thin windbreakers. That's what the cruise lines tell them
to pack and they are all freezing in Alaska's cool summer
temperatures. When going to Alaska, pack a fleece jacket to wear
under a windbreaker. This also applies to European cruises,
especially in the spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable rubber-soled shoes, hats with wide brims, suntan
lotion, sunglasses, mosquito repellent, Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your travel agent if there's a costume party or talent
contest. This may sound a little dopey, but once you're on the ship
you'll wish you had brought that Madonna-esque leather bra so you
could impress your new friends with your own version of Like a
Virgin.

 &HT;    Europe's two most romantic cities
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm going to tell you my picks for the
two most romantic cities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But before I do that, allow me to give those of you
contemplating a honeymoon a few pieces of advice:
</P>
<P>
   First, stay put! In one place in Europe, that is. Don't go
driving all over the continent in an effort to see everything.
You'll just get tired and cranky.
</P>
<P>
   Stay in one city, and it will become ``your'' city, the one that
will be foremost in your photo album.
</P>
<P>
   Second: Go in spring or fall, even winter, but not summer.
Europe is too crowded, hot and expensive in summer, and this tends
to make people tired and cranky.
</P>
<P>
   And, I thought of a third point: Don't worry about spending
money. Budget enough for the trip so that you're not fretting about
every franc you're spending on taxis and food. The wedding trip is
not the time to worry about money _ there's plenty of time for that
later in the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And my No. 1 personal favorite city for romance?
</P>
<P>
   Venice.
</P>
<P>
   When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, especially on
a gondola ride along the 1,000-year-old city's many canals,
serenaded by a gondolier _now, that's amore. You'll both be sighing
as you glide under the Bridge of Sighs.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be awed by the 11th-century Basilica with its
Moorish domes and the magnificent Ducal Palace with the frescoed
ceilings decorated with solid gold.
</P>
<P>
   You can sip cappuccino in St. Mark's Square while admiring the
Byzantine buildings with graceful arches that still frame the
square Napoleon called ``the most beautiful salon in the world.''
This is the city that inspired Lord Byron and Robert and Mrs.
Browning.
</P>
<P>
   There's great shopping _ you new husbands can buy that Venetian
cameo that has a remarkable resemblance to your beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay? If you've saved a bundle for this trip, you
should go straight to the Hotel Gritti Palace. Kings and queens,
prime ministers and presidents have slept in the ultra-luxurious,
antique-filled rooms of the hotel, a 16th-century palace
overlooking the Grand Canal. It's expensive _ rates start at about
$557. For reservations, call (800) 325-3589. Ask about package
rates and specials.
</P>
<P>
   The Albergo San Marco is in a medieval building only 100 feet
from St. Mark's Square and next to a quiet canal. Rooms start at
about $150 a night and have modern baths, phones and CNN. The rooms
vary quite a bit so ask to see the room before you pay.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Albergo Cavalletto &AMP; Doge Orseolo, which opened
in 1308 and is one of the oldest hotels in Italy. It's also only
100 feet from St. Mark's Square and faces a gondola dock. Double
rooms start at about $200. For reservations at both hotels, call
(800) 528-1234. Ask about specials.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that Paris is romantic. But I'll go ahead
and say it.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling along the Seine, hand-in-hand, and spending most of an
evening in an outdoor cafe is the best entertainment in town.
There's also the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Musee d'Orsey, and, of
course, the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   You can stay at the Hotel d'Albe (call 011-331-46-34-09-70), a
medieval building that was once home to a princess. Rates start at
about $125 for two. It's in an excellent location in St. Michel on
the Left Bank just a block from the Seine. It has modern rooms and
baths, and is on a pedestrian street with lots of inexpensive
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The Marronniers Hotel (011-331-43-25-30-60) is about $140 (not
including breakfast), and is an atmospheric inn on Rue Jacob, a
cobblestone street on the Left Bank. If the room isn't important,
you might consider the St. Michel Hotel (011-33-1-43-26-98-70) on a
narrow cobblestone street a half-block from the Seine. The location
is excellent, but rooms have a faded '70s decor. Those with shower
and toilet are only $68 for two (in April). A room with bath and
toilet down the hall is about $45.
</P>
<P>
   Other romantic places in Europe: any of the Greek isles;
Florence, Italy; Cologne, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden; and any
smalltown in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, any place is great if you're in love.

 &HT;    Tea partyers take sips of life in `Gilded Age'
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mark Twain dubbed it ``The Gilded Age.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decades after the Civil War, industrial prosperity left
some Americans with too much money and a nagging sense of
inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   So they made Grand Tours of Europe, crinolined culture-vultures
on a raid. They built huge mansions in Newport, the Hamptons and
Palm Beach and called them ``cottages.''
</P>
<P>
   And they had tea parties.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, about 75 people about to bid farewell to the 20th
century paid homage to this 19th-century custom at the Flagler
Museum's first Gilded Age Tea.
</P>
<P>
   They nibbled cucumber sandwiches _ no crust on the bread, of
course. They chatted in reverent murmurs under the high ceiling of
the old dining hall. They showed the good breeding not to request
Sweet 'n' Low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretentious?'' said Joyce Schiller, a curator at Reynolda
House, the R.J. Reynolds mansion in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``I suppose
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Schiller prepared the party-goers with ``Reading Gilded
Leaves,'' a lecture on the manners and meaning of 19th-century tea
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was also a delightful ritual,'' she said, ``a gentility
we want to hold onto in this fast-food, fast-paced life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Branyan of Lake Park, Fla. arrived at the tea in a white
lace dress she's held onto since 1905, when her mother made it for
her eighth-grade graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel elegant,'' she said, peering from under a
wide hat adorned with white roses, ``like I want to stand
straighter and act properly and be a lady. A lot of women don't
want to be ladies these days.''
</P>
<P>
   One striking difference between the Flagler Museum's recreation
and a real Gilded Age tea lay in the gender disparity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, men and women took tea together.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Herbert Mueller of West Palm Beach was one of only
three or four men present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats happy hour,'' he explained.

GO AHEAD, FULFILL A VERY BASIC NEED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Your mention of the Apple IIe brought tears to
my eyes. Does anybody have an equivalent to Applesoft for Windows?
I don't know, but I suspect Visual BASIC is expensive and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old-Timer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OLD: No, I'm the one who's expensive and clumsy, but we're
not here to talk about my love life.
</P>
<P>
   You can score Visual BASIC for about a hundred bucks. It's the
``learning edition,'' which means it does almost everything the
``professional version'' does except cost an arm and a leg. And
don't worry: BASIC is still pretty much BASIC.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic
Instruction Code, which some nerd must have thought was extremely
clever when he thought it up at 4 in the morning. Never mind that
it should be called BAPSIC. Anyway, it's an easy-to-learn
programming language using quasi-English commands, so geek wannabes
don't have to twiddle with hexidecimal numbers or languages like C,
where the commands resemble English only inasmuch as letters are
arranged haphazardly to form what appear to be words.
</P>
<P>
   And guess who churned out BASIC for the Altair, the first home
computer (although it was pretty much just a box with some switches
and blinking lights)? And for the Radio Shack Model 100? And, yes,
even for your venerable old IIe? Sorry, Bill-bashers, but you owe
the guy an apology. Without Big Billy Gates giving those early
boxes something productive to do, we'd all still be sitting here
staring at blinking lights. Can I have my check now, Mr. Gates?
</P>
<P>
   If you want something as simple as Applesoft, try snaring a copy
of QuickBASIC 4.5, which is out of print, but traded on the
Internet the same way baseball cards are.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find a copy of DOS 6, it came with QBASIC, a
stripped-down QuickBASIC. Ancient versions of DOS had GW-BASIC. The
bad news in all this (other than the stuff will probably be on
5.25-inch floppies) is that you'd only be able to write DOS
programs. True, they can run under Windows, but they look dorky and
old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Visual BASIC isn't that scary. The hard part is designing what
your application will look like. You take things like command
buttons and text boxes and slap them together like Legos until your
program is pretty. Then you add little snippets of code to each
Lego. If you want a command button to close the program, you attach
the BASIC command END to it. It's simple enough for a monkey to do,
which would explain the quality of some of the software I've seen
lately.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I can't load any programs without calling the
system administrators and waiting two days for them to get here.
How can I get by this ``lockout'' in order to load legitimate
programs?
</P>
<P>
   _ Frustrated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FRUS: Try calling the system administrators and waiting two
days for them to get there. Like it or not, those people are
responsible for what's on your company's computers, and if the
latest virus starts popping up in all the wrong places, it's their
necks. And don't think they won't take you down with them. Load
your ``legitimate'' programs at home.
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay has gotten awfully
strict in his old age. You'd think he never pirated a copy of Doom.
Uh, ignore that. His real name is Michael Gerst, editorial systems
manager for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He can be reached at

COMPUTERS: WHAT'S ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tech talk: A few weeks back, What's Online offered a Web site
devoted to funny technical support anecdotes. Well, they were funny
to the technicians, anyway, who used much of the Web site's content
to mock users. (See Spam! at
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/12/online.html) That
item inspired one reader to offer up two more, similar sites.
Computer Stupidities at rinkworks.com/stupid/ is similar to Spam!
in that it includes written anecdotes submitted by technicians. But
this one isn't quite as mean-spirited. An example: ``Tech Support:
`Do you have 3{-inch diskettes?' Customer: `No, I only have 3 of
them.''' There's even an area called ``Stupid Tech Support'' in
which the tables are turned. Help Desk Funnies at
www.helpdeskfunnies.com goes beyond just printing stories _ you can
also hear them. Along with written anecdotes, Help Desk Funnies
features recorded tech support phone calls in either RealAudio or
WAV format. There are some hilarious moments here, such as one call
in which a woman thinks she's called a TV preacher's prayer line
and has wound up with printer tech support. Or, listen to one man
threaten to throw his new digital telephone into the bay _ and then
talk himself out of it. Some of the calls include strong language,
including one in which an America Online subscriber denies he used
vulgarity in a chat room by screaming epithets at the poor customer
service representative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rule Britannica: Encyclopedia Britannica, the venerable
reference work, nearly was killed by the computer revolution. While
it was still selling only books for thousands of dollars and later
a CD-ROM version for hundreds of dollars, its competitors had moved
to CD versions selling at less than $100. But the Internet has
offered Britannica a new lease on life, even allowing it to become
_ gasp! _ hip. Here's evidence: the Brittannica's new Web site at
www.britishinvasion.eb.com/ devoted to the British Invasion of the
1960s. The site looks at the monolithic pop bands that came out of
that era, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who.
You can hear sound clips, print out trading cards and read the
stories of each band. And here's a good example of how much times
have changed _ while parents in the 1960s disapproved of the
``longhair music'' coming out of England, it's now a subject of
study in schools. There is even a study guide for teachers at the
British Invasion Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unreal reality: In the 1970s, PBS enthralled American TV
viewers with a show that involved TV cameras spending every waking
moment chronicling a family. ``An American Family,'' featuring the
Louds of Santa Barbara, Calif., was considered a seminal event for
television. That later inspired the less-than-seminal ``Real
World'' series from MTV, in which a group of 20-somethings is
thrown together in a house somewhere in the world while the TV
cameras roll. Now we have ``Hear and Now,'' which uses a Web camera
to track the lives of six friends sharing a house. Located at
www.hereandnow.net, the site leans more to ``Real World'' than ``An
American Family.'' It's obviously more a financial than a
sociological experiment _ there is a ``contact us'' page with
separate e-mail addresses for investment and advertising
opportunities. The camera isn't always up _ it's more like ``Here
and Occasionally'' _ and when it is, you get the feeling things are

LEAP TO PENTIUM III MORE LIKE BABY STEP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems whenever Intel Corp. begins shipping a new processor
these days, it comes with an unwanted feature _ controversy.
</P>
<P>
   When Intel's low-cost entry, the Celeron, was introduced,
critics complained about its lack of onboard memory known as cache.
And remember the floating-point math bug in the original Pentium?
The Pentium Pro and Pentium II chips had similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the Pentium III, with its built-in serial number
that privacy groups say amounts to ``Big Brother Inside.'' And
there's the fact that the Pentium III is actually a Pentium II,
with 70 extra software commands to boost multimedia performance.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at the following two high-end Pentium III systems,
I can say they're impressive _ as any system built around a
500-megahertz processor would be. But I'm not so sure the chips in
these are worthy of another Pentium version number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dimension XPS T500, $2,500, Dell Computer Corp.: In the days
before the Pentium III's late-February launch, Dell teased visitors
to its Web site with a banner ad for ``the new Dimension.'' The
implication was that Dell was going to be revamping its flagship
small and home office line.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``new Dimension'' is about as revamped for a PC as the
Pentium III is for a processor. Essentially, it has more memory,
bigger hard drives, and of course the new processor. In other
words, it's about what you would expect Dell _ or any PC maker _ to
do to keep up with technology.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 500-megahertz Pentium III chip,
256 megabytes of memory, a 20.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 4.8X DVD-ROM
drive with software decoding, a 16-megabyte STB Velocity 4400 video
card, a Turtle Beach Montego II audio card, a U.S. Robotics 56K fax
modem, a 3Com 10/100-megabit network card and Microsoft Office 97
for small business.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that this is a very fast machine. Dell is
using some of the best components in the business here, including
that video card. The Velocity 4400 is built around nVidia's Riva
TNT 128 chip set, which currently is one of the fastest combination
2-D/3-D cards available. This card will do just fine if you want to
stick with a single board.
</P>
<P>
   The software decoding in the DVD was excellent, and not having
to use a PCI slot for a decoder card was a big plus. And the
Montego II sound card supports positional audio, which simulates
surround-sound. With the optional Altec Lansing ACS-295 speakers _
which come with a wood-encased subwoofer _ the sound was
exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension comes with a couple of games that are supposed to
show off the capabilities of the Pentium III's SSE feature _ or
``Streaming SIMD Extensions.'' The only one that really wowed me
was Rage Software's Expendable, a 3-D action game. The colors,
lighting and smooth gameplay were incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Dell ships this with the Pentium III serial number turned off.
To turn it back on, you must change BIOS settings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pavilion 8940, $2,500, Hewlett-Packard: This consumer-oriented
PC comes with plenty of bells and whistles _ and one is very cool.
It is one of the first PCs you can buy with a built-in, writeable
CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8940 comes with a 500-megahertz Pentium III chip,
128 megabytes of memory, a 19-gigabyte hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM
drive, an HP CD-Writer Plus drive, an eight-megabyte ATI Rage Pro
video card, a 56K fax modem, a 16-bit stereo sound card and Polk
Audio speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-Writer will be a revelation if you've never used one. It
works with both CD-Recordable (record once) and CD-ReWritable
disks. It comes with Adaptec's excellent EasyCD software, which
makes creating your own audio or data CDs drag-and-drop easy.
</P>
<P>
   The system is smartly designed, with a standard serial port on
the front of the case for plugging in a digital camera or other
serial device.
</P>
<P>
   This system is going to be great for anyone using mainstream
multimedia, but game-players may find the video card lacking. The
ATI Rage Pro is not the best card for 3-D gaming _ you probably
would want to add a Voodoo2-based card to this system.
</P>
<P>
   The sound also lacks the kind of punch gamers expect, but those
using it for children's multimedia or music will find it more than
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   This computer doesn't come with any software that showcases the
chip's abilities _ in fact, the software bundle is relatively
light. That will please those who would rather have plenty of free
hard disk space.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8940 also ships with the Pentium III serial number
turned off in the BIOS.

MAKING A SCORE IN VIDEO GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you're on a plane to Seattle, all dressed up in shiny
new shoes and headed for your first real job. The guy next to you
begins the clever in-flight banter. ``So, what do you do?'' You
explain that you compose music for video games, and Mr. Chatty lets
out a laugh so loud that the tray tables rattle. Your new shoes
suddenly seem scruffy; your ego is deflated.
</P>
<P>
   That happened five years ago to Jeremy Soule, who was all of 19
at the time. ``The guy said, `Oh, you make all those little noises,
all those beeps and boops?' It was so depressing,'' the composer
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, the music for interactive games has
gone from simple beeps and boops to large-scale symphonic
orchestration. Soule is one of about a dozen artists in the
vanguard of this burgeoning field. His score for Total
Annihilation, a popular strategy game released in 1997, was
recorded by Northwest Sinfonia, a 95-piece orchestra made up of
musicians from the Seattle Symphony, Seattle Opera, and Northwest
Ballet. The music sounds like the soundtrack for a popcorn flick _
lush and emotional, full of peaks and valleys. It's no wonder that
John Williams is Soule's favorite composer.
</P>
<P>
   Total Annihilation was one of the first games to feature a
symphonic score, but it's becoming de rigeur in the gaming
industry. Games like Myst and Riven have separate soundtrack CDs.
If you're anything like me (with gaming skills that begin and end
as a Trivial Pursuit), you can skip the bombs going off in the game
and just listen to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Soule, 24, is the in-house composer for Cavedog Entertainment in
Seattle, where he's working on the score for Cavedog's upcoming
adventure epic, Amen: The Awakening. He sounds like a cross between
the artist in the garret and the kid glued to the video screen when
he describes his work. ``Our hero narrowly escapes an atomic blast
by going into a manhole and flipping down into the subway tunnels
beneath New York,'' Soule explains. ``There's moss and decay
everywhere. I created a score with a lot of low strings, a very
soft mallet on a gong and muted percussion. It sounds like you're
in a tiny room, with a serious feeling of claustrophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   Soule didn't exactly imagine that he'd be composing scores for
computer games. He says he started composing melodies when he was 3
and that he could notate music before he could write his name: ``My
mother can prove it,'' he says. His father is a music teacher (``I
call him Mr. Holland,'' Soule says), and Soule took college courses
in composition when he was in junior high school. He went straight
into the profession at 19.
</P>
<P>
   And the on-line industry is burgeoning. ``The interactive game
industry is opening the door to opportunity, which is always a good
thing,'' says Ron Sobel, assistant vice president of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Soule is working on self-producing CDs of his music; samples are
available at www.jeremysoule.com. Some of his fellow composers are
lobbying the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to add
a new category for interactive music at the Grammy Awards. Hey,
they award one for Best New Polka, so why not? Besides, the days of
beeps and boops are long over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Pascal de Vries has tried and he's tried and he's tried, but
he hasn't been able to get any satisfaction. That might change some
time soon. His popular site, www.lyrics.ch, may be back on-line
next month.
</P>
<P>
   This story begins back in January when de Vries, who lives in
Basel, Switzerland, was approached by the local police seeking to
shut down his lyrics data base, which lists the words to more than
114,000 songs. The reason: The New York-based National Music
Publishers Association accused the site operators of copyright
violations, and Swiss police seized the computers that drive the
site. Since then, De Vries has been negotiating with music
association president and CEO Edward P. Murphy to work out a
licensing deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police came to my house, but I was at work,'' de Vries
recalled. ``They found my colleague in Zurich and took the servers
from there. He was at home, and they questioned him for four hours.
We were really surprised and shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched two years ago as an amateur project; de
Vries is in a rock band in his spare time, and he and his fellow
musicians were looking for an easy way to get lyrics so they could
cover songs in English. The little idea grew; its founder says the
site was getting about 1 million hits a day when it was shut down.
He originally used his own money to foot the bill, but as the site
grew, so did costs. Before it was shut down, the site cost about
$40,000 a month to run; it was supported by revenue from
advertisements. De Vries says it just broke even.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the Swiss musicians didn't own the license to
list the lyrics. Enter the powerful music association. Things were
testy at first, but now it looks like a deal is in the works. De
Vries can't discuss the details, but it looks like the two sides
are going to work out a licensing arrangement or a revenue-sharing
deal. The pact would be unprecedented, setting the stage for the
music association to take its trade into cyberspace in a proactive,
rather than a reactive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And all those kids in garage bands will be able to find the
words to their favorite covers. De Vries' own band, called First of
May, has a few favorites: ``Hotel California'' and ``Smoke on the
Water.'' And he's looking forward to the day when the smoke finally
clears.

STANDARDS SET FOR REGISTERING INTERNET NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies wanting to compete with Network Solutions Inc. and its
current monopoly in the lucrative business of registering Internet
domain names can begin applying for consideration next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Criteria for registration were approved last week in Singapore
by the new nonprofit corporation appointed by the Clinton
administration to take over administration of the Internet from the
U.S. government and to introduce competition into the system of
assigning the Internet addresses known as domains.
</P>
<P>
   The initial accreditation guidelines called for applicants to
have $100,000 in liquid capital, $500,000 in liability insurance, a
proven computer infrastructure and at least five employees. Esther
Dyson, interim chairwoman of the group's board, said that in
relaxing the guidelines the board would allow exceptions to some of
the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria were among the first policy decisions made by
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling other issues, the board also forged a structure for the
body that will ultimately recommend how and when to add new
top-level domains _ the three-letter suffixes like .com and .org _
to accommodate demand for new Internet addresses. In addition, the
board adopted a conflict-of-interest policy and established
procedures for reviewing its staff decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some major progress toward creating a truly
competitive environment in the .com, .net and .org domain-naming
system,'' Ms. Dyson said. ``We also showed the consensus process in
operation by changing our initial proposals to reflect the
community's feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the creation of Icann and just about everything the
board has proposed have stirred opposition and controversy around
the globe, nothing has been more contentious than its refusal to
hammer out policy decisions in public.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson said the board had also relaxed its requirements for
companies that wanted to compete with Network Solutions, which has
operated until now as a government-protected monopoly. It is
currently the exclusive registrar for the most popular top-level
domains _ .com, .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   International complaints about the company's lucrative monopoly
led the United States last year to create Icann and to move
administration of the Internet from federal contractors to the new
private corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either meet that criteria or you can prove to us that
you don't need to,'' Ms. Dyson said. ``You can say, `Hey, I've got
only two guys, but we're total Net heads, we've been in business
five years, we've never had any complaints. We don't need five
employees.'''
</P>
<P>
   Icann's initial goal is to introduce five competitors to the
domain-registration business by the end of April. That test is
expected to last about two months, after which Icann plans to let
an unlimited number of companies around the world participate in
the registry.
</P>
<P>
   Applications for those initial five will be taken beginning next
Monday. The Icann staff, led by its interim president, Mike
Roberts, will pick the first five companies from those applicants.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Ms. Dyson said, Icann will lower the threshold.

NEWS ANALYSIS: AT&AMP;T'S EMBRACE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SIGNALS NEXT ERA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid last week's typically hectic flow of headlines about the
communications industry, perhaps the most significant news of all
got lost: Frank Ianna, president of the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s network unit,
announced that by the end of this year, the long-distance giant
wanted to stop buying traditional telephone switches for the core
of its network.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Ianna's pronouncement last Tuesday was not the
lapel-grabbing kind of news generated by a multibillion-dollar
takeover or the latest hot Internet stock. But it was a seminal
moment for the communications industry and in some ways for
everyone who uses a phone.
</P>
<P>
   As it halts decades of investing in the traditional gear that
makes up most of the global phone system, AT&AMP;T is retooling its
network around a new generation of technologies inspired partly by
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and MCI Worldcom, the other long-distance giants, are
doing much the same thing. But as the biggest communications
company in the United States, AT&AMP;T wields a proportionately larger
influence in the market and with technology suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday's announcement was perhaps the definitive sign that
at least in the long-distance business, the aging and increasingly
crowded phone network would be rejuvenated with younger, more
efficient technologies.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, this evolution could lead to lower prices. And in
the future, as the new technologies expand from the core of the
network to homes and businesses, consumers could also benefit from
new sorts of features and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the functionality moves closer and closer to the customer,
the bottom line for the consumer is that clearly we will drive the
economics down,'' said Neil J. Grenfell, an engineering vice
president at Sprint. ``This can also help give the customer more
and more control and more and more integration.''
</P>
<P>
   This might mean, for instance, that a tourist or business
traveler who wanted to stay in touch could simply unplug the
handset from the home or office telephone and plug it into the base
of any other telephone. The network would recognize that the person
had moved around the block or across the country, and calls to the
original number would ring in the new location.
</P>
<P>
   Services like that are many years away and would require the
local phone companies to invest billions of dollars on top of the
current spending by long-distance carriers. And, of course, it
would require consumers to buy ``intelligent'' phones.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the new advanced networks being planned by AT&AMP;T and
others are new and advanced is that they change the way networks
behave at their most basic level.
</P>
<P>
   Since the invention of the telephone, almost every civilian
communications network has been based on the concept of circuits.
If a network is a multilane highway, then a system based on
circuits, known as a circuit-switched network, paints the lane
lines of that highway solid: each conversation has its own lane, or
circuit. If two people are on the phone with each other and neither
of them is speaking, they still use the entire circuit just as if
they are screaming. The standard voice circuit sends and receives
64,000 bits of information a second.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantages of circuit switching are that it is reliable
and relatively simple to carry out. The main disadvantage is that
it is extremely inefficient to keep an entire lane open for every
phone call, regardless of how much data _ in this case,
conversation _ it is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative that is being embraced by AT&AMP;T and the others is
a sort of mass-transit alternative called packet switching. On a
packet highway, the lane lines are dashed. Rather than consuming at
entire lane, each conversation gets broken up into millions of
small pieces, or packets, that are then mixed up with other
conversations only to be reassembled into intelligible
communications at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantage of packet switching, the technology used by
the Internet to move massive amounts of data around the globe, is
that it is extremely efficient. A conversation that takes up 64,000
bits a second on a circuit-switched network might take up only a
quarter of that, or 16,000 bits a second, on a packet-switched
system. That can allow carriers to lower their costs and,
potentially, the prices they charge consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that sorting out all those packets and routing
them to the right place requires ingenuity, especially when the
packets are carrying conversations. A few extra seconds when
loading a Web page may not mean much, but consumers expect their
phone calls to be perfect representations of what they are saying _
with no delays or distortion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The means for making packet-based systems robust enough to carry
millions of phone calls has just emerged over the last year or so
from companies including Ascend Communications, which has agreed to
be acquired by Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems and others.
</P>
<P>
   Packet-based, however, does not necessarily mean the Internet
version, known as Internet protocol.The main technology that AT&AMP;T
and many other long-distance carriers are looking toward is called
asynchronous transfer mode.
</P>
<P>
   In the jargon of the communications industry, ATM uses ``cells''
rather than packets. That is because while the data packets
generated by Internet protocol vary in length, the data cells in an
ATM system are always the same size, generally 53 bytes. That
uniformity can be a powerful advantage because it allows ATM to
carry co-mingled voice, video and data traffic without sacrificing
much efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while Internet protocol often ships each packet of
information to its destination by a different path, ATM sets up
so-called virtual circuits, which help insure that a transmission
of Hamlet's soliloquy begins with ``To be'' instead of ``Be to'' or
``Eb ot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is basing its network of the future largely on ATM
switches made by NEC of Japan, though Sprint is also working
closely with Cisco. AT&AMP;T is using Ascend's ATM equipment. MCI
Worldcom has asked vendors to submit proposals for ATM switches but
has not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   One of the raging debates in the communications industry is
whether ATM is necessary at all or whether Internet protocol is
reliable enough to form the underlying network language instead.
For now, most of the big carriers are wary of Internet protocol,
partly because not all of the work has yet been done to add
advanced features like Caller ID and call-waiting to Internet-based
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the software you need to do call-waiting in the
circuit world,'' Ianna said. ``Think about the software and the
intelligence you need to replicate that in the IP world. It's
non-trivial. There is a lot of router work that needs to be done,
and it's not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time AT&AMP;T revamped its network so thoroughly was about
10 years ago when it upgraded its long-distance network from copper
wires to optical fiber. About 20 years ago, the company upgraded
its circuit switches from analog to digital.
</P>
<P>
   `'This is the next-generation architecture,'' Ianna said. ``If
analog was the first generation and digital switching was the
second and digital transmission was the third, this is the fourth.
It is significant.''

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Being snowbound has its
advantages. I have, for instance, recently learned everything I
could ever want to know about Stonewall Jackson and Grand Funk
Railroad. Everything and more. How many times have you longed for
some time to sit down, relax and converse with your spouse? During
the recent inclemencies, Jim and I have had the opportunity to do
just that. Be careful what you pray for. (McCarty, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ In the 1970s, my wife, Ruth, and I were
standing on the veranda of a wonderful old hotel at Cooperstown,
N.Y. Joe DiMaggio was across the veranda, chatting with friends.
``I'm going to say hello to him,'' Ruth said. I wouldn't have
dared. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED TUESDAY.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ Deregulation of public education: Is that
what we're talking about with these school vouchers? If so, hold
the phone. I happen to have an opinion about public education. My
opinion is that no other institution has contributed more to
democracy in America. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED TUESDAY.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin filmmaker Steve Mims is
auctioning off his 1980 Honda Civic on the Internet to help pay for
the low budget film he's about to introduce at the South by
Southwest Film Festival. ``People should know that the air
conditioner blows cold,'' said Steve, who also owns a 10-year-old
Honda. Steve is borrowing $20,000 to pay for the final print of his
film, ``The Perfect Specimen.'' To help repay the loan, he's
selling the older car, which is not a perfect specimen. Steve says
State Farm Insurance has declared the '80 Civic totalled twice,
after two different wrecks. Something tells me Steve isn't going to
get quite $20,000 for this car. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman)

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's get this
straight: The day President Clinton apologized to the nation but
not to Monica Lewinsky, the poor thing felt dirty and used. Monica,
who considered herself the president's ``sexual soulmate,'' is
sorry for what happened. Oh, and by the way, she didn't intend to
cause the president public embarrassment. She was fully prepared to
lie in the Paula Jones investigation. That would be ``like putting
on a team jersey.'' Really? To play offense, defense or both? I
gleaned these meager details from the pre- and post-hype of Barbara
Walters' tour through the sewers of Monica's mind last week on
20/20. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   STARWARS-FANS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people can't figure
out what they'll be doing next week, much less in two months. Not
Joseph Helmsorig. For the past year, May 21 has been a sacred date.
That's when the new Star Wars movie, Episode I: The Phantom Menace,
debuts in theaters. And the day before, the 29-year-old emergency
medical technician from Sunrise, Fla. will don a homemade costume
and transform himself into Boba Fett, an obscure character who had
all of six lines of dialogue in the three previous films. Then
he'll trudge down to the local theater _ in his $1,100 get-up _ and
camp out overnight so he can party with hundreds of others who have
waited since 1983 for a fresh Star Wars movie. And after seeing
Phantom the first time, he plans to go to as many showings as he
can get into that day. Yes, Helmsorig is truly devoted. ``My
fascination with Star Wars knows no boundaries,'' he says, almost
solemnly. He has plenty of company in his galaxy of adoration. If
Internet traffic is any indication, an untold legion is lurking in
a parallel universe waiting for the big day. (Houck, Palm Beach

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: In public school they teach you to
share
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush wants vouchers for
Texas parents who had rather educate their children in private
schools or home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it seems that whatever George W. Bush wants, he gets.
From what I read, if and when he decides he wants to be president,
he'll get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then he'll want school vouchers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation of public education: Is that what we're talking
about? If so, hold the phone.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to have an opinion about public education. My opinion
is that no other institution has contributed more to democracy in
America.
</P>
<P>
   And now we're going to whittle it down into a bunch of splinter
groups?
</P>
<P>
   People who want their kids to go to private or church schools,
or who want to school them at home, think they ought to be able to
spend their tax money for education the way they please. After all,
it's THEIR kids.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of argument may sound like it makes sense. The truth
is, it's talking silly.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well argue that people whose kids are out of
school, or single people who never even had children, shouldn't
have to pay school taxes, that government should give back their
money so they can spend it as best benefits them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the issue, what's best for you or what's best for
me. Rather, it's what's best for America.
</P>
<P>
   Every citizen has an investment in public education. Our
nation's children represent our nation's future. As they succeed,
we all succeed. It's not by luck that America enjoys the most
advanced technology and the healthiest economy.
</P>
<P>
   You like the idea of school vouchers? Then why not this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not park vouchers for parents who'd rather take their
children to Disneyland instead of public parks?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not road vouchers for motorists who prefer toll roads to
the public highway system?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not water vouchers for those of us who drink bottled water
instead of city water?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not zoo vouchers for animal lovers who enjoy their own
personal menagerie over the public zoo? (With eight dogs and two
cats, personally I could use the money.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not protection vouchers for private police and firemen who
would come to the aid of only those who subscribe to their
services?
</P>
<P>
   _ And why not, while we're at it, arms vouchers for militia
groups who don't trust the U.S. military to defend the nation?
</P>
<P>
   Why not, indeed? Because it's silly, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposals for school vouchers aren't silly. Such ideas,
proposed by such leaders as Gov. Bush, are very serious _ a very
serious threat to our public education system.
</P>
<P>
   You want to home-school your children? Fine.
</P>
<P>
   You want to send your children to private schools? Fine.
</P>
<P>
   But not at the expense of OUR public schools.

NEW DEVICE FOR PLAYING MUSIC FROM THE INTERNET  
 PIXEL AIMS TO EXPLOIT FRINGES OF THE DESKTOP 
 SOFTWARE TURNS COMPUTERS INTO DESKTOP LIE DETECTORS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The recording industry's recognition that the Internet is
changing the music business is coming none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Music and Internet Expo on Saturday, Creative
Technology Ltd., long the leading seller of audio circuitry for
personal computers, showed off a line of products to help meet the
pent-up demand for devices that can retrieve and play music from
the Internet. The devices use the MP3 software format, which is the
most popular way to transmit audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Creative, a Singapore company whose U.S. operations are based in
Milpitas, Calif., said that it would start selling its portable MP3
player this spring for less than $200, roughly the same price as
the Rio MP3 player from Diamond Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rio, which was announced in October to much fanfare
along with a lawsuit from record companies, Creative's device,
called the Nomad, is about the size of pack of cigarettes and holds
as much music as an audio CD.
</P>
<P>
   Creative's announcement came a week after a group of recording
and technology companies, which have formed the Secure Digital
Music Initiative, announced a leader and an ambitious timetable for
their effort to create a technical standard for the copyrighted
sale and digital delivery of music over the Internet. The group's
effort is an implicit attack on MP3, which has no copyright
protections and is the popular choice of Internet music pirates.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the main business opportunity for MP3 appears to be the
hardware for playing the music. The Recording Industry Association
of America went to court last year in an attempt to block Diamond
from selling the Rio. But the judge sided with Diamond, paving the
road for other companies, like Creative, to enter the MP3 filed.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics of Korea has also announced plans to bring a
device called the Yepp MP3 player to the U.S. market sometime this
year. Several other consumer electronics companies are also said to
be well along in MP3 development, even as they worry that the
devices could cannibalize sales of their own portable cassette and
CD players.
</P>
<P>
   Creative brings an established brand name to the digital music
market. Its Sound Blaster audio card for use in PCs has been among
the most popular computer peripheral products of the decade. And
its Inspire music Web site (www.creativeinspire.com) already has a
large following.

   Pixel Aims to Exploit Fringes of the Desktop
</P>
<P>
   In its antitrust trial, Microsoft Corp. has repeatedly said that
it had granted personal computer makers greater freedom to do as
they please with the Windows desktop screen, which pops into view
when a machine is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   One of Microsoft's old adversaries, Robert Steinberg, an
intellectual property lawyer, has noticed the same thing _ and sees
a business opportunity. ``There is some loosening up and,
frankly,'' he said, ``that is one of the reasons I'm coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Steinberg will become the chief executive of Pixel Co.,
a Seattle start-up. Its business plan is to exploit some of the
valuable real estate on computer desktops that Pixel insists is
technically and legally beyond Microsoft's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's software grabs a slender band of unused screen space,
called the overscan area, about one-quarter to one-half inch along
each edge of the screen. Its first product is a control bar, called
My Space, that sits on the bottom edge of the screen, just below
the Windows 98 task bar. By clicking on a My Space icon, a user can
be linked to a site on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC, a large PC maker, has installed My Space on
its new consumer machines, which will begin arriving in stores in a
couple of weeks. Pixel's next product is a more robust software
engine _ an as-yet unnamed control bar that will reside along the
right-hand side of the screen. Available later this year, the new
software will be able to start other programs, like browsers and
spreadsheets. Steinberg hopes it will be attractive to the large
all-in-one portal sites, like Yahoo, that are fighting for
placement and attention on the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, a partner at Irell &AMP; Manella in Los Angeles, wrote
the patent for the data-compression technology that became the
center of a legal dispute between Microsoft and Stac Electronics
Inc., which Steinberg represented. In 1994, a jury ordered
Microsoft to pay Stac $120 million for patent infringement, though
Microsoft later settled the case for an estimated $50 million and
took a 15 percent stake in Stac.

   Software Turns Computers Into Desktop Lie Detectors
</P>
<P>
   Don't fudge that expense account. Not if the people in Accounts
Payable have been in touch with B. Francis Camis, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For about the price of a business lunch, Camis' new company,
Digital Robotics Inc., of Westmont, Ill., offers a lie detector
program designed to work on any PC equipped with a microphone. Like
polygraph equipment used by law enforcement agencies, the Fortress
Personal Lie Detector analyzes the stress levels in a person's
voice to determine whether they are telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortress is just one program in an arsenal of security
programs from Digital Robotics (www.digitalrobotics.com), which
Camis founded after leaving his job as a network administrator for
a unit of Lucent Technologies and a brief stint as a computer
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   His company's other digital subterfuge tools include Digital
Dynomite, a program that wipes out the audit trail of activities on
your PC, and a personal firewall program for keeping out viruses
and other interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   Camis said he was initially aiming the Fortress at home users
for ``personal experimentation,'' although he would happily sell it
to anybody who was interested. Hoping to protect himself and
Digital Robotics from lawsuits stemming from misuse of the program,
Camis emphasizes that anyone using Fortress must first get the
written consent of the person whose voice is being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortress is available through Digital Robotics' Web site and
other online stores for $29.95, with a free 15-day tryout.
</P>
<P>
   The program works by analyzing subliminal levels of stress
expressed through changes in the voice, such as the frequency
range. Camis said that the more that a person has emotionally at
stake in a statement, the easier a lie is to detect. ``For somebody
who's sociopathic, it probably wouldn't work,'' he said. Everybody
else _ 'fess up.

COMPANY TROLLS FOR SCUTTLEBUTT ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By   MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Alexander is the bearer of bad news for
hundreds of corporations. And now, Alexander's clients can take
heart that he intends to bring them more negative tidings more
quickly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, 30, and his brother, Charles Lukaszewski, 32, are
co-founders and operators of Ewatch, a company that scours the
Internet on behalf of corporate clients who want to know what the
rest of the world is saying behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman is a pedophile; the chairman is arrested; the
chairman has checked into a hospital under an assumed name,''
Alexander said, rattling off recent examples of false rumors from
the dark corners of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have long paid so-called clipping services to
monitor their appearances in the conventional news media. But
Ewatch and its several competitors have taken the practice online
and a step further.
</P>
<P>
   This new generation of monitors goes beyond news publishers and
instead trolls for rumor and innuendo in the Net's virtual back
alleys _ in thousands of chat rooms and discussion forums where,
Ewatch executives say, unchecked scuttlebutt can damage corporate
reputations and stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   These brothers grim _ Lukaszewski a programmer by training and
Alexander a former television producer _ started Ewatch in 1994
from their home offices in Minneapolis and New York, respectively.
With help from friends and family, they spent days searching the
Internet for venom spewed against corporations, trying to convince
potential clients of the need for online rumor detection and
control.
</P>
<P>
   But bad news for corporate America meant good public relations
for Ewatch. After O.J. Simpson's acquittal on murder charges in
October 1995, for example, a false rumor _ first reported on the
tabloid television show ``Hard Copy,'' and then spread on the
Internet _ said that Mrs. Field's Cookies had underwritten a party
for the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales dipped, Alexander said, and Ewatch was hired
to help Mrs. Fields find online discussion groups where the rumor
had appeared, and then post corrective messages. Cookie sales soon
returned to normal levels, Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as cyberspace has grown, so have Ewatch's methods.
As its client list expanded, the company scrapped manual monitoring
for automated ``spiders'' _ search tools that scour chat groups for
key-word phrases.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, Ewatch began a more fundamental
overhaul, upgrading its software and server computers to quadruple
the speed at which they scan and process information. The company
also replaced its home-brewed search engine with search software
from Excalibur Technology, which will be coupled with a new Oracle
data base management system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is experiencing uncontrollable growth, and we
have to be prepared for it,'' said Alexander, who also said that
the upgrade would cost $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Ewatch combs through more than 250,000 postings from
the sprawling online discussion forum known as Usenet. It also
monitors thousands of other postings from the financial chat rooms
on leading Web sites, including Yahoo and Motley Fool, while also
scanning discussion areas on the leading proprietary online
services like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the challenge of keeping apace of Internet growth,
Ewatch has another concern: competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the handful of competitors offering monitoring services
are Cybercheck, a Denver company that says it can search for key
words in 150,000 online sources, and Cyveillance, an Alexandria,
Va., company that scans the bit stream for rumors, trademark
infringements and e-commerce developments that might affect its
corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   But Louis M. Thompson, president and chief executive of the
National Investor Relations Institute, a trade group based in
Vienna, Va., said that among Internet monitoring companies, Ewatch
``seems to be the big one on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewatch serves about 130 clients full time, including US West,
H.J. Heinz, Owens Corning and Northwest Airlines. It is no longer
independent, having been acquired by Wavephore Inc., a publicly
held data broadcasting company based in Phoenix. But it is still
operated by the brothers, with Alexander overseeing marketing from
New York and Lukaszewski operating the technology side from
Minneapolis, where the brothers were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that corporations had come to realize that the
same attributes that make the Internet a valuable commercial medium
_ such as the ability to quickly and cheaply spread information to
the masses _ can be a liability, too. That is especially true as
the rising popularity of online stock trading has placed a
fast-twitch premium on corporate information, often with little
regard to its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as more companies come to recognize the perils of the
electronic grapevine, Ewatch and other monitoring agents are
finding that their real competitors are often their would-be
clients. Many companies use in-house resources to monitor the
Internet, or ask their public relations firms to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Even if companies acknowledge that Ewatch may have superior
surveillance capabilities, they may not always be convinced that
the $13,000-a-year service is worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Take Itex Corp., a small, publicly held financial record-keeping
company in Portland, Ore., which has filed a lawsuit against
several people whom Itex accuses of making defamatory remarks
against the company in a Yahoo chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company filed its suit, the burden of trolling the
Internet for corporate gossip is being borne by the company's
assistant general counsel, Stephen C. Pearson. He said the small
public company _ which was recently delisted from the Nasdaq stock
market after the Securities and Exchange Commission said Itex had
failed to submit its annual report on time _ could not afford the
likes of Ewatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Ewatch in particular and did a brief analysis of
their systems,'' Pearson said. ``We came to the conclusion that it
was pretty expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ewatch's better capitalized bigger clients say the
service has proved valuable, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a loose and free exchange of information on the
Internet,'' said Tom Pinto, spokesman for the giant pension system
TIAA-CREF, which manages more than $250 billion in assets.
``Anything that is inaccurate or harmful, we want to know
immediately about it and respond.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last October, for example, a visitor to a Compuserve
discussion room wrote that a TIAA-CREF pension fund called Global
Equities held 25 percent of its assets in Asia. In fact, the fund
held only 5 percent of its assets in the region, and it was a
potentially devastating error, coming amid the Asian economic
crisis. Had the rumor spread, Pinto recalled, it might have caused
investors to flee the $6 billion pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, an Ewatch report landed on Pinto's desk. Two days
later, the TIAA-CREF manager of media relations sent e-mail to the
mediator of the chat group, who posted a correction.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of messages posted daily to tens of
thousands of Internet message boards, it might seem humanly
impossible to patrol even a fraction of cyberspace. But Ewatch
relies on its search spiders and computers to do most of the
culling, before handing off to the half-dozen people Ewatch employs
to do the final winnowing before passing along the information to
clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, the searches have periodically turned up some
juicy material. Take the episode, for instance, when a group of
restive shareholders plotted online to disrupt an annual corporate
meeting _ even agreeing to the clothes they would wear so they
could identify one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Ewatch clients are not necessarily looking for bad
tidings, but simply any news or discussions that might be relevant
to the company. Owens Corning, based in Toledo, Ohio, instructs
Ewatch to search not just for its name, but also for the words
``fiberglass,'' ``insulation'' and ``asphalt,'' Jim Worden, an
Owens Corning spokesman, said. Such searches, he said, help the
company stay abreast of consumer sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Ewatch will be offered for an extra fee to subscribers of
Wavephore's primary product, Newscast, which gives corporations
tailored news feeds from thousands of sources like Dow Jones,
Reuters and PR Newswire. And Ewatch subscribers, in turn, will be
given access to Newscast Lite, a significantly slimmed-down version
of Newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Alexander said he would like to create a service
that would help a company analyze the combined impact of Internet
rumors, media coverage and the client's own public relations
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that plenty of details still need to be
worked out, he envisions the day when a client could type in a
natural-language query like ``Why are sales lagging in Minnesota?''
and receive reports about marketing, media and mendacity that might
help explain the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And on the assumption that no news is not necessarily good news,
the company plans eventually to monitor not only for gossip and
innuendo, but for the absence of chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a company that's spent $100 million on a launch
campaign and no one's talking about you _ why is that?'' Alexander
said. ``If there's nothing about you online, isn't that valuable
information to know?''

E-COMMERCE: INTERNET RETAILERS WORK TO TURN SHOPPERS INTO BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By   BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet shoppers may be at the vanguard of a retail
revolution, but as with anyone on the front lines, they are a
jittery bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Those who shop on the Internet abandon one-half to two-thirds of
the purchases they begin, industry executives and analysts say. One
way that sites can measure the dropouts is through ``shopping
cart'' technology, which, as the name suggests, allows users to
gather items at a site for a one-stop checkout.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that online shoppers often start filling a cart,
but then leave the site without buying anything.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of such almost-sales, e-commerce sites have begun looking
at the problem and are feverishly devising methods to convert these
browsers into buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there widespread concern in the industry about this?'' said
Arno Harris, vice president for marketing at 911gifts.com, whose
site has seen 45 percent of its potential transactions abandoned
before checkout. ``I think there is.'' Of those who bail out,
Harris said, 30 percent drop off at the first page of the billing
process. ``We're still in the early phase of e-commerce adoption,
so a lot of people just get into the process and panic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives cite various reasons why customers bail out.
</P>
<P>
   First, some consumers are just trying out the online shopping
experience, without intending to make a purchase. Others abandon
the process when confronted with often-hefty shipping and handling
charges at the end of the transaction, or with registration forms
that ask for personal information, like a home address, e-mail
address or phone number. Finally, a significant _ but diminishing _
number of users remain unsure about giving out their credit card
information online.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Hyde, vice president of online sales for REI.com, an
outdoor goods retailer, conjectures that many Internet users are
simply playing with sites that have e-commerce capabilities, just
as people try out anything new before seriously considering
spending money on it. ``I put stuff in the cart all the time and
then leave, don't you?'' Hyde said. ``I did it three times on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Cassar, an e-commerce analyst for Jupiter
Communications, a New York-based research firm, said a big problem
was shipping and handling costs, which many sites do not disclose
until late in the buying process. ``It's sticker shock,'' Cassar
said. ``A lot of people just aren't willing to pay what is
essentially a 30 to 40 percent markup.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassar and other analysts said that security was less of an
issue than it was last year, when many in the industry were
predicting that such fears would slow the growth of e-commerce. To
date, there have been few actual reported instances of online
credit card fraud. And many consumers have chosen to shop online at
sites operated by established companies, perhaps further reducing
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   More Internet retailers are also designing their Web sites to
convey the image of a secure store, with an abundance of credit
card logos and other seals of approval adorning many companies'
home pages. Though some shoppers still balk at using their credit
cards online, Cassar said that many more were put off by
registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   William Bryant, chairman of Qpass, a company that has developed
a billing system for e-commerce sites, understands consumer
resistance to registering. ``Imagine going to a 7-Eleven to buy a
can of Coke, and having to fill out a registration form that asks
you about marital status,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect registration forms to disappear any time soon.
Internet companies love them, because they help retailers refine
their marketing efforts and aim advertisements on the site more
precisely (and thus charge more to advertisers). Even so, online
merchants are exploring ways to make registering less of a
hindrance, such as systems that would let users register one time
for multiple Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Excite, for example, lets users type in their credit card
information once and then shop at a number of merchants within the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Halliday, vice president for Excite's commerce division,
said the system not only eliminated registration redundancies, but
also gave shoppers fewer opportunities to abandon a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important, he said, because the Internet
has been a medium for impulse spending. ``You have to make a
consumer's purchase decision as slippery a slope as possible,''
referring to the speed with which sites should finalize sales.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, of 911Gifts.com, said that his company recently started
a similar system and that he expected it to reduce the number of
lost purchases at his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that people have pretty much figured out the economics of
getting customers to their sites, the focus is on conversion,'' he
said, noting that e-commerce sites typically convert less than 2
percent of their visitors into customers. ``This is a really
critical way merchants can improve economics without spending a lot
more money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most aggressive approach to the problem is
represented by Cybershop, an online department store that actually
pursues shoppers who abandon large purchases. Jeffrey Tauber,
Cybershop's chief executive, says that even when a shopper fills
and flees, the company can still ``capture a pretty good level of
information'' about who the consumer was. ``And if it's a nice-size
order, we'll call or e-mail them and try to close the sale,''
Tauber said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the customers the company pursues ultimately
complete the sale, Tauber said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the best antidote for shopping jitters is, simply, more
practice. Industry executives and analysts predict that if the
Internet's flagship merchants continue to provide positive shopping
experiences, fewer customers will hesitate about making a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the industry is going to get past its
abandonment issues, companies will have to allay customers'
concerns. The e-merchants, meanwhile, will also have to stock up on
the one commodity rarely found in cyberspace: patience.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, the E-Commerce Report will appear on alternate
Mondays in Business Day, and every Monday in the Technology section
of The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/tech.  &QL;

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Games play into PC choices 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Intel Corp. and AMD Inc. made a big to-do last
week when they introduced faster, more powerful processors _ the
Pentium III and K6-3.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? To run Microsoft Word or complex personal finance
programs? For many, the most important reason of all is that these
processors will help you dominate death matches in ``Quake II.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a trivial thing, basing the purchase of a new
computer or upgrade on a single game, but as it has always been in
the history of computers, games are a primary motivator for
computer evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Games, in short, are a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it's often been the simplistic _ games such as
``Tetris'' and ``Solitaire'' glued millions to desktops. But
increasingly, it's violent first-person shooters such as ``Quake
II,'' ``Unreal'' and ``Half-Life'' that are upping the ante on how
much computing power is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To fully take advantage of a game such as ``Unreal'', you need a
fast processor, plenty of memory, a big enough hard drive to hold
the software, a 3D sound card that lets you hear the position of
your enemies and a speedy Internet connection to battle online.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all together, and you have a very powerful computer
system that, like the oversized, cartoonish weapons in ``Unreal,''
amount to computational overkill. In few other applications except
games do you need that kind of power. Who needs a $150 graphics
accelerator card to write a letter in Microsoft Word or to do a
Yahoo! search in Netscape Communicator?
</P>
<P>
   The computer demands of games are so great, in fact, that
magazines and Web sites that review computer systems regularly use
games such as ``Quake II'' ``Turok the Dinosaur Hunter'' and
``Descent: Freespace'' to benchmark systems _ the true test of a
computer's power is how many frames per second it can display a
3D-rendered character's head being blown off by a plasma cannon.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of people who planned to purchase a new computer for
the home in the next 12 months, 57 percent of respondents said they
would buy games for that computer.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many people are using $1,500-$2,000 computer
systems as little more than game consoles is a bit confusing given
that a Sony PlayStation, which often offers better control in a
wide variety of games, sells for $129. And a coming generation of
consoles including Sega's Dreamcast and Sony's next PlayStation are
to offer processing, sound and graphics that will surpass PC
capabilities for less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   But high-end, resource-hogging games continue to be popular,
especially among early adopters and PC experts. The reason is that
PC games are playable over the Internet (Dreamcast will ship with a
modem, but so far console games have not made effective use of the
Net), they can be added to with downloaded patches and upgrades,
and they usually have rich graphics and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers also like the demands these games place on their systems
_ nothing speaks more highly of a gamer's dedication than having
the fastest computer with the best graphic capabilities on which to
play.
</P>
<P>
   What console systems and PC games have shared is the ability to
create a demand for hardware based on a few popular titles. Sony
has had Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider Series, ``Resident Evil''
and ``Final Fantasy VII.'' Nintendo had ``Mario 64,'' ``Goldeneye:
007'' and ``The Legend of Zelda: Orinca in Time.'' And the PC has
had breakthrough games such as ``Quake,'' ``Unreal'' and ``Grim
Fandago.''
</P>
<P>
   While those console games have moved entire systems, the demands
of games for PCs have provoked gamers into buying powerful graphics
cards, better sound systems and faster processors.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not new _ Origin System's ``Wing Commander''
games in the early '90s enticed gamers into purchasing Sound
Blaster-compatible sound cards to hear the digital soundtrack and
speech incorporated into the game.
</P>
<P>
   But more than ever, computer games are becoming the primary
motivator for the introduction of faster, more powerful computer
systems. Until the Internet evolves as more people get higher
bandwidth connections in the home, the dimly lit, spectacularly
detailed walls and skies of ``Unreal'' and ``Half-Life'' will be
where computer users get the most out of their machines.

With cable modem, the thrill returns 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who know me, either from reading this
column or from having breakfast with me at the Waffle House,
understand _ despite the fact that I've messed around with gadgets
for my entire adult life _ I am not a bold man when it comes to
adopting new technology.
</P>
<P>
   I've never, for instance, stuck a deposit in an ATM, because I'm
sure it'll get lost somehow. I use a bald-headed man named Marvin,
not a computer, to figure my taxes. And my checkbook stays
unbalanced just fine without Quicken. My computer is slow and
clunky compared to what most people have and want. I'm happy with
old tech that is dependable and has proven its worth.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you ought to listen when something new catches my
eye. If I like it, you probably wil, too.
</P>
<P>
   Do yourself a favor. As soon as they're available in your
neighborhood _ and if you have the money to spare _ get a cable
modem and use it to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I did a week ago. It made a big difference, but
maybe not in the ways you'd expect. In fact, what I expected and
what I got were two different things.
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what I mean. I saw a cable modem as simply a way
to get Web pages to load faster and something that would let me
download new files quickly. Both those things turned out to be true
(I downloaded a new 15-megabyte copy of Netscape Navigator in the
time it took me to eat five cookies), and Web pages are fast now,
faster even than when I use the expensive T1 high-speed data line
at work.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, things that weren't practical before, like
downloading a new program just to see what it is like; looking at
video that appears as clear and stable as a TV signal (although
still in a tiny box on my screen); and listening to audio that is
of an almost high-fidelity quality, become possible.
</P>
<P>
   But something more important happened, too. I began treating the
Web the way I used to, way back in the beginning when it was new. I
was surfing again.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing used to be a big deal to a lot of us. We'd go to one Web
page, click on an interesting link, follow it, and then follow
another one. A person could literally go from beekeeping to Peru in
just a few minutes. A lot of what we found wasn't immediately
practical, but it was almost like getting a liberal arts education:
Some of the things I learned became important later on.
</P>
<P>
   It was very much like picking up a book out of boredom,
something you would have never read, and discovering something
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Then two things happened. The Web got useful _ something that I,
you too probably, use at work to find out boring stuff like the
gross national product of Mexico. So, instead of surfing, I'd head
right to the spot where the information was held. The second thing
that happened was that Web pages got big and complicated _ full of
video and sound _ and that meant they took forever to load at
analog modem speeds. So I hesitated before pressing a link just for
fun. Sometimes it took a couple of minutes for the page to build.
</P>
<P>
   Think of owning a cable modem as being data-rich. You have
enough bandwidth to squander some, to use it just for fun. And,
truthfully, with my old dial-up connection the Web wasn't much fun.
There were times when I could go to the kitchen to fix a sandwich
while I waited for a page to build.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thanks to my cable modem, I'm surfing again. And it's
just as much fun as it used to be. Get yourself a cable modem. The
surf is up.

A site for headache sufferers 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Headache sufferers now have their own home on the Web,
http://www.headaches.org.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $20 to join the organization that sponsors the site,
the National Headache Foundation, based in Chicago. The membership
fee includes a headache relief video. The site also offers lots of
free information. A comprehensive guide to headaches lists
different types of headaches, such as tension, migraine, cluster
and hormone. The site offers tips on how to choose a headache
doctor and what to expect on your first visit to that doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was started in 1970 as a nonprofit organization
focused on three goals: to offer information to headache sufferers,
their families and the physicians who treat them; to promote
headache research into potential causes and possible treatments;
and to teach the public that headaches are serious disorders and
that sufferers need understanding and continuity of care.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the organization includes a quarterly newsletter,
brochures about headache prevention, a list of physician members,
discounts on books, brochures and audio and video tapes, toll-free
access to the NHF office, breaking news developments, and
information about support groups near your home.
</P>
<P>
   NBA PLAYER LAUNCHES AMBITIOUS WEB SITE
</P>
<P>
   Sports teams have had their own Web sites since the Internet
became popular. Now individual players are taking the cue.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Spurs second-year power forward Tim Duncan has
launched http://www.slamduncan.com, known as The Official Tim
Duncan Website.
</P>
<P>
   The site lists a biography, stats and highlights. The bio
includes such must-have information as Duncan's shoe size (16),
what tattoos he wears, his favorite actor and what cars he drives
(a Yukon Denali and a Porsche).
</P>
<P>
   The Courtside page gives you the chance to e-mail Duncan, sign
his guest book, read about his charitable contributions and look at
the Spurs' 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For the true Duncan fan, the stats page lists Duncan's numbers
in the NBA as well as in his four seasons at Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the site will offer a public fan mail section
complete with Duncan's responses to e-mail and regular chat
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is apparently a movie and music lover. Ultimately, the
site will give visitors the chance to read his reviews of CDs and
movies.
</P>
<P>
   HERE'S HOW TO TREAT A CELL PHONE WITH RESPECT
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched ``The X-Files'' last Sunday remembers Fox
Mulder waking up over and over to a series of annoying things, one
of which was a leaky water bed that shorted out his cell phone,
which was on the water-soaked rug. Mulder could have avoided a
shorted-out phone had he paid attention to the rules of cell phone
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at AirTouch, one of several cellular phone sellers on
the market, recently put out a list of cell phone tips, one which
was to keep your cell phone dry.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Read your owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treat a cell phone like other electronic devices and keep it
and all parts and accessories away from children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't keep your phone in hot areas. High temperatures can
shorten the life of electronic devices, damage batteries, and warp
or melt some plastics.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the same time, don't store your cell phone in cold areas.
As the phone warms, moisture forming inside can damage the circuit
boards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never try to open your cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't keep your cell phone in dusty, dirty areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try not to drop, knock or shake your cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't use harsh chemicals or solvents to clean your phone. Use
a soft, cloth, lightly dampened with a soap-and-water solution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider getting your phone an annual service check-up.

Get your pheromones, better sex life via e-mail 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``BOOST YOUR SEX APPEAL AND CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL AND SEX
LIFE FOREVER,'' said the message header.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless you've gotten e-mail like this, too. Maybe you read
it. Maybe you sent off for the stuff. Maybe you just ignored it, as
I did until just now.
</P>
<P>
   After all, an august computer columnist ought not to be nosing
around things like this. No telling where it might all end, but
given my luck it would end in the emergency room, the police
blotter or the gossip column.
</P>
<P>
   But I was feeling pretty down. My social life revolves around my
wife, my guinea pigs, and, blessedly but only occasionally, my
granddaughters. Sex appeal? In the eyes of a matronly walrus,
perhaps. Sex life? Well, that's private, and I wish it needed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   So, what the hey. Let's see what these sleazebags are peddling.
</P>
<P>
   What they are peddling are ``the natural human male/female
pheromone attractants and they are NOW available to YOU, legally.''
</P>
<P>
   I never knew pheromones were available to me at all, even
illegally. I never heard of the DEA raiding an underground
pheromone lab, or had anyone sidle up on a dark street corner and
whisper, ``Hey, big 'un, wanna dime bag 'a pheros? Finest kind _
Bolivian blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Pheromones, of course, are sexual attractants, but I assumed
they were limited to Mediterranean fruit flies. Florida, which is
bedeviled by these bugs, is always trying to use pheromones to lure
them to their deaths. I cannot see how my life would be improved by
my own personal cloud of fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   But the aptly named purveyor of this stuff, Euphoria Products,
located, predictably, in Florida, claims humans have pheromones,
too, and all one needs for a wildly busy love life is an abundance
of them.
</P>
<P>
   According to my e-mail, this product, called HI-octane, contains
both male and female pheromones in a ``clear, odorless liquid,''
and the lovelorn are supposed to add it to their ``favorite perfume
or cologne.'' Despite this, the Euphoria folks say, ``This will not
attract same sex; but works as nature intended, attracting the
opposite sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like computer software. ``Hey, some clown back in
production dumped the male vat and the female vat together. We got
to figure out how to make this a feature and not a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it might work just fine, but I wouldn't want to send
mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem. I don't have a favorite cologne. I
tried it when I was a kid. It stings when you put it on, it tends
to smell like old saddle leather steeped in cheap whiskey, and if
girls got close to me their eyes watered and they sneezed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the e-mail claims a little dab'll do ya, since the
stuff sells for $40 per 1/8-ounce bottle (buy two, get one free),
the likelihood of overdosing seems inevitable. A testimonial from
Dave J., who can scarcely be heard over the clamor of women, says,
``I'd like to know if your product is available in a larger
quantity so I can make sure I'm never without it!''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, you should beware of peddlers offering substitutes,
like maybe water buffalo pheromones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful,'' cry the folks at Euphoria. ``Animal pheromones
do NOT attract humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't e-mail wonderful?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Intel's Pentium III more evolutionary than revolutionary 
By Bill Husted 
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ PCs with the new Pentium III chip from Intel are on
shelves now. These new machines are the fastest yet, reasonably
priced and _ based on early reports _ relatively bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? If the chip is a good one, and it is, and if the price
is right, and it is, why not rush to the store and take one home?
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to answer that question for yourself by the end
of this article.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know about the Pentium III is the internal
workings of the chip _ its architecture _ isn't all that different
from the Pentium II. In fact, if you have a Pentium II machine, the
new chip is so similar to the old one, odds are good you can simply
remove the old chip and plug in a new Pentium III with no problems
at all. But don't do that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Keep reading.
</P>
<P>
   The real changes in this newest Pentium from Intel are in what
is called its instruction set. The instruction set is really more
like a computer program than a part of the chip. It consists of
computer code that instructs the chip on how to compute. Without
the instructions, it would be an expensive and useless piece of
silicon about the size of a matchbook.
</P>
<P>
   The new instruction set will eventually allow Pentium III chips
to handle video much better (since computer games are loaded with
video, games will run much faster). The instructions _ called
Katmai New Instructions _ also let the chip do a better job with
speech recognition, a technology rapidly becoming practical and
useful.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the first reason why there's no need to rush to the
store today: Only software specially written to take advantage of
the new instruction set will get a speed boost. Your old programs
won't profit from this instruction set.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few games take advantage of KNI (including
``Wargasm'' and ``Descent III''). As time goes on, that will
change. Video cards will be created that recognize the new
instructions, and Windows 2000 will have built-in support for KNI.
(Microsoft has said it will create a patch _ a tiny program
designed to improve an existing one _ that will let Windows 98 take
advantage of KNI.) Since Windows itself is a heavy user of graphics
and sound, the combination of the patch and the new chip should
make your PC run faster.
</P>
<P>
   MARK OF THE BEAST?
</P>
<P>
   When the Pentium III's specifications were first announced,
there was panic and protest among many computer enthusiasts.
Messages zipped through cyberspace as word got out that the new
chip has a built-in electronic serial number. Intel says the
purpose of the serial number _ which will identify the computer to
other computers on the Internet _ was to increase security. After
all, passwords and user names can be faked. But Intel said _ when
combined with the built-in serial number _ there would be less
chance of someone faking an electronic transaction or e-mail. But
for some computer folks, that serial number was the mark of the
beast. There was worry that the serial number would make it
impossible to have any privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's reaction was to create a small program that can be
downloaded from Intel's Web site (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.intel.com) that gives users control over the serial number.
Those who fear the number can invade their privacy can turn off the
serial number, and those who buy into Intel's argument that the
serial number actually protects privacy and security can leave it
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   BUY TODAY, LOSE OUT TOMORROW
</P>
<P>
   You've already learned most of the speed is yet to come, as
software programs take advantage of the new instruction set.
Depending on what figures you see and whom you believe, the new
machine should run about 5 percent to 8 percent faster (not enough
of a change for most people to notice) with programs that do not
take advantage of the new instruction set.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies will gear up to support the KNI instructions.
But at least as important is the fact Intel has said it expects to
offer Pentium III chips by the end of the year with speeds as fast
as 1 gigahertz (a little more than twice as fast as the
450-megahertz speed of the current PIII chips).
</P>
<P>
   So, if you buy a Pentium III today, you may find yourself with a
high-tech antique.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you decide the faster Pentium IIIs aren't important,
waiting makes sense. New chips and king-of-the-hill computers
command a premium price. Prices for slower Pentium IIIs will take a
nose dive as 1-gigahertz class machines are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   If you'll settle for a Pentium II, take note of Intel's
announcement last week that it will drop the price for that chip by
15 percent to 20 percent. That doesn't mean Pentium II PCs will
make the same percentage drop, since there's more to a computer
than a single chip, but it adds momentum to price drops already
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it is true with automobiles, prices vary widely. But
some of the new Pentium IIIs sell for $2,000 or a bit more at the
bottom end of the price range. That's a good introductory price.
And, some people (especially those who have graphics-intensive
tasks to perform at work and who are lucky enough to use programs
that do or soon will take advantage of the new instruction set)
will pay it gladly.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us, the introduction of the Pentium III marks a
time when watching and waiting makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT THE INTEL PENTIUM III
</P>
<P>
   _ A set of internal instructions will eventually make it a
better chip for games and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ A controversial built-in serial number makes transactions on
the Net more secure _ or invades your privacy (depending on whom
you believe).
</P>
<P>
   _ Initially, it will come in two speeds: 450 megahertz and 500
megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Later versions (out by the end of the year) will be twice as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Features in the chip should make new technologies such as
voice recognition work faster and better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since the basic design of the chip has not changed from the
Pentium II, it can be used as a direct replacement in most Pentium
II machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is backward-compatible: All the programs that are running
on your current PC should work just fine on a new Pentium III.

LAWMAKERS LOOKING TO CRACK DOWN ON INTERNET ALCOHOL SALES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers introduced legislation Tuesday to make it
more difficult for minors to use the Internet to purchase alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would confer more power on state law
enforcement officials to crack down on such activity, also would
empower state officials to stop alcohol sales over the Internet,
mail-order catalog or phone in the 20 states where direct delivery
of alcoholic beverages is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Klein, assistant attorney general of Utah _ one of the 20
states _ said state officials recently intercepted 244 cases of
beer from a distributor called Beer Across America which sells beer
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that large numbers of minors actually use
the Internet to purchase alcohol, but several local television
stations have recently broadcast stories showing how easily it can
be done.
</P>
<P>
   One such story, which was displayed on monitors Tuesday during a
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Internet alcohol sales,
showed how a 13-year-old ordered a case of beer using a home
computer from a micro-brewery with her older brother's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager simply clicked on the icon that stated that she was
at least 21 years-old. Three weeks later the beer arrived at her
parents' door step, according to the TV station, KUTV, of Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it
delivered by borrowing a credit card and making a few clicks with
her mouse, there is something very wrong with the level of control
that is being exercised over these sales,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow states to use federal courts to go after
direct alcohol distributors. State officials have complained that
it is difficult to prosecute direct alcohol distributors if they
are located in another state.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, however, has raised the ire of the California
wine industry, which says it could inadvertently hurt its efforts
to sell wine over the Internet that is not readily available in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., who also operates a small
California winery, said the Hatch legislation ``would have the
unintended consequence of crippling small wineries in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   John DeLuca, president of the Wine Institute, an organization
that represents more than 450 California winemakers, said the
legislation would harm industry's efforts to lobby individual
states to change their laws to allow wineries to ship their
products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry argues that liquor stores carry a limited
selection of wine and that small wine-makers suffer as a result.
The Internet and mail-order catalogues give consumers access to
virtually any wine or beer that is made.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is pushing legislation in some states that would
allow a limited amount of alcohol, such as a case of wine or beer
per month, to be shipped to individuals. Nineteen states currently
have laws that allow limited alcohol shipments.
</P>
<P>
   On the problem of teenager buyers on the Internet, DeLuca
acknowledged that underage drinking is a ``serious problem,'' but
said ``minors are not purchasing any significant amount of wine or
alcohol by the relatively expensive and slow path of direct
shipments, which leaves a clear trail of delivery records and
credit card information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the committee,
urged a cautious approach to regulating Internet purchases of
alcohol, saying the Hatch bill was ``over-kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Feinstein said she had ``seen precious
few examples of youths on their own initiative'' deciding to obtain
alcohol via the Internet, ``waiting days or weeks for shipment and
managing to be home without their parents at just the crucial time
when it arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the examples of under-age-purchases on the
Internet ``involve youths who were prompted to do so, usually by a
local news organization,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Radonovich noted that there are already remedies available for
violations of liquor laws including revoking the federal permits
that are required to operate a winery or brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry is more supportive of efforts like one by Rep.
Juanita Millender-McDonald, D-Calif., who wants to require
distributors to clearly label a package as containing alcohol.
Shippers such as United Parcel Service would then be required to
obtain a signature of a person who is age 21 or older to leave a
package at a home or office.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she supports a similar approach.

MICROSOFT APPEARS UNLIKELY TO SETTLE ITS ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Microsoft antitrust trial broke for a six-week recess
on Feb. 26, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had some parting words
for both sides. He called the lawyers for the government and the
Microsoft Corp. into his chambers and told them to ``use this six
weeks wisely,'' according to a person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   It was a garden-variety judicial admonition, legal experts say,
to urge the two sides to see if they could again try to settle
their dispute. Judges, they say, typically prod litigants to
reconsider the option of settlement at key stages in a case. In the
Microsoft trial, the 12 witnesses for each side have concluded
their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There are no settlement talks currently under way between
Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the
software maker, according to a person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times reported on Tuesday that the government and
Microsoft were ``exploring ways'' to settle the suit and quoted
Robert Herbold, the chief operating officer of Microsoft, as
saying, ``You never block out the notion of settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Intel Corp. announced a proposed settlement of
its antitrust dispute with the Federal Trade Commission, the
possibility that Microsoft might also settle its case drove its
stock price sharply higher Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading, Microsoft's stock traded as high as $164.75 a
share, up $5.75 from Monday's close, though it drifted down later
in the day to close at $161.813 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the Justice Department did hold settlement talks
in the days before the government and states filed their sweeping
antitrust case against the company last May _ but those talks
quickly broke down when it became clear the two sides were far
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft and Intel cases, legal experts noted, are very
different. A settlement in one, they added, suggests next to
nothing about the chances of a settlement in the other, even though
both are computer industry powers charged with violating antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed a complaint against Intel contending that the big
chip maker unfairly withheld technical information from three
computer makers as a strong-arm tactic in patent disputes. The
government's case against Microsoft, by contrast, is a sweeping
antitrust suit contending that the software maker repeatedly tried
to stifle competition _ charges Microsoft fiercely denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A settlement would be far more difficult to reach in the
Microsoft case because the stakes are so much greater and the
distance between the two sides is so much wider than it was in the
Intel case,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Though not out of the question, settling a case after a trial
has begun is far less common than before testimony begins, as Intel
did. ``Once the two sides have descended into combat, it is far
more difficult,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust litigator at
Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft might or might not agree to as part of a
settlement is closely related to the debate over the remedies the
government might seek if it wins the case. These range from
prohibiting Microsoft from entering into exclusionary contracts to
splitting up the company.
</P>
<P>
   The government, according to most courtroom observers, will
likely win in Jackson's court after a strong trial performance by
its legal team. ``So it would take a real change in Microsoft's
thinking for it to offer something that the government could accept
as real remedial settlement,'' said one person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle in reaching a settlement is that any proposal
would have to be acceptable not only to the Justice Department, but
also to the 19 states involved in the case. A few dissenting
states, or even one, could scuttle a settlement proposal, legal
experts say.

MICROSOFT, OTHERS TO FILE ANTITRUST COMPLAINT AGAINST AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARK HALPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A $14.5 billion giant whose every thundering step shakes the
software industry can be just another money-losing upstart in
electronic commerce, and that makes for an interesting paradox
within Microsoft Corp. While Microsoft the gorilla wrestles the
Justice Department in a landmark antitrust suit, Microsoft the
upstart is asking the same agency to investigate possible antitrust
violations by the nation's airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company's MSN Expedia is among a group of Web-based travel
agencies that are furious over the airlines' own aggressive online
ticket sales and the slim commissions they pay online agencies. The
group claims that the airlines' practices are keeping most travel
agents off the Web and making business untenable for those who do
venture online.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, could eventually drive up fares for consumers by
limiting choice, Microsoft contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned things are happening in the marketplace that
are disadvantageous to the online travel agent,'' said Simon
Breakwell, the general manager of Microsoft's travel business unit.
``There are implications for consumer choice, and that would have
implications on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Three travel agency associations representing Microsoft and
other online agents will jointly file an antitrust complaint with
the Justice Department by the end of this month, said Reid Detchon,
executive director of one of the three, the Interactive Travel
Services Association. Microsoft's Breakwell sits on the
association's board and was instrumental in the decision to file.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the association in the complaint will be the American
Society of Travel Agents, of which Microsoft is also a member, and
the Coalition for Travel Industry Parity.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents' senior vice president for
legal affairs, Paul Ruden, said through a spokeswoman that the
Justice Department filing was ``imminent.'' The society filed its
own complaint in December alleging that airlines were attempting to
control Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft apparently sees no contradiction in crossing swords
with the government to protect its monopoly in one industry while
pointing an antitrust finger at a group of heavyweight companies in
another industry. In fact, the group's complaint will be addressed
to Joel Klein, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division and the man who masterminded the lawsuit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two are entirely unrelated,'' Breakwell said. Suzi LeVine,
Expedia's product manager, added, ``It's just a matter of us being
a part of what is right for consumers and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Microsoft's general counsel, William Neukom, declined
requests for an interview, a spokesman said the company's
continuing battle with the government ``does not prevent us from
moving forward with our business strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel agency filing is not a suit but a complaint asking
that the government investigate the airlines. At stake is the $29.4
billion that Forrester Research says online consumers will be
paying for airline tickets and other travel products in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   While travel agents sell 80 percent of all airline tickets sold
in the physical world, they sell only 50 percent of all tickets
sold online, said a Forrester analyst, Seema Williams. And even
that share is falling fast. Forrester predicts that online agents'
portion of the Web market will plummet to 25 percent by 2003 as the
airlines step up efforts to sell directly through their own Web
sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most major airlines offer easy-to-use booking procedures on
their sites and entice travelers with Internet-only fare discounts.
For example, US Airways in February offered a Philadelphia-Seattle
round trip for $249. Its 21-day advanced notice rate is $398, and
its full fare is $1,816.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines threw down a gauntlet earlier this year when it
implemented a $2 surcharge on all flights booked through any means
other than its own Web site. A consumer uproar prompted Delta later
to rescind the fee.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have been cutting commissions since 1995, forcing many
agents to start charging customers for their services and to
increase their mix of vacation and cruise packages, which earn
higher commission rates. The knife has been particularly sharp for
online agents. Many airlines limit online commissions to $10 for
domestic flights, well below the $50 cap on bookings by agents in
the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   This has added to online travel agencies' red ink. Preview
Travel, the largest publicly held online agency, reported a 1998
loss of $27 million, including a $4.2 million write-down of a
travel-video business, on revenue of $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Ms. LeVine would not reveal Expedia's operating
losses, but she described commissions as ``the carrot that gets
pushed further and further away.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Jones, president of the Web's most popular travel
agency, Travelocity, called the online commission rates
``penurious,'' claiming that an agency's cost of issuing a ticket
is more than the maximum $10 it earns in commissions. Even so,
Travelocity, a sister company of AMR's American Airlines, is not
joining the complaint. It is owned by Sabre Group, which sells
technology services to other airlines and operates a reservation
systems for travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Detchon of the Interactive Travel Services Association said
online agents were also concerned about airlines demanding valuable
customer profile information and imposing more stringent conditions
on online agency bookings than they impose on traditional bookings.
For instance, he said, online agents typically can book only four
passengers at a time, whereas traditional agents can book up to
nine at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for American Airlines, UAL's United Airlines and US
Airways declined to comment because they had not yet seen the
proposed complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint will cite an airlines-owned entity called the
Airline Reporting Corp., or ARC, a clearinghouse that helps process
ticket sales. While Kathy Argiropoulos, ARC's vice president and
general counsel, declined to comment on the pending complaint, she
noted that the American Society of Travel Agents lost a complaint
in the early 1990s over ARC rules requiring agents to share sales
data. She also noted that Omega World Travel lost a suit against
ARC and Trans World Airlines over data-sharing policies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the society won an $86 million out-of-court
settlement in 1996 after it alleged collusion among airlines in
imposing commission caps.

SOFTWARE PRIVACY CONCERNS BRINGS CALL FOR LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nervous Americans are beginning to worry that their personal
computers can't keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of new technologies that create digital ``fingerprints''
of computer users that could violate their privacy have led to
embarrassment for two of the nation's leading high-tech companies.
As a result, privacy advocates have stepped up demands for federal
legislation to limit the way firms collect and use personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law that protects our privacy has not kept pace with rapid
changes in technology,'' says Barry Steinhardt, associate director
of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``We need to have some
safety net of national legislation that protects us from this kind
of information grab.''
</P>
<P>
   The privacy issue heated up following reports that Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows 98 software automatically creates a unique
identification number on every computer that uses it. This number
is then sent to Microsoft over the Internet when the software is
registered, without the user's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been apparently collecting these hardware IDs for the
last eight months or so, ever since Windows 98 came out,'' said
Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass., who discovered the ID numbers and contacted Microsoft to
object. The ability of Windows 98 to create such digital
fingerprints was first reported over the weekend in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 98 ID number might not be much of a privacy threat
by itself. But a similar ID number is embedded in documents created
with Microsoft products like its word processing program, Microsoft
Word. Someone with access to Microsoft's database of Windows 98
users could identify the author of a particular e-mail message. For
instance, a court could subpoena Microsoft's records to identify an
anonymous message written using Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   Smith stresses that most home computer users have nothing to
worry about. Both ID systems rely on a unique number contained on a
piece of computer hardware called an Ethernet card, which is used
to link computers in corporate networks. Very few home users have
Ethernet cards, and on these systems the ID numbers couldn't be
used to track documents.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethernet cards are used on tens of millions of corporate PCs
and a handful of home machines as well, and these users could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft says it never intended to collect the ID
numbers without users' permission. Microsoft originally developed
the ID system to help its customer support staff identify technical
problems reported by its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Product manager Rob Bennett said a bug in Windows 98 causes it
to transmit the number without the user's consent. This bug will be
replaced in future editions of the product. Microsoft also vowed to
delete the ID numbers from any of its corporate databases, and will
provide a free program that will let computer users remove the ID
numbers from their own machines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chipmaker Intel Corp. may have settled its federal
antitrust case, but the company is still taking heat over a
controversial feature in its new Pentium III microprocessor. The
new chip can automatically identify itself to other computers on
the Internet. Furious privacy advocates are urging consumers to
boycott computers with the Pentium III chip. They say the chip's
identification system could be used to track a person's movements
on the Internet without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, many Internet sites persuade consumers to provide
their name and address. Now such a site can also obtain the chip ID
of the visitor's computer. And the site can sell this information
to other Internet-based companies. If enough companies buy the
data, it becomes very difficult for a user to visit a Web site
without identifying himself. Hundreds of Web sites could use the
chip ID system to call up a complete dossier on the visitor, even
if that person has never been to the site before, and never agreed
to provide it with the information.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has sought to mollify critics by including software that
allows consumers to switch off the chip ID feature. But last month,
a German computer hacker demonstrated a program that could bypass
this safety feature and turn the chip ID on without the user's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU, which once seemed willing to accept the Intel chip,
with proper safeguards, is now taking a harder line because of the
hacking incident. Over the weekend the organization joined other
privacy-rights groups to urge the Federal Trade Commission to halt
the sale of the Pentium III until the chip ID is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith, editor of Privacy Journal, says technology firms
seem not to think about the privacy implications of their latest
gadgets. ``It's a really serious problem,'' said Smith. ``It's just
amazing to me that companies don't address it before they implement
new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Ed Markey (D-Mass.) takes a jaundiced view of
the computer industry's position. ``Trust us, believe us, we'll
never compromise anyone's privacy,'' said Markey. ``But whatever
you do, don't pass any legislation that'll hold us to what we
declare is our corporate policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey wants more than pledges of good behavior. He says he'll
introduce legislation to create a privacy bill of rights for
consumers. The law would give people the right to know what
information is being collected on them, and how it will be used, as
well as a right to refuse to provide this information.
</P>
<P>
   According to Markey, the recent Intel and Microsoft
controversies only strengthen his bill's chances of passage.

PHARMACISTS URGED TO BONE UP ON HERBAL PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ With demand for herbal and natural health products
exploding, health officials say pharmacists must help bridge the
gap between conventional and alternative medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Once found mainly in specialty health food stores, alternative
products such as ginseng, kava kava, melatonin and shark cartilage
now line the shelves of mainstream drug stores and groceries.
</P>
<P>
   But the proliferation of the thousands of alternative treatments
has come with a price: consumer confusion over what works and what
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   That is where pharmacists come in, said Dr. Mary Hardy of Los
Angeles who is a specialist in integrative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists have the opportunity to help consumers through the
maze of alternative therapies on the market, Hardy said Monday
before a panel of the American Pharmaceutical Association, which
held its annual meeting in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we don't yet have the confidence of the public
so that patients identify their pharmacists or physicians as a
major source of herbal information,'' Hardy said. ``And I think it
behooves us to get our knowledge base up, get our education up and
get the word out so that our patients feel comfortable approaching
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that 30 percent of Americans are using herbal
products on a regular basis, Hardy said. About half of them are
also using prescription or over-the-counter drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The herbs are drugs. They have drug-like effects,'' Hardy
said. ``We can expect that our patients are going to be
experiencing potential drug-herb interactions or maybe making
substitutions where it's not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a need for pharmacists who can help consumers make
educated choices regarding which alternative medicines to take and
whether such therapies might conflict with other medicines, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombarded by false claims and misleading advertising about
natural therapies, many consumers are left scratching their heads,
said Amanda McQuade-Crawford, a California herbalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the public is baffled,'' she said. ``There is so much
misinformation out there about herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative products _ including vitamins and nutrients, amino
acids and botanical supplements _ are considered dietary
supplements. That means they aren't being regulated as drugs by the
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that many alternative therapies act as drugs,
yet are allowed to skirt critical quality controls. They also
aren't subjected to the rigorous clinical tests pharmaceuticals
must go through before hitting the market.
</P>
<P>
   A sharply worded editorial last year in the New England Journal
of Medicine detailed the many pitfalls of alternative medicine. The
journal warned of ``irrational approaches to medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the medical establishment isn't shunning natural products
completely.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association has published
several articles on herbs, finding in some cases that herbs could
provide better treatments than conventional care.

TECHNOLOGY PLAYS A BIGGER ROLE IN THE SURGICAL WARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Before Dr. Morris Franklin could stride into the
dimly-lighted operating room, his nurse shouted out a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget your microphone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin grabbed for a black microphone headset. Once in the
operating room, he plugged it into a nearby machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microphone connected,'' a computerized woman's voice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hermes, VCR record,'' the doctor commanded, glancing up at two
large video monitors displaying the patient's inner abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recording,'' the voice confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hermes, pressure: Down, down, down,'' Franklin said, watching
as the patient's bloated belly automatically flattened from the
decreasing gas pressure being pumped into his system.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem straight out of a ``Star Trek'' episode,
this scene is becoming a familiar one in operating rooms. Where it
was once common for a patient to spend hours under the knife, the
doctor of today may use voice-activated commands to shorten
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies such as the Hermes control system Franklin uses
at the Southeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio are a driving part
of the operating room revolution. State-of-the-art medical machines
and tiny, more precise tools can enhance a surgeon's skills, as
well as cut down on the pain and recovery time a patient often
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another step toward having the operating room
fully automated _ or as fully automated as we can get,'' Franklin
said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Although some doctors are reluctant to embrace the idea of a
high-tech operating room where machines and robots follow a
surgeon's commands, Franklin welcomes it. He foresees a day when
robotic technology will be widely used in operating rooms to enable
a doctor to perform surgery using virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sit here at my desk and put my hands into a pair of
gloves that send signals to the robot in the operating room. Every
time I moved, the robot would move,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider this: when you get down to the fine stuff, every
doctor has a hand tremor. We've all just learned to control it,''
he said. ``Robots don't have tremors. That means you can do finer
and more delicate surgery that is more accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such technology is available, but not widely used, today. The
surgeon can sit at a console and use instruments similar to
conventional surgical tools to control robotic arms in the
operating room.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular afternoon, Franklin performed a minimally
invasive, laparoscopic surgery on a 46-year-old man. The patient's
abdomen was inflated with carbon dioxide gas to allow a team of
doctors to insert microscopic tools _ including a small video
camera and light source _ through five small incisions.
</P>
<P>
   The patient was undergoing surgery to correct a condition called
Barrett's esophagus, marked by reflux of acid matter into the
throat. The condition can lead to esophageal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the condition, Franklin had to tack the patient's
stomach to his esophagus and then suture both to the diaphragm to
create a valve.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the procedure, Franklin kept his eyes on two large
television monitors stationed above the patient's head. A pioneer
in laparoscopic surgery, Franklin has had lots of practice
manipulating the long, thin instruments inserted through tiny
valves.
</P>
<P>
   But he was getting used to the newest member of his staff _ the
Hermes system, manufactured by Computer Motion Inc. of Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital bought Hermes two weeks ago for about $40,000.
Franklin and another doctor have programmed their voices into the
system so that it will recognize their commands.
</P>
<P>
   Hermes actually takes over other equipment during surgery. It
can control the gas pressure, light source, digital printer and
video-cassette recorder, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Before, nurses often had to constantly monitor each individual
piece of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would literally have to be there to do all these things _
we were the doctor's hands,'' said Toni Halcomb, a nurse
administrator at the San Antonio hospital. ``With this, the nurse
doesn't have to be available for the surgeon the entire time and we
can be doing other things.''
</P>
<P>
   But some nurses say they are nervous that more technology means
less need for their skills in the operating room. Halcomb downplays
such concerns, saying nurses will continue playing a vital role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you have all this equipment, you have to have someone
to talk to the patient, to soothe them,'' she said. ``I sure
wouldn't want a robot to do that.''
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the end of the surgery, a mischievous grin spread across
Franklin's face. He called upon Hermes again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hermes, controls,'' he said, bringing up a control panel on
the television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compliment,'' he ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're such a great surgeon,'' the computerized voice said,
eliciting giggles from the operating room staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what a great system this is?'' Franklin said.

THE PERFECT CHARACTER WITNESS: A POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A lawyer I once knew displayed a sign on his desk
that got right to the point: ``Reasonable doubt for a reasonable
fee.''
</P>
<P>
   But reasonable people can, and often do, disagree about what
constitutes reasonableness. Just ask anybody involved in the case
of Donald J. Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   He's 57 and one of roughly 2,200 registered lobbyists in New
York's capital city. He's a respected member of a
$50-million-a-year Albany industry.
</P>
<P>
   The police pulled Boyle over last April in suburban Colonie. It
was a bit after 8 p.m. He'd just spoken to a group at the Colonie
Elks Club. The cops said he was going too slow and that his BWM was
weaving. They took Boyle back to headquarters and administered a
breath test. Boyle's breath registered a .25 blood alcohol content.
The legal limit for driving while intoxicated is .10. Deeply
disapproving, the cops charged him.
</P>
<P>
   There's a little irony worth mentioning here. Boyle lobbies for
driving schools. One of them is called the New York Safety Program.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Boyle wasn't permitted to drive home. Instead, he
called a friend to pick him up. Boyle then hired a lawyer. Plea
bargaining began. Since Boyle had copped a plea three years earlier
to another drunken driving beef, the district attorney's office
would accept a plea only to what he was charged with and not to
lesser offense.
</P>
<P>
   This set the stage for a three-day jury trial last month in
Colonie Town Court.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses testified on Boyle's behalf. One was an official
of the group that Boyle had addressed. He said that Boyle had
downed only one drink and seemed fine. The friend who'd picked up
Boyle and driven him home that night also testified that Boyle had
appeared perfectly sober. That friend, one juror told me, was an
impressive witness. He was Mike Hoblock, the former Colonie town
councilman, former Albany County executive, former assemblyman and
state senator. He's currently chairman of the New York State Racing
and Wagering Board and one of the most popular and highly respected
local politicians in the Albany metro area.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle and Hoblock have known each other for decades. Boyle
kicked in $250 to Hoblock's last campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The jury retired and acquitted Boyle in just a half hour. The
prosecutor is still slapping his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's lawyer had argued that the single drink Boyle had
consumed at the Elks Club had produced a false blood alcohol
reading _ that residual alcohol in his client's mouth and throat
had thrown off the measuring device. A juror I spoke to said that
the defense also had raised the possibility that the device that
had measured Boyle's blood alcohol content had been thrown off by
radio waves. The jury had been impressed by that _ and by those
witnesses, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all the jurors. One had served as an alternate,
standing by in case another juror died or became unable for
whatever reason to participate in deliberations. At the end of
testimony, but before deliberations, she went home. When I told her
that Boyle had been acquitted, she was aghast. She wouldn't have
voted that way.
</P>
<P>
   Neither she nor the other jurors knew of Boyle's previous
conviction. He didn't testify, so the defense had no clean way to
bring it up. Hoblock, by the way, told me that he hadn't known
either.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? None of the jurors had heard any personal history
of drinking and driving. They simply ended up with reasonable
doubts about the accuracy of that breath test _ especially after
hearing from those convincing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's some advice: Don't drive drunk. It really annoys the
cops. But if they ever stop you and charge you with it, you know
whom to call for a ride home. Somebody credible enough to attract
57,421 votes the last time he ran for office.
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO PONDERS MEMORIAL FOR `YANKEE CLIPPER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city's Board of Supervisors is pitching
ideas for what to name in honor of hometown hero Joe DiMaggio, the
``Yankee Clipper'' who died Monday at 84.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gavin Newsom, a onetime neighbor of DiMaggio's, has
taken the lead in finding a suitable memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have about 150 requests or ideas and recommendations
for name changes on DiMaggio,'' Newsom said. ``It's quite amazing
the response in terms of ideas, (and it's) good fun. When it comes
to recognizing a hero, there are no bad ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Board President Tom Ammiano said the supervisors probably would
name a committee to consider a memorial for DiMaggio, but would
limit what would be renamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to rename a school or a street, it brings out a
divisive element. (A) playground is safe, and brings it some
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown also supports naming something after
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio is ``a San Francisco icon, and the mayor is supportive
just as he was for naming something for (former Mayor) Joe
Alioto,'' his spokeswoman, Kandace Bender, said. ``DiMaggio is as
much an icon as anybody in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas circulating for a memorial to DiMaggio are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Renaming Fifth Street. DiMaggio wore No. 5 on the back of his
Yankee uniform.
</P>
<P>
   _ Changing the name of Marina Middle School, near the recreation
center where DiMaggio honed his ball-playing skills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renaming the Golden Gate Bridge or the new eastern span of the
Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renaming City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would happen without the consent of the family, Newsom
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is always spicy,'' Ammiano said. ``Whether it's
King, Kennedy or Alioto.''
</P>
<P>
   A private funeral service for DiMaggio will be held Thursday at
10 a.m. in SS Peter and Paul Church in North Beach, attended by
about 30 family members and close friends.
</P>
<P>

Francisco to dimaggio(at)examiner.com. Faxes may be sent to

<P>
   DULLES, Va. America Online President Stephen M. Case was piecing
together a struggling online company in 1994 when he heard of a hot
new Internet startup, Netscape Communications. He desperately
wanted to buy that company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he's had to wait five years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, (March 17) Netscape shareholders are expected to
approve the sale of their company to AOL in a stock deal worth more
than $8 billion. If the deal is also cleared by the Justice
Department, it would catapult AOL into new business markets and
solidify its position as a major player in online advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is like looking at a 17th century geopolitical
map of Europe,'' says James Kimsey, AOL's founder and former
chairman, and now head of its non-profit foundation. ``Everyone is
trying to marry off his daughter to strengthen alliances. There's
no doubt Netscape is a key strategic play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the nation's largest online service, with 16 million
members. Netscape's Netcenter is one of the most frequently visited
Internet sites. Once the companies are combined, AOL can use
Netscape's Internet browser to lessen its reliance on Microsoft,
whose Windows operating system is one route to AOL. The deal also
should help the consumer-focused AOL attract business customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal certainly makes them the big kahuna of Internet
portals,'' says Andrew Bartells, senior research analyst with Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   For AOL users, the merger isn't expected to change the chatty
online service.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the deal is expected to improve earnings growth
because it gives AOL access to lucrative business customers, who
prefer Netscape. AOL is solidly established in the consumer market,
with 60 percent of U.S. online users as members. But while today's
consumer e-commerce market is valued at $6 billion to $8 billion a
year, the business-to-business market is worth a much larger $25
billion to $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal, however, does not shield AOL from increasing
competition in the rapidly changing business-to business market.
AT&AMP;T completed its acquisition of cable operator
Tele-Communications Inc. on Tuesday. There's also a challenge from
Microsoft Network, as well as from entertainment giant Time Warner,
which is rolling out its Road Runner service.
</P>
<P>
   Today, AOL provides service mostly over phone lines. It is not
well-positioned to deliver its services over cables lines, although
there is speculation of possible deals to gain access to these
high-speed pipelines. And the company has turned to the government
for help, asking for regulatory intervention to provide access to
cable,
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care what pipe we use,'' says Kimsey.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's anywhere, any way strategy is aimed at developing an
online media company whose services that can be accessed from
devices ranging from computers to cell phones to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL could even be on your electric toothbrush one day,'' jokes
Matt Korn, the company's senior vice president of network
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy could be key to holding onto AOL's dominant online
position, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are any number of ways to access the Internet --
phone lines, cable lines, ADSL lines and wireless,'' says Bill
Whyman, an Internet analyst with Legg Mason Research Technology
Team in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is who controls the customer relationship,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind AOL's drive to build that needed loyalty is Case.
When Case joined AOL's predecessor, Quantum Computer Service, in
1983, he was 24 and the company was nothing more than a
cyber-experiment. Since then, he has guided the company through a
handful of near-death experiences _ including an uproar created by
subscribers frustrated over troubles connecting to AOL _ and more
recently to better-than-expected financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, fiscal-year revenue has climbed to $2.16 billion
from $98 million, and earnings per share to a split-adjusted 14
cents a share from less than 1 cent per share. Wall Street expects
revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June to hit $3.9-$4
billion, and earnings of about 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is growing overseas. AOL International now
operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Japan
and Australia. It will launch AOL Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international markets are like watching the U.S. market on
fast-forward,'' says Jack Davies, president of AOL International.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute AOL's success to a handful of key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Case started mass-mailing 250 million free AOL disks to
the public. A risky move, it has been credited as helping make AOL
one of the best known consumer brands in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he changed the pricing structure from a per-minute
charge to a flat fee. Today the service costs $21.95 monthly. As a
result, members are staying online longer-- up from an average of
14 minutes online per day then to an average of 55 minutes daily
now.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, there was another shift. Since the company's
inception, the lion's share of revenue had come from online
subscriptions. But with a growing membership staying online longer,
AOL set out to market the captive audience to online advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, advertising and e-commerce fees jumped to $98 million,
a 717 percent increase from $12 million in 1996. The first big deal
was a $100 million, three-year agreement with long-distance company
Tel-Save Holding, which wanted to market phone service on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company is shifting focus again -- to Washington. Case
has said that U.S. policy decisions will set the course for the
industry's future and greatly affect AOL's business decisions. The
company has responded by has increasing its lobbying force from two
to five people. And it is in the process of setting up its first
political action committee to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been instrumental in setting up the Open
Net Coalition, staffed by Vice President Al Gore's former
technology staffer, Greg Simon, and former National Republican
Committee chairman Rich Bond, to lobby for government intervention
in the cable wars. AOL and others, including MindSpring
Enterprises, want regulators to force cable companies to make their
lines available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's really going on here is that they are trying to
slow down the deployment of broadband technology because they are
not in a position to dominate that market,'' says James Cicconi,
AT&AMP;T's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ulric Weil, managing partner of the Arlington-based Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey brokerage firm isn't concerned AOL will be left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will do a deal when they have to,'' he says. ``AOL
wouldn't even get out of bed for the numbers these cable companies
have.''

   DULLES, Va. America Online President Stephen M. Case was piecing
together a struggling online company in 1994 when he heard of a hot
new Internet startup, Netscape Communications. He desperately
wanted to buy that company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he's had to wait five years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, (March 17) Netscape shareholders are expected to
approve the sale of their company to AOL in a stock deal worth more
than $8 billion. If the deal is also cleared by the Justice
Department, it would catapult AOL into new business markets and
solidify its position as a major player in online advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is like looking at a 17th century geopolitical
map of Europe,'' says James Kimsey, AOL's founder and former
chairman, and now head of its non-profit foundation. ``Everyone is
trying to marry off his daughter to strengthen alliances. There's
no doubt Netscape is a key strategic play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the nation's largest online service, with 16 million
members. Netscape's Netcenter is one of the most frequently visited
Internet sites. Once the companies are combined, AOL can use
Netscape's Internet browser to lessen its reliance on Microsoft,
whose Windows operating system is one route to AOL. The deal also
should help the consumer-focused AOL atpipe we use,'' says Kimsey.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's anywhere, any way strategy is aimed at developing an
online media company whose services that can be accessed from
devices ranging from computers to cell phones to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL could even be on your electric toothbrush one day,'' jokes
Matt Korn, the company's senior vice president of network
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy could be key to holding onto AOL's dominant online
position, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are any number of ways to access the Internet --
phone lines, cable lines, ADSL lines and wireless,'' says Bill
Whyman, an Internet analyst with Legg Mason Research Technology
Team in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is who controls the customer relationship,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind AOL's drive to build that needed loyalty is Case.
When Case joined AOL's predecessor, Quantum Computer Service, in
1983, he was 24 and the company was nothing more than a
cyber-experiment. Since then, he has guided the company through a
handful of near-death experiences _ including an uproar created by
subscribers frustrated over troubles connecting to AOL _ and more
recently to better-than-expected financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, fiscal-year revenue has climbed to $2.16 billion
from $98 million, and earnings per share to a split-adjusted 14
cents a share from less than 1 cent per share. Wall Street expects
revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June to hit $3.9-$4
billion, and earnings of about 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is growing overseas. AOL International now
operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Japan
and Australia. It will launch AOL Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international markets are like watching the U.S. market on
fast-forward,'' says Jack Davies, president of AOL International.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute AOL's success to a handful of key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Case started mass-mailing 250 million free AOL disks to
the public. A risky move, it has been credited as helping make AOL
one of the best known consumer brands in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he changed the pricing structure from a per-minute
charge to a flat fee. Today the service costs $21.95 monthly. As a
result, members are staying online longer-- up from an average of
14 minutes online per day then to an average of 55 minutes daily
now.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, there iness decisions. The company has responded
by has increasing its lobbying force from two to five people. And
it is in the process of setting up its first political action
committee to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been instrumental in setting up the Open
Net Coalition, staffed by Vice President Al Gore's former
technology staffer, Greg Simon, and former National Republican
Committee chairman Rich Bond, to lobby for government intervention
in the cable wars. AOL and others, including MindSpring
Enterprises, want regulators to force cable companies to make their
lines available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's really going on here is that they are trying to
slow down the deployment of broadband technology because they are
not in a position to dominate that market,'' says James Cicconi,
AT&AMP;T's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ulric Weil, managing partner of the Arlington-based Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey brokerage firm isn't concerned AOL will be left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will do a deal when they have to,'' he says. ``AOL
wouldn't even get out of bed for the numbers these cable companies
have.''

RARE FIGHTING WORDS FROM HOLYFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield is supremely confident of three
things this morning as he's riding down Central Park West heading
toward the Church Street Gym near Wall Street, where a crowd of
several hundred photographers and expectant journalists from around
the world are impatiently waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, he will walk into Madison Square Garden, with
more than 20,000 people screaming for blood and a 6-foot-5-inch,
245-pound man waiting to make it flow. Many, including that massive
opponent 20 feet away, will be there in the strong belief that this
is the end for the Humble Warrior, the last big fight for the best
heavyweight of his time.
</P>
<P>
   As the street scenes of midtown Manhattan pass by, Holyfield
looks out the window of his limousine and considers what he is
about to face before he speaks of it. At 36, an age at which most
prizefighters have reached the status of pensioner or punching bag,
the heavyweight champion of much of the world is about to embark on
the biggest challenge of his career still certain of three things:
his God, himself, and the fact that a man named Lennox Lewis is
coming to Madison Square Garden Saturday to do him harm.
</P>
<P>
   God will be there to protect Holyfield, Holyfield will be there
to protect himself, and Lewis will be there to defend his third of
the heavyweight title while hoping to snatch away the 66.7 percent
Holyfield controls. In the opinion of the World Boxing
Association-International Boxing Federation titleholder, the latter
fact is as welcome as the other two because he sees them as a
winning equation for possibly the last big fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta understand what makes a fight difficult,'' Holyfield
said. ``Vaughn Bean (whom Holyfield defeated in a desultory
performance in his last outing) came to survive. Lennox is coming
to win. A guy trying to win leaves himself open to be hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Bean was trying to do was prove he belonged in the same
ring with me. I'm a winner. I'll do everything necessary to win,
but if your opponent says, `I don't think I can win so I just want
to survive,' he covers up and the fight goes the distance and
causes you problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis won't do that. He's trying to prove he can win. I
know Lennox is coming to win, so I know it's gonna be a good fight
and a short night.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has been uncharacteristically bold about offering this
opinion, making pronouncements about a third-round knockout that
caught even his trainer, Don Turner, off-guard. When Holyfield
originally said he would dismantle Lewis so quickly, a surprised
journalist asked if he had heard correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not predicting,'' Holyfield said. ``I'm telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   Three is a number he has stuck with, and nothing changed as he
rode through the streets of Manhattan Tuesday because those words
were based not on anything lacking in Lewis but in a supreme belief
in himself and the God he is sure has brought him to this moment
only for victory, just as He twice did when Holyfield fought the
seemingly unbeatable Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he's less than what he is,'' Holyfield said of
Lewis, an Olympic and two-time world champion. ``I'm not saying
he's a bum. I'm not saying he's not a hard puncher. But even if
he's as good as he says he is, what does it mean? I'm still going
to knock him out in three rounds because this is not about Lennox
Lewis. That's how confident I am in my ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes me able to say and do these things is my
relationship with God. It's at its best right now and so I'll be at
my best. I want to be the very best I can be. If I am, I don't have
anything to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying these things and then going to sleep. I'm
working hard. I'm preparing to be the very best I can be. If I'm at
my best, I know what the outcome will be, so I'm holding to the
truth. The truth is the fact, and the fact is I'm going to knock
him out in three rounds. My confidence is great. It don't have
nothing to do with Lennox Lewis in no form or fashion. Lennox just
happens to be the opponent I'm going to knock out in the third
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking anybody to believe that or write that. I'm just
telling you. You can write it now or write it later.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most shocking is that Holyfield never before has
belittled an opponent or made any predictions except to say that he
would win.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the opponent was Dwight Muhammad Qawi or Buster Douglas
or Riddick Bowe or George Foreman or Michael Moorer or Mike Tyson,
it was the same. Holyfield was always secure in that knowledge. But
it was not until he found himself facing an opponent who has
accused him of being a hypocrite for professing his faith so loudly
while at the same time fathering three children out of wedlock that
has he chosen to be specific about his dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has not passed up any opportunity to speak out on the
apparent contradictions between what Holyfield has said about God
and how he has treated one of the Ten Commandments, pointing out
that anyone can make a mistake but when you repeat it twice in one
year, as Holyfield did in 1998, it isn't a mistake. It's a habit.
</P>
<P>
   Those words surely stung, but Holyfield has insisted they are
not what has inspired him. Rather, he said, ``I was worse than what
he's saying about me. But my past is my past. It gives me
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it is strength enough to knock Lewis unconscious in
nine minutes because ``Lennox poses a threat to a lot of people but
not to me,'' said Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   To Holyfield, he is something less than a threat but also
something more. He is an opportunity to cement Holyfield's standing
in boxing and to shore up his standing with God on the same night.
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd way of looking at an opponent capable of knocking
you out with one right hand while trying to do it with the movement
of his lips as well, but that is how Holyfield sees the world _
through a looking glass all his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said about me gave me an opportunity to explain to the
world what a hypocrite really is,'' Holyfield said. ``A hypocrite
quits when he falls. Everybody always knew my relationship with
God. My strength comes from the Lord regardless of my mistakes.
I've made a lot of them but He's always got me through. He's always
given me another opportunity to redeem myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you fall short doesn't mean you don't get up and
continue on. That's why I'm a three-time heavyweight champion. I
fell short. I came back. I didn't make excuses. I don't make
excuses for other things that happened in my life, either. I was
born out of wedlock and I had kids out of wedlock. I made mistakes,
but they are still my kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox saying what he did about me gave me the opportunity to
look at myself and to inspire people not to give up just because
they made a mistake. God forgives your mistakes. He tells you it's
not how you start but how you finish. So a hypocrite isn't somebody
who makes mistakes. A hypocrite is somebody who pretends to be
something he's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox has proclaimed he wants to be the undisputed
heavyweight champion. After this fight Saturday he'll have the
opportunity to see if he's a hypocrite. Does he want to be champion
bad enough to come back after he gets hisself knocked out?''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield stretched after he said that, his tightly muscled body
relaxing as the car approached the gym and a sea of cameras
encircled it. Instructions were given that it go around the block
to let the champion slip in through a side door, but Holyfield
rejected the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go right in the front,'' he said. ``Let them all see
we're coming.''
</P>
<P>
   A smile crossed his face as he slipped into the crowd with one
last thought for Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to hurt him,'' Holyfield said. ``Then we'll
see who's a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   And who isn't.

FOR KENT, REAL MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTY PANTAGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   March Madness?
</P>
<P>
   How about driving home through fog so thick that a relatively
simple 4-hour trip to Miami of Ohio turned into an overnight crawl
along a deserted highway outside of Oxford, Ohio, with a friend
hanging out the car window shining a flashlight to find the white
line on the side of the road?
</P>
<P>
   March Madness?
</P>
<P>
   How about traveling to Ypsilanti, Mich., on a last-minute whim,
only to take a wrong turn somewhere near Toledo and arrive at
Eastern Michigan's Bowen Field House to watch the last 30 seconds
of a 1-point loss?
</P>
<P>
   March Madness?
</P>
<P>
   How about cutting down the nets at Ohio State's old St. John's
Arena _ off rims tucked away in a storage area long after a
20-point defeat to a perennial Big Ten power?
</P>
<P>
   No, we didn't lack March Madness at Kent State in the early
1980s; the problem always seemed to be that these acts of temporary
insanity during college basketball season took place in December,
January, and February.
</P>
<P>
   Come March, the Golden Flashes quickly were eliminated from the
fledgling Mid-American Conference tournament, and we had turned our
attention to ridiculing the antics of a Ted Stepien-owned Cavaliers
team and anticipating another hopeless summer of Indians baseball.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers teeter on competitiveness, the Indians have been
in two of the past four World Series, and Kent _ minus the State _
is playing in its first NCAA basketball tournament, facing Temple
at the Fleet Center on Friday afternoon in a first-round East
Regional game.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost 30 years, but mention that you attended the
21,000-student university in northeastern Ohio and undoubtedly the
response is tied to May 4, 1970, when four students were killed and
nine others wounded by National Guard gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young wrote a song about Kent State
that became an anthem for the '60s protest movement. But the
university could just as easily be remembered for producing Gene
Michael, Thurman Munson, Jack Lambert, Michael Keaton, and Arsenio
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   As for basketball history? Well, that's another story _ unless
you consider 1951 graduate and longtime Lakers assistant coach Bill
Bertka an NBA legend. The MAC has a tradition of producing
NBA-caliber players _ Nate Thurmond, George Gervin, Ron Harper, and
Dan Majerle, among others. But Kent State's fortunes usually
revolved around 5-foot-10-inch point guards and 6-7 centers who
were passed over by the Michigans and Ohio States. But that didn't
stop us. I was a freshman at Kent State in 1979, more interested in
Trent Grooms's chase to become the MAC's all-time leading rebounder
than ongoing protests on campus over the site of a gym annex.
</P>
<P>
   In our minds, Duke's Cameron Crazies had nothing on us. Heck,
their teams played for national championships. Off we'd go, cutting
Wednesday classes to follow around a sub-.500 team, either on
assignment for the Daily Kent Stater or for the sheer joy of the
game (and who could pass up a trip to Corapolis, Pa., for a
nonconference game against Robert Morris?).
</P>
<P>
   After I departed Kent, the Flashes did enjoy a modicum of
success under coach Jim McDonald, posting a couple of 20-victory
seasons that gained NIT berths. But the NCAA is virgin territory.
</P>
<P>
   Third-year coach Gary Waters's team has won a school-record 23
games this season _ matching the total number of victories my
freshman and sophomore years. The Flashes still rely on undersized
players, but they play that patient style that causes upsets this
time of the year. (Just ask Miami of Ohio All-America forward Wally
Szczerbiak, who was shut down by Kent in the MAC tournament title
game.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to think we were ahead of our time in Kent, preparing
some 20 years for this day that all college teams strive to reach.
After all, I never thought I'd see the Indians in the World Series.
So Kent in the Big Dance? Stranger things have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Madness begin.

 &HT;    Collectors: Payne price was `inflated'
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Olympic memorabilia collectors and dealers worldwide
marvel at the price Billy Payne fetched for his Atlanta mementos,
which have been valued at $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot imagine what's in the collection of Mr. Payne that
can be so expensive,'' said Bernhard Winter, an auctioneer from
Dusseldorf, Germany, who specializes in Olympic items.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who was president and chief executive officer of the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, received $975,000 for his
memorabilia from the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation and
credit for a noncash contribution of $528,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Olympics chief said he could not remember all the
items in his collection but did cite the commemorative torch he
carried in Greece, an engraved brick from Centennial Olympic Park,
signed posters, ``tons of photographs'' and gifts he received for
making speeches.
</P>
<P>
   GAAF President Ralph Jernigan Jr. said he could not identify the
items and that he had never seen an itemized appraisal. He said he
thinks one exists but would not make it public. Jernigan earlier
said the collection is contained in about a dozen boxes. The
material is destined for an Olympics museum proposed for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid O'Neil, a Colorado Springs, Colo., auctioneer and
authority on Olympic material, acknowledged that she appraised
Payne's collection but declined to say what it contained or how
much it appraised for.
</P>
<P>
   So what could add up to $1.5 million in those boxes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this a long time, and I haven't got that kind of
money (invested in a collection),'' said Don Bigsby, president of
the Olympic Collectors Club, based in Schenectady, N.Y. He has
hundreds of valuable items, including a winner's medal from almost
every Games.
</P>
<P>
   Collector Alan Polsky of Los Angeles said, ``This stuff must be
rare and one-of-a-kind.'' And fellow collector Jon Becker said the
amount paid by the GAAF ``seems to be an inflated price.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter, the German auctioneer, said that if Payne's torch is no
different in design from the 13,000 others produced, then it is not
worth more than the typical price of $1,500 paid by collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a special thing if it's the only one,'' Winter said.
Polsky said some collectors would pay a premium of perhaps $500 for
an item because Payne received it personally. But ``I don't think
it would make it priceless because it came from the local former
head of the Olympic committee,'' Polsky said. ``It's not (Olympic
founder Baron Pierre) de Coubertin's torch.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a personal award given by a foreign country to Los
Angeles Olympics chief Peter Ueberroth was purchased recently for
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Payne says he is offended that anyone would question the
appraised value of his collection or the transaction with the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a private and confidential transaction,'' he said.
``There was no attempt to hide anything on this issue. The people
who brought the Games to Atlanta are not dishonorable
people.''Karen Rosen writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,

US HOPING TO REGAIN ITS GOLDEN FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPOO, Finland _ If this hockey team were a movie, it would be
``Starting Over.'' If it were a song, it would be ``Yesterday's
Gone.'' If it were a carbon copy of the 1998 Olympic squad, it . .
. well, it isn't _ and that's exactly the point the coach is trying
to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of something old, something new, something
borrowed and something blue,'' said Ben Smith with a chuckle.
``This is really the first time we've actually played together.''
</P>
<P>
   And Smith said that after the first game of the Women's World
Championship of ice hockey, which got under way here Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 women on the US roster for these world championships are
a mix of 11 Olympic veterans (captain Cammi Granato and assistant
captain Karyn Bye among them), experienced former national team
members (including Erin Whitten and Stephanie O'Sullivan, two of
the last pre-Olympic roster cuts) and rookies still in high school
(including Minnesotans Krissy Wendell, 17, and Natalie Darwitz, at
15 the youngest player ever named to the national team.) For a
number of reasons _ perhaps all of them inevitable _ blending them
into a well-oiled unit in only two weeks has been more difficult
than Smith had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to get 20 people on the same page even though some
people are coming from different books is taxing for the student
and the teacher,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute arrival here Monday of key defensemen Angela
Ruggiero and Tara Mounsey perhaps best illustrates the difference
between this year and last. Instead of spending five months
training, touring, living, and bonding with their national
teammates, as they did leading up to the 1998 Olympic gold medal,
the Harvard freshman and Brown sophomore played weekend games for
their college teams and then endured an overnight flight from
Boston to join the other 18 members of their new team, racing from
the Helsinki aiport to the Hotel Rivoli with just 30 minutes to
spare before the bus left for the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually without sleep for over 24 hours (``Some guy was
snoring behind us,'' said Ruggiero), the two barely had time to put
on their skates before each got an assist in the 10-2 win against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a haphazard way to assemble a team, it's not
because the US views this tournament as trivial. Far from it:
despite beating perennial foe Canada for the Olympic gold medal 13
months ago, the US has yet to defeat them in four tries at the
world championship and wants nothing more than to knock them off
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada's the reigning world champion,'' said Ruggiero after a
good night's sleep. ``It would be really nice to take that away
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   But after putting their lives on hold to attain their Olympic
dream, many of the 20 American players from Nagano have moved on.
Sandra Whyte, Gretchen Ulion, Colleen Coyne, Vicki Movsessian, and
Lisa Brown-Miller have retired; six players (including both Olympic
goalies, Sarah Tueting and Sara DeCosta) are back in college after
taking as much as two years off to train for the Olympics, with
only defensemen Mounsey and Ruggiero feeling prepared to miss
school and/or the first round of the ECAC women's tournament in
favor of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``With scheduling the tournament at this time of year, we knew
it was going to be a problem,'' said Smith, who had only 14 players
available when camp got under way at Lake Placid two weeks ago.
``We didn't want to haul people out of school to play (exhibitions)
in January because we knew we were going to have to haul people out
for this thing. It can cause quite a bit of consternation and we
don't want to disrupt the collegiate ranks because we're so
indebted to the product they're producing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounsey looks on the bright side, if realistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully you can take 20 good athletes and they'll perform,''
said the Concord, N.H., native who turns 21 on Friday. ``Obviously,
this won't be as good a team as the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the Olympics. Another problem, this one more insidious and
therefore potentially more threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a little trouble getting back into the mode
that previous teams were used to playing in,'' said Smith,
referring to a 6-1 drubbing by the Canadians in an exhibition in
Brampton, Ontario, before the teams left last week for Finland. ``I
think some people thought just getting back and stepping onto the
ice was all it was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   This tournament, all now agree, is the first phase of gently
shutting the door on 1998 while beginning to crack open the door to
2002. ``The Olympics have come and gone, and people have accepted
that,'' said Mounsey. Agreed Katie King, a forward out of Salem,
N.H.: ``It's been kind of fun to get on with things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Canada wants to start over, too, for reasons that are
colored silver. New coach Daniele Sauvageau, an assistant at Nagano
who took over the team when Shannon Miller's contract was not
renewed, has brought a dozen Olympians, including Danielle Goyette
and Hayley Wickenheiser, to Finland on a team that may boast more
speed, more strength and more depth than it did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment,'' said Sauvageau on Monday after her team's
10-0 rout of Switzerland, ``we are not talking anymore about the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not until the hoped-for rematch in Sunday's final.

 &HT;    Reality short of Olympic promise
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little-known public charity founded by Billy Payne
more than a decade ago is shouldering a huge responsibility _
carrying on Atlanta's Olympic legacy. But the Georgia Amateur
Athletics Foundation is a long way from fulfilling its mission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nonprofit foundation's stated tax-exempt purpose is
to support amateur sports, in the 2 1/2 years since the Games
ended, it has given grants of $10,000 each to two youth golf
programs. At the same time, the foundation spent nearly $1 million
to buy the personal memorabilia of its chairman _ Payne _
presumably for an Olympic museum the foundation intends to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic legacy for the Games has basically been nil, and
that has really been unfortunate,'' said Dennis Berkholtz, a former
Olympian and president of the national team handball federation,
which relocated to Atlanta after the Games in hopes of benefitting
from that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation-sponsored community development program that would
pump $1 million provided by the U.S. Olympic Committee into Olympic
sports programs for local youth has not begun.
</P>
<P>
   And the GAAF's vision for an Olympic museum has yet to come into
focus, although it has assembled a vast collection of memorabilia
and archived documents that remain behind closed doors at the
Atlanta History Center. A temporary exhibition was opened to the
public in 1997, but there are no plans for additional showings.
</P>
<P>
   Far from shining light on Atlanta's Olympic experience, the
foundation at present is vigorously trying to shelter itself from
an ongoing Olympic bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has emerged to link Atlanta's bid campaign to
bribery allegations that have debased the Salt Lake City 2002
Olympics bid effort. But the foundation has been in the news for
refusing to open its bid records to the public even as an
International Olympic Committee investigation widened to include
all recent bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Payne contends that GAAF has ``an admirable record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has hosted sporting events and given grants for a multiple
number of years,'' he said. ``The process was interrupted when the
bid was accepted. Now that everybody has got a second wind, we are
going to pick it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Salt Lake scandal erupted last fall, the GAAF
kept a low and private profile.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, created by real estate attorney Payne in 1987,
is the brainchild of the people who brought the Olympics to town.
Its board of directors still includes the Atlanta Nine, private
citizens who circled the globe extending Southern hospitality to
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose was to establish amateur athletic
competitions in Georgia, but the foundation's primary role was as a
vehicle for public contributions to lobby for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation took in about $12 million in cash, value-in-kind
contributions and licensed merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years of the bid campaign, GAAF co-hosted
international swim meets, volleyball tournaments and road races. It
launched the Olympic Day in the Schools program to build awareness
of the Games and to demonstrate to the USOC and the IOC that
Atlanta _ heretofore known for pro sports _ supported amateur
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, everything GAAF did was related to the bid,'' said
foundation president Ralph Jernigan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta won the Games in 1990, Payne formed the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games and appointed his foundation
colleagues as officers and board members of the new organizing
committee. The foundation turned over much of the money it had left
in the bank to ACOG _ in the form of a $1.3 million loan _ to
launch operations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, the foundation's primary beneficiaries
were ACOG and Payne, who remained its chairman while also president
and chief executive of ACOG. The foundation's tax returns indicate
several substantial grants to the organizing committee. Some were
cash advances that came back to GAAF after the Games. Others were
transfers of cash from GAAF's Children's Olympic ticket fund that
provided seats to competitions for kids with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the foundation loaned Payne $500,000 at a 6 percent
annual interest rate. Payne had quit his job when he launched his
bid effort and had secured a personal loan from a private source to
cover his expenses. The foundation's loan allowed Payne to pay off
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation did make grants to a number of organizations,
including the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs, the Atlanta Project, a Techwood
Outreach basketball program and the Martin Luther King Jr. Center.
Jernigan acknowledged: ``We were not out publicizing the fact we
had a foundation trying to help youth sports. We were just
responding if somebody came to us.'' But in the months before the
Games, the foundation's board began to visualize its future,
Jernigan said. ``We began to realize if there was going to be any
ongoing legacy after the Games, GAAF was going to be the
organization to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Years before, Payne pledged to leave an amateur sports legacy
for inner-city youth. Originally, ACOG had projected a substantial
financial surplus, a portion of which would go to build soccer
fields and handball courts. But the budget tightened as the Games
drew near and organizers said after closing the books that the well
was dry. The USOC stepped in by announcing that it would contribute
$1 million to launch an Olympic sports program for local kids. The
GAAF would be its local partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think GAAF is the right partner, especially being the
legacy organization for the Olympic Games,'' said Maureen Stone,
the USOC program manager in Atlanta. ``The commitment is there from
the leadership to make this a successful program and resources are
there in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   While that program will encourage coaches, volunteers and
children to get more involved with Olympic sports such as team
handball, judo, canoeing and kayaking, it has not gotten out of the
starting blocks. Stalled by legal wrangling over liability issues
for two years, the committee is waiting for the foundation to sign
off on the paperwork, a USOC official said. When the Community
Olympic Development Program is launched this year, it will pale in
comparison to the one birthed after the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles, the last previous U.S. city to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Amateur Athletics Foundation, a model for GAAF, was created
in 1985 and funded with $90 million in surplus revenues in Los
Angeles. The foundation has granted more than $57 million to help
build an aquatics center, teach 100,000 children how to swim,
introduce thousands more to sports such as cycling and beach
volleyball and turn out more than 600 certified coaches through its
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   With its relative lack of funds or support from any governmental
entity, the GAAF could never hope to foster a similar sports
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Atlanta resident, I would selfishly have liked to see a
strong amateur sports movement and to have used the Olympics as a
springboard to do that,'' said Atlanta resident Dwight Bell, a USOC
board member. ``But clearly there has to be a commitment by some
organization to go after it and support it and coordinate it and be
a lighning rod for that activity.''
</P>
<P>
   GAAF was supposed to be that lightning rod. But it has yet to
generate any electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the foundation had no staff. In January 1998,
it hired a part-time executive director, Linda Stephenson, a former
ACOG employee. Many of its directors and officers have been busy
closing down operations at ACOG. ``Most of us have been at this
eight or nine years,'' Jernigan explained. ``We had to take a
breather.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's number is not listed in the phone book, and it
operates temporarily out of a cubicle in sparse space still leased
in the near-empty Inforum by ACOG. When the board gets together,
it's usually in a member's living room or conference room at the
member's business office.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has $4.5 million in assets _ $3 million in cash
returned by ACOG at the end of the Games and Payne's memorabilia,
which it values at $1.5 million. It still is not actively seeking
contributions or soliciting grant applications from sports
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Games, GAAF has given away no money, save the $10,000
golf program grants last fall to the East Lake Community Foundation
for its Junior Academy and the Friends of John A. White Park for
First Tee for inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs were connected to Payne or his board members.
Payne chaired the recent PGA Tour Championship at East Lake Golf
Club. His college friend, Jimmy Gabrielson, heads the First Tee
program. Two GAAF board members sit on the John A. White Park
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me and a lot of people that their objective is get
the museum built, and that's a legacy, but that's not a legacy for
kids and sports,'' lamented Berkholtz.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is a priority for GAAF and its executive director.
Stephenson has spent countless hours working on the Olympic
collection with the History Center. She helped put together the
center's ``Let the Memories Begin'' exhibition while still on
ACOG's payroll in 1997. Last year, she launched an ``oral history''
program seeking athletes, officials, volunteers and the public to
put their Olympic memories on videotape. Along with History Center
curator Don Mooney, she developed an Olympic display at the
Teaching Museum South, a special learning center for Fulton County
school children.
</P>
<P>
   A feasibility study for a permanent museum suggests making ``The
Olympic Experience'' a major downtown destination. But, in the
midst of the Salt Lake scandal, officials believe now is hardly the
time to launch a fund-raising campaign for about $30 million to
build the facility.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stephenson is producing a commemorative brochure on
the Games. ``When people come to Atlanta and they want to know
about the Olympics, it's difficult for them to see something,'' she
said. Payne defended the foundation's emphasis on preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``GAAF has spent thousands of hours beginning the process of
looking into the memorabilia and records,'' he said. ``We have
spent thousands of hours on the museum feasibility study. Those are
fundamental and appropriate undertakings and ones that we are proud
of.'' The largest financial undertaking since the Games is GAAF's
$975,000 purchase of Payne's Olympic memorabilia collection in
1997. That purchase allowed Payne to pay off his loan to the
foundation and still receive about $370,000 in cash. The foundation
considers Payne's memorabilia an essential part of any museum
collection. But while the sports activists don't begrudge the
foundation their drive for an Olympic museum, many agree with
Atlantan Steve Kearney, president of USA Badminton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already got a beautiful (Centennial Olympic) park, and
I'm glad we've got it. But what is that going to do for the
sports?'' he said. ``I'd also like to have a gym I could play in
and teach kids in. The athletes are the legacy.''

GOP HOPEFULS SEEK SOFTER ABORTION STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To the dismay of many GOP conservatives and the
relief of party moderates, the mark of a mainstream Republican
presidential candidate in 2000 will be a distinctly soft and
accommodating voice on the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That is becoming clear this week as three of the White House
wannabes _ Texas Governor George W. Bush, former Tennessee governor
Lamar Alexander, and former labor secretary Elizabeth Dole _ take
steps toward running and distance themselves from party activists
who for two decades have made a commitment to ending legal
abortions a litmus test of GOP presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different,'' said Ann Stone, founder of Republicans
for Choice, a group that raises money for GOP candidates who
support abortion rights. ``We have front-runner candidates, Bush
and Dole, who are bridge builders and don't want to divide the
party over the abortion issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The three all say they oppose abortion. But Alexander, who
formally began his campaign Tuesday in Nashville, said Monday he
could accept a running mate who supports abortion rights. Bush, who
presented his exploratory committee Sunday in Austin, Texas, said
the GOP should ``maintain its pro-life tenor,'' but said he had not
picked his advisers on the basis of their views on abortion. ``Our
party is big enough for good people to be able to disagree on the
issue,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who was to open her exploratory bid in Iowa this week, is
being advised to affirm her opposition to abortion while presenting
herself as ``a reasonable person who is not an extremist on the
issue,'' said Linda DiVall, Dole's pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polling shows that many women who are both staunchly
Republican and pro-life are also uncomfortable with male
politicians dictating their point of view on abortion,'' DiVall
said. ``Mrs. Dole is clearly pro-life, but as a woman she would
think through the issue, not impose her point of view, and uphold
the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, the Republican presidential nominee will need to
appeal beyond the party, particularly to women voters, to win the
White House. The results of the last two presidential races, and
defeats last fall of a dozen GOP House members and several
high-profile senators who opposed abortion, are causing likely
candidates Alexander, Bush, Dole, and Arizona Senator John McCain _
who also says he is antiabortion _ to play down the polarizing
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose a pollster would also have told Abraham Lincoln,
`It's fine to be antislavery, but don't talk about it if you want
to carry the South,' '' said Republican Gary Bauer, who has made
opposition to abortion a centerpiece of his run for the White
House. ``The issue is human life, and when Republicans begin to
play games with it, we send a signal that we are not a serious
governing party.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of ardent, antiabortion activists at the
GOP grass roots, and plenty of GOP White House aspirants, including
Bauer, vying for their support in next year's presidential
primaries. Among them are Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, TV
commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former diplomat Alan Keyes, and publisher Steve Forbes, who is more
passionate about abortion now than he was as a candidate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who headed the conservative Family Research Council, said
that as president, he would appoint only antiabortion judges, sign
legislation banning late-term abortions, and send Congress a bill
defining fetuses as persons protected under the 14th Amendment. He
said he would fight to preserve the party platform that since 1980
has called for both a constitutional amendment protecting ``the
right to life for unborn children'' and congressional efforts to
restrict federal funds for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Parro, the Dallas-based director of the Republican
National Coalition for Life, said she fears the party's thirst for
victory in 2000 could threaten the antiabortion plank in the
platform and is encouraging ``squishy pro-lifers'' such as Bush and
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Dole would allow abortions for women who are
victims of rape or incest, or whose lives are endangered by a
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be efforts to water down the platform language or
remove it entirely,'' said Parro, whose antiabortion group was
formed to counter Republicans for Choice. ``Some Republicans also
are going to push for a pro-choice running mate, which would really
be dumb. If we walk, they don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the contentiousness of the issue, the centrist candidates
have adopted the position that the less said about abortion for
now, the better. McCain refused to discuss the issue at a recent
California GOP convention. Asked about abortion on the ``Today''
show Monday, Alexander said, ``We have honest differences of
opinion about it in the Republican Party. Let's move on to
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander opposes a constitutional amendment to end abortion,
supports a ban on late-term procedures, and says the states should
be able to restrict people who can obtain abortions. But the issue
is not on the candidate's agenda, said Stephen Schmidt, Alexander's
spokesman. ``This campaign is about fixing public education,
reducing taxes, and strengthening the national defense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Try as they might, though, candidates might have trouble staying
on course when punches come from the right and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is a kinder, gentler, politically correct
candidate who doesn't want to offend anyone,'' said Cathie Adams,
who, as president of the Texas branch of the conservative Eagle
Forum, has been disappointed with Bush for not limiting access to
abortion in the state. ``Americans want strong stands and strong
positions, and we will make abortion a front-burner issue.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the liberal National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, the nation's largest abortion-rights advocacy group.
Kate Michelman, the league's president, said her organization
intends to expose the GOP centrists as ``great pretenders'' trying
to woo voters with soft rhetoric on abortion that matches neither
their personal views nor their policies as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This attempt by some Republicans to appear moderate on
abortion speaks dramatically to how important the issue of a
woman's right to choose will be in 2000,'' Michelman said. ``But
I've lived long enough to know this is nothing more than a campaign
strategy. Once they win office, who knows what will happen to this
fragile and fundamental right?''

WEALTHY HOUSE DEMOCRAT LOCKED IN VICIOUS DIVORCE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINEZ, Calif. _ In November 1997, just when she was getting
used to her job as a freshman member of the House of
Representatives, Ellen O. Tauscher received an anonymous e-mail
that her husband, William, was having an affair with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Her suspicions were confirmed when, on a visit to the home the
couple maintained in Atlanta, she discovered a photograph of her
husband with his paramour, taken at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan,
where she and William were married in July 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That information is contained in Tauscher's written declarations
in divorce proceedings filed in Superior Court in Contra Costa
County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Marital counseling failed. And in December, Tauscher, a Democrat
now in her second term representing the California congressional
district that includes parts of Contra Costa and Alameda counties,
petitioned for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Huge amounts of money _ their net worth is nearly $18 million _
are at stake, according to the divorce case records. Stock in
William Tauscher's computer company makes up more than half of
their $36 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher, 47, a Wall Street investment banker and
entrepreneurial businesswoman before turning to politics, accuses
her husband of concealing and misappropriating their joint assets,
in part to pay expenses for a woman he has acknowledged was his
mistress.
</P>
<P>
   William Y. Tauscher, 48, founder of the Computerland Stores,
which changed into Vanstar and subsequently merged into Inacom
Corp. of Omaha, Neb., calls Ellen Tauscher a liar who is using a
``poor little me'' attack to claim a disproportionate share of
their wealth, according to the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   They also are fighting over the custody of their 7-year-old
daughter, Katherine. Ellen Tauscher wants to restrict her husband's
visitation and custodial rights to weekends, which, she contends,
is the only time he ever saw the girl. He disputes that claim and
wants joint custody.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agree they lived extravagantly as a couple,
although it is one of the few points of agreement acknowledged in
the competing court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ellen Tauscher nor her husband could be immediately
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a private matter,'' Ellen Tauscher told the Contra
Costa Times on Monday. ``It's a family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult time,'' William Tauscher told the
newspaper. ``I just hope it can be concluded soon, as well as
possible and Ellen can get on with being a great congressperson and
we can both be great parents and go on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Tauscher said in a court declaration that her husband
``has always insisted that we `live large.' He always ensured that
we travel first class, stayed in five-star hotels, stayed in suites
rather than just rooms, ordered caviar at restaurants rather than
regular appetizers, drank (Roederer) Cristal ($169.99 a bottle)
instead of ordinary champagne and paid the tab at each and every
meal, regardless of who we were with or how many people were with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   William Tauscher's response was: ``The lifestyle developed by
the Tauschers was established mutually.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Tauscher portrays herself as significantly disadvantaged
financially in her dispute with her husband. Her congressional
salary is $135,000 a year, and she has about $300,000 in liquid
assets, while he earns $1 million a year, is in line for a $3
million bonus and controls a fortune of about $17 million, she
contends.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Tauscher contends that she had ``no knowledge of the
family's financial affairs'' and ``was kept in the dark''
throughout the marriage. William Tauscher took out a $15 million
loan without her knowledge and is trying to force her to pay off
part of it, according to the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she was ``upset and hurt that Bill pretended to be
part of one big happy family while having a long-term affair.''
</P>
<P>
   William Tauscher said his wife is an astute and experienced
businesswoman, one with her own seat on the New York Stock
Exchange, and was fully cognizant of their financial affairs. He
also noted that she moved swiftly to gain control of $1 million
they had in a joint bank account when the marriage hit the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Tauscher's explanation for moving on the bank account was
that ``I was scared, as Bill had cut me off financially, refused to
disclose what was happening with our money, except to tell me that
he had none, and had control of the entire estate.''

 PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND, Alaska: ... of the work.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, oil reached 1,300 miles of coastline and killed
staggering numbers: 250,000 birds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 seals, 250
bald eagles, perhaps billions of salmon and herring larvae,
according to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, which
manages Exxon settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   The spill also devastated coastal communities such as Cordova,
which saw its vital herring fishery closed after the spill, and New
Chenega, a native village that had been destroyed before, by a 1964
earthquake. The oil that covered Sleepy Bay poisoned the Chenegans'
clam beds.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible as the immediate costs were, the bigger controversy
centered on the longterm damage, if any, from the disaster. Exxon
paid about $300 million in damage claims in the first few years
after the spill, but lawyers for people who had been harmed called
that a mere down payment on losses that averaged more than $200,000
per fisherman from 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the two sides are still arguing. In 1994, a
federal jury in Anchorage awarded thousands of fishermen, natives,
and property owners $5 billion in punitive damages for the spill,
which Exxon has appealed, arguing that they were wrongly blamed for
problems far beyond their accident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the official cleanup ended in 1992, Exxon
researchers began declaring ``the remarkable recovery'' of Prince
William Sound. ``Resources in the spill-affected area are
essentially recovered and. . . wildlife is present at levels within
historic range,'' concluded Exxon's shareholder magazine in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   True, some animals, such as bald eagles and, later, river
otters, did seem to bounce back quickly. However, scientists at the
National Marine Fisheries Service say Exxon's claims are premature
even now. Not only are some species, such as loons and harlequin
ducks, showing no signs of recovering, but new research suggests
that the Exxon Valdez spill may be killing today.
</P>
<P>
   Wright of the National Marine Fisheries Service believes traces
of Exxon Valdez oil among the rocks in salmon streams are killing
eggs. Research at the service's Auke Bay Lab found that the tiny
red eggs actually draw the oil to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, people suing Exxon believe the spill has had a
longterm toxic effect on them. J. Steven Picou, a sociologist at
the University of South Alabama, found major psychological stress
among coastal residents, including severe depression in 40 percent
of commercial fishermen in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the spill, commercial fishing has crumbled, though not
entirely because of oil. Disease decimated the herring industry,
while growing salmon competition dropped prices from $2.70 a pound
in the 1980s to just 50 cents a pound in some places now.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of fishermen, it's getting to the point where you
can't afford the peanut butter and gas to go fishing,'' said
O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, scientists may never know the full impact of the
spill, partly because they don't know enough about pre-spill
wildlife populations and partly because the Sound was changing
anyway. Water temperatures have risen four degrees Fahrenheit in
recent decades, altering the food supply in unpredictable ways. The
best that Molly McCammon, executive director of the Exxon Valdez
Oil Spill Trustee Council, can say is that recovery work is not
finished: ``There is a long way yet to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the waters of Prince William Sound, the big spill has had
a dramatic effect on the oil industry. Publicly embarrassed, and
certain more regulations were coming, major oil companies put up $1
billion to start a new firm to prepare for catastrophic spills, the
Marine Spill Response Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act in 1990, which
greatly increased polluter liability for spills, set up a $1
billion national cleanup fund, and required tankers to have a
protective outer hull by 2015. The law also imposed new rules aimed
at better emergency response planning, one of the major weaknesses
in the Valdez accident.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the port of Valdez has gone from an embarrassment to an
industry showcase, with tugboats escorting the tankers, better
radar tracking their movements, and monthly emergency drills.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these measures have reduced the amount of oil
spilled in US waters from at least 4 million gallons each year in
the 1980s to only 565,500 gallons in 1997, according to the Oil
Spill Intelligence Report.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the progress against oil spills may make the country
less prepared for the next Exxon Valdez-scale disaster. With no
catastrophic spills since 1989, response companies have struggled
for business.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, cleanup companies pay lots of people to be trained
and wait. For instance, the Marine Spill Response Corp. keeps a
staff of six on its 210-foot cleanup vessel stationed outside San
Francisco even though it has worked on only two oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with crude oil prices at a 12-year low, oil firms are
laying off thousands and merging with each other to save money.
Some fear they will cut back even more on how much they pay to keep
spill equipment and personnel on standby.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSRC's capacity far, far exceeds regulatory requirements,''
said Benz, praising the company's founders. Oil companies ``are
clearly spending far more than they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of emergency response cuts scares
environmentalists as the oil industry presses to explore for oil
and gas in the sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and as
the existing Trans-Alaska Pipeline to Valdez ages. Nine
environmental groups recently called on federal regulators to hold
up the merger of Mobil and Exxon until issues regarding the Valdez
spill are settled. ``A new millennium demands a new commitment by
corporations to act responsibly toward the environment and the
human beings affected by their operations,'' the activists said.

THE LIMITS OF LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sex and adultery can wreak havoc in a workplace, but the
consequences often depend more on who the people are and where they
are than the affair itself. Double standards still rule the day.
Power, wealth and, yes, gender, still make a difference. So does
the type of workplace. Certain behaviors may be ignored by one
company and severely punished by another.
</P>
<P>
   Few employers actually ban consensual relationships. Some try to
discourage sexual relations between employees, particularly when
managers and subordinates are involved, because of the negative
impact those relationships may have on productivity and company
morale.
</P>
<P>
   In February, I wrote a Valentine's Day column on romance in the
workplace, and the increase in dating among co-workers. What I did
not touch on, as explained in the following letter, was the
extramarital affair, or dating among married employees, and its
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your February article on love in the workplace hit very hard,
not for what it covered, but for what it did not cover. What do you
do when adultery has struck? It's a fairly typical situation:
</P>
<P>
   --Married man in his 40s, put through bachelor's and master's in
science by professional wife.
</P>
<P>
   --Small company with fabulous potential.
</P>
<P>
   --Attractive girl in her 20s who works for him. She gets hot; He
gets hot. They fall in love and/or are infatuated.
</P>
<P>
   --The wife observes ``chemistry'' between them. They claim
friendship and temptation, but deny sexual relationship. Co-workers
have been suspicious for some time.
</P>
<P>
   --Girlfriend is removed from his team. They continue the
relationship for a year and a half, denying all. He resigns from
his team.
</P>
<P>
   --He confesses, after wife finds proof. Marriage deteriorates.
Wife insists on separation if he can't be faithful. He asserts he
is not capable of being faithful.
</P>
<P>
   --Separation planned. He's taking an apartment, the cost of
which is going to put severe financial burden on a budget strained
to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   As the wife, I can cope with the essential tragedy of my loss of
a marriage partner, but I have a larger question: To what extent
could the company be held liable for the alienation of a husband
when the executive ranks were aware of the adulterous affair and
did nothing about it?
</P>
<P>
   Adultery, for all its commonplaceness, is still illegal, is it
not? If companies are held liable for damages due to tolerating
behavior that results in harassment, sexual or otherwise, does it
logically follow that they could be found culpable in situations in
which they tolerate behavior that causes a woman to lose her future
stake in a partnership that provided her and her child with
material security?
</P>
<P>
   What are a wife's options? Should she make a formal complaint to
the company and demand the (girlfriend) be let go? Should she
divorce him, and sue for his options?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Name Withheld Upon Request &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Tragically, this letter demonstrates how devastating these
relationships can be to families.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several high-profile divorce cases that have
raised questions about a wife's role in a marriage and have focused
on her options during divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Lorna Wendt, then the wife of GE Capital
chief executive Gary Wendt, sued for half of the $100 million she
estimated he was worth. She wanted more than the house they had
shared before the break-up of their 32-year marriage. Lorna Wendt
wanted Gary's unvested stock options. She also wanted a share of
his retirement benefits, even though they would not be available to
either of them for several years.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, she prevailed. Instead, of the $8 million her
husband had offered, she received $22 million. Additionally, a
Connecticut judge ruled that any stock options awarded to Gary
Wendt during the marriage were ``marital property'' and, therefore,
had to be shared with Lorna.
</P>
<P>
   The other question is more difficult to answer. I could not find
anyone who knew of a case in which an employer had been found
liable for an adulterous relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Can the wronged spouse demand the firing of an adulterous
employee? ``It is not the wife's place to demand that the woman be
transferred or fired,'' said Chicago employment lawyer Laurel
Bellows, former chairperson of the American Bar Association
Commission on Women. ``She is not the supervisor of the workplace.
She is an affected party between two adulterers. In legal language,
she does not have the standing to complain about the atmosphere in
the workplace because she is not an employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if this was the 10th adulterous relationship fostered
by a workplace where loose sex and orgies were common,'' she
continued. ``Even then, the wife or spouse might not have a cause
of action, but the employees would.''
</P>
<P>
   About the illegality of adultery, Bellows asked, ``Who is to say
a consensual relationship is wrong legally? Morally, we would all
probably agree with this letter writer. But few states now have
Alienation of Affection Acts or statutes that make adultery
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she noted, ``This woman has raised cutting
edged legal issues. We read her letter and we laugh at first, then
we cry. She would like to use the law to turn the workplace in the
opposite direction, but that is too much of a stretch since most
people now feel that employers have no place in their personal
lives.''

THE RISE OF E-WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tony Pelletier, a retired engineer who trades stocks through
his on-line brokerage account, is considering buying something his
son typically avoids: Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand technology stocks because of my profession, and
I'd been planning to get more into them,'' says the 65-year-old
Hyannis, Mass. resident, who trades several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   For Pelletier's 37-year-old son, Bruce, the siren call of
electronic investing has a different timbre. Although he trades on
line for a living, investing his own $500,000 in up to 50 stocks
each day and cashing out before the market closes, he generally
shuns Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grind out small profits and sometimes have a windfall,'' he
says. ``But it's hard to track the short-term direction on Internet
stocks, so I generally don't buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite different approaches, the Pelletiers are at the fore of
the biggest revolution in investing since the rise of mutual funds.
Spurred by Internet mania, a bull market in stocks, and the speed,
economy, and ease of Web-based trading, on-line investing has gone
mainstream. Barely a fringe culture three years ago, it now
accounts for roughly one-third of stock trades by individual
investors, and is challenging traditional Wall Street brokerages as
well as the buy-and-hold principle that has ruled investing for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people buy and sell stocks electronically _
often with the click of a mouse from home computers _ investing has
become much more of a do-it-yourself affair. In the process, power
has shifted to small investors, and the barriers separating
professional stock pickers and amateurs have eroded.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers are increasingly worried about the harm that
neophyte Web-based investors may do to themselves. While
on-line-only brokerages come under the purview of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the investment industry's regulator, such
sites have made officials and observers nervous about the
consequences of high volume trading.
</P>
<P>
   With Web-based trading, investors are taking matters once left
to brokers into their own hands. As a result, ``people are having
to spend a lot more time on decision-making and choosing,'' says
professor Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management. ``There's an element of
self-discipline that becomes more important. Some of the old rules
aren't going to be very useful in this new culture.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line investors are not just day traders, who make bungee jump
transactions dozens of times a day in rapid-fire succession. Nor
are they only thirtysomethings dabbling in America's hottest hobby.
Increasingly, they are also the affluent and the elderly, for whom
money management is now a self-service affair from the home
computer as much as an occasional trip to the financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the number of on-line brokerage accounts more than
doubled to 7.3 million, with $420 billion in assets, according to
Piper Jaffray Inc., a Minneapolis investment firm. Around 27
percent of all retail trading by individuals in stocks and mutual
fund shares was done on line in 1998, says Piper Jaffray. For
stocks only, the firm says, on-line brokerages accounted for a
whopping 37 percent of all retail trading.
</P>
<P>
   The growth is not just in new accounts. Investors using one of
the nation's 100 or so on-line brokerages trade an average of 20
times a year, four times more often than regular investors,
according to Gomez Advisers Inc., a Concord, Mass., consulting firm
on the Web-based brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of on-line trading is clear. At anywhere from $5 to
$29.95 a trade, electronic transactions cost a fraction of the $300
and more charged by full-service brokers. Offering research,
charts, fancy analytical tools, and live price quotes,
cyber-brokerages blur the boundary between the trading room of a
Wall Street money giant and a kitchen in Kansas with a computer and
a modem.
</P>
<P>
   As such, on-line investing reflects the growing populist tone of
the US investment industry, where the rise of discount brokerages,
mutual funds, and 401(k) pension plans have all shifted power to
the individual investor.
</P>
<P>
   But while emblematic of an increasingly consumer-driven,
computerized world, on-line investing and its perils in fact recall
shady aspects of Wall Street earlier this century.
</P>
<P>
   Often full of bogus tips and false hype, the Internet's
thousands of investment chat rooms and message boards sometimes
echo the market manipulators and bucket shops of the 1920s, when
shady dealers would solicit money from investors, talk down a
stock's price, and then pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, more modern perils.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the crush of investors racing on line has
caused overloaded systems to crash, most seriously at E-Trade, a
popular online-only brokerage, and most recently at Charles Schwab
&AMP; Co., the industry leader. Such outages have caused investors,
whose profits depend upon instant trade execution, to lose
thousands of dollars. Some investors, their confidence shaken, have
even filed lawsuits against electronic brokers.
</P>
<P>
   For those who make profits, fast and furious electronic trading
can produce bigger capital gains taxes, since there are more
transactions to tax.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperactive trading also creates more activity in
already-volatile markets and has spawned a shorter-term investing
horizon. That in turn has created a new class of investors who
increasingly forsake stocks with good long-term prospects in favor
of popular, flavor-of-the-month issues _ a major shift in investing
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   As state officials shut down renegade day-trading shops and the
nation's top securities regulator calls for increased scrutiny of
on-line brokerages, some industry players wonder just how safe
investing's brave new world is.
</P>
<P>
   ``With on-line brokerages, the cost of investing is the lowest
in history,'' said professor Jeremy Siegel of the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School. ``But the risk is not.''
</P>
<P>
   That point is not lost on Bruce Pelletier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely an art,'' says the Hyannis resident, who
worked as a carpenter and resort manager before becoming a
full-time self-avowed day trader three years ago. Bruce invests
side-by-side with his father out of a ``trading room'' the elder
Pelletier built on the third floor of his Cape Cod-style house.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, who trades only through his $1 million
account at Fidelity Investments' on-line brokerage, Bruce has
gradually moved his business from Fidelity to an obscure Web-only
brokerage, whose name he won't mention for fear of creating a
systems-crushing flood of new business. With all the trading he was
doing, Bruce says, Fidelity's system of routing orders to
specialists and market makers, rather than executing trades
automatically, was costing him time and, hence, profits.

BAY STATE OFFERS UNIQUE WAY TO SAVE FOR EDUCATION

 By CHARLES A. JAFFE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A new Massachusetts program allows for tax-deferred
college savings, and provides the kind of flexibility most previous
tuition-savings programs lack. The U. Fund is the state's version
of a so-called ``529 Plan,'' and its creation makes Massachusetts
the first state with both major forms of state-sponsored savings
program, one that involves guaranteed tuition savings (the
previously established U. Plan) and the newer form of investment
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the Roth IRA of college savings plans,'' says
Brian Grodman of the Grodman Financial Group in Manchester, N.H.
New Hampshire last year became the first state in the country to
offer a 529 Plan, opening the Unique College Investing Plan, which
is very similar to the U. Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers tax-deferred growth, with flexibility that was not
previously available. Anybody with children or grandchildren is
going to have to look at this as an option, because you can build
your college savings around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the basics on how the U. Fund works:
</P>
<P>
   Parents or grandparents open a U. Fund account in the name of a
child, who becomes the beneficiary of the account. The money grows
with all state and federal taxes deferred until the child reaches
college age. There already is a proposal from the governor's office
that would make the program state-tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
   When the child reaches college age, the money is withdrawn to
pay for tuition, room, board, books and/or required equipment and
supplies. The money, at this time, is taxed at the child's tax
rate, typically much lower than that of the parent.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the U. Plan, in which investments essentially buy
tuition credits at participating colleges throughout the state, the
U. Fund has no borders. The child can attend any college, anywhere,
and be a beneficiary of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The money is invested into funds managed by Fidelity
Investments. One of the rules allowing 529 Plans is that the people
establishing the account are not allowed to have discretion over
how the money is invested; you do not get to pick the funds, nor
decide what percentage goes into each fund in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts plan _ like the one offered by New
Hampshire _ the money is invested in one of eight portfolios of
funds, starting out with a mix of 88 percent stocks/12 percent
bonds when the child is young, and becoming steadily more
conservative until it reaches an allocation of 20 percent stocks/40
percent bonds/40 percent short-term bonds and cash when the child
hits college age.
</P>
<P>
   The money is placed in up to 16 different Fidelity funds, from
equity choices such as Blue Chip Growth, Overseas, Spartan Market
Index, and Equity-Income II, to fixed-income selections including
Government Income, Investment Grade Bond, and Short-Term Bond.
</P>
<P>
   (Each state develops its own plan for how the money should be
invested. Most of the 16 states with 529 Plans in operation invest
more conservatively than either the Massachusetts or New Hampshire
plans and/or do not adjust the portfolio for the age of the
beneficiary.)
</P>
<P>
   Both the Massachusetts and New Hampshire plans have neither
residency requirements nor borders. Plans can be established by
residents of any state. (Out-of-state residents could face
different state tax implications, depending on tax laws where they
live.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the U. Fund allows the money to be moved from one
beneficiary to the next. Say the oldest child in a family decides
not to go to college or graduates with a balance left in the U.
Fund account. The money can be transferred without penalty into the
account of which a younger child is the beneficiary, or even into
one in which the parent saves money to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   If you withdraw the money early, for a use other than qualified
college expenses, the earnings are taxed at the
parent/grandparent's rate, plus a 10 percent penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the structure of 529 Plans in general has some positive
estate/gift aspects. Normally, a parent can give a child only
$10,000 per year without hitting the limit and triggering gift
taxes or dipping into certain estate tax benefits. With the U.
Fund, however, a parent or grandparent can give the child up to
$50,000 in a single year (maximum of $100,000 per couple).
Essentially, this works like an advance on the $10,000-per-year
rule; you can make the maximum gift now, but give no more for five
years. Still, that puts the money to work upfront, and eases
certain estate-tax provisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are costs associated with the program. Aside from the
regular management fees of the mutual funds involved, there is a
0.3 percent annual management cost. And there is a $30
set-up/annual fee, which is waived if the participant makes
automatic monthly investments of $50, or once the account reaches
$25,000 in value.
</P>
<P>
   With the average fund in the program having an expense ratio of
0.7 percent _ more for the stock funds, less for the bond funds
involved _ the average expense ratio on the investment will be
roughly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For information and application forms on the U. Fund, call
800-544-2776.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no income limits and the contribution limit is five
years at the highest-priced institution in the state,'' says Peter
Mazareas, executive director of the Massachusetts Educational
Financing Authority, which is running the program for the state.
Currently, that means the maximum contribution is pegged at
$158,750 (although giving that much in one lump sum could have
estate/gift tax consequences). ``This is really a program that
everyone can participate in and benefit from.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazareas says he believes the new program will not put the
existing U. Plan out of business. That program allows investors to
set aside current dollars to pay for college tuition at a list of
participating institutions. If, for example, a parent puts in
enough money to pay for 10 percent of a UMass education at today's
prices, he will be guaranteed of having that percentage of tuition
covered when his child reaches college age, regardless of what
happens with tuition inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for this type of plan has been, however, that the
guaranteed rates of return have been low, compared with stock
market returns. That, plus a limited enrollment period (the U. Plan
accepts new participants in May only, compared with the 529 Plan,
which is open year-round), have curtailed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some people who want the guarantee, the safety
of knowing that they have purchased tuition and that the education
is paid for no matter what happens to prices,'' Mazareas says.
``But for everyone who felt the U. Plan was too conservative, the
U. Fund provides a new option. Hopefully, we've now got something
for everyone.''

UNEASY PEACE IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Packed with commuters, the city
tram chugs down the center of ``Sniper Alley,'' a road once so
dangerous that few dared attempt the trip except in an armored
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But while the shooting and looting have virtually stopped in
Bosnia since the end of the war in 1995, the peace is an uneasy
one. The presence of NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) peacekeeping
troops gives Bosnia the unsettled feel of a country patrolled by an
occupying army, and many here believe fighting would break out
quickly if the troops pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Northern Ireland,'' said Stef Whelan, an Irish
observer with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as
he monitored the streets of Omarska, in the north. ``The guns
aren't being fired. But that doesn't mean they can't be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three years after the Dayton accord ending the 1992-95
war, Bosnia is still tense, with the previously warring factions of
Serbs, Croats, and Muslims still living wary, separate lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serbs are furious with an international decision last
week to put the town of Brcko under three-way rule by Serbs,
Croats, and Muslims. The town is of critical strategic importance
to the Serbs because it sits on the narrow connection between the
two wings of Republika Srpska, a Serb-run part of Bosnia. The rest
of Bosnia is largely Croat-Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dayton agreement, Brcko has been officially neutral,
but effectively controlled by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament of Republika Srpska voted late Sunday to boycott
participation in national Bosnian affairs with their Croat and
Muslim counterparts. They also voted to condemn last week's firing
of its hard-line nationalist president, Nikola Poplasen, by
international peace coordinator Carlos Westendorp.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen insisted Tuesday he would not step down, but
Westendorp, who has sweeping powers as peace coordinator, said the
decision was final.
</P>
<P>
   The votes have strained relations between Republika Srpska and
the international community, and raised questions about the Serbs'
commitment to the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bosnia remains on edge. The 30,000 troops _ including
6,900 US soldiers _ have been able to keep the locals from killing
each other en masse. But few refugees have returned to their homes
in Bosnia _ some because they are afraid to return to a town
largely populated by another ethnic group, and some because they
fear their homes have been booby-trapped by departing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Houses throughout Bosnia remain burned and empty since the war.
Between one and two million land mines are still scattered
throughout the region, making much of the land off-limits for
housing or farming.
</P>
<P>
   Also, critically needed economic reform has not come about, said
Colin Soloway, a political analyst with the International Crisis
Group in Sarajevo. There is virtually no private banking system in
Bosnia, and wage-earners and business owners must put their money
into state-run accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accounts are controlled by party bosses on all three
sides, the system, a vestige of the socialist era, makes it
personally risky for people to speak out against politicians,
international observers say, further holding up change.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of publicly accused war criminals are still at large, and
locals are disinclined to help the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia find them, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbs ``consider them heroes,'' said Lee Snell, a human
rights investigator in Prijedor, northern Bosnia. Those whose
family members were killed or tortured during the war also may keep
quiet, since ``they'd rather take care of it themselves. They'd
rather kill them themselves,'' Snell said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Dayton agreement, the Stabilization Force is not
allowed to arrest accused war criminals unless the soldiers come
across them in their ``daily duties,'' said Lieutenant Commander
Glenn Chamberlain, an SFOR spokesman. ``We're not policemen,'' he
said. ``We can't do investigations, going door-to-door.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing tension in Bosnia is made even more troublesome
because of the crisis in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
and Serbs are fighting for control of the Serb-governed, but mainly
Albanian-occupied, province.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in Bosnia are sensitive about the fate of Kosovo, which
many Serbs consider a kind of sacred, historical homeland. Bosnian
Serbs, who are mainly Orthodox Christian, see the mainly Muslim
Albanians as being just an extension of the Bosnian Muslims, said
Radisar Mashic, head of the single radio station in Foca, southern
Bosnia, and a prominent local Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the war increases in Kosovo, stability here would not
exist,'' Mashic warned. ``Dayton would be in danger.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A new Massachusetts program allows for tax-deferred
college savings, and provides the kind of flexibility most previous
tuition-savings programs lack. The U. Fund is the state's version
of a so-called ``529 Plan,'' and its creation makes Massachusetts
the first state with both major forms of state-sponsored savings
program, one that involves guaranteed tuition savings (the
previously established U. Plan) and the newer form of investment
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the Roth IRA of college savings plans,'' says
Brian Grodman of the Grodman Financial Group in Manchester, N.H.
New Hampshire last year became the first state in the country to
offer a 529 Plan, opening the Unique College Investing Plan, which
is very similar to the U. Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers tax-deferred growth, with flexibility that was not
previously available. Anybody with children or grandchildren is
going to have to look at this as an option, because you can build
your college savings around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the basics on how the U. Fund works:
</P>
<P>
   Parents or grandparents open a U. Fund account in the name of a
child, who becomes the beneficiary of the account. The money grows
with all state and federal taxes deferred until the child reaches
college age. There already is a proposal from the governor's office
that would make the program state-tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
   When the child reaches college age, the money is withdrawn to
pay for tuition, room, board, books and/or required equipment and
supplies. The money, at this time, is taxed at the child's tax
rate, typically much lower than that of the parent.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the U. Plan, in which investments essentially buy
tuition credits at participating colleges throughout the state, the
U. Fund has no borders. The child can attend any college, anywhere,
and be a beneficiary of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The money is invested into funds managed by Fidelity
Investments. One of the rules allowing 529 Plans is that the people
establishing the account are not allowed to have discretion over
how the money is invested; you do not get to pick the funds, nor
decide what percentage goes into each fund in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts plan _ like the one offered by New
Hampshire _ the money is invested in one of eight portfolios of
funds, starting out with a mix of 88 percent stocks/12 percent
bonds when the child is young, and becoming steadily more
conservative until it reaches an allocation of 20 percent stocks/40
percent bonds/40 percent short-term bonds and cash when the child
hits college age.
</P>
<P>
   The money is placed in up to 16 different Fidelity funds, from
equity choices such as Blue Chip Growth, Overseas, Spartan Market
Index, and Equity-Income II, to fixed-income selections including
Government Income, Investment Grade Bond, and Short-Term Bond.
</P>
<P>
   (Each state develops its own plan for how the money should be
invested. Most of the 16 states with 529 Plans in operation invest
more conservatively than either the Massachusetts or New Hampshire
plans and/or do not adjust the portfolio for the age of the
beneficiary.)
</P>
<P>
   Both the Massachusetts and New Hampshire plans have neither
residency requirements nor borders. Plans can be established by
residents of any state. (Out-of-state residents could face
different state tax implications, depending on tax laws where they
live.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the U. Fund allows the money to be moved from one
beneficiary to the next. Say the oldest child in a family decides
not to go to college or graduates with a balance left in the U.
Fund account. The money can be transferred without penalty into the
account of which a younger child is the beneficiary, or even into
one in which the parent saves money to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   If you withdraw the money early, for a use other than qualified
college expenses, the earnings are taxed at the
parent/grandparent's rate, plus a 10 percent penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the structure of 529 Plans in general has some positive
estate/gift aspects. Normally, a parent can give a child only
$10,000 per year without hitting the limit and triggering gift
taxes or dipping into certain estate tax benefits. With the U.
Fund, however, a parent or grandparent can give the child up to
$50,000 in a single year (maximum of $100,000 per couple).
Essentially, this works like an advance on the $10,000-per-year
rule; you can make the maximum gift now, but give no more for five
years. Still, that puts the money to work upfront, and eases
certain estate-tax provisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are costs associated with the program. Aside from the
regular management fees of the mutual funds involved, there is a
0.3 percent annual management cost. And there is a $30
set-up/annual fee, which is waived if the participant makes
automatic monthly investments of $50, or once the account reaches
$25,000 in value.
</P>
<P>
   With the average fund in the program having an expense ratio of
0.7 percent _ more for the stock funds, less for the bond funds
involved _ the average expense ratio on the investment will be
roughly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For information and application forms on the U. Fund, call
800-544-2776.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no income limits and the contribution limit is five
years at the highest-priced institution in the state,'' says Peter
Mazareas, executive director of the Massachusetts Educational
Financing Authority, which is running the program for the state.
Currently, that means the maximum contribution is pegged at
$158,750 (although giving that much in one lump sum could have
estate/gift tax consequences). ``This is really a program that
everyone can participate in and benefit from.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazareas says he believes the new program will not put the
existing U. Plan out of business. That program allows investors to
set aside current dollars to pay for college tuition at a list of
participating institutions. If, for example, a parent puts in
enough money to pay for 10 percent of a UMass education at today's
prices, he will be guaranteed of having that percentage of tuition
covered when his child reaches college age, regardless of what
happens with tuition inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for this type of plan has been, however, that the
guaranteed rates of return have been low, compared with stock
market returns. That, plus a limited enrollment period (the U. Plan
accepts new participants in May only, compared with the 529 Plan,
which is open year-round), have curtailed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some people who want the guarantee, the safety
of knowing that they have purchased tuition and that the education
is paid for no matter what happens to prices,'' Mazareas says.
``But for everyone who felt the U. Plan was too conservative, the
U. Fund provides a new option. Hopefully, we've now got something
for everyone.''

FOLK-ROCK SERVICES HELP CHURCH REACH YOUNG ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the very beginning it is clear this is not your typical
Sunday morning service at College Avenue United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning and welcome to the church of rock,'' the Rev.
Edward Deyton says in greeting his small congregation in
Somerville, Mass. The congregation responds in unison: ``And
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute service in a small alcove on the church's second
floor has more the flavor of a coffeehouse folk concert than a
Christian worship experience _ just a few songs and a brief, lively
discussion of the challenges a church faces when it tries to do
things differently.
</P>
<P>
   There is no praying and no preaching. Just Deyton and his six
band members, singing and playing guitar, drums and keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's church for people who aren't interested in what they
normally associate with church,'' said Liz Strausbaugh, 27, who
sings and somtimes plays the flute and violin at the service.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists might scoff, but the Sunday morning folk-rock
services have helped College Avenue make inroads to a population
that many mainstream Christian churches are having a hard time
attracting _ adults in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenting with worship service _ usually by making it less
formal or introducing more contemporary music _ is one strategy
many churches are trying to draw younger members. Without young
blood, aging congregations say they face a perilous future.
</P>
<P>
   College Avenue was a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Like many mainline Protestant churches, its membership had been
declining since the early 1960s, as younger generations grew
suspicious and disenchanted with institutional religion.
</P>
<P>
   When Deyton arrived at College Avenue about 6 1/2 years ago, he
found only one person under 40 who regularly attended the church.
Most members were in their 60s or older. Today, the church has
about 40 active young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that if we didn't do something we were going to
die,'' said Deyton.
</P>
<P>
   The church also looked at the demographics of the surrounding
neighborhood and found that the majority of residents were single
people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation also benefits from a favorable location near
the MBTA station, which draws heavy commuter foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to do something that would send the message to the
community that we were going to do some serious work in terms of
welcoming young adults,'' said Deyton, who has led United Methodist
churches in Lowell, Mass. and Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the idea of the folk-rock service was born. ``We
wanted to have, in a sense, a church that's not like church,''
Deyton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a generation that is incredibly skeptical
of institutions,'' said Chance Hunter, 25, who is the church's
director of young adults ministry and a student at Boston
University School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   Deyton strives to create a laid-back atmosphere at the service.
He writes many of the songs, or chooses folk songs with a spiritual
theme. Instead of a sermon, he presents a theme, then invites a
short discussion, and those at the service have a short discussion
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of College Avenue's congregation, which has about 350
members, still attends the more traditional Sunday morning service.
But the folk-rock service has brought in people who otherwise would
not set foot inside a church, Deyton said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Leary, 30, grew up in a Methodist family. When she first
moved to Somerville several years ago she started looking around
for a church. She liked College Avenue because it had people her
age and it was actively involved in social issues.

   Trying to start repairing the deep divisions within the Greek
Orthodox Church in America, leaders of the church, including
bishops, have adopted a resolution encouraging greater solidarity
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We oppose the spirit of all negativism, destructive criticism
and division,'' stated the resolution adopted last week in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which was released by the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese of New York, was signed by the metropolitans, the
bishops of the church's large dioceses who called this year for the
resignation of the church's embattled national leader, Archbishop
Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon has come under criticism for what detractors say is an
authoritarian and unyielding management style.

ADDING INSULT TO OLD WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You dine out at a local restaurant and worry whether the tip you
leave is too small or too large. Will the size of your gratuity
confirm the waiter's image of you as a cheapskate doctor or as a
yuppie spendthrift?
</P>
<P>
   You go to work and wonder whether your new patient averted her
eyes when you shook hands. Did she recognize you? Did you imagine
it, or did she recoil?
</P>
<P>
   You move to a new neighborhood and want to make friends, but you
are more guarded now, more wary of strangers. Will they ask, offer
an opinion, or avoid the subject altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy changes you. Loss diminishes you. But there is no
vocabulary for what happens to you when your life becomes a public
spectacle, when your deepest scars are laid bare for public
dissection.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since Matthew Eappen suffered fatal head
trauma, two years since his parents, Deborah and Sunil Eappen,
spent four long days and nights at his bedside in the intensive
care unit before he succumbed to his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a year since a Middlesex Superior Court
jury convicted, and a judge confirmed, that it was Louise Woodward
who violently shook 8-month-old Matthew Eappen and slammed his head
against a hard surface. It has been months since the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court affirmed that conviction and sent Matthew
Eappen's British au pair back to England and allowed her to reclaim
her life.
</P>
<P>
   All that time, all those judicial proceedings, all of Louise
Woodward's appeals exhausted and yet, incredibly, it is still
Deborah and Sunil Eappen who remain on trial.
</P>
<P>
   To what end were the airwaves crackling and the presses rolling
this week with new theories about Matthew Eappen's violent death?
To what end was a platform provided to doctors whose hands never
touched his swollen eyes or cradled his fractured skull?
</P>
<P>
   To what end did those doctors proffer their wild speculations
that he was strangled, not shaken, that his injuries might have
been inflicted days, not hours, before an ambulance sped him away
from home for the final time?
</P>
<P>
   There has been little peace for the Eappens since, but is there
to be no peace for their son, ever?
</P>
<P>
   On the television screen, a man with a pointer and a white coat
jabs at an X-ray of their son's brain. Is his to be an autopsy
without end? Is the baby Debbie carried, the boy Sonny cherished,
public property now? Is anyone with a medical credential and a pet
theory invited to take a scalpel to his corpse?
</P>
<P>
   On the airwaves and in the press this week, the medical experts
are offering hypotheses about CAT scans, opinions about tissue
slides and brain injuries. The defense lawyers are ranting about
``new evidence'' and ``reasonable doubt'' and ``a new trial.'' The
celebrity TV interviewer is intoning solemnly about the search for
truth and ``a miscarriage of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking about a mother and father who have lived for
two years as the public's shadow suspects _ those fancy Newton
physicians who left their children with a teenage baby sitter to
indulge their careers. In some eyes, they can never really be
exonerated, no matter what the X-rays show.
</P>
<P>
   All along, they've heard the whispers but they pushed forward.
They had lives still to live, two other children to rear, friends
and family to support them. He began to think it might be getting a
little better. She had days when it was possible to feel normal for
hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But that was last week, when the possibility of resuming a
private life seemed tantalizingly real.
</P>
<P>
   This week, it is deja vu, all over again:
</P>
<P>
   You walk into a room and all conversation stops. Are you
imagining it or is the atmosphere suddenly tense, awkward?
</P>
<P>
   You get in line at the supermarket and the woman in the aisle
beside you peers over the top of her National Enquirer. Don't I
know you?
</P>
<P>
   You take your son on a run down the sledding hill, longing to
feel nothing but the wind in your face and the weight of his body
snuggled beside you. Instead, you feel the eyes of the other
parents and you wonder: What are they thinking? Do they think we're
going too fast?

THE WRONG WAY TO FIGHT A DRUG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug czar Barry McCaffrey talks as if he gets it. This is what
he is saying about the so-called war on drugs:
</P>
<P>
   --``We have a failed social policy and it has to be reevaluated.
Otherwise, we're going to bankrupt ourselves. Because we can't
incarcerate our way out of this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Demand must be the priority. People's desire for drugs is
what sets the drug abuse cycle in motion. . . . If demand reduction
is the primary effort, prevention is the key. Clearly, preventing
drug abuse in the first place is preferable to waiting to address
the problem later with law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   --``We have begun to shift federal spending priorities and
programs . . . Resources for prevention have increased 33 percent
in the past two years while spending for treatment has increased by
the same ratio over the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Prevention is the ultimate key to reversing the upward trend
in the use of drugs and empowering communities to address their
drug problems.''
</P>
<P>
   --``I don't think we're going to arrest our way out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   This sounds as if McCaffrey, director of the White House's
Office of National Drug Control Policy, wants to end the hysteria
that has turned the drug war into Vietnam. It seems that he knows
that the call for more law enforcement is as ineffective as Lyndon
Johnson's orders for more troops. He appears to understand that
prisons are napalm, defoliating African-American men to the point
where 13 percent of them cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey does not yet have the courage to put enlightenment
into action. He is still calling for more troops and more napalm.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCaffrey went to Capitol Hill to detail his $17.8
billion budget for fiscal year 2000. Many studies say prevention
and treatment (not to mention education and jobs) are more
effective in reducing addiction and recidivism than the porous
walls of interdiction or the barbed wires of incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the portion of the budget reserved for prevention and
treatment, $6 billion, is only 34 percent of drug-war spending.
That is exactly the same percentage as in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So much for shifting the priorities. While McCaffrey has
proposed an increase of $210 million for the programs to help
Americans combat drug addiction, he has proposed an increase of
$525 million for domestic and international law enforcement. While
the portion of the budget for prevention has remained stagnant for
a decade, the share for domestic law enforcement, i.e. cops and
incarceration, rose from 41 percent in 1991 to 55 percent in 1996.
The percentage in 2000 would be 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The drug war budget, which has more than quadrupled since 1988,
and always with two-thirds for incarceration and interdiction and
one-third for prevention, has not affected drug use or
availability. A serious drug war should have resulted in limited
supply and steep prices. The prices of both cocaine and heroin have
dropped dramatically over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   While the budget in the drug war for prevention and treatment
would rise by 3.6 percent, the budget for the Bureau of Prisons
would go up 13 percent. The FBI budget would go up 19 percent. The
budget for the US Attorney's office would go up 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the budget for prisons will go up nearly 20 percent from
1988 to 2000, community policing, seen as a more sensitive way to
reduce drug-related crime, will drop by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCaffrey said Monday that the prison budget is
is difficult to control because there has to be a place to put the
people already arrested. The spokesman said McCaffrey wants more
money for prevention, but the need for prisons is so great that it
will take several years to see a change in funding.
</P>
<P>
   This ignores the fact that huge percentages of people
incarcerated are nonviolent, low-level users and dealers. The White
House knows it could dramatically slow the need for prisons by
pushing to end mandatory minimum sentences and discriminatory laws
that serve more to employ prison guards than to stop drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that McCaffrey and the Democratic White House
have had to tailor their policies to suit pro-incarceration
Republicans. But now, McCaffrey's failed budgets and plays to
hysteria are generating high-profile criticism on their own. A
series of statements where he denounced needle exchange and medical
marijuana and badly exaggerated drug crime in Holland sparked a
recent open letter that included signatures from Harvard University
professors Henry Louis Gates Jr., Alvin Poussaint, Orlando
Patterson and William Julius Wilson, and Boston University
professor Glenn Loury.
</P>
<P>
   The letter exhorted McCaffrey to provide facts ``that could help
us deal realistically and effectively with our very real problems
of addiction.'' It will be hard for McCaffrey to hear them when his
primary weapon in the drug war is still napalm.

PIPELINE SAFETY RAISES ALARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVILA BEACH, Calif. _ This used to be Hollywood's idea of a
funky beach town, a sunbaked row of businesses sandwiched between
green hills and endless Pacific surf. The poster from a 1978 movie
filmed here, ``California Dreaming,'' still hangs proudly in the
Custom House restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before a clothing shop owner ``struck oil'' when
she tried to expand a few years ago. Now, bulldozers are
demolishing most of downtown to clean up massive oil contamination
from leaking pipelines that went undetected for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town used to have its own hip atmosphere,'' said a
disgusted Lindsey Olsen, looking at the metal sheeting that
encloses the land where her favorite nightclub once stood. ``Now
look at it. It's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has taken strides in reducing tanker
spills since the Exxon Valdez accident of 10 years ago, the country
has made less progress against other dangerous spills, especially
pipeline leaks. Nearly 8 million gallons of hazardous liquids
escaped US pipelines in 1998, the most since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Though pipeline leaks don't get the attention of tanker
accidents, they are nearly as destructive. Unocal Corp. spilled at
least 8.5 million gallons of petroleum products from pipelines in a
fragile dune area near Avila Beach as well as more than 400,000
gallons that flowed under the village.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
pipeline accidents, has warned for years that many pipelines are
old, poorly maintained, and operated by underqualified people _
sometimes with deadly results. Two teenagers in Lively, Texas, were
killed in 1996 when liquid butane escaped from a corroded pipe,
causing an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Transportation Safety Board chairman, Jim Hall,
complains that the US Department of Transportation office in charge
of regulating the nation's 157,000 miles of pipeline hasn't been
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Office of Pipeline Safety has just had a pretty terrible
track record for a number of years,'' Hall said, adding that the
office adopts significantly fewer Safety Board recommendations than
federal agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration. He
said he'd give the Office of Pipeline Safety ``a big fat F on
everything they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that better regulation would have helped at Avila
Beach, where the leaks began decades ago and where the state
accused Unocal of withholding information about the spill outside
of town. However, Safety Board officials say other spills could be
avoided with tougher regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Hall wants tougher rules to prevent corrosion,
the cause of the Texas explosion as well as a major fuel oil spill
in South Carolina's Reedy River in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also believes lax employee training requirements have
contributed to accidents such as the propane explosion in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, that killed 33 people in 1996. Gas company workers
failed to find the leak despite repeated efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Transportation officials say they agree with the
Safety Board's general concerns, but disagree that their agency
isn't making pipelines safer. They say the Office of Pipeline
Safety adopts far more Safety Board recommendations now than in the
past and that the volume of spills in the 1990s is less than in
previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made tremendous strides in improving pipeline safety,''
said Kelley F. Coyner, administrator of the Research and Special
Programs Administration, which oversees the Office of Pipeline
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   She said the office recently worked with industry, state
regulators, and others to come up with stronger pipeline worker
qualifications, though the Safety Board criticized the proposals as
weak. Also, Coyner said that new rules on leak detection will go
into effect in July and that her agency is experimenting with
education programs to reduce construction accidents.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough for the National Pipeline Reform Coalition, a
group of environmentalists as well as labor unions and business and
government leaders who are pushing for tougher laws and pipeline
safety enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Epstein of the Environmental Defense Fund, a member of the
coalition, told a congressional committee last month that the
Office of Pipeline Safety has not identified environmentally
valuable areas near pipelines, despite a 1992 law to do so. And she
said the agency's fines are so low that it may be cheaper for
pipeline operators to pay rather than prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   At Avila Beach, about to virtually shut down for 18 months for
the oil cleanup, Tony Quale doesn't have to be convinced that
pipelines are dangerous. As the cleanup project rumbled behind him,
he said nostalgically, ``The loudest sound used to be the crashing
of the waves.''

SPRING TRAINING FOR SHARPENING SKILLS, PENCILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; have a new cause: spring training for the professions.
Specifically, for my profession.
</P>
<P>
   As year succeeds to year, it's hard not to cast an envious eye
southward at baseball's Boys of Spring. Luxuriating under the palm
trees, gently tossing the pill in the tropical breeze so as not to
distend any sinews or ligaments; wife and children safely tucked
away in Kalamazoo; chucking rookies' cleats into the swimming pool;
dogging your way through a series of meaningless games, PowerAde in
one hand, Marlboro Light in the other . . . That's the life for me!
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why not for us? We white-collar drones work too. Why
can't we start fresh each spring, sharpen our skills, and ramp up
slowly to the demands of another trying year of bilking the public
(real estate brokers, auto dealers, Microsoft employees), lying
about sex (politicians, psychiatrists), or piping quotes (Globe
columnists)?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great to drop tools in February, head down to
Fort Myers, check into the La Quinta, and reacquaint ourselves with
the basics of our profession? Accountants could do left-brain
exercises, like trying to imagine themselves as vegetables. Doctors
could tune up their penmanship, and maybe crack open some anatomy
texts while languishing poolside. Perhaps refresh their memories as
to where the vertebrae end and the spinal discs begin.
</P>
<P>
   Take someone like Ken Starr. He's been working so hard now, five
years straight, righting the world's wrongs. Don't you think he
needs a couple of weeks in, say, Tempe, Ariz., just to relax, maybe
hang out with other prosecutors, bone up on civil procedure? I
could see Bill Clinton down in Fort Lauderdale, escaping the
missus, finally getting the time to read that fat biography of
Warren Harding, another ``misunderstood'' president. Isn't spring
break coming up? An ideal opportunity for Clinton to mix with the
country's future leaders . . .
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it would work in my profession. The Globe team would
hole up in a motel near Jacksonville, with the other newspapers
encamped elsewhere in the Sunshine State: the Herald at Kissimmee,
the Times at some classy joint like the Fontainebleau in Miami
Beach. Every couple of days we'd invite them over for a scrimmage,
mostly playing the kids just up from the Standard Times and the
Eagle-Tribune. Sure, New York might start Anthony Lewis and William
Safire, and we'd counter with Marty Nolan and Ellen Goodman. But
there would be an understanding that the vets would exit in the
second or third inning and give the rooks a chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   When not scrimmaging, we'd be honing our skills. Dave Barry and
Carl Hiaasen could come over from The Miami Herald and share a few
laughs. Maybe we could bring in some reporters from The Wall Street
Journal to tell us how they keep all those complicated business
facts straight. I'd have The Washington Post people drop by to
explain those double bylines they're so fond of. Two reporters
doing the work of one? I'm sure it's more complicated than that.
</P>
<P>
   But the real goal is to learn. We'd let staff aces like Dan
Shaughnessy and Will McDonough watch the younger scribes and then
offer advice: ``Not bad, kid,'' I'd hear Willie growling. ``But
your stuff could use more leaked depositions.'' Shaughnessy could
teach them how to work in allusions to long-forgotten rock groups,
like Toto. And I'd be happy to help the columnists of tomorrow
answer the kind of tough questions I often hear from fans: ``So,
what do you do the other three days of the week, Mr. Beam?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, spring training wouldn't be all work. It would be
important to eat right and get plenty of sleep in preparation for
the difficult months ahead. And I suppose one might be cajoled into
lifting a jar after a long day in the sunshine, improving one's
skills. Afterward we would all return to Boston, tanned, fit, and
ready to handle anything the world wants to throw at us.
</P>
<P>
   I'll slide this idea into the suggestion box and tell you what
happens.

DEEP PROBLEMS 10 YEARS AFTER EXXON VALDEZ

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND, Alaska _ Captain Joseph Hazelwood's voice
crackled over the radio at the Coast Guard station in the tiny port
of Valdez just after midnight on March 24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fetched up, uh, hard aground, north of Goose Island off
Bligh Reef,'' said the skipper of the Exxon Valdez, who had been
drinking and now struggled to understand what had happened to his
tanker. ``And evidently, uh, leaking some oil.''
</P>
<P>
   With that breathtaking understatement, Hazelwood announced the
worst oil spill in US history. Pierced by the rocks at Bligh Reef,
the Exxon Valdez dumped 10.8 million gallons of thick, crude oil
into the water, creating a slick big enough to reach from Cape Cod
to North Carolina, and killing animals by the tens of thousands as
it spread.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Prince William Sound looks as beautiful as ever
from the air, its glacier-fed blue waters broken only by breaching
whales or sea otters floating lazily on their backs. Painful as the
spill was, life goes on in this vast place, and many animal species
are rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   But the deep scars, and the unfinished business, of the Exxon
Valdez disaster become clearer down on the water, where only two of
the 23 most damaged species have fully recovered and an estimated
40 percent of the fishermen suffer depression over their decimated
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superficially, this looks healthy . . . but you poke around
and you still find oil,'' said National Marine Fisheries Service
biologist Bruce Wright as he picks his way along the cobblestone
beach of Sleepy Bay, where oil piled up 3 feet deep during the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Wright turns over a boulder to reveal the black oil tar,
the toxic ``bathtub ring'' left by the spill. ``I don't know of any
way you could clean this beach up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Prince William Sound isn't the same since the spill, neither
is the rest of America. The grim spectacle of one of North
America's most pristine places turned into an industrial waste site
spawned tough new laws that have made oil spills five times more
costly to companies, and, as a result, less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the US coast bristles with billions of dollars worth of
boats, booms, and other equipment from Portland, Maine, to San
Francisco, awaiting the next big spill, while schools such as the
Massachusetts Maritime Academy train hundreds of mariners in
cleanup strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a recent freighter spill on the Oregon coast
demonstrates, oil spills haven't gone away, and as the horror of
the Exxon Valdez spill fades, some fear cleanup preparedness may
slide, too. Already, the biggest cleanup company has seen its
operating budget cut in half as oil producers and transporters
reduce support, and regulators fear smaller firms could fail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the oil industry grapples with low energy prices,
layoffs, and a wave of consolidations, officials in the spill
cleanup industry have begun warning of hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable that there has to be consolidation in our
industry,'' warns Steve Benz, president of the Virginia-based
Marine Spill Response Corporation, which maintains ships and
equipment around the country to fight a Valdez-scale spill.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, the spill's legacy hangs in the balance as well.
Exxon's $1 billion settlement with the state and federal
governments has protected 650,000 acres of land, made Prince
William Sound the world's most-studied spill site, and afforded a
new aquarium in Seward.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is still contesting the larger $5 billion
punitive damages award to thousands of native villagers, fishermen,
and property owners who were harmed by the spill, leaving many of
them feeling embittered and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had thousands of clients that have gone bankrupt, got
divorced, died, or been down on their financial luck'' while
awaiting a settlement, said Brian O'Neill, the Minneapolis lawyer
who represents 60,000 plaintiffs in the suit against Exxon. ``When
we get the money, if we're disbursing it to estates and divorce
settlements, I'm going to feel like it was a little late.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Alaskans angry at Exxon will have to settle for the
spectacle of Captain Hazelwood picking up trash on Alaska state
lands this summer. Acquitted of criminal drunkenness but convicted
of negligence, Hazelwood must serve 1,000 hours of community
service over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the Exxon Valdez accident seems like a case study
in how to create a disaster. The 987-foot tanker had no tugboat
escort as the crew maneuvered around ice floes, and Hazelwood,
after a day of drinking, had left a lowly third mate in charge of
the bridge. The Coast Guard couldn't even track the ship's progress
because of range limits on its radar.
</P>
<P>
   After the tanker ran aground _ on a clear night on a well marked
reef _ officials at the oil facilities in Valdez took 10 crucial
hours figuring out which emergency response equipment to send to
the spill, allowing the slick to spread unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when a virtual army was deployed to fight the spill _ up
to 10,000 workers, 1,000 boats, and 100 aircraft at a cost of $2.1
billion to Exxon, disorganization, along with potent tides and
winds, repeatedly undermined containment. Ultimately, they
recovered only a fraction of the oil, leaving tides and evaporation
to do most of the work.

 NEW YORK: ... so much power.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I always thought that a critic needed a great palate, stamina,
and good metabolism,'' she said. ``A friend once said, `What you
really need is to be endlessly social.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And she is. ``That part of it I really like.''
</P>
<P>
   Before reviewing took over her life and abolished the nightly
dinner hour, she and her then-husband, Doug (she has since
remarried), were part of a group house in Berkeley. The place, as
she describes it in her book, was always filled with friends, most
of them hippies willing to go along with a housemate's latest
ecological phase.
</P>
<P>
   When she became a reviewer, said Reichl, she had to move the
party out of her home. ``I just transferred it to restaurants. Now
I'll transfer it back. What really makes me happy is to have people
around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, she and her husband bought a house in the country and
now she has a Wolf range. ``The house has a really good kitchen.
There are wonderful days when I cook and write. I bake or make a
big stew. My big pleasure is just cooking, and now I'll get to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Conde Nast approached Reichl, she had no idea what went on
at Gourmet, or if, in fact, there was any talent on board. The
pages lack vitality and many think its subscribers are mostly
octogenarians.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl shows off her new allegiance. ``It's the most loyal
readership of any magazine ever. I want to keep them,'' she says _
and add others.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast publisher Si Newhouse called Reichl when the
appointment was made public. ``Will you go over and knead the
staff?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   So she called a meeting. ``I love meetings.'' When she was food
editor of the Los Angeles Times, the staff met all the time. ``We
wrote captions together,'' she said, ``and headlines. You can do a
lot in a 10-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Would this happen at Gourmet? ``There I was. These people were
worried about their careers. I was fully prepared to talk to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What she found, she said, was a roomful of willing people, ``an
amazing resource, a staff that was eager and full of ideas.' As it
turned out, they were attending their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl says she plans to bring new writers to the pages of
Gourmet. Her own issues won't begin until September and she has
already contacted a few friends. An early phone call went to
humorist Calvin Trillin.
</P>
<P>
   Did he want to travel somewhere and write for her, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Bud. Isn't there somewhere you want to go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay,'' he answered. ``To the pimento festival in Spain. I've
always longed to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just what she wanted to hear. ``I want travel to be like
that. We have the expertise to add the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   To her amazement, she learned that the staff traveled as a group
once a year to an exotic location and that every editor got to
attend cooking school wherever in the world she wanted. ``Does the
magazine reflect this?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   And the testers. ``It's a dream job. I want to take that kitchen
and give it a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be eight kitchens in the new Gourmet offices at 4
Times Square, which will house all the Conde Nast publications. The
magazines will move in gradually over the course of next summer.
Gourmet's editor in chief will have a private office. It was to
have a sofa and coffee table, and a private bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed to use a toilet that's just mine,'' says the
populist reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the designer to take out the sofa and put in a big
table and six chairs. I want meetings every morning. That way we'll
get a magazine that has its look. I want to be able to open the
magazine and say `This is Gourmet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By then, someone else will own the wigs, though not her
successor, William Grimes, a reporter in the Times's Dining
section. Reichl says she had visions of throwing a party and
tossing out the wigs like bouquets. ``Whoever caught the most would
get the job.''
</P>
<P>
   She checks her watch. The staff at Gourmet is waiting for her.
On the way over, she'll call her office at the Times for messages
and it's unclear whether she'll do this from the back of a taxicab
or right on the street. She grabs the ubiquitious black bag carried
by every well-dressed New York woman, straightens out the jacket of
her expensive black suit, and dashes away.
</P>
<P>
   For today a platinum blonde with arched eyebrows, sunglasses,
and big scarlet lips, she looks like Tracey Ullman doing the Upper
East Side. There are so many women who fit the description, it's
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Even after sharing a meal, it's not easy to tell what Reichl
really looks like.
</P>
<P>
   (It wasn't very good.)

 UNDATED: ... hence, profits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike his father, who trades mostly large-cap stocks like Dell,
Home Depot, and Staples, Bruce buys and sells ``just about anything
that moves'' _ except, curiously, Internet issues. Day in, day out,
he tracks tiny shifts in the flow of orders for hundreds of stocks,
and then buys or sells seconds ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   For all the detail and precision of his work, it is a foggy
experience.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his father, who can rattle off his worst bets
(Informix, Compaq, and AMD are among them), and who knows the
companies he buys, the younger Pelletier struggles to list his hits
and misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a blur _ you don't actually remember the particular
wins and losses,'' says Bruce, who has two children but has not
used his trading profits to set up long-term investments, like
college education funds. ``Sometimes, I can't even remember what a
particular company does,'' he says. All he knows, he adds, is that
he makes around $1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his son, Tony Pelletier buys puts and calls _ fancy
options to buy and sell stocks at a later date for locked-in
prices. He also uses ``stop-loss'' orders to automatically sell
issues that fall more than 7 percent. Since he started trading on
line eight months ago, his strategy has helped him earn a 15
percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had the guts to do an E-Bay yet,'' he says,
referring to the high-flying on-line auction house, ``but I'll
probably try it through options.''
</P>
<P>
   To Michael Gazala, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., Tony Pelletier reflects one of on-line
investing's more interesting trends: the growing willingness of
older, wealthy investors not reared on computers to trade via the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester, 10 percent of all affluent households,
or those with at least $1 million to invest, traded with an
on-line-only brokerage last year, double 1997's level. And nearly
half of affluent households did some form of on-line trading in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston-based Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual fund firm,
on-line accounts grew 19 percent last year to 2 million. Fidelity
now accounts for nearly 10 percent of all on-line brokerage trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just play money and it's not just the young,'' Gazala
says. ``It's also serious people with serious money. And it's
definitely more than a fad.''
</P>
<P>
   That has old-line money managers quaking in their wingtips.
While full-service Wall Street giants like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
nation's largest brokerage, are inching toward offering on-line
investing services, the old guard has been shocked by the power of
much smaller, Web-only firms like Waterhouse and Ameritrade to
transfer the broker's expertise to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   As on-line brokerages rush to modernize their computer systems
and consider offering advice and planning services, their
established counterparts are rethinking the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely the demise of the traditional stock broker
and his traditional role,'' says Julio Gomez, head of the
Concord-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for that shift abounds.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown &AMP; Co., a small discount brokerage in downtown Boston,
business has flowered since company chief executive George Brown
launched Web-based investing services last March. Brown, who calls
on-line investing ``a socially acceptable form of gambling,''
expects firm revenues to rise 20 percent this year, the same as in
1998. His client base, now at 80,000 active trading customers, will
probably grow 10 percent, as demand for on-line accounts soars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new generation of people out there who want to
do things for themselves,'' says Brown, whose $5 fee for trading
5,000 shares is among the lowest in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits that on-line trading has changed the calculus of
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have money to lose,'' the no-nonsense Brown says
flatly, ``you shouldn't be in this business.''

A HIGH-TECH SOS IS HEEDED FROM AFAR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes two visa/foreign worker text tables.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Di Zhao and Anisha Mahajan are software programmers at
two Greater Boston companies. They earn annual salaries of between
$50,000 and $70,000 each, comparable to the pay of their American
colleagues. Neither is an American citizen, and neither is
considered an immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both are classified as ``temporary workers,'' part of
the growing influx of foreigners with prized technical skills
recruited by US companies. Zhao arrived from China and Mahajan from
India last year under a temporary visa program for skilled
professionals. Known as H-1B, for the section of federal
immigration law, the visa allows foreigners with highly specialized
knowledge to work up to six years in the United States, provided
their employers can demonstrate an inability to find American
workers to do the same jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The tight US job market has touched off an international
scramble among high-tech employers for skilled professionals. Both
Zhao's and Mahajan's employers are among hundreds of US companies
that insist they have difficulty finding critical talent on US
shores. Employers have flocked to the H-1B program, in the process
fanning controversy over whether the high-priced, highly-skilled
foreigners are displacing American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor and engineering groups, including the AFL-CIO,
claim that high-tech firms exaggerate the worker shortage problem
and that employers hire foreigners merely to save on wages.
``Importing'' foreign professionals, they argue, undermines the
American work force.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhao and Mahajan don't see it that way, pointing out how
they are taking jobs at prevailing wages that Americans have either
turned down or simply were not qualified for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see what I do as saving (American) jobs,'' said Zhao, a
25-year-old programmer at Primeon Inc. of Burlington, which helps
businesses solve their year 2000 computer problems. ``I am here
helping to prevent possible disasters at these companies.''
Similarly, Mahajan, who works for Westford-based Intersoft
Technologies Inc. developing telecommunications software, sees her
programming job as helping the US economy.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble for foreign talent has been so intense that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, after using up its yearly
allotment of 65,000 H-1B visas in just 7 1/2 months last year,
stopped issuing them for 4 1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   In response, big employers like Microsoft Corp., Texas
Instruments Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. asked Congress to change
the law. After much debate, H-1B visa laws were modified last fall
to boost the allotment of such visas to 115,000 for this year and
another 115,000 for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But now, there are indications that the higher maximum will be
used up well before Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. As of
Jan. 31, more than 70,000 H-1B visas have been approved, prompting
the Information Technology Association of America to predict the
new, higher quota could be exhausted by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we were stunned when the cap on H-1B visas was
reached in May and now we are equally concerned that the cap may be
reached by midyear,'' said Dyann DelVeccchio, an immigration
attorney at Palmer &AMP; Dodge in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Her clients include Parametric Technology Corp. of Waltham,
which hired 125 foreign hardware engineers and software programmers
in the past 12 months under H-1B.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric, which was formed by Russian emigres, has a high
concentration of Russian engineers and programmers like Dmitri
Fomin, who works in the engineering software company's core
geometry group.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 70 percent of the people I work with are Russian.
Russia, India and China have so many bright programmers and
mathematicans,'' said Fomin, who taught mathematics in Russia at
his alma mater, St. Petersburg State University. He joined
Parametric two years ago on an H-1B visa to work on new versions of
the company's flagship software for computer-aided engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Any limitation on H-1B visas worries Fred Wang, cofounder and
chief technology officer of Primeon, where Zhao has been working as
a programmer since October.
</P>
<P>
   The company is uniquely linked to China through the H-1B
program. Twenty-four (five women and 19 men) of its 70 employees
are from China, many of them from Tsinghua University in Bejing,
considered the MIT of China. Wang still hopes to add up to 10 more
programmers from China.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first people Wang recruited 18 months ago was Robert
Ying, a well-regarded professor of computer graphics at Tsinghua
who is now Primeon's chief software architect. Since Ying and Wang
keep in touch via the Internet with a close knit circle of friends
and graduates from Tsinghua and four other universities in China,
finding software engineers was not too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to find US citizens for a service-oriented
business. The best and smartest engineers all find employment
developing computer networking products or want to work on the
latest frontiers of technology,'' said Wang, who left China in 1986
to earn a doctorate in computer science at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. ``We work with mainframes, where the
software is sometimes very old, where we have to know more than 20
different application development languages.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Lixia Zheng and her husband Dongchen Wang, both Tsinghua
classmates with Fred Wang, knowing some of those arcane software
development languages helped them land jobs at Primeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the challenges of learning a new computer language and
figuring out problems,'' said Zheng, 39, who earned a master's
degree in computer science from the University of Oklahoma and
worked in Germany before coming to Primeon on an H-1B visa.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger colleague, Zhao, however, acknowledges an itch for
more interesting work. ``There are many brilliant people here, but
some of the programming work is a little boring,'' he said of
Primeon. ``I want to create something and I think they (Primeon)
will give me the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Under H-1B regulations, employers can bring in temporary foreign
professionals for up to six years at prevailing US wages set by the
Department of Labor. However, employers must show they are not
replacing US workers with H-1B visa holders and that the foreign
workers have the education and skills to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   To allay concerns about foreign workers taking jobs from
Americans, the new H-1B laws require employers to pay $500 for each
visa. The funds _ estimated to reach $250 million in three years _
are for federal job training programs for American workers and
college scholarships for low-income students in engineering,
computer science, math and science.

CHIUCHOW GARDEN'S CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Ken Hom's ``Fragrant Harbor Taste'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1989). The cubed chicken is moist and extremely
flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds chicken thighs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon rice wine or rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>

   2 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarsely ground black and Szechuan peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   2 scallions, minced
</P>
<P>
   Remove the skin from the thighs, and bone by cutting on one side
of the bone with a sharp knife and scraping off the meat on the
other. You should have about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of meat after
boning. Cut the meat into bite-size 1-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the soy sauce, rice wine, salt, sugar, and cornstarch,
and mix in the chicken pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a wok until it is quite hot. Add the chicken
mixture and stir-fry over high heat for about 5 minutes. Add the
peppercorns and continue to cook for 2 more minutes or until the
chicken is completely cooked. Place the chicken on a platter,
sprinkle with the scallions, and serve at once.

TURKEY RABBIT
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Marcella Hazan, whose recipe for stewed rabbit
in ``The Classic Italian Cookbook'' (Knopf, 1978) inspired this
dish. The turkey cooks down to savory shreds, and the sauce is
perfect over cheesy mashed potatoes or rice.
</P>
<P>
   3 to 3 1/2 pounds turkey thighs, skinned and trimmed of excess
fat
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely diced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons rosemary
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, 6 to 8 twists of mill
</P>
<P>
   1 bouillon cube
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato paste plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar, or 2 to 3
tablespoons ketchup
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the thighs in cold running water and pat thoroughly dry
with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a deep, covered skillet large enough to contain the
thighs in a single layer. Put in the oil, celery, garlic, and
turkey, and cook over low heat for 2 hours, until the meat is very
tender. Turn the meat once or twice but keep the cover on.
</P>
<P>
   After cooking for 2 hours, the meat throws off a great deal of
liquid. Uncover the pan, turn up the heat to medium, and cook,
turning the meat from time to time. When the liquid has evaporated,
add the wine, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, until
the wine has evaporated. Dissolve the bouillon cube and
tomato-paste mixture or ketchup in 2/3 cup warm water, pour it over
the turkey, and cook gently for another 8 to 10 minutes, turning
and basting the turkey 2 or 3 times. Serve immediately or reheat
gently before serving.

CHICKEN WITH 40 CLOVES OF GARLIC
</P>
<P>
   An old favorite that anticipated the current craze for roasted
garlic, from ``The New James Beard'' (Knopf, 1981).
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   8 whole chicken legs, cut into drumsticks and thighs, excess fat
removed
</P>
<P>
   4 ribs celery, cut into long strips
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry vermouth or white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   40 garlic cloves, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   Put the oil in a shallow dish, add the chicken pieces, and turn
them to coat evenly with the oil. Cover the bottom of a heavy
6-quart casserole with a mixture of the celery and onion, add the
parsley and tarragon, and lay the chicken pieces on top. Pour the
vermouth over them, sprinkle with the salt, pepper, and a dash or
two of nutmeg, and tuck the garlic cloves around the chicken
pieces. Cover the top of the casserole tightly with aluminum foil
and then the lid (this creates an airtight seal so the steam does
not escape). Bake in a 375-degree oven for 1 1/2 hours, without
removing the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the chicken, pan juices, and whole garlic cloves with thin
slices of heated French bread or hot toast. The garlic should be
squeezed from the root end of its papery husk onto the bread or
toast, spread like butter, and eaten with the chicken.

OREGANO CHICKEN BAKED WITH POTATOES AND TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   (POLLO IN FORNO)
</P>
<P>
   An immensely satisfying dish from Giuliano Bugialli's ``Classic
Techniques of Italian Cooking'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1982).
</P>
<P>
   3 to 3 1/2 pounds small chicken thighs and drumsticks
</P>
<P>
   1 pound potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh tomatoes, ripe but not overripe
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   Clean and wash the chicken carefully. Peel the potatoes and cut
them into thick slices. Put the slices in a bowl of cold water
until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze the lemon and reserve the juice. Cut the tomatoes
horizontally into slices less than 1/2 inch thick. Remove the
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil a 13-by-8 3/4-inch Pyrex baking dish. Preheat the
oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Layer the potatoes over the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the
potato slices with salt and pepper, then pour the lemon juice over
them. Make a layer of chicken pieces over the potatoes. Put a
tomato slice over each piece of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Finely chop the garlic. Pour the oil into a small bowl, then add
the garlic, red pepper flakes, oregano, and salt to taste. Mix well
with a wooden spoon. Pour the sauce over the tomato layer in the
baking dish. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 50 minutes to
an hour.
</P>

<P>
   Bringing in a foreign professional can cost an employer as much
as $20,000 per person. That includes immigration attorney fees,
H-1B application costs, air fare and living arrangements until the
worker is settled in, said Rajan Zambre, founder of InterSoft. His
firm specializes in finding software workers from India and placing
them at Massachusetts-based telecommunications companies and at his
own company, which also does software projects.
</P>
<P>
   India, with its abundance of technical talent, has been by far
the biggest source of professional workers under the H-1B program.
Nearly half of all H-1B visas approved last year were from India.
</P>
<P>
   ``In India, young computer software engineers can earn $1,000
per month at companies like Texas Instruments, but their growth
path is limited compared to coming here and working on the latest
technologies and earning more than $50,000 a year,'' said Zambre,
who recruited Anisha Mahajan and her husband Prithviraj Banerjee
</P>
<P>
   Having spent 14 years at Digital Equipment Corp. followed by a
year at Stratus Computer Corp. before starting his own company,
Zambre has hired more than 60 programmers from India on H-1B visas
in the last two years, and expects to recruit more than 70
programmers from India this year. Last week Zambre said he made
offers to programmers in China, Hong Kong and Korea, although 80
percent of his recruits are from India.
</P>
<P>
   Zambre's search usually begins with computer science graduates
from the Indian Institutes of Technology in Kanpur and Madras. Most
have worked for Indian companies or US firms doing business in
India, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Texas Instruments Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as many as 30 percent _ more than 500 graduates of
the Indian Institutes of Technology went to the United States to
pursue either jobs or graduate degrees, according to published
reports. In recent years, the emigration has been so great that the
Indian government has raised concerns about a national brain drain.
</P>
<P>
   For Zambre, bringing a young Indian programmer to Massachusetts
means providing the works. He houses them temporarily at one of two
homes he rents in Acton and Lowell. He also supplies food and
provides them with an automobile during the transition. He helps
them get their Massachusetts driver's licenses and has an English
tutor on call to help them understand American accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't treat them well, there are 10 other companies that
will offer them jobs,'' said Zambre.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian programmers often stick together, dining at Indian
restaurants and sometimes socializing at a Hindu temple in Ashland.
Zambre also encourages them to continue their education at Boston
area colleges and universities, paying 75 percent of their tuition.
</P>
<P>
   He expects most of his young hires to return to India in three
to six years to take care of their parents and younger siblings,
although several recent arrivals say they want to stay in the
United States for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zambre even offers his recruits cultural survival tips, such
advice to avoid ironing shirts in the kitchen while they are
cooking curry.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 60 Indians he has brought in on H-1B visas,
Zambre claims only two were sent back because they did not work
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two presented skills in certain areas but when they
began working here, it was clear they could not demonstrate
competency,'' he added, noting he paid for their return to India.

THE THIGHS HAVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DEBORAH P. JACOBS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the world can be divided between the night owls and the early
risers, those who rush to the phone when it rings and those who
screen every call via answering machine, those who read the last
page of a novel first and those who won't even look at the jacket
copy for fear of spoiling the ending, surely there is a line
between those who like their poultry lean and white and those who
lust after the juicy dark meat.
</P>
<P>
   These two tastes are so distinct that it's sometimes hard to
believe they come from the same bird: the delicate breast meat that
depends almost wholly on a sauce or seasonings for character, and
the ripe, slightly gamy flavor of the thigh. Though one usually
associates the White Meat Only school with children, a surprising
number of otherwise reasonable adults also turn up their noses at
the nether parts of a chicken or turkey.
</P>
<P>
   This preference is surprising when you consider the differing
levels of labor involved in preparation. Without constant
surveillance by the chef, a chicken breast can quickly cross the
line from moist to inedibly woody, while the thighs only improve
with longer cooking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, thighs lend themselves to a greater range of cooking
styles, yielding equally delicious results with slow braising,
high-temperature roasting, and stir-frying. They provide a huge
chunk of protein at a low price, and if skinned and trimmed of
excess fat, they can meet the standards of those concerned about
fat and calories. The thigh also presents a compact, easy-to-handle
package, much quicker to prepare than a whole chicken, for example,
and simpler to convert into leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   In the following recipes, which require a minimum of effort and
ingredients, the thighs form the succulent center of an enticing
whole. A mouthwatering Indian dish, a magically easy French confit,
an Italian stew with wine and rosemary _ they all prove that the
thighs have it.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
TURKEY CONFIT
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a Sunset magazine recipe from the mid-1970s. The
succulent meat goes beautifully with potatoes and a nutty green
such as broccoli or kale.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cracked bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 pounds whole turkey thighs (unskinned)
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Combine the salt, bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme. Rub the
mixture all over the meat. Place the meat in a heavy plastic bag or
a glass or stainless steel container. Cover and refrigerate for 12
to 24 hours (for lightest salt flavor, let it chill the minimum
time).
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly rinse the meat under cold running water, rubbing
lightly to extract as much salt as possible. Drain the meat, then
pat dry. (At this stage, the meat can be covered and chilled for
another day. Just rinse and dry again before cooking.)
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy 12-inch frying pan or 5- to 6-quart kettle (choose
one with a tight-fitting lid) over medium-low heat, arrange the
thighs so they are as flat as possible. Cover and cook slowly until
the meat is very tender when pierced and is richly browned, about 2
1/2 hours. Turn occasionally to equalize the cooking. As the fat
cooks out of the meat and the meat begins to brown, you will hear
it sizzling. From this point, check the meat frequently and turn
more often for even browning.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the meat from the pan, drain briefly, and remove and
discard the skin. Arrange on a large serving platter and keep warm.
Pour off the fat in a pan and discard. Add the garlic to the pan.
Cook, stirring, over medium heat until the garlic is soft. Add the
water to the pan and bring to a boil; stir to free any browned
particles. Blend in the parsley and serve this sauce spooned onto
the meat, or from a small bowl to add to individual portions.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 7 or 8.

CHICKEN WITH SUMAC
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from Mary Laird Hamady's ``Lebanese Mountain
Cookery'' (David R. Godine, 1987) is exquisite in its simplicity
and combination of flavors. The pita bread soaks up the juices from
the chicken, and the ground sumac imparts a deep tang that
contrasts nicely with the rich meat. Sumac can be found in health
food stores and Middle Eastern groceries.
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 rounds pita bread

<P>
   1 tablespoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper

   1 tablespoon ground turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 to 3 teaspoons salt or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 garlic cloves, peeled and mashed to a pulp

<P>
   3 1/2 pounds chicken thighs, skinned and trimmed of excess fat
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cumin, paprika, cayenne, turmeric, black pepper,
salt, garlic, and lemon juice in a bowl. Mix well. Rub this mixture
over the thighs, pushing the paste inside any flaps and openings
that you find. Spread the thighs in a shallow baking pan and set
aside in a cool place for 3 hours. (Longer will not hurt. Just
cover the chicken with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth Reichl slips into a corner seat, eluding yet
another commanding maitre d' with one of her trademark disguises.
The restaurant critic for The New York Times has just dropped her
son off at school and is on her way to meetings at Gourmet
magazine, where she will take over as editor in chief at the end of
April. In the afternoon, she'll pick up her son, then end the day
in a restaurant. Tomorrow or the next day she'll file one of her
last reviews for the Times.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this double life, which she finds exhausting,
she'll travel to several cities on a book tour for ``Tender at the
Bone'' (Broadway Books), her memoir that was just released in
paperback. Tomorrow night, Reichl will read from the book _ in
disguise, of course _ at the Brookline Booksmith.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl (pronounced RYE-shul), 51, surprised colleagues in
January with the announcement that she would leave the Times after
5 1/2 years to revamp sleepy Gourmet magazine. Considered one of
the most influential voices in the food world, Reichl writes
reviews that are read as much for lively cultural commentary as for
her dissection of restaurant pretentions. She admits she hardly
glanced at Gourmet when it came across her desk. ``I had to go back
and read old issues,'' she says of the Conde Nast publication,
which has a subscription of 760,000 and newsstand sales of 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   While some restaurateurs find Reichl too critical (this goes
with the territory), others say that she elevated the art of
reviewing with stylish writing and refreshing frankness. Amusing
reports on what happened during her visits invariably include
snippets of overheard conversation _ some of it absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Her most celebrated review occurred early: After poor treatment
(in disguise) at Le Cirque, a temple of cuisine, Reichl returned
looking like herself. ``The King of Spain is waiting at the bar,''
owner Sirio Maccioni told her, ``but your table is ready.'' In the
star-rating system of restaurant reviews, this discrepancy cost Le
Cirque one precious star.
</P>
<P>
   A staff who caters only to the rich will pay a price. ``My
particular bent is that restaurants aren't for the 1 percent who
can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend calls it my misguided populism.''
</P>
<P>
   That populism was honed in Ann Arbor, where she attended the
University of Michigan, and polished in Berkeley, Calif., where she
worked in a restaurant for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl stumbled into reviewing 20 years ago, long before the
nation's interest in food peaked. She worked at New West magazine,
which later became California magazine. After handing in her first
review, an editor told her, ``You were born to do this,'' she
recalls in ``Tender at the Bone.'' From there, she moved to the Los
Angeles Times, where she began as critic and eventually became the
food editor, too.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she arrived in New York in 1993, ``restaurants had
become the icon of the '90s,'' she said. Now, she adds, ``they're
part of the natural conversation because the culture demanded it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her job, in a way, was to entertain. ``Reviews are an odd
combination of service journalism and fantasy journalism,'' she
said. In the same way that readers examine reviews of plays and
films they might never see, they also read about food they'll never
eat. ``People get to have little visits to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't even mind know-it-alls _ the people who study
restaurants and then make sure everyone knows their views. ``It's
much more fun dealing with an educated public,'' she said, ``than
dealing with a stupid public.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reichl began using disguises as a way to remain anonymous in a
city where critics' photographs hang in restaurant kitchens. She
owns many wigs and pairs of glasses, which she combines for a
variety of looks, from sleek to heavy, chic to frumpy. ``They took
on a life of their own,'' she said. ``I was late this morning,''
she said, holding out plain hands. ``I usually do nails.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem cumbersome to eat when tucked into a costume, but
the critic has made much about the disguises, talking about them on
radio interviews when her book was first published. Yet one diner
who has eaten with Reichl several times contends he has never seen
her in disguise. Reichl says she goes out in disguise about half
the time: ``There's a limit to how long you can stand to be done up
all day. Every restaurant I go to I try to do both to see what kind
of a difference there is. Usually if I go out to a restaurant in
disguise at lunch, I don't (do so at) dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   She also distances herself from the restaurant owners. She
eliminates any difficult conversations with them after her visits
by not talking to anyone at the restaurant. She hired an assistant
to call for details about hours and to book reservations because
New York restaurants-of-the-moment fill early. ``It can take hours
on the phone because they keep you on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no problem filling the table. Her eaters include
``starving artists, friends whose children have already left home,
and childless friends who are always thrilled to have a free
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first began at the Times, she thought it was a plum
assignment. She was dutiful about reporting to work in the Dining
section. ``The first three years I went in all day every day. `This
is such a princess job,' I told myself, `it really behooves you to
show up.' '' She would work until 5 p.m., go home for an hour or so
to see her son, and then go out again. Now she picks him up from
school every day. ``But we don't have family dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   The job, she said, is ``very high pressure. You think, what's so
high pressure about it? But people read these things with such
intensity. You have so much power.

DIABETES, OTHER FACTORS MAY TAME SEX DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LOUANNE COLE WESTON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: I've been married four years. For some reason I don't
want sex.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine until I went on the pill about one month
before we got married. I noticed an immediate lack of desire but
hoped that it was due to the stress of planning our wedding. But it
never got better.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my husband could (and still can) arouse me to
climax, it has been more work than pleasure. I noticed a
lubrication problem as well, so after six months I quit taking the
pill. I hoped that things would eventually return to normal, but
they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   It's now taking a toll on our marriage since we have sex less
and less frequently. My husband's become closed off emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   Can the pill cause hormone fluctuations that don't easily
correct themselves? I've tested negatively for thyroid dysfunction.
I've heard that the pill can cause low testosterone levels in women
which, in turn, can cause decreased sex drive. My doctor says she's
never tested any women for low testosterone levels. She was
supposed to get back to me but has not.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, this isn't getting any better. The less we have
sex, the more closed off my husband is, the less I want sex. It's
extremely frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Your situation requires some detective work to sort out
the possible cause(s) of your decreased sexual desire. The areas to
consider are: your hormonal levels, your general health and your
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not already had a thorough physical exam, do so. It
may uncover a condition that would be antagonistic to your sexual
drive. For example, some women experience sexual difficulty with
the onset or full occurrence of diabetes. Decreased lubrication can
be a symptom.
</P>
<P>
   Your physician's reluctance to assess your testosterone level is
unfortunate, but common. This hesitance is based on several
concerns. Physicians are very concerned about masculinization when
it comes to women and testosterone. Rather than carefully monitor
female patients, many physicians choose to avoid the area all
together. Some are not well informed about the normal range of
adult female testosterone levels (20 to 90 nanograms per deciliter
of blood) and unnecessarily worry if a woman's blood level goes to
30.
</P>
<P>
   Though many people acknowledge the connection between sexual
drive and testosterone levels for women, there are those who would
prefer to view female sexual arousal problems as strictly a mental
problem. It's unfortunate that our culture has so rapidly embraced
physiological approaches to enhance male sexual functioning (Viagra
for instance), but drags its feet when it comes to research and
patient access to solutions for females with low sexual drive.
</P>
<P>
   Also unfortunately, the birth control pill formulas that cause
the fewest side effects (such as headaches, irritability, weight
gain) also tend to suppress libido. The good news for you is that
usually when birth control pills are discontinued, women's hormonal
levels tend to resume the pre-pill taking levels in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   That's where we have to take a look at your relationship. When
something physically undermines a person's libido (which the birth
control pill may have done to you), people sometimes also make
mental adjustments in their sexuality to accommodate the physical
change. They may perceive themselves differently.
</P>
<P>
   You may have sown some seeds of sexual disharmony in your
relationship while on the birth control pill that persisted even
after you stopped taking it. Your husband may also have contributed
in some ways to the sexual shutdown that sprang up between you. In
other words, a collection of factors may have influenced you
somewhat simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Get your physical exam, re-ask your physician (or another one)
about a blood test for your testosterone, and consider couples
counseling with your husband before your relationship grows any
further apart. Even in just four years, couples can settle into a
familiarity that is undermining to their mutual sexual enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Explore this before you form any long-lasting conclusions about
your relationship.

years. And it has called into question a practice at the very heart
of the bureau's operations _ its use of ``confidential informants''
to fight organized crime. The case centers on accusations that
Boston FBI agents protected James Bulger and Stephan Flemmi while
they committed assorted crimes for decades because the two also
provided valuable information about their Italian mobster rivals.

NOTARO: NAKED ISN'T GYM DANDY BY ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was my first day at the gym. Eager to start a new
habit that would shrink my butt from a couch to a love seat, I was
going to begin exercising. I had just opened my locker and slapped
on the new lock I had bought at Target the day before when it
happened.
</P>
<P>
   She walked by me, then headed toward a bench across the aisle.
Standing in front of me was a naked lady, fresh from the shower.
</P>
<P>
   A completely naked lady.
</P>
<P>
   With no clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even know what my first instinct was. I don't think I
had one. All I knew was that a naked lady was standing in front of
me, and I was staring at her being naked.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I just couldn't believe it. I had never really seen a
naked lady before, except for one time when I was 5 and my mom let
our hippie neighbor, Honey, take me shopping with her and her
5-year old daughter. Honey took both of us into the dressing room
with her, and before I knew what was happening, there was Honey's
left ``lentil'' (a scientific term my mother called our
not-yet-developed bosoms) just hanging there, wide out in the open.
I looked at Honey's daughter, who didn't seem too bothered by it,
but personally, I was horrified. I was 5 AND I was a Catholic. The
whole thing was just DIRTY. I felt as if I had just witnessed
something unholy and shameful, and I never told anyone that filthy
secret, not even at confession, until just now. I'm sorry that I
kept this from you, Mom, but it's true. I saw Honey's lentil.
</P>
<P>
   I felt dirty then, and I felt dirty now. It was happening all
over, but not only were there lentils, there were things my mother
never taught me the names of, but then again, I was a little
sheltered. Until I was a junior in high school, I believed my mom
when she told me that the Kotex pads under the bathroom sink were
special sponges she used to clean the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The naked lady, now bending over to dry her legs off, was
showing me a whole other view, like her marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just what is going on here?'' is what I wanted to say to the
naked lady, because I didn't know this woman. I had no business
seeing her NAKED, especially since there was a bathroom stall
several feet away. I had no right, and furthermore, I had no idea
when I paid for my gym membership that I had also joined a nudist
colony.
</P>
<P>
   Who could be that free? I thought. Who could be that free that
they could just strut around ``in all candor'' in front of other
people? Who has that much self-esteem that they could bare it all
and not burst into tears? I mean, I have trouble walking from the
bath mat to the shower without any clothes on, let alone put on a
show for a bunch of strangers. My bra doesn't come off until the
sun goes down, and that's the law. I feel perverted if my dog
catches a glimpse of me in all my glory, let alone someone I've
never even met. When I have to go to the gynecologist, I have to
practice sitting on the edge of my bed with no pants on for a week
before my appointment, just to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the naked lady had no such problems. I didn't know
what to do, so I got my stuff together, took the new lock off the
locker and left. I went home and called my mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a streaker?'' my mother said from the other end of the
phone. ``That is just disgusting. And there was a bathroom stall 5
feet away? Some people are raised like animals, barnyard animals!
They never heard of Sodom and Gomorrah?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I said, shaking my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your sister and I joined that gym last year,'' she
continued, ``there were so many of them walking around that I just
had to stop going. It's like a topless bar! I felt like I should be
handing out dollar bills! `Here's one for you, here's one for you.'
The last thing I need is to see strangers' lentils! How do I tell
that to a priest? You should just stay home and run in place like I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then my sister got on the phone. ``Once, when I was in the
locker room, I met a friend of mine that owed me money for a lunch,
and she wrote me a check right then and there. Completely naked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you do?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cashed the check and bought a tae bo video tape,'' my sister
replied. ``And I run in place when no one else is home. I can't go
to the gym anymore. There's so many naked people around that I feel
like I'm in a porno movie. And for my friend, well . . . I can't
eat lunch with someone like that. She can be wearing seven sweaters
and a parka, but she'll always be naked to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When my husband came home from work that night, he asked me
about my first day at the gym, but I told him how the naked lady
scared me so badly I had to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought she was dirty, didn't you?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I answered. ``Yes, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He just shrugged his shoulders and said, ``So? It's a gym,
Laurie. People have to take showers. And you're kind of . . .
repressed. I can't believe you've never seen a naked lady before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I started, ``it's not like all of us girls go into the
Gap dressing room, take off our clothes and chase and tickle each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about your family?'' he suggested. ``You never saw any of
them naked?''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped, sucking in a breath so hard it nearly knocked me
backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful people,'' I said slowly. ``We don't believe
in naked! It's not natural.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very normal to be naked in the locker room,'' my husband
said, trying to calm me. ``If you go back, you're probably going to
see more naked people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah? Well, I'm not playing naked games with them,'' I
answered. ``And I'm not wiping off anybody's back!''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, I got up enough courage to go back to
the gym. I was getting ready to put my new lock on my locker when I
heard an elderly, grandmotherly voice call out to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear,'' the voice said gently. ``Young lady? Could you please
help me? I've dropped my comb, and I can't seem to reach it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure,'' I said, noticing the comb on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   I picked it up and started to hand it to her, and as I looked up
into her sweet little grandmother face, I saw that the only thing
she was wearing was a smile. &QL;

SMALLER COMPANIES SEEN AS VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three years, three upgrades, $250,000 and
numerous glitches later, Michael King said he almost has his small
business' year 2000 computer glitch problems licked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as tough as I feared,'' said King, chief financial
officer at Peking Handicrafts Inc., a South San Francisco company
that sells bedding and linens to major retailers. ``No matter how
much you plan and prepare and test, things happen that you don't
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who still has a few bugs to work out before he can close
the Y2K chapter at his company, is glad he started early.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the money to address this problem, and you
haven't started working on it by now, for a lot of companies it may
be too late,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch _ known variously as the millennium bug, Year 2000 or
Y2K problem _ stems from fears that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines might assume
it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses tend to have less money, information and time
than large corporations to tackle the computer glitch. Now, with
less than 10 months to go, efforts have increased to make sure the
country's estimated 12 million small enterprises are up to speed
when the clock strikes midnight Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved and the House is considering legislation
that would guarantee $500 million in loans to cover compliance
costs for small businesses. And from March 29 to April 1, the U.S.
Small Business Administration (SBA) will conduct a Y2K awareness
campaign with events around the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to a National Federation of Independent Business
(NFIB) report conducted with San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank,
4.5 million small employers use computer equipment. The survey
found that 40 percent had addressed the Y2K issue, and another 19
percent had plans to do so but hadn't started yet.
</P>
<P>
   That still means a third had no plans to deal with the problem.
The survey warned that 750,000 businesses risk being crippled or
forced to shut down if they didn't correct the problem in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of (small) businesses that feel this is a lot
of hype,'' said Scott Hauge, head of the Small Business Network in
San Francisco. ``A lot of small businesses don't have the
resources, don't have the time, and they're just hoping this will
all go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses have been slower than large corporations to
recognize the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me about small- and medium-sized businesses is
that many of them don't seem to take the PC problem seriously,''
said Jon Huntress, a writer and researcher for a Y2K site sponsored
by Tenagra Corp., a Houston-based Internet marketing and consulting
group. ``They think if they have recent PCs, they won't have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Huntress argues that until last year, many computers still
weren't compliant on the hardware level, so a relatively new system
might not offer complete protection. ``Even the word `compliance'
hasn't been defined,'' he said. ``It means different things to
different companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 Readiness Act, the bill approved by the Senate and
now being considered by the House, has been well received by small
business trade groups, but it is not considered a cure-all for
small companies that have not upgraded for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., would
allow the SBA to guarantee a higher percentage of loans available
to fix the problem and would grant limited deferments on principal
payments. Other Y2K bills are under consideration, but none has had
the widespread support of Bond's measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes it easier for small business to get money from
private lenders,'' said Kristy Simms, manager of legislative
affairs for the National Federation of Independent Business. ``It's
really just a safety net. It's helpful to a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said small businesses might be more at risk from
the Y2K problems of the large companies they work with, such as
suppliers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NFIB, 46 percent of the small businesses
already taking action expect to pay less than $1,000 to upgrade
their systems. About 7 percent plan to spend more than $25,000, and
a few report costs of up to $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Companies using relatively new, prepackaged computer systems
rather than ones that are highly customized or produced in-house
are expected to have less expensive upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   King said his company's system was expensive because of its
sophistication. At $50 million in sales with 120 employees, Peking
is a growing company that needs to keep up with major clients like
J.C. Penney Co., Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Federated Department
Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   King said he had chosen to upgrade the systems in a series of
smaller steps rather than one big leap to reduce the risk of a
system collapse or major failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the money to pay for the upgrade ... it
would be devastating,'' he said. ``Fortunately, we made enough
money in prior years and got to the size where we could take the
hit and then take a deep sigh. By the time you're done, you're
better than you were before.''

 &HT;    Herbs, spices turn familiar to fantastic
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery and use of herbs and spices by ancient people took
the preparation of food for the purpose of survival to an art form
and a pillar of civilized life. Discovering what tastes certain
dried leaves, seeds or powdered roots imparted to foods was a
process that apparently took place simultaneously all over the
planet and, if nothing else, illustrates mankind's natural urge to
simply add a little spice to life.
</P>
<P>
   There is such a wealth of knowledge about herbs and spices that
one could make a lifetime study of these fascinating plants. And
for eons, people have done just that. In ancient times in many
societies, knowledge of herbs and their uses both in medicine and
in cooking set a person apart as a wise and valued member of the
group. Today, these people are on the Internet. There are many
hundreds of excellent sites where individuals, herb societies and
educational institutions share their collected knowledge for you to
explore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us cook with the same spices we've used for years. But
by simply discovering a new herb or spice to season an everyday
dish, you can turn the familiar into the exciting. And rather than
spending a lifetime doing it, all this is just a click or two away.
</P>
<P>
   For the novice, the first thing to do is find a good herb chart
_ and there are many. Find one you like and bookmark it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Perhaps the all-round best is
http://www.spiceguide.com/encyclopedia
</P>
<P>
   /encyclopediamain.html, which is nothing less than an
encyclopedia of herbs and spices loaded with information, put forth
in an interesting and understandable format. There are good color
pictures plus recipes and fascinating facts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check out http://www.humorscope.com
</P>
<P>
   /herbs/herbs.html. It has an herb and spice index, recipes, tips
on growing your own, history, geography and more. Here, for
instance, you will find that caraway has been cultivated for at
least 5,000 years. Hungarian herdsmen used the seeds to flavor
their goulash, Germans flavored pork with it and the Swedish put
the seeds in bread. There are growing instructions and a recipe for
caraway yogurt biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another good site for a chart is
http://foodlines.com/foodgallery
</P>
<P>
   /culinaryessentials/spiceupyourlife
</P>
<P>
   .html. There is also a short but excellent course on the
difference between seasonings and flavorings, often confused
because both are usually used in the final steps of a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Flavoring changes the taste of the dish by adding a new flavor,
while seasoning brings out the flavor that is already there. You
can cook for a lifetime and never learn this kind of thing outside
of a cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You also will not want to miss the essential information
offered at http://aries27.uwaterloo.ca/(tilde)dmg/faqs
</P>
<P>
   /spices/spices.html, ``Flavoring the World _ Frequently Asked
Questions About Spices.'' First, learn the difference between herbs
and spices. Herbs come from the leafy part of the plant and spices
can be seeds, bark or other parts of plants _ even the same plant
an herb comes from. (Raise your hand if you didn't know.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another good chart that includes dishes that the herb or spice
goes with is at http://CNN.com/HEALTH/indepth.food
</P>
<P>
   /herbs/chart.html.
</P>
<P>
   After you have digested all that and are ready to try it out in
the kitchen, check these sites for recipes:

<P>
   Fresh Green Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 1/2 cups
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 7 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This sauce is delicious served over steaming-hot vegetables or
pasta. It can be made a day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Pinch cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup (1 ounce) grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon each fresh, finely chopped basil, parsley, mint,
chives, tarragon, oregano and lemon thyme
</P>
<P>

   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Roast Pork Loin Stuffed With Dried Apricots,
</P>
<P>
   Shallots and Sage
</P>
<P>
   Makes 10 servings Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 2
hours
</P>
<P>
   The musky flavor of fresh sage offsets the sweetness of the
fruit, yielding a melange that perfectly accents the pork. This is
an elegant main course that also is great at room temperature,
perhaps for a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons canola oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried apricots, cut in 1/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   4 green onions, cut in 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup brandy
</P>
<P>
   2 cups orange juice, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups coarse dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, lightly beaten, or 1/2 cup egg substitute
</P>
<P>
   4- to 5-pound boneless pork loin, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons canola
oil. Stir in apricots, shallots, green onions, raisins and sage.
Cook for about 2 minutes, or until the sage is fragrant. Stir in
the brandy and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in 1 cup orange juice,
bring to a boil, lower heat to medium and reduce liquid by
one-third. Remove from heat and stir in bread crumbs. Let cool.
Stir in eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pork loin in half lengthwise, leaving one side attached.
Fold open and cut out a trough about 1 inch deep and 2 inches wide
in center of each half. Fill the troughs with the bread crumb
mixture. Fold the two halves together and tie with kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large ovenproof
skillet or roasting or baking pan over high heat. Add the pork loin
and brown on all sides. Pour in remaining 1 cup orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to oven and cook for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350
degrees. Basting every 20 minutes, cook for 1 1/2 hours. Remove
from oven and let stand for 10 minutes. Cut in 1-inch slices and
serve with the pan juices. _ From ``The Herbal Palate Cookbook'' by
Maggie Oster and Sal Gilbertie (Storey Publishing, 1996)

 &HT;    Soup recipe pops in from Gatlinburg
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Phil Panuska didn't have to wait long for a popcorn
soup recipe he requested for his wife, Tamara. She had enjoyed the
soup at a restaurant in Gatlinburg, Tenn., he said, and he had been
unsuccessful tracking down the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, the manager of the Magnolia Tea Room at
Eight Gables Inn in Gatlinburg, where Tamara had the soup, came
through with the recipe. Cindy Black said it's a favorite there,
too, and it's often on the menu.

   EMERGING-ARCHITECTS (Undated) _ Eight architectural firms were
selected this year as ``emerging voices'' of 1999 by the
Architectural League of New York, a nonprofit organization that has
sponsored public programs in architecture since 1881. But rising
stars need more than a winning way with a T-square _ or a
state-of-the-art CAD program _ to make a name for themselves. The
simplest projects require a fanatical commitment and Job-like
patience. This year's winners offer a telling glimpse of the state
of architecture _ a mirror of how it is being built today and a
window onto the world of the next century. By Julie V. Iovine.

   FALLINGWATER (Bear Run, Pa.) _ Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd
Wright's 1936 masterpiece, acknowledged by architects to be the
most significant American building, appears to be falling down.
When this weekend house slung over a waterfall opened here last
week for its annual season of public tours, visitors were treated
to the sight of a bathtub-sized hole in the middle of the living
room floor. The house, a series of intersecting concrete trays,
has, in fact, been sagging; one corner, hanging over the falls, is
more than seven inches lower than it should be. The problem, which
threatened to bring Fallingwater crashing into the rocks below, has
led to a top-to-bottom analysis of the building's structure. By
Fred Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   PIPHER-PROFILE (Lincoln, Neb.) _ Mary Pipher, the psychologist
whose book about adolescent girls, ``Reviving Ophelia,'' was a
phenomenal best seller, was walking on the prairie near her home at
sunset, showing off the quiet beauty of winter in Nebraska. She
walks here with her women's writers' group on weekends, she says,
and it is where she likes to celebrate New Year's Day. She walked
on the prairie a lot during the 11 months her mother lay dying in a
hospital in Kansas five years ago. This is the landscape,
undramatic and Midwestern, that has shaped her life and thinking,
and landscape is the metaphor she uses to explore aging in her new
book, ``Another Country: The Emotional Terrain of Our Elders,''
which will be published next week. As in ``Reviving Ophelia'' which
is as much a social critique as it is a psychological treatise, Dr.
Pipher, 51, views aging through the lens of the anthropologist she
set out to be in college. A profile of the writer by Sara Rimer.

<P>
   NY-OLD-SIGNS (New York) _ You can't miss it. At the corner of
Greene and West Houston Streets, a new billboard for G-Shock
watches partially obscures an early 20th-century sign for the
United Thread Company. A giant wristwatch, splayed across both
advertising panels, appears to be attached to the building by
trompe l'oeil nails. But is the old sign really old? Or is it new,
too? Such questions crop up often these days, as New York's
construction boom alternately exposes and covers old signs:
advertisements for carriage rentals and patent medicines painted on
brick walls previously hidden by buildings. They appear suddenly,
flashes of the past, when a building is razed. By Phil Patton.

Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   HOPPEN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Lionized in Britain but largely
unknown here, Kelly Hoppen has seen the future, and it is beige,
accented with sorbet-sweet shots of aubergine, blackberry and
lilac. The future is also sculptured with concealed, expensively
calibrated light. By Mitchell Owens.

   NY-SEX-MUSEUM (New York) _ When was the last time you loved a
building and it loved you back? This month, the Museum of Sex, or
Mosex, begins sweeping the floor of its new temporary home at 233
Fifth Avenue (27th Street), beneath the shadow of the Empire State
Building, in anticipation of renovations that will deliver a new
facade, 12,000 square feet of exhibition galleries and offices, a
retail shop and a cafe by the end of the year. Mosex _ at the other
end of the block from Le Trapeze, a towels-only night club _ is an
adult museum, the first in the United States to be devoted to ``sex
and culture everywhere,'' said Alison Maddex, 32, its director.
``It's going to be the Smithsonian of sex,'' she added. By William
L. Hamilton.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND, Alaska _ Captain Joseph Hazelwood's voice
crackled over the radio at the Coast Guard station in the tiny port
of Valdez just after midnight on March 24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fetched up, uh, hard aground, north of Goose Island off
Bligh Reef,'' said the skipper of the Exxon Valdez, who had been
drinking and now struggled to understand what had happened to his
tanker. ``And evidently, uh, leaking some oil.''
</P>
<P>
   With that breathtaking understatement, Hazelwood announced the
worst oil spill in US history. Pierced by the rocks at Bligh Reef,
the Exxon Valdez dumped 10.8 million gallons of thick, crude oil
into the water, creating a slick big enough to reach from Cape Cod
to North Carolina, and killing animals by the tens of thousands as
it spread.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Prince William Sound looks as beautiful as ever
from the air, its glacier-fed blue waters broken only by breaching
whales or sea otters floating lazily on their backs. Painful as the
spill was, life goes on in this vast place, and many animal species
are rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   But the deep scars, and the unfinished business, of the Exxon
Valdez disaster become clearer down on the water, where only two of
the 23 most damaged species have fully recovered and an estimated
40 percent of the fishermen suffer depression over their decimated
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superficially, this looks healthy . . . but you poke around
and you still find oil,'' said National Marine Fisheries Service
biologist Bruce Wright as he picks his way along the cobblestone
beach of Sleepy Bay, where oil piled up 3 feet deep during the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Wright turns over a boulder to reveal the black oil tar,
the toxic ``bathtub ring'' left by the spill. ``I don't know of any
way you could clean this beach up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Prince William Sound isn't the same since the spill, neither
is the rest of America. The grim spectacle of one of North
America's most pristine places turned into an industrial waste site
spawned tough new laws that have made oil spills five times more
costly to companies, and, as a result, less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the US coast bristles with billions of dollars worth of
boats, booms, and other equipment from Portland, Maine, to San
Francisco, awaiting the next big spill, while schools such as the
Massachusetts Maritime Academy train hundreds of mariners in
cleanup strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a recent freighter spill on the Oregon coast
demonstrates, oil spills haven't gone away, and as the horror of
the Exxon Valdez spill fades, some fear cleanup preparedness may
slide, too. Already, the biggest cleanup company has seen its
operating budget cut in half as oil producers and transporters
reduce support, and regulators fear smaller firms could fail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the oil industry grapples with low energy prices,
layoffs, and a wave of consolidations, officials in the spill
cleanup industry have begun warning of hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable that there has to be consolidation in our
industry,'' warns Steve Benz, president of the Virginia-based
Marine Spill Response Corporation, which maintains ships and
equipment around the country to fight a Valdez-scale spill.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, the spill's legacy hangs in the balance as well.
Exxon's $1 billion settlement with the state and federal
governments has protected 650,000 acres of land, made Prince
William Sound the world's most-studied spill site, and afforded a
new aquarium in Seward.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is still contesting the larger $5 billion
punitive damages award to thousands of native villagers, fishermen,
and property owners who were harmed by the spill, leaving many of
them feeling embittered and impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had thousands of clients that have gone bankrupt, got
divorced, died, or been down on their financial luck'' while
awaiting a settlement, said Brian O'Neill, the Minneapolis lawyer
who represents 60,000 plaintiffs in the suit against Exxon. ``When
we get the money, if we're disbursing it to estates and divorce
settlements, I'm going to feel like it was a little late.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Alaskans angry at Exxon will have to settle for the
spectacle of Captain Hazelwood picking up trash on Alaska state
lands this summer. Acquitted of criminal drunkenness but convicted
of negligence, Hazelwood must serve 1,000 hours of community
service over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the Exxon Valdez accident seems like a case study
in how to create a disaster. The 987-foot tanker had no tugboat
escort as the crew maneuvered around ice floes, and Hazelwood,
after a day of drinking, had left a lowly third mate in charge of
the bridge. The Coast Guard couldn't even track the ship's progress
because of range limits on its radar.
</P>
<P>
   After the tanker ran aground _ on a clear night on a well marked
reef _ officials at the oil facilities in Valdez took 10 crucial
hours figuring out which emergency response equipment to send to
the spill, allowing the slick to spread unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when a virtual army was deployed to fight the spill _ up
to 10,000 workers, 1,000 boats, and 100 aircraft at a cost of $2.1
billion to Exxon, disorganization, along with potent tides and
winds, repeatedly undermined containment. Ultimately, they
recovered only a fraction of the oil, leaving tides and evaporation
to do most of the work.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND, Alaska: ... of the work.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, oil reached 1,300 miles of coastline and killed
staggering numbers: 250,000 birds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 seals, 250
bald eagles, perhaps billions of salmon and herring larvae,
according to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, which
manages Exxon settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   The spill also devastated coastal communities such as Cordova,
which saw its vital herring fishery closed after the spill, and New
Chenega, a native village that had been destroyed before, by a 1964
earthquake. The oil that covered Sleepy Bay poisoned the Chenegans'
clam beds.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible as the immediate costs were, the bigger controversy
centered on the longterm damage, if any, from the disaster. Exxon
paid about $300 million in damage claims in the first few years
after the spill, but lawyers for people who had been harmed called
that a mere down payment on losses that averaged more than $200,000
per fisherman from 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the two sides are still arguing. In 1994, a
federal jury in Anchorage awarded thousands of fishermen, natives,
and property owners $5 billion in punitive damages for the spill,
which Exxon has appealed, arguing that they were wrongly blamed for
problems far beyond their accident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the official cleanup ended in 1992, Exxon
researchers began declaring ``the remarkable recovery'' of Prince
William Sound. ``Resources in the spill-affected area are
essentially recovered and. . . wildlife is present at levels within
historic range,'' concluded Exxon's shareholder magazine in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   True, some animals, such as bald eagles and, later, river
otters, did seem to bounce back quickly. However, scientists at the
National Marine Fisheries Service say Exxon's claims are premature
even now. Not only are some species, such as loons and harlequin
ducks, showing no signs of recovering, but new research suggests
that the Exxon Valdez spill may be killing today.
</P>
<P>
   Wright of the National Marine Fisheries Service believes traces
of Exxon Valdez oil among the rocks in salmon streams are killing
eggs. Research at the service's Auke Bay Lab found that the tiny
red eggs actually draw the oil to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, people suing Exxon believe the spill has had a
longterm toxic effect on them. J. Steven Picou, a sociologist at
the University of South Alabama, found major psychological stress
among coastal residents, including severe depression in 40 percent
of commercial fishermen in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the spill, commercial fishing has crumbled, though not
entirely because of oil. Disease decimated the herring industry,
while growing salmon competition dropped prices from $2.70 a pound
in the 1980s to just 50 cents a pound in some places now.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of fishermen, it's getting to the point where you
can't afford the peanut butter and gas to go fishing,'' said
O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, scientists may never know the full impact of the
spill, partly because they don't know enough about pre-spill
wildlife populations and partly because the Sound was changing
anyway. Water temperatures have risen four degrees Fahrenheit in
recent decades, altering the food supply in unpredictable ways. The
best that Molly McCammon, executive director of the Exxon Valdez
Oil Spill Trustee Council, can say is that recovery work is not
finished: ``There is a long way yet to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the waters of Prince William Sound, the big spill has had
a dramatic effect on the oil industry. Publicly embarrassed, and
certain more regulations were coming, major oil companies put up $1
billion to start a new firm to prepare for catastrophic spills, the
Marine Spill Response Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act in 1990, which
greatly increased polluter liability for spills, set up a $1
billion national cleanup fund, and required tankers to have a
protective outer hull by 2015. The law also imposed new rules aimed
at better emergency response planning, one of the major weaknesses
in the Valdez accident.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the port of Valdez has gone from an embarrassment to an
industry showcase, with tugboats escorting the tankers, better
radar tracking their movements, and monthly emergency drills.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these measures have reduced the amount of oil
spilled in US waters from at least 4 million gallons each year in
the 1980s to only 565,500 gallons in 1997, according to the Oil
Spill Intelligence Report.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the progress against oil spills may make the country
less prepared for the next Exxon Valdez-scale disaster. With no
catastrophic spills since 1989, response companies have struggled
for business.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, cleanup companies pay lots of people to be trained
and wait. For instance, the Marine Spill Response Corp. keeps a
staff of six on its 210-foot cleanup vessel stationed outside San
Francisco even though it has worked on only two oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with crude oil prices at a 12-year low, oil firms are
laying off thousands and merging with each other to save money.
Some fear they will cut back even more on how much they pay to keep
spill equipment and personnel on standby.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSRC's capacity far, far exceeds regulatory requirements,''
said Benz, praising the company's founders. Oil companies ``are
clearly spending far more than they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of emergency response cuts scares
environmentalists as the oil industry presses to explore for oil
and gas in the sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and as
the existing Trans-Alaska Pipeline to Valdez ages. Nine
environmental groups recently called on federal regulators to hold
up the merger of Mobil and Exxon until issues regarding the Valdez
spill are settled. ``A new millennium demands a new commitment by
corporations to act responsibly toward the environment and the
human beings affected by their operations,'' the activists said.

`DEEP END' GRIPPED PFEIFFER THAN NO OTHER

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Michelle Pfeiffer bought the movie rights to
Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' before it
became Oprah's Book Club's first phenomenal best seller. Before
millions were shocked and moved by its tale of a family's struggle
to cope after a child goes missing. Before it was even published.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a good idea at the time, and it probably was. But
even when she first read the pre-publication draft, the
actress-producer had a good inkling of how tough making and
starring in the movie version was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put it down, and then I had to put it down, if you
know what I mean,'' says the 40-year-old Pfeiffer, known almost as
well for the acting challenges she takes on (``Married to the
Mob,'' ``The Age of Innocence,'' ``Love Field,'' ``The Fabulous
Baker Boys'') as for her classic movie-star beauty.
</P>
<P>
   We do know what she means. ``Ocean's'' protagonist, Beth
Cappadora, loses Ben, the second of her three little children, in a
crowded hotel lobby. For nine agonizing years, she and her husband,
Pat (Treat Williams in the movie), their oldest son Vincent (played
as a teen-ager by ``General Hospital's'' Jonathan Jackson) and
their daughter, Kerry (Alexa Vega), struggle to keep the remnants
of their family functional.
</P>
<P>
   When Ben re-enters their lives, he's a 12-year-old (Ryan
Merriman of the TV series ``The Pretender'') who now goes by the
name Sam and has no recollection of the Cappadoras. This triggers a
whole new set of heartbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Beth was a harrowing assignment, especially for an
actress with two small children of her own. But doing justice to
Beth's complex story and character _ the novel ran 447 pages _ in a
movie that runs less than two hours was an even more formidable
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was so full, we couldn't possibly get all of it in,''
Pfeiffer explains. ``We had many, many different versions of the
script. Vincent got into a lot more trouble in the book. Beth and
Pat behaved even worse, did all kinds of bad stuff to each other,
had affairs and everything. It was all wonderful and it was rich;
that's what I loved about the book, it painted such a truly, truly
realistic view of how people are.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the hard thing, when you go to make a movie, is to bring
as many of those colors as you can to it. At the same time, you
can't possibly give all the background information or all the
nuances. So, sometimes, audiences don't understand what motivates
the characters, and they end up just not liking them. It was a very
delicate balance to find.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that it's a very different thing from her book,
Mitchard says she likes the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have known that parts were missing if I hadn't
written it,'' she explains. ``There's, like, a cast of thousands in
the book, and that would've been impossible in a film. It's a much
more linear form; it doesn't go back and forth and around the way
that a book can do. There just wasn't enough space.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, essentially, the story's emotional content survives in
the movie,'' adds the author, a mother of five who wrote her first
novel after her husband of 13 years succumbed to cancer. ``It makes
you ask questions about what makes up people's bonds with each
other in the way that you should ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, those unfamiliar with the book may wonder why
Candy, the Chicago detective in charge of the missing boy's case,
announces to Beth for no apparent reason that she's a lesbian. This
is significant in the novel, where Candy is a more significant
character (and is also a white woman; Whoopi Goldberg plays her in
the film).
</P>
<P>
   Readers, on the other hand, are going to wonder what became of
Vincent's psychiatrist, a major presence on the page who does not
even appear on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like psychiatrist stuff in movies,'' says
screenwriter and former film critic Stephen Schiff. ``In general,
shrinks in movies are about telling, not showing. Good movies are
about showing.''
</P>
<P>
   While decisions such as this were certainly discussed with
director Ulu Grosbard, Pfeiffer and her producing partner Kate
Guinzburg, Schiff explains that he felt no pressure to increase the
star's film presence at the expense of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a famous story about one actor: If you're ever in a
conflict with them, you're supposed to say `Don't you realize this
is your scene?''' Schiff jokes. ``Michelle is not that in any way,
shape or form. When you talk to her about a scene her character is
not in, she brings the same precision and insight. She gets movies,
she gets details, she understands story; and she does it from a
completely unactorish point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer gives an example of how, when it came time to shoot the
kind of extravagant scene that actors crave, it had to be
sacrificed for the sake of the overall show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really fine-tuning all the way, first in the writing of
the script and then, as we were shooting, discovering things,''
Pfeiffer says. ``For instance, in the novel, she gets really drunk
in the hotel and throws up all over the place. That was in the
script, but when it came time to do it, we thought it might not be
a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, in that situation, it's not anything I would do,
though I guess some people would. But if you don't know the
character, you would think she had a drinking problem. She didn't,
but we weren't able to give you enough about Beth in the beginning
for you to know that, so it was best just to leave it out. I would
never want to diminish a character just because she unnerved people
_ I think that's a good thing. But you had to let go of things that
you felt would confuse the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer also had to let go of a replacement ending she felt
would improve on the one Grosbard originally shot. That delayed the
film's release from last fall to this Friday, but it did not play
any better. The movie is coming out with Grosbard's ending.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this episode, the director describes working with the
star-producer in glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain amount of confidence and trust between
us,'' says Grosbard, an acclaimed Broadway director (``The Subject
Was Roses'') who's made such distinctive films as ``Straight Time''
and ``True Confessions.'' ``On the second day of shooting, Michelle
had to tape this demanding, emotional television appeal. She just
walked in, sat down and was right there. She was so full, out of
nowhere, and that's very difficult to do. There were no other
actors for her to build with, she was on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer admits that the material had a special resonance for
her. She and her husband, television producer David E. Kelley, have
a 6-year-old adopted daughter, Claudia Rose (their other child,
John, is 4). And the point of the story, which gradually emerges in
both book and film, is that emotional connections can be as strong
as blood ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is a lot different than the one in this movie,''
she explains. ``But before I ever even became a parent, I'd read
stories about things like this happening, and so much of the time
the resolution was not geared toward what was in the best interest
of the child. I think it has to be about the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always complicated, and there are always extenuating
circumstances,'' she continues. ``This is a movie about people
redefining themselves individually, in relationship to each other
and as family. And I think it's different for everyone. I don't
think our traditional sense of family always applies to people.
It's not always biological or genetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Producing, however, is not a family affair. Pfeiffer's Via Rosa
Productions had a hand in her blockbuster hit ``Dangerous Minds,''
and the not-so-successful ``One Fine Day'' and ``A Thousand
Acres,'' before taking on ``Deep End.'' Although Kelley has had
remarkable success on television with ``Ally McBeal,'' ``The
Practice,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Picket Fences'' and ``L.A. Law,''
Pfeiffer notes that her husband is ``way too smart'' to give her
advice she doesn't ask for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really spend our time talking about work much,'' she
continues. ``There are so many things to focus on about the family
and the kids that we just never get there. I mean, I never know
what he's doing half the time. Probably, if I read the trades, I
would learn a lot about my husband!''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer is learning more and more about filmmaking with each
new movie that she produces. Not all of it is great. There was no
doubt that Oprah Winfrey would have liked to produce the movie
version of her first book club selection. Pfeiffer addresses
whatever friction that might have caused gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talked to her personally, and anything I ever heard
about Oprah was always kind of third-hand,'' Pfeiffer says. ``I
know that she expressed a lot of interest, and she did a lot for
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer adds that an appearance on ``Oprah'' was discussed, but
the actress's busy work schedule _ she plays Titania in a film
version of Shakespeare's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' coming out
in May, and is shooting the marital comedy ``The Story of Us'' with
Bruce Willis _ did not permit it.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever distress, professional or emotional, that making
``Deep End of the Ocean'' caused, Pfeiffer says it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some weeks when things were a little more difficult
and trying,'' she says of the demanding adaptation and performing
processes. ``But because the process was pretty much an enjoyable
one, I really went home feeling purged in a way.'' &QL;

When this weekend house slung over a waterfall opened here last
week for its annual season of public tours, visitors were treated
to the sight of a bathtub-sized hole in the middle of the living
room floor. The house, a series of intersecting concrete trays,
has, in fact, been sagging; one corner, hanging over the falls, is
more than seven inches lower than it should be. The problem, which
threatened to bring Fallingwater crashing into the rocks below, has
led to a top-to-bottom analysis of the building's structure. By

   PIPHER-PROFILE (Lincoln, Neb.) _ Mary Pipher, the psychologist

sunset, showing off the quiet beauty of winter in Nebraska. She
walks here with her women's writers' group on weekends, she says,
and it is where she likes to celebrate New Year's Day. She walked
on the prairie a lot during the 11 months her mother lay dying in a
hospital in Kansas five years ago. This is the landscape,
undramatic and Midwestern, that has shaped her life and thinking,
and landscape is the metaphor she uses to explore aging in her new
book, ``Another Country: The Emotional Terrain of Our Elders,''
which will be published next week. As in ``Reviving Ophelia'' which
is as much a social critique as it is a psychological treatise, Dr.
Pipher, 51, views aging through the lens of the anthropologist she
set out to be in college. A profile of the writer by Sara Rimer.

advertising panels, appears to be attached to the building by
trompe l'oeil nails. But is the old sign really old? Or is it new,
too? Such questions crop up often these days, as New York's

WIRED DIGITAL FACES RESTIVE INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Twin investor uprisings _ one an open battle,
the other an underground movement _ could affect the financial
future of Wired Digital, a pioneering San Francisco Web company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the aftershocks of Tuesday's resignation by a key
board member of the giant Lycos Web site may hamper that company's
acquisition of Wired Digital, which has itself been the subject of
a reported revolt by investors.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, David Wetherell, chief executive officer of the
Andover, Mass.-based Internet marketing company CMGI Inc., resigned
from the board of Lycos Inc., which is in the final stages of
acquiring Wired Digital. CMGI is Lycos' largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell contends that Lycos' pending acquisition by Barry
Diller's USA Networks Inc. would inadequately compensate current
Lycos investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``After further consideration, it is my opinion that the terms
of the USA/Lycos transaction are inadequate for Lycos
shareholders,'' Wetherell said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to observers, the Lycos/USA Networks spat could
further complicate the pending Lycos-Wired Digital deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could very well be a ripple effect,'' said James
Preissler, an Internet analyst with PaineWebber in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Lycos management will surely be focused on (the USA
Network acquisition) and could easily get distracted from the Wired
Digital deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come down to how management will be able to handle two
big projects like this,'' added Dalton Chandler, analyst with
Needham &AMP; Co. in New York. ``I mean, how many big projects can
Lycos executives devote themselves to?''
</P>
<P>
   Key to navigating these two controversies, Preissler said, will
be the ability of shareholders and others to ``play nice'' during
these acquisitions. And nice is not a game some want to play.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports first published last month in Boston
newspapers, shareholders at Wired Digital have hired attorneys,
with the possible intention of launching lawsuits that could block
the Lycos-Wired Digital deal. Lycos and Wired Digital officials
maintain the deal is solid, however.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital shareholders, including founders Louis Rosetto and
Jane Metcalf, are reportedly miffed over how Lycos shares will be
apportioned among various classes of Wired Digital stockholders.
Rosetto and Metcalf could not be reached for comment on these
reports.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports and documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, original Wired Digital investors holding A
class shares are subject to restrictions that give later B and C
class investors a larger stake of the incoming Lycos stock.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to SEC filings and reports, Wired Digital
chief executive Beth Vanderslice and other top executives were
issued hefty stock options that might dilute share worth for other
stockholders, including Wired Digital employees lured and retained
by the promise of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created some very interesting morale dynamics around
here,'' said one longtime Wired Digital employee, one of six
interviewed, all of whom asked not to have their names published.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew de Vries, a Wired Digital spokesman, said it was
full-steam ahead for the Lycos-Wired Digital deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies remain fully committed to completing this
deal,'' de Vries said. ``According to Bob Davis (the Lycos chief
executive), he's absolutely committed to completing this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vries said talk of a torpedoed merger was ``weak
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good deal for Lycos,'' de Vries said, and Wired
Digital ``is a key part of the Lycos network.''
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital is the on-line remnant of the Wired Ventures
empire, which was carved up when the print magazine Wired was sold
to Conde Nast a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Lycos announced it was going to acquire the Wired
Digital properties, which include the bombastic Suck.Com Web site
and the heavily advertised HotBot search engine.

 &HT;    THERE SHE IS: THE NEW MISS ISRAEL IS MEMBER OF ARAB MINORITY
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ She wears the sequins, sash and gleaming smile of
beauty queens the world over, but no one should take the new Miss
Israel at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Crowned Tuesday night, 21-year-old Rana Raslan is the first Arab
ever to win the Miss Israel pageant. A Muslim, she will represent
the Jewish state in the Miss World contest late this year.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of nearly a million Arab Israelis -- distinct from
the neighboring Palestinians in that they are Israeli citizens and
within the recognized borders of Israel, rather than the disputed,
occupied areas. Though facing high rates of poverty and
unemployment, the Arab Israelis have slowly increased in numbers
and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Raslan's photo, with her crown set atop her long, dark curls,
was on the front of Israel's major dailies Wednesday and she seemed
to scramble the region's religious and ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I belong to Israel. I'm Israeli Arab,'' the exhausted beauty
queen told the Cox News Service in a telephone interview from a
party in her home in Haifa Wednesday. ``We must, the Jewish and the
Arabs, live like brothers. We must show all the world we can live
together.''
</P>
<P>
   A legal secretary, who speaks Arabic, Hebrew and English, Raslan
wants to eventually become a teacher. But, Wednesday was filled
with photo sessions, interviews and comparisons to her predecessor,
a Jewish Israeli who won the Miss World title last November.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits here note that beauty pageants pale in importance in a
land of periodic war and terrorism. But, Raslan's victory was
seized upon by politicians and commentators from Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the choice a ``a clear expression of
equality,'' to a pageant judge who called it a peace gesture to the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Most acknowledge that Raslan was, if nothing else, a sign of
Israel's increasingly multi-cultural make up -- a Jewish Ethiopian
Israeli also made history Tuesday by taking second place -- as well
a small triumph for the sizeable Arab minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a creeping recognition. It is very limited and still
not the norm, and not rooted in Israeli political culture,'' said
Majid Al-Haj, an Arab Israeli who heads Haifa University's Center
for Multi-Culturalism.
</P>
<P>
   He said Israeli Arabs are seeking integration into Israeli
society more than ever and could change Israel's identity as the
Zionist, Jewish state. Jews, in turn, he said are slowly starting
to recognize Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-sixth of the six million Israelis living here are
Arabs, either Muslims or Christians. Unlike the 2.5 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the families of Arab
Israelis did not flee or get forced out of Israel when neighboring
Arab nations attacked in 1948. Some Israeli Arabs prefer to call
themselves Palestinians or ``Arab citizens of Israel'' rather than
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Israel are segregated, and
Israeli Arabs complain that they receive only a fraction of the
services of Jewish sectors.
</P>
<P>
   But, they have generally the same legal rights, including the
right to vote and hold public office. An Arab Israeli recently
became the first Arab appointed to a nine-month term on the Israeli
supreme court(CQ lower case).

   He said Israeli Arabs are seeking integration into Israeli
society more than ever and could change Israel's identity as the
Zionist, Jewish state. Jews, in turn, he said are slowly starting
to recognize Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-sixth of the six million Israelis living here are
Arabs, either Muslims or Christians. Unlike the 2.5 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the families of Arab
Israelis did not flee or get forced out of Israel when neighboring
Arab nations attacked in 1948. Some Israeli Arabs prefer to call
themselves Palestinians or ``Arab citizens of Israel'' rather than
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Israel are segregated, and
Israeli Arabs complain that they receive only a fraction of the
services of Jewish sectors.
</P>
<P>
   But, they have generally the same legal rights, including the
right to vote and hold public office. An Arab Israeli recently
became the first Arab appointed to a nine-month term on the Israeli
supreme court(CQ lower case).

   My opinions regarding the baseball legend Joe DiMaggio would be
of no particular interest to the general public were it not for the
fact that 30 years ago I wrote the song ``Mrs. Robinson,'' whose
lyric ``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely
eyes to you'' alluded to and in turn probably enhanced DiMaggio's
stature in the American iconographic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after ``Mrs. Robinson'' rose to No.1 on the pop
charts, I found myself dining at an Italian restaurant where
DiMaggio was seated with a party of friends. I'd heard a rumor that
he was upset with the song and had considered a lawsuit, so it was
with some trepidation that I walked over and introduced myself as
its composer. I needn't have worried: He was perfectly cordial and
invited me to sit down, whereupon we immediately fell into
conversation about the only subject we had in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't understand,'' he said, ``is why you ask where
I've gone. I just did a Mr. Coffee commercial, I'm a spokesman for
the Bowery Savings Bank and I haven't gone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   I said that I didn't mean the lines literally, that I thought of
him as an American hero and that genuine heroes were in short
supply. He accepted the explanation and thanked me. We shook hands
and said good night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the shadow of his passing, I find myself wondering about
that explanation. Yes, he was a cultural icon, a hero if you will,
but not of my generation. He belonged to my father's youth: He was
a World War II guy whose career began in the days of Babe Ruth and
Lou Gehrig and ended with the arrival of the youthful Mickey Mantle
(who was, in truth, my favorite ballplayer).
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s and '60s, it was fashionable to refer to baseball as
a metaphor for America, and DiMaggio represented the values of that
America: excellence and fulfillment of duty (he often played in
pain), combined with a grace that implied a purity of spirit, an
off-the-field dignity and a jealously guarded private life.
</P>
<P>
   It was said that he still grieved for his former wife, Marilyn
Monroe, and sent fresh flowers to her grave every week. Yet as a
man who married one of America's most famous and famously neurotic
women, he never spoke of her in public or in print. He understood
the power of silence.
</P>
<P>
   He was the antithesis of the iconoclastic, mind-expanding,
authority-defying '60s, which is why I think he suspected a hidden
meaning in my lyrics. The fact that the lines were sincere and that
they've been embraced over the years as a yearning for heroes and
heroism speaks to the subconscious desires of the culture. We need
heroes, and we search for candidates to be anointed.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we do this even as we know the attribution of heroic
characteristics is almost always a distortion? Deconstructed and
scrutinized, the hero turns out to be as petty and ego-driven as
you and I. We know, but still we anoint. We deify, though we know
the deification often kills, as in the cases of Elvis Presley,
Princess Diana and John Lennon. Even when the recipient's life is
spared, the fame and idolatry poison and injure. There is no doubt
in my mind that DiMaggio suffered for being DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   We inflict this damage without malice because we are enthralled
by myths, stories and allegories. The son of Italian immigrants,
the father a fisherman, grows up poor in San Francisco and becomes
the greatest baseball player of his day, marries an American
goddess and never in word or deed befouls his legend and greatness.
He is ``the Yankee Clipper,'' as proud and masculine as a
battleship.
</P>
<P>
   When the hero becomes larger than life, life itself is
magnified, and we read with a new clarity our moral compass. The
hero allows us to measure ourselves on the goodness scale: OK, I'm
not Mother Teresa, but hey, I'm no Jeffrey Dahmer. Better keep
trying in the eyes of God.
</P>
<P>
   What is the larger significance of DiMaggio's death? Is he a
real hero? Let me quote the complete verse from ``Mrs. Robinson'':
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In these days of presidential transgressions and apologies and
prime-time interviews about private sexual matters, we grieve for
Joe DiMaggio and mourn the loss of his grace and dignity, his
fierce sense of privacy, his fidelity to the memory of his wife and
the power of his silence.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States,
gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a
curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of
the president's affection _ the artifacts that may testify to Bill
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them
are gone.
 &HT;    Whither the gifts _ the hatpin, ``Leaves of Grass,'' the Black
Dog T-shirt _ and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made
for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by
which presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and
the public imagination?
 &HT;    ``It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,''
admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with
the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy
assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel
investigations that followed.
 &HT;    The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings
against the president, but eventually, Tilley said, ``we would
assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a
piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly
interesting investigation.''
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says
that ``normally'' such subpoenaed items go ``back to the rightful
owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has
not been settled. ``Legal research is being done right now,'' she
says, referring to all the materials held by the various
independent counsels.
 &HT;    Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and
Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables,
and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called the most
sentimental'' of the president's presents.
 &HT;    If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent
Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are
likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate _ our first fully
curated presidential scandal _ special prosecutions have assured
the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality.
 &HT;    The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia
used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that
followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with
hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what
Tilley calls ``the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation
offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she
erased 18 minutes of tape.
 &HT;    Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer
hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security
Council. Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never
requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in
an exhibit on either subject. But a number of presidential
librarians point out that these institutions balance their
scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might
suspect.
 &HT;    The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just
acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters
taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton
Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to
get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to
own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least
national humiliation.
 &HT;    Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library
in Austin, recalls how LBJ, not too long before his death, judged
some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not
nearly ``mean enough.''
 &HT;    He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive
items, including one postcard that read: ``I demand that you as a
gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton
says he has ``tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed
ballot box that may have helped send ``Landslide Lyndon'' to the
Senate in 1948.
 &HT;    Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of
both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors
gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this
presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the
existence of government-run libraries (there are none prior to
Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the chief
executive.
 &HT;    The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after
Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the president's
secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the
president's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept
in his Oval Office desk.
 &HT;    Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the
Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House
managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that
their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture
is moved and used elsewhere.
 &HT;    The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with
one of the misprinted pens _ Untied States Senator, says the barrel
_ used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object
may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the
sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which
includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its
later repeal.
 &HT;    The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable
without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is
written right across the offending language in the original
document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial,
during which Sen. Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage
by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another
drawer.
 &HT;    (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct
a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in
plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950s
Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.)
 &HT;    Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton
Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this
future facility will have to address the events that led to
impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the
gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will
be made by professionals at some later time. ``We don't even have
an architect on board yet,'' he says.
 &HT;    The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the
impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one
thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal.
 &HT;    More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual,
videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost
literally alive with its stain of presidential DNA. It is a messy,
assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization
could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts.
 &HT;    No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the
connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more
compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money
might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much
awe or heartbreak _ like, say, the string with which Lincoln
repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of
Congress _ but like it or not, it too now belongs to the ages.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Republicans in the House of Representatives are looking to their
new speaker, Dennis Hastert, with a yearning that appears
suspiciously like desperation. Few of them even pretend that they
consider Hastert a forceful leader.
 &HT;    As one leadership aide put it recently, and bluntly, ``What
people like about Denny is that he's not going to do something
stupid.''
 &HT;    Hastert is a modest, amiable soul who is fond of recalling his
past career as a high-school wrestling coach. When party leaders
came to Hastert in December to tell him that he needed to fill the
breach created by the stunningly unexpected resignation of Robert
Livingston, the speaker-designate, Hastert, according to one
Midwestern congressman, ``wasn't sure he could do it, he wasn't
sure he wanted to do it, and he was scared.''
 &HT;    What Hastert's colleagues are hoping is that the new Speaker
will somehow save them from themselves, as if his bulky frame were
a rampart standing between the G.O.P. and the cliff it seems
disposed to race off. Hastert's real virtue is that he is not his
predecessor, Newt Gingrich, for the retrospective view inside the
party is that Gingrich is at the heart of practically everything
that anyone thinks went wrong in the last few years.
 &HT;    Talk to Republican House members, as I spent the past few weeks
doing, and you'll hear that Gingrich was too obsessed with
destroying the president, failed to remind the public of the
party's accomplishments, caved to the Christian right and caved to
the Clinton left. You would think that Gingrich was a virus alien
to the party, rather than the party's leader and visionary for most
of the decade.
 &HT;    Hastert, the not-Newt, was trotted out for celebration at a
closed-to-the-press party-leadership retreat in Williamsburg, Va.,
earlier this month. The retreat began with a sobering presentation
from pollsters: Current numbers, they explained, show that voters
trust the Democrats more than the Republicans on almost all major
issues, including taxes, an issue on which the GOP has
traditionally been favored by a significant margin.
 &HT;    After dinner on the first night, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the
new head of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
screened a video made up of clips of gloating Democrats, designed
to fire members with horror at the prospect of a Democratic
takeover of the House _ which is precisely what would happen were
an election held today, according to pollsters.
 &HT;    Hastert didn't speak until the following morning, when he got up
and more or less said, according to a summary provided by one
attendee, ``We need to work together, he's the coach, he wants to
put other people in the spotlight.''
 &HT;    It was a pep talk, and not a particularly memorable one, and it
lasted no more than 10 minutes. Then the group talked about issues
and heard a presentation from executives of a marketing firm, who
explained that in order to promote a winning message, the GOP
needed to empathize with voters, tone down the ideological content,
personalize and simplify. So yes, there had been a problem _ but
with the marketing, not the message.
 &HT;    ``The message needs to be delivered by people who are upbeat,
who are connectors with folks out there, who can relate everything
we're doing to people's everyday lives,'' Jennifer Dunn, a
congresswoman from Washington who is herself an important element
of the Republicans' new look, told me a few days after the retreat.
 &HT;    Or as Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida put it, with perhaps a
trace of irony, ``Denny is this year's model.''
 &HT;    As the congressional Republicans head out into battle with the
ordeal of impeachment finally behind them, they hope to win back
the public with a kinder, gentler face. It should become clear soon
enough whether the problem really was Newt, and whether the answer
is Denny.
 &HT;    An alternative theory constitutes the nightmare underneath the
professions of optimism and bonhomie _ that the House Republicans
have actually lost touch with ordinary Americans, or rather are
captive to a base that is itself out of touch with ordinary
Americans, as the Democrats were 15 or so years ago.
 &HT;    Michael Forbes, the Long Island congressman who publicly
agonized over impeachment before voting with his party, said to me,
``If we keep defining the party by the extreme right, not only will
you see Republicans leaving the party, but you will also see a
permanent Republican minority where we will lose the White House,
we will lose the House and we will lose the Senate.'' And then
Forbes added, ``I have great hopes in the ascension of Denny
Hastert.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Among the congressional Republicans there is no bafflement like
the bafflement over the failure of the American people to rally to
the cause of impeachment.
 &HT;    John Doolittle, a California congressman who has both his car
and his office desk festooned with bumper stickers that read,
``Impeach Clinton for the Children,'' said: ``I feel good about
impeaching the president, and I would happily do it tomorrow. How
the rest of the country can not feel good about it is truly beyond
me.''
 &HT;    Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, advances the almost
metaphysical argument that ordinary citizens, unlike congressional
Republicans, simply can not own up to their own true feelings on
the subject.
 &HT;    ``People don't want to admit that the man they voted for
president is so deeply flawed because that says something about
themselves,'' Luntz said.
 &HT;    A number of moderate Republicans pointed out that many of their
party brethren loathe the president so passionately that they
simply cannot conceive that people of good will could feel
otherwise. Given their own scorn, they cannot admit that most
Americans disagree with them without feeling contempt for the
people themselves, an emotion very few politicians permit
themselves to express.
 &HT;    Tom DeLay, the Republican majority whip and the leader of the
party's Clinton-hating faction, insisted in a speech before the
House that impeachment was a matter of ``relativism vs. absolute
truth.'' Given the choice, Americans, it turned out, preferred a
tolerant and forgiving relativism.
 &HT;    Some version of this understanding has now in fact become patent
to many Republicans. Vin Weber, a former congressman and Reagan-era
optimist who along with Gingrich proclaimed the coming of a new
``conservative opportunity society,'' said, ``The image that our
party is defined by a hectoring moralism is as dangerous to us as
it is on the left if they're defined by a pandering
permissiveness.''
 &HT;    But it's also true that impeachment did not provoke a new tone
of hectoring moralism from an essentially secular party; it brought
to the fore passions that have been bubbling at least since the
``revolution'' of 1994 and perhaps since the election of Clinton
two years before.
 &HT;    Gingrich stoked those passions and was finally, in the classic
revolutionary denouement, consumed by them. The speaker staved off
a coup from the right in the summer of 1997 and then was ousted
after last year's election. And on his way out, like a Jacobin
railing at the Terror as he's led to the tumbrels, Gingrich warned
darkly of the party's ``perfectionist caucus.''
 &HT;    This is the kind of epithet that may stick to the House
Republicans. Gingrich's lament suggests a very different
explanation for the Republicans' grave problems.
 &HT;    I heard such a theory from Peter King, the Nassau County
Republican who became a hero to Democrats everywhere by his
unwavering, and very public, opposition to the impeachment of
President Clinton. King has been held in fairly low regard inside
his own party since he made himself into a sort of celebrity
martyr, boasting of his victimization by party leaders and almost
flaunting his subsequent marginalization inside the GOP.
 &HT;    At the same time, as King told me, he has a perfect voting
record with the Christian Coalition. ``I am not a moderate,'' he
said flatly.
 &HT;    King doesn't see the party's problems precisely in ideological
terms. In the '80s, he explained, the party's base was not Sunbelt
evangelicals but Reagan Democrats. ``They weren't Holy Roller
types, but they wanted to have some semblance of decency, they
wanted to reward hard work.''
 &HT;    Today, King went on to say, those Reagan Democrats are ``looking
for someone like Reagan, but what they're seeing are these really
harsh, unrelenting, unforgiving, avenging-angel types _ that scares
them off. And as I look around the House of Representatives, there
are very few people who would be comfortable with Ronald Reagan in
terms of their attitudes _ the Democrats are the enemy, Bill
Clinton is evil, politics is evil.''
 &HT;    And yet Republican governors around the country, including
George Pataki, George W. Bush, Tommy Thompson and Christine
Whitman, have gained enormous popularity by emphasizing effective
government over moral or ideological campaigns. You won't see many
of these governors mounting the barricades on issues like
immigration or affirmative action, not to mention partial-birth
abortion.
 &HT;    Gingrich may have instituted the style and the rhetoric of total
war, but it is now a deep-seated reflex among the House
Republicans. It was, after all, Dick Armey, the Republican majority
leader, who said of Hillary Clinton, ``All her friends are
Marxists,'' and who referred to Barney Frank, the openly gay
Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, as ``Barney Fag.''
 &HT;    DeLay, the House whip, has compared the Environmental Protection
Agency to the Gestapo. DeLay has replaced Gingrich as the most
powerful figure in the House as well as the Democrats' extremist of
choice. He is a small businessman _ an exterminator, more precisely
and deliciously _ who represents the new middle-class suburbs that
have grown up outside of Houston, an area very similar
demographically to Gingrich's DeKalb County and also largely devoid
of the yeasty ethnic mix that, King would say, lent a certain
realism and restraint to the Reagan Democrats.
 &HT;    In recent years, DeLay has developed strong ties to the
Christian right. Both he and Armey are among the few congressional
members of the Council for National Policy, an organization of
right-wing political and religious leaders.
 &HT;    Randy Tate, the head of the Christian Coalition, used to be one
of DeLay's deputy whips, and they remain close. A number of
Republicans suggested to me, without questioning the depth of
DeLay's convictions, that he had recognized that if you want the
power that comes with a mass following in today's Republican Party,
you cultivate the Christian Right.
 &HT;    DeLay is not exactly a practitioner of the school of genteel
bipartisanship. He is known inside the Beltway as the Hammer, a
nickname that he cherishes like a scar from an old brawl. Shortly
after Tate won election to Congress from Washington in 1994, DeLay
sent a letter to PAC's listing the amounts each had given to Tate's
opponent.
 &HT;    ``I was surprised to see you opposed Randy Tate,'' he wrote.
``You now have the opportunity to work toward a positive future
relationship. ... Your immediate support for Randy Tate is
personally important to me and the Republican leadership team.''
DeLay had served notice that lapses into bipartisanship would no
longer be accepted. ``He is,'' as one prominent Republican said
wonderingly, ``almost harsher than Newt.''
 &HT;    Yet party leaders recognize that the rhetoric of total warfare,
of Barney Fag and the Gestapo, has not gone down well with the
American public. The party wants to substitute some smiling faces
for DeLay's angry glare and to restore the sunny optimism of
Reagan.
 &HT;    GOP advisers such as Reed and Luntz have begun to remind the
party of why it was that Reagan was so popular and masterful a
figure. Recently, in a private memo to party leaders, Luntz wrote:
``Think about how often we were on the tube last year 'blasting'
someone or something. ... Ronald Reagan hardly ever raised his
voice, yet his message was clear, persuasive and popular. Let us
learn from our Great Communicator.''
 &HT;    Luntz suggested the Reaganesque strategy of head-shaking
ridicule and even provided examples: ``Bill Clinton wants to spend
millions of your taxpayer dollars on dance lessons for convicts.
Convicts!! It's a prison. Can you visualize prisoners dancing? Who
leads?''
 &HT;    It is probably safe to say that neither DeLay nor Armey can be
trusted to bring off this joke with just the right tone of voice.
(During the president's most recent State of the Union Message,
cameras periodically focused on DeLay and Armey as they smirked and
grimaced and virtually sat on their hands to keep from having to
applaud.)
 &HT;    By giving his maiden speech in the well of the House rather than
in a partisan setting, Hastert scored points; and he has said that
he wants to speak regularly to Richard Gephardt, though an aide of
Gephardt's said that the meetings to date have been procedural
rather than substantive.
 &HT;    Several of the Republican legislators I spoke to said that they
are waiting for a sign _ a sign that Hastert realizes the need to
publicly affirm a new identity for the party. Yet the reason why
Hastert, or Luntz, may not be able to cure what ails the GOP is
that the problem is not simply the messenger or the tone of voice.
The party can not be jollied out of its hectoring moralism. That
part of the party that is beholden to, and identifies with, the
Christian right is profoundly at odds with the part that isn't, and
doesn't.
 &HT;    It is also true that the Republican standbys that Reagan could
count on _ communism, crime _ have either evaporated or lost their
edge of urgency.
 &HT;    Clinton has vowed to set aside 62 percent of the projected
surplus to shore up the Social Security system _ and the
Republicans have agreed _ but that still leaves nearly $100 billion
over the next two budget years. The Republicans want to use some or
all of that money for tax cuts, while the Democrats want to use it
for Medicare, a few far-more-modest tax cuts and the kind of
domestic initiatives that have been waiting in the wings for just
such a moment of historic prosperity. The Democrats, too, have an
impatient base.
 &HT;    What's more, the economy could finally tumble off the rails,
though Republicans can't permit themselves to openly root for a
recession. Finally, the GOP could come up with a presidential
candidate more charismatic than Al Gore, which wouldn't seem
terribly difficult to do. A lot of things could happen, but the
auguries are grim.
 &HT;    ``Right now,'' said one Republican strategist, ``we're whistling
past the graveyard.''

 THE PERSISTENCE of POLYGAMY

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Driving south on Utah's Highway 59, you slip out of the
subdivisions sprouting in the desert, ascend to a lonely stretch of
ink-colored juniper trees, then suddenly find yourself at the edge
of the last century. There on the Arizona border, tucked behind
towering flanks of red rock, is a town of about 5,000 people. Most
are Mormon fundamentalists, and most are outlaws: It is the largest
polygamous community in the United States.
 &HT;    Though polygamy is a felony, nobody has to hide from the law in
this town, called Hildale on the Utah side of the state line,
Colorado City on the other. More than a century after it was
outlawed, polygamy is flourishing in Utah and small pockets of the
American West, nurtured by religious directives and the hands-off
stance of legal authorities.
 &HT;    Laura Chapman, 36, is the 25th child from a family with four
mothers and 31 children, and she knows most of the people in
Hildale and Colorado City, even the few she is not related to by
blood. Chapman left the town years ago _ she calls it ``the land
that time forgot.'' Today she is one of a new group of women who
have fled plural families and want to draw attention to the reality
of modern polygamy.
 &HT;    Forget the sepia-toned notion of kindly Mormon patriarchs
frolicking with a bushel of happy wives, these women say. Forget
about the polygamy of Abraham or the Mormon pioneer Brigham Young.
 &HT;    Late-20th-century polygamy, practiced by people who seem
unconcerned about the law or public opinion, is a Dark Ages hybrid,
say women who have left the big families. They raise allegations of
sexual abuse, pedophilia and incest.
 &HT;    ``This is organized crime, operating under the cover of
religion,'' Chapman maintains.
 &HT;    If the charges of women such as Chapman have been shrugged off
before, that may be about to change. Last year a teen-age girl
emerged with a story of incest, child abuse and forced marriage at
the hands of one of Utah's biggest polygamous clans, the Kingstons
_ who are based right in Salt Lake City, within a few miles of the
domed capital building.
 &HT;    Whatever the outcome, Chapman and other ex-wives of polygamy
hope the resulting trials, scheduled to begin in April, will force
a reckoning with Utah's oldest ghost.
 &HT;    After the Mormon Church denounced polygamy and Utah outlawed it
in 1896 _ Washington had made this a condition of statehood - it
was thought that the practice of taking multiple wives would
ultimately disappear. But a century later the opposite has
happened, with anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 people living in
families where one man is married to 2, 3, 5, as many as 30 women.
 &HT;    No one has been prosecuted for polygamy in Utah for nearly 50
years, and the state's power structure has not made enforcement an
issue. Last year Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is
himself a descendant of polygamists, even said the practice is not
often prosecuted in part because ``these people have religious
freedoms'' (a statement he later amended in the wake of a public
outcry).
 &HT;    The practice is still a minority one in this state of 2 million
people, of course, and the mainstream Mormon leadership in Salt
Lake City strongly condemns it. But it survives in ``clans'' _
massive patriarchal cabals linked by bloodlines and business ties,
whose members generally tithe 10 percent of all wages and earnings
to their church.
 &HT;    Those leaders insist that their only crime is following the true
word of God _ they see the church's capitulation on polygamy as a
blasphemous mistake. Sexual abuse is rare, they insist, and when it
occurs it is not tolerated.
 &HT;    There are at least four major clans in Utah. One of these
polygamous empires, based about 40 minutes south of Salt Lake, in
Bluffdale, is run by Owen Allred, age 84. The state has long
estimated its membership at about 5,000 people.
 &HT;    But Janet Bennion, a Utah Valley State College anthropologist
who spent five years studying the Allreds for a recent book,
``Women of Principle'' (Oxford University Press), says the number
is closer to 10,000, with clusters all over the West.
 &HT;    At the Allred compound, the headquarters is a huge, windowless
two-story building facing the Wasatch mountain range. Arrayed
around it are massive houses, with two or three minivans in many of
the driveways.
 &HT;    Lillian Bowles spent most of her life on this patch of arid
land. She grew up in a trailer not far from Bluffdale's church, one
of 40 children in a family in which her mother was one of eight
wives. She is not even sure where she fits in the family
chronology. ``I think I'm No. 17,'' she says. She remembers a life
of claustrophobia and fear of the outside world. ``I knew early on
that what we were doing was against the law,'' says Bowles, who is
26. ``We were always taught to hide. We couldn't play in the front
yard. When we drove somewhere, it was always 'Duck!' when you
passed a police car.''
 &HT;    At 16, she wanted to leave. But like other women who have fled
polygamy, she says she had no idea how to. ``We were taught early
on that we were God's chosen people, and everyone else was
condemned to hell. If you left, you were condemned.''
 &HT;    At age 17, she married a man who told her it was better to get
married young, rather than wait to be a third or fourth bride.
After six years of marriage, she says, Bowles left her husband when
he decided take on another wife.
 &HT;    Rowenna Erickson, 59, told me a similar tale when she described
her life within another major clan, the Kingstons. She married her
brother-in-law, Charles L. Kingston, and produced eight children.
 &HT;    ``The other wives kept telling me how this was all so wonderful
because we were going to heaven,'' she says between baby-sitting
chores for grandchildren in Salt Lake City. ``But if it was so
wonderful, how come I felt so horrible?''
 &HT;    I asked her if she was ever in love with her husband. ``It was
business,'' she says. ``Produce the babies. Don't question your
husband. But still, you get jealous. I remember when my husband had
his eyes on a very young girl. My sister and I were so hurt.''
 &HT;    She went on to explain a marital routine I heard from members of
polygamous families all over Utah, a sexual-rotation schedule with
all the romance of being a hen at a poultry ranch. ``When you're
ovulating, the patriarch is called,'' she says.
 &HT;    Polygamous leaders tend to shrug off stories such as those told
by Bowles, Erickson and Chapman, dismissing them as bitterness with
a political agenda. But they may have a more difficult time
explaining away an episode that rocked Utah last spring, when a
sobbing, badly bruised 16-year-old girl placed a 911 call from a
truck stop in northern Utah.
 &HT;    She told the police a story of indentured barbarism, alleging
her father had forced her into becoming the 15th wife of her uncle.
When she tried to flee, she maintained, she was whisked to a family
ostrich ranch, taken into a barn and whipped by her father.
 &HT;    The leaders of the Kingston clan run one of the biggest and
wealthiest family business empires in Utah. With 1,500 members and
interests in everything from restaurants to casinos, the clan is
worth $150 million or more, state officials estimate. The clan
operates much of its business out of an old brick office on State
Street just outside downtown Salt Lake City. The building has no
identification on the outside, save an address.
 &HT;    In a December pretrial hearing, the girl gave a hint of what her
life was like inside the clan. Her marriage was arranged by her
father and uncle; the latter had sex with her the first time at her
mother's home.
 &HT;    ``I guess it was my night, so he came over,'' the girl
testified. Then she was moved into a small apartment, with another
wife, one door away from a third wife. All the while, the girl
said, she was terrified. ``I felt trapped.''
 &HT;    The girl's uncle David O. Kingston has been charged with three
counts of incest and one count of unlawful sexual conduct. Her
father, John D. Kingston, has been charged with child abuse. The
two brothers will be tried separately in April, and both have
pleaded not guilty. (The father's lawyer _ and cousin _ Carl E.
Kingston refused to talk to me.)
 &HT;    But even in the face of the girl's court testimony that she had
been forced to marry her uncle and join 14 other wives, the state
has chosen not to bring polygamy charges.
 &HT;    State officials insist the law is unenforceable because most
polygamists have a marriage certificate only for the first bride;
the others are sealed in church ceremonies, without a paper trail
necessary for proof of crime.
 &HT;    The last major attempt at prosecuting anyone on polygamy charges
was in 1953, in Hildale/Colorado City _ then called Short Creek. A
big raid on the compound was written about and photographed by Life
magazine, and what resulted was a furor over families being torn
apart by the state.
 &HT;    Last year, six women from plural marriages _ including Bowles,
Erickson and Chapman _ founded one of the most unusual private
outreach groups in the country, an advocacy organization called
Tapestry of Polygamy. When such women hear Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
intone about the sanctity of law and President Clinton's sexual
misdeeds, they want to shout from the top of the Mormon Temple:
``What about polygamy?''
 &HT;    Prompted in part by Tapestry, the state attorney general's
office recently sent emissaries to the Allred compound to discuss
things such as statutory rape, child abuse, the minimum wage and
other basic legal facts of modern American life. They gave out
phone numbers. According to the attorney general's office, dozens
of calls have come in _ women and children asking basic questions
about the outside world.
 &HT;    When Chief Deputy Attorney General Reed Richards said last year
that polygamy was not only nearly impossible to prosecute but,
technically, not a crime at all, it took the largely poor and
unschooled ex-wives of polygamous men to point out the law to him.
Polygamy is in fact covered by the statute that makes bigamy a
felony, the women noted, and the law says nothing about a marriage
certificate being needed for proof of crime, only that a husband or
wife ``purports to marry another person.''
 &HT;    I read that statute to Richards and mentioned that prominent
polygamists in Utah had their own Web sites and seemed to be
bragging about breaking the law. One man, Graydon Henderson, whom I
spoke to, lives openly with his five wives and 21 children in a
suburb just south of Salt Lake.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a bit afraid of the law,'' he told me. ``It's not even
worth worrying about.'' Richards finally said that he has no idea
why polygamy was not prosecuted in his state. But he added, ``If we
cracked down on it, I think it would all go underground.''
 &HT;    In Hildale/Colorado City today and in the Allred and Kingston
compounds, residents consider themselves the followers of the true
Mormon Church. In their view, the heretics are the ones operating
out of Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake.
 &HT;    On a tour of Temple Square, the global headquarters of the
Mormon religion, one of the fastest-growing in the world, I asked
the guide about the wives of Brigham Young, a founder of the Mormon
Church. We were in a former home of Young's, the Beehive House,
about a block from the Temple, and the guide was explaining how the
patriarch's wife made bread.
 &HT;    ``Which wife?'' I asked. Young had 27.
 &HT;    ``These other wives were mostly widows,'' the tour guide
replied.
 &HT;    But that sort of historical revisionism ends up infuriating both
the women who have fled polygamy and the people who defend it.
 &HT;    Chapman wants Utah's Mormons to acknowledge that some of their
most revered founding fathers had child brides. Fundamentalists
want the basic facts of the polygamists' past to remain a central
part of the Mormon narrative.
 &HT;    What seems to interest outsiders the most about polygamy is the
sex. The famed 19th-century eroticist, Sir Richard Burton, traveled
to Utah to have a firsthand look at a practice he considered quite
natural. Some people who defend modern polygamy take the same
approach, saying men are, after all, promiscuous animals by nature.
 &HT;    ``You look at the nature of men, and most of them are
polygamous,'' says Mary Potter, who was once one of three wives of
a policeman in a Salt Lake City suburb. (The family later split
up.) She has now formed a group in support of plural marriages, and
openly frets about ``having to wear a Scarlet P,'' as she calls the
cries for legal action. ``In polygamy, men are properly
channeled.''
 &HT;    She and other supporters of polygamy point to recent studies
that maintain that men are evolutionally wired for multiple sexual
partners. ``There's a desire on the part of men to have a diversity
of mates _ it's their natural urge _ so sex is definitely a
motivating factor for many of the patriarchs,'' Bennion says.
 &HT;    Viagra has been a blessing for a few of the older patriarchs,
she also notes. ``Some members of the Allred group are using Viagra
because they just can't keep up with their younger wives,'' she
says. ``There is a big age difference for many of these men. If
you've got three or four sexually active wives, that's a lot of
work.''
 &HT;    With its reputation for divinely sanctioned promiscuity, the
Hildale and Colorado City community attracts its share of misguided
visitors, says Dan Barlow, who is the town's mayor and an elder in
the church that owns nearly every house here.
 &HT;    ``They think what goes on here is all about sex,'' he says.
``It's foolish to make such a claim because we live a hundred miles
or so from Las Vegas. If people want sex, that's where they should
go.''
 &HT;    The mayor took me on a tour. The houses he showed me were huge,
some with as many as 15 to 20 bedrooms and others that looked more
like half-finished motels or dormitories. On a weekday afternoon,
every female in town was wearing an ankle-length dress.
 &HT;    ``These are happy, joyous homes,'' Barlow said. With its
extraordinary rate of reproduction, the community is growing by
better than 10 percent a year, he said.
 &HT;    As for the allegations that boys paw at their sisters and old
men prey on young girls, he shakes his head. ``Whenever you have
people living together, you're going to have people problems, the
same here as anywhere else.''
 &HT;    Prompted by the recent furor, two bills introduced in the
current state legislative session directly target polygamy. One
would raise the legal age of marriage from 14 to 16. The other
would provide money and shelters for women who want to flee but may
not meet the specific admittance rules of traditional halfway
homes.
 &HT;    ``What these women have brought into broad daylight is a civil
rights issue that is second to none in the history of Utah,'' says
State Sen. Scott Howell, the leader of the Democratic legislative
minority in Utah, who introduced one of the bills.
 &HT;    ``Here, we've got all the world coming to town for the Olympics.
Do we really want to be known as the place where we let old men
marry little girls?''
 &HT;    For the women who brought polygamy out of Utah's closet, the
2002 Olympics remain the trump card. More than 10,000 visiting
journalists will be deluged with information about the world's
greatest snow, the glowing city in the Wasatch, the spotless
facilities.
 &HT;    And then, when they grow tired of the luge and the Tabernacle
Choir stories, the press will have no trouble finding the women of
Tapestry, who will tell them about Utah's other heritage.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States,
gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a
curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of
the president's affection _ the artifacts that may testify to Bill
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them
are gone.
 &HT;    Whither the gifts _ the hatpin, ``Leaves of Grass,'' the Black
Dog T-shirt _ and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made
for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by
which presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and
the public imagination?
 &HT;    ``It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,''
admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with
the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy
assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel
investigations that followed.
 &HT;    The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings
against the president, but eventually, Tilley said, ``we would
assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a
piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly
interesting investigation.''
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says
that ``normally'' such subpoenaed items go ``back to the rightful
owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has
not been settled. ``Legal research is being done right now,'' she
says, referring to all the materials held by the various
independent counsels.
 &HT;    Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and
Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables,
and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called the most
sentimental'' of the president's presents.
 &HT;    If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent
Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are
likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate _ our first fully
curated presidential scandal _ special prosecutions have assured
the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality.
 &HT;    The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia
used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that
followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with
hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what
Tilley calls ``the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation
offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she
erased 18 minutes of tape.
 &HT;    Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer
hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security
Council. Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never
requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in
an exhibit on either subject. But a number of presidential
librarians point out that these institutions balance their
scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might
suspect.
 &HT;    The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just
acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters
taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton
Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to
get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to
own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least
national humiliation.
 &HT;    Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library
in Austin, recalls how LBJ, not too long before his death, judged
some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not
nearly ``mean enough.''
 &HT;    He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive
items, including one postcard that read: ``I demand that you as a
gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton
says he has ``tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed
ballot box that may have helped send ``Landslide Lyndon'' to the
Senate in 1948.
 &HT;    Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of
both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors
gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this
presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the
existence of government-run libraries (there are none prior to
Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the chief
executive.
 &HT;    The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after
Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the president's
secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the
president's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept
in his Oval Office desk.
 &HT;    Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the
Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House
managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that
their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture
is moved and used elsewhere.
 &HT;    The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with
one of the misprinted pens _ Untied States Senator, says the barrel
_ used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object
may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the
sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which
includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its
later repeal.
 &HT;    The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable
without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is
written right across the offending language in the original
document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial,
during which Sen. Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage
by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another
drawer.
 &HT;    (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct
a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in
plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950s
Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.)
 &HT;    Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton
Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this
future facility will have to address the events that led to
impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the
gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will
be made by professionals at some later time. ``We don't even have
an architect on board yet,'' he says.
 &HT;    The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the
impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one
thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal.
 &HT;    More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual,
videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost
literally alive with its stain of presidential DNA. It is a messy,
assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization
could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts.
 &HT;    No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the
connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more
compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money
might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much
awe or heartbreak _ like, say, the string with which Lincoln
repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of
Congress _ but like it or not, it too now belongs to the ages.

 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    They'll try almost anything. Like the time Barbara Walters found
out that William Ginsburg, then Monica Lewinsky's lawyer, couldn't
get bran flakes for lunch at the Cosmos Club. Walters quickly
hopped a plane from New York with his favored food. Katie Couric
once sent skater Tonya Harding's lawyer a cake frosted with the
words WE REFUSE TO STOP SUCKING UP.
 &HT;    As TV talk shows and newsmagazines proliferate, the pursuit of
``gets,'' as high-profile interviewees are known in the business,
is reaching such a fever pitch that some anchors and reporters
wonder what kind of business they are in.
 &HT;    ``We all collectively find it repulsive,'' says ``20/20's''
Connie Chung. ``It's made reporting so much harder because we are
spending half our time booking instead of reporting.''
 &HT;    ``It's something I'm not comfortable with,'' ``60 Minutes''' Ed
Bradley confesses. ``But it's unavoidable.''
 &HT;    The competition isn't likely to cool down. If anything, it
promises to get worse. ``20/20'' has expanded to four nights a
week. ``Dateline NBC'' now puts on five shows a week, while ``60
Minutes'' has expanded to a second hour. Add to that the three
24-hour all-news networks _ MSNBC, Fox and CNN _ and consider that
CNN alone books 12,000 interviews a year. Stir in ``Hard Copy,''
``Inside Edition,'' Oprah, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Charlie Rose,
Leeza, Roseanne and Don Imus, and you have a recipe for insanity.
 &HT;    ``I was away from television for almost 2-1/2 years,'' Chung
says, ``and when I came back, I found the competition much worse.
Before, the arena was pretty much limited to big-name 'gets.' Now
it's spread to the kind of stories you find on the back pages of a
newspaper.
 &HT;    ``Just about any story we think about doing, whether we've read
it in a newspaper, heard it on the radio or come upon it through
word of mouth _ by the time you get there, every other network,
cable station and talk show is already racing to the scene.''
 &HT;    When the trophy is big enough, even the biggest names in
television are forced to hold their noses and pursue hookers,
felons, even convicted murderers. But most of the day-to-day work
in the guest-getting sweepstakes is done by segment producers, or
bookers, as they are known. Most are women, and they are pretty
intense, waging warlike campaigns to land the really elusive
guests.
 &HT;    Carol Ross Joynt, who used to be a booker for Larry King, spent
more than a year helping nail down Al Pacino, who was No. 1 on
King's wish list. ``I sent flowers on his birthday,'' Joynt says.
``I would send flowers on the announcement of a new movie. I made
friends with his assistant. I wrote intelligent-sounding but
fawning letters. When he appeared in a play in New York, I got
Larry good seats down front and made arrangements to go backstage
afterward. Finally, after a long telephone call that Larry placed
to Al, he agreed to come on.''
 &HT;    One producer tells about the scene outside the courtroom in Los
Angeles the day the O.J. Simpson verdict was announced. Every TV
and print outlet in the country was trying to get reaction from
Nicole Simpson's sisters and mother, who were being escorted
through the jammed hallway to a waiting elevator.
 &HT;    Suddenly a booker from ABC reared back and hurled his cell phone
50 feet across the top of the crowd, screaming ``Denise.''
Amazingly, Denise Brown caught the phone. Later, the booker, who
was working for Diane Sawyer, called his number on the cell phone,
reached Brown and got the interview for Sawyer.
 &HT;    Mostly, success is a matter of patience, persistence and charm.
``Does their manner help? Absolutely,'' says Susan Carpenter
McMillan, who fields interview requests for presidential accuser
Paula Jones. ``Larry King's people are wonderful. John Gibson's
people are wonderful. High pressure does not play nearly as well.
When they tell me, 'We have the highest ratings' or 'We'll get
Paula's story out there the way she wants to get it out,' I find
that insulting.''
 &HT;    ``These young bookers have learned to say things like 'It will
make my career' or 'I'll get a big raise,''' says Linda Tripp's
friend Lucianne Goldberg, who was in demand as a stand-in for Tripp
when the Lewinsky scandal broke. ``How can you turn them down?''
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal focused a lot of attention on Washington
``gets.'' Tops on everyone's list was Lewinsky. Once it was
announced that she was giving the first interview to Walters, the
scramble did not stop as producers fought tooth and nail for the
right to the second interview with her.
 &HT;    Tripp, Ken Starr, Vernon Jordan and other players in the Clinton
drama also have been the subjects of heavy wooing. ``I have talked
to Linda Tripp half a dozen times at least,'' Mike Wallace says.
``I never promised to make her America's sweetheart, but I did tell
her, 'Look, if you decide you're going to do it, everybody is going
to ask you the same questions, Linda. You and I had a good
chemistry (when they had dinner at L'Auberge Chez Francois.) There
were five of us there. We all sat around and shot the breeze. We
had a drink, then another drink, and if you do that, it naturally
establishes a chemistry.''
 &HT;    At ABC, over the years, the brass have been trying, mostly
without success, to level the playing field between Sawyer and
Walters, but Walters continues to rack up the big ones _ Ted
Kennedy after Chappaquiddick, Michael J. Fox on his Parkinson's
disease, Colin Powell, Christopher Reeve, Elizabeth Taylor, John
Hinckley's parents, Muhammad Ali, Margaret Thatcher, Vaclav Havel
and every American president since Richard Nixon.
 &HT;    The Walters treatment includes everything from flowers, fruit
and charming notes to tea and cookies at her Fifth Avenue apartment
in New York. Her biggest selling points are her empathetic manner
and the big audiences she delivers. But she is also famously
aggressive in pursuit of her quarry.
 &HT;    During the 1992 presidential campaign, her colleague Donaldson
had lined up back-to-back interviews with Bill Clinton, George Bush
and Ross Perot on the same program. At the last minute, Perot
backed out. He had been contacted by Walters, who reminded him of
an earlier promise to give her the first interview.
 &HT;    Another time, Sawyer was getting ready to tape an interview with
Katharine Hepburn. Suddenly, Hepburn took a call from Walters, who
told her to hold everything: She would be right over to do the
interview herself.
 &HT;    Sawyer has been no slouch in getting guests. She did the first
interviews with Tonya Harding, Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie
Presley, Marla Maples, caning victim Michael Fay, O.J. detective
Mark Fuhrman, newly outed Ellen DeGeneres and the family of Nicole
Brown Simpson, whom she interviewed three times.
 &HT;    Sawyer's presence has done wonders for the guest roster since
she began cohosting ``Good Morning America.'' Still, she finds it
hard to compete with Walters' Rolodex. Yet when Sawyer's contract
came up in 1994, and the other networks were offering her the moon,
she chose to stay at ABC. A big factor in her decision, it was
said, was the creation of a central booking unit meant to keep
ABC's magazine shows from competing with one another.
 &HT;    ``What I couldn't stand was that I was making phone calls on
stories (for ``PrimeTime Live''), ``Day One'' was making phone
calls on stories, ``20/20'' was making phone calls _ it was crazy,
taking all our time doing this,'' Sawyer told an interviewer.
 &HT;    She has a point. One person who kept a log of calls _ the
public-relations executive hired by the parents of child beauty
JonBenet Ramsey _ was overwhelmed, not just by the number of calls
but by the number of different people from the same network who
contacted him.
 &HT;    According to Chung, who wrote a paper on the business of
``gets'' while she was a fellow at Harvard, the executive got 23
calls from ABC News staffers in one month. He also reported getting
18 calls from CBS News, 20 from NBC News _ not counting CNBC and
MSNBC _ 22 from CNN and ``Larry King Live,'' nine from Fox, plus
assorted pleas from ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy,'' Don Imus and
others.
 &HT;    The new booking unit at ABC was supposed to eliminate in-house
competition, making sure that both Sawyer and Walters got their
share of trophy guests. In fact, insiders say, the unit never
really worked. It couldn't function without Walters' cooperation,
and she refused to play ball.
 &HT;    After Westin assumed the helm of ABC News, he too fell under
Sawyer's spell. ``David positively lights up when she walks in the
room,'' a corporate source says. ``When Diane sets her sights on
dazzling someone, rarely if ever do I see a man, a powerful man,
fail to succumb. They just flop right over.''
 &HT;    Westin came up with a new solution to the Walters/Sawyer
competition: He merged ``PrimeTime Live,'' Sawyer's showcase, with
Walters' ``20/20.'' At the same time, he personally intervened on
Sawyer's behalf to get a hotly pursued interview with Kenneth
Starr. Westin committed to doing a full hour with him _ -something
``20/20's'' chief rival, ``60 Minutes,'' virtually never does.
 &HT;    Starr also wanted the interview to take place right after he
finished testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in
November. Westin offered Starr the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, a
night he said had a large viewing audience, and he pledged to
promote the interview.
 &HT;    Starr's appearance drew an audience of nearly 15 million people,
but the interview did not go as his people hoped, even though he
spent four hours taping with Sawyer. Starr's friends complain that
Sawyer was overly adversarial, that her questions were too long,
that his answers were cut down to snippets.
 &HT;    Journalists who watched the interview probably saw nothing amiss
in the way Sawyer conducted the interview. But other players may
have drawn some cautionary lessons from Starr's appearance.
``People are becoming more sophisticated about live vs. taped,''
says Gail Evans, who oversees the booking operation at CNN. ``You
hear them say, 'I'm only going to do live interviews, where I'm
sure of the way my answers will be used.'''
 &HT;    The reaction to Sawyer's piece on Starr illustrates the line
anchors and reporters have to walk if they want to bag the biggest
game. Those who have a reputation for being too prosecutorial often
lose out.
 &HT;    ``Does it hamstring me? I'm sure that it does,'' says tough guy
Wallace. ``It gets frustrating when I hear people have said, 'Oh,
good Lord, you're going to be interviewed by whom?' In one way,
it's flattering, I suppose. On the other hand, it's a myth.
Everybody asks the same questions. They just ask them in different
ways.''
 &HT;    If interviewers are perceived as going too easy, they risk
taking a shellacking in the press. That's what happened to Ed
Bradley after his ``60 Minutes'' interview with Kathleen Willey,
the woman who claimed to have been groped by President Clinton.
During the interview, Bradley gently led her through her story,
never asking her whether she had pursued a book deal (she had) or
if she remained friendly with Clinton after the alleged incident
(she did). Bradley was even criticized by friends of Willey's, who
complained that if he had been tougher, she wouldn't have been open
to so much White House-inspired criticism in the press afterward.
 &HT;    These days, professional handlers keep score for their clients,
and woe unto the journalist or talk-show host who says something
perceived as unfriendly. At one point, Walters was making headway
with her request to interview Paula Jones. But she lost the chance
after a panelist on Walters' syndicated show made an unflattering
remark about McMillan, Jones' spokeswoman.
 &HT;    ``One of the things I believe in strongly,'' McMillan says:
``You really pay back your friends and punish your enemies. It will
be a cold day in hell before Paula does any of the late-night
shows. After all the cruel things they said about her, comparing
her nose to a penis, they can just forget it!''
 &HT;    The one thing nobody on either side of the transaction wants to
talk about is the deals that are made. In exchange for getting the
first interview, broadcasters routinely allow celebrities and other
public figures to dictate the terms of their appearance. ``The
length of the segment is open to discussion, the areas of
questioning can be limited, as well as which of the personalities
or reporters will actually do the interview,'' says Random House
publicist Stuart Applebaum. ``But most of all the timing is
important.''
 &HT;    Timing was a big issue with Lewinsky, who was not paid for her
interview with Walters but had an understanding with ``20/20'' that
the interview would coincide with the release of her book. She also
retained the rights to the proceeds from any sales of the Walters
interview to foreign broadcasters. While that feature of her
agreement with Walters was a little unusual, the promotional
interview, in which celebrities tout their latest movie, book or TV
appearance, has become so standard that even the critics have
stopped bemoaning the naked commercialism of the transactions.
 &HT;    Occasionally, questions are raised about deals that go beyond
mere commercialism. Tom Rosenstiel reported in Esquire that one of
the figures in the 1989 Menendez brothers' murder trial told ABC
the story had to have a positive tone and demanded script approval.
ABC capitulated on both counts, according to Rosenstiel.
 &HT;    On one point, the established outlets are firm: They don't pay
for interviews. However, foreign broadcasters do: Britain's Channel
4 is paying Lewinsky an estimated $640,000 for its interview.
Domestic syndicated shows such as ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy''
and ``Roseanne'' also pay. Such shows are said to have showered
hundreds of thousands of dollars on friends, employees and
relatives of Michael Jackson's for information about him when he
was being accused of pedophilia.
 &HT;    Money occasionally rears its head at the Fox network as well.
Although Fox has denied paying Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, for its exclusive interview with him, he reportedly got
$600,000 for home movies and still photos of his sister.
 &HT;    About the only thing the networks and shows such as ``Oprah''
will pay for are airfare, meals and hotel rooms. And in hotly
competitive situations, the subjects may receive small ``tokens of
esteem.'' ''You get flowers, candy,'' Lucianne Goldberg says.
``Nothing you wouldn't get from a nice first date.''

``Does their manner help? Absolutely,'' says Susan Carpenter
McMillan, who fields interview requests for presidential accuser
Paula Jones. ``Larry King's people are wonderful. John Gibson's
people are wonderful. High pressure does not play nearly as well.
When they tell me, 'We have the highest ratings' or 'We'll get
Paula's story out there the way she wants to get it out,' I find
that insulting.''
 &HT;    ``These young bookers have learned to say things like 'It will
make my career' or 'I'll get a big raise,''' says Linda Tripp's
friend Lucianne Goldberg, who was in demand as a stand-in for Tripp
when the Lewinsky scandal broke. ``How can you turn them down?''
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal focused a lot of attention on Washington
``gets.'' Tops on everyone's list was Lewinsky. Once it was
announced that she was giving the first interview to Walters, the
scramble did not stop as producers fought tooth and nail for the
right to the second interview with her.
 &HT;    Tripp, Ken Starr, Vernon Jordan and other players in the Clinton
drama also have been the subjects of heavy wooing. ``I have talked
to Linda Tripp half a dozen times at least,'' Mike Wallace says.
``I never promised to make her America's sweetheart, but I did tell
her, 'Look, if you decide you're going to do it, everybody is going
to ask you the same questions, Linda. You and I had a good
chemistry (when they had dinner at L'Auberge Chez Francois.) There
were five of us there. We all sat around and shot the breeze. We
had a drink, then another drink, and if you do that, it naturally
establishes a chemistry.''
 &HT;    At ABC, over the years, the brass have been trying, mostly
without success, to level the playing field between Sawyer and
Walters, but Walters continues to rack up the big ones _ Ted
Kennedy after Chappaquiddick, Michael J. Fox on his Parkinson's
disease, Colin Powell, Christopher Reeve, Elizabeth Taylor, John
Hinckley's parents, Muhammad Ali, Margaret Thatcher, Vaclav Havel
and every American president since Richard Nixon.
 &HT;    The Walters treatment includes everything from flowers, fruit
and charming notes to tea and cookies at her Fifth Avenue apartment
in New York. Her biggest selling points are her empathetic manner
and the big audiences she delivers. But she is also famously
aggressive in pursuit of her quarry.
 &HT;    During the 1992 presidential campaign, her colleague Donaldson
had lined up back-to-back interviews with Bill Clinton, George Bush
and Ross Perot on the same program. At the last minute, Perot
backed out. He had been contacted by Walters, who reminded him of
an earlier promise to give her the first interview.
 &HT;    Another time, Sawyer was getting ready to tape an interview with
Katharine Hepburn. Suddenly, Hepburn took a call from Walters, who
told her to hold everything: She would be right over to do the
interview herself.
 &HT;    Sawyer has been no slouch in getting guests. She did the first
interviews with Tonya Harding, Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie
Presley, Marla Maples, caning victim Michael Fay, O.J. detective
Mark Fuhrman, newly outed Ellen DeGeneres and the family of Nicole
Brown Simpson, whom she interviewed three times.
 &HT;    Sawyer's presence has done wonders for the guest roster since
she began cohosting ``Good Morning America.'' Still, she finds it
hard to compete with Walters' Rolodex. Yet when Sawyer's contract
came up in 1994, and the other networks were offering her the moon,
she chose to stay at ABC. A big factor in her decision, it was
said, was the creation of a central booking unit meant to keep
ABC's magazine shows from competing with one another.
 &HT;    ``What I couldn't stand was that I was making phone calls on
stories (for ``PrimeTime Live''), ``Day One'' was making phone
calls on stories, ``20/20'' was making phone calls _ it was crazy,
taking all our time doing this,'' Sawyer told an interviewer.
 &HT;    She has a point. One person who kept a log of calls _ the
public-relations executive hired by the parents of child beauty
JonBenet Ramsey _ was overwhelmed, not just by the number of calls
but by the number of different people from the same network who
contacted him.
 &HT;    According to Chung, who wrote a paper on the business of
``gets'' while she was a fellow at Harvard, the executive got 23
calls from ABC News staffers in one month. He also reported getting
18 calls from CBS News, 20 from NBC News _ not counting CNBC and
MSNBC _ 22 from CNN and ``Larry King Live,'' nine from Fox, plus
assorted pleas from ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy,'' Don Imus and
others.
 &HT;    The new booking unit at ABC was supposed to eliminate in-house
competition, making sure that both Sawyer and Walters got their
share of trophy guests. In fact, insiders say, the unit never
really worked. It couldn't function without Walters' cooperation,
and she refused to play ball.
 &HT;    After Westin assumed the helm of ABC News, he too fell under
Sawyer's spell. ``David positively lights up when she walks in the
room,'' a corporate source says. ``When Diane sets her sights on
dazzling someone, rarely if ever do I see a man, a powerful man,
fail to succumb. They just flop right over.''
 &HT;    Westin came up with a new solution to the Walters/Sawyer
competition: He merged ``PrimeTime Live,'' Sawyer's showcase, with
Walters' ``20/20.'' At the same time, he personally intervened on
Sawyer's behalf to get a hotly pursued interview with Kenneth
Starr. Westin committed to doing a full hour with him _ -something
``20/20's'' chief rival, ``60 Minutes,'' virtually never does.
 &HT;    Starr also wanted the interview to take place right after he
finished testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in
November. Westin offered Starr the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, a
night he said had a large viewing audience, and he pledged to
promote the interview.
 &HT;    Starr's appearance drew an audience of nearly 15 million people,
but the interview did not go as his people hoped, even though he
spent four hours taping with Sawyer. Starr's friends complain that
Sawyer was overly adversarial, that her questions were too long,
that his answers were cut down to snippets.
 &HT;    Journalists who watched the interview probably saw nothing amiss
in the way Sawyer conducted the interview. But other players may
have drawn some cautionary lessons from Starr's appearance.
``People are becoming more sophisticated about live vs. taped,''
says Gail Evans, who oversees the booking operation at CNN. ``You
hear them say, 'I'm only going to do live interviews, where I'm
sure of the way my answers will be used.'''
 &HT;    The reaction to Sawyer's piece on Starr illustrates the line
anchors and reporters have to walk if they want to bag the biggest
game. Those who have a reputation for being too prosecutorial often
lose out.
 &HT;    ``Does it hamstring me? I'm sure that it does,'' says tough guy
Wallace. ``It gets frustrating when I hear people have said, 'Oh,
good Lord, you're going to be interviewed by whom?' In one way,
it's flattering, I suppose. On the other hand, it's a myth.
Everybody asks the same questions. They just ask them in different
ways.''
 &HT;    If interviewers are perceived as going too easy, they risk
taking a shellacking in the press. That's what happened to Ed
Bradley after his ``60 Minutes'' interview with Kathleen Willey,
the woman who claimed to have been groped by President Clinton.
During the interview, Bradley gently led her through her story,
never asking her whether she had pursued a book deal (she had) or
if she remained friendly with Clinton after the alleged incident
(she did). Bradley was even criticized by friends of Willey's, who
complained that if he had been tougher, she wouldn't have been open
to so much White House-inspired criticism in the press afterward.
 &HT;    These days, professional handlers keep score for their clients,
and woe unto the journalist or talk-show host who says something
perceived as unfriendly. At one point, Walters was making headway
with her request to interview Paula Jones. But she lost the chance
after a panelist on Walters' syndicated show made an unflattering
remark about McMillan, Jones' spokeswoman.
 &HT;    ``One of the things I believe in strongly,'' McMillan says:
``You really pay back your friends and punish your enemies. It will
be a cold day in hell before Paula does any of the late-night
shows. After all the cruel things they said about her, comparing
her nose to a penis, they can just forget it!''
 &HT;    The one thing nobody on either side of the transaction wants to
talk about is the deals that are made. In exchange for getting the
first interview, broadcasters routinely allow celebrities and other
public figures to dictate the terms of their appearance. ``The
length of the segment is open to discussion, the areas of
questioning can be limited, as well as which of the personalities
or reporters will actually do the interview,'' says Random House
publicist Stuart Applebaum. ``But most of all the timing is
important.''
 &HT;    Timing was a big issue with Lewinsky, who was not paid for her
interview with Walters but had an understanding with ``20/20'' that
the interview would coincide with the release of her book. She also
retained the rights to the proceeds from any sales of the Walters
interview to foreign broadcasters. While that feature of her
agreement with Walters was a little unusual, the promotional
interview, in which celebrities tout their latest movie, book or TV
appearance, has become so standard that even the critics have
stopped bemoaning the naked commercialism of the transactions.
 &HT;    Occasionally, questions are raised about deals that go beyond
mere commercialism. Tom Rosenstiel reported in Esquire that one of
the figures in the 1989 Menendez brothers' murder trial told ABC
the story had to have a positive tone and demanded script approval.
ABC capitulated on both counts, according to Rosenstiel.
 &HT;    On one point, the established outlets are firm: They don't pay
for interviews. However, foreign broadcasters do: Britain's Channel
4 is paying Lewinsky an estimated $640,000 for its interview.
Domestic syndicated shows such as ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy''
and ``Roseanne'' also pay. Such shows are said to have showered
hundreds of thousands of dollars on friends, employees and
relatives of Michael Jackson's for information about him when he
was being accused of pedophilia.
 &HT;    Money occasionally rears its head at the Fox network as well.
Although Fox has denied paying Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, for its exclusive interview with him, he reportedly got
$600,000 for home movies and still photos of his sister.
 &HT;    About the only thing the networks and shows such as ``Oprah''
will pay for are airfare, meals and hotel rooms. And in hotly
competitive situations, the subjects may receive small ``tokens of
esteem.'' ''You get flowers, candy,'' Lucianne Goldberg says.
``Nothing you wouldn't get from a nice first date.''

 By ANDY BEHRMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ___ He was hooked up, switched on, blissed out. __
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I'm lying on a gurney in the operating room at Gracie Square
Hospital, in New York City. I feel as if I'm waiting for either the
scariest roller-coaster ride of my life or for my own execution.
 &HT;    I'm convinced that if I live, my brain will be reduced to a
blank Rolodex. I look down at my bare feet. A flawless loafer tan
line. Maybe I'll die wearing flesh-tone loafers.
 &HT;    As far as manic-depressive tales go, my stories are typical. My
illness went undiagnosed for a decade, a period of euphoric highs
and desperate lows highlighted by $25,000 shopping sprees,
impetuous trips to Tokyo, Paris and Milan, drug and alcohol binges,
days without sleep, sex with strangers and jail time.
 &HT;    After seeing eight psychiatrists, I finally received a diagnosis
of bipolar disorder on my 32nd birthday. Over the next year and a
half, I was treated unsuccessfully with more than 30 medications.
My suburban New Jersey upbringing, my achievements as a film major
at Wesleyan University and a thriving career in public relations
couldn't help me.
 &HT;    April 11, 1995. I'm in front of Barneys, the upscale clothiers,
when it finally happens. My skin starts tingling and I feel as if
my insides are spilling onto the sidewalk. Everything moves in slow
motion. I can't hear. I rush home and climb into the empty bathtub.
I lie still for hours.
 &HT;    As a last resort, I'm admitted to the hospital for ECT,
electroconvulsive therapy, more commonly known as electroshock. The
doctor explains the procedure to me. But most important, he tells
me that I will get better.
 &HT;    _ Seven a.m. The doctor and his team, as well as a group of
residents, hover over me. Standing room only. I'm about to have my
brains jolted with 200 volts of electricity while 10 note-taking
spectators gawk. I'm thinking about being struck by lightning and
the electric chair. I'm joking incessantly to fend off the terror.
Is it too late for the call from the governor? No call. The show
must go on.
 &HT;    ``Got an Amstel Light?'' I ask. No response. I give the thumbs
up. An IV of Brevital, an anesthetic, is stuck into my arm,
silencing me. I struggle to stay awake _ a losing battle. But I've
been told what will happen: an IV of succinylcholine goes in next,
relaxing my muscles to prevent broken bones and cracked vertebrae.
The nurse sticks a rubber block in my mouth so I don't bite off my
tongue, a mask over my mouth and nose so my brain is not deprived
of oxygen, and electrodes on my temples.
 &HT;    All clear. The doctor presses a button. Electric current shoots
through my brain for an instant, causing a grand-mal seizure for 20
seconds. My toes curl. It's over. My brain has been ``reset'' like
a windup toy.
 &HT;    I wake up 30 minutes later and think I'm in a hotel room in
Acapulco. My head feels as if I've just downed a frozen margarita
too quickly. My jaw and limbs ache. But I feel elated.
 &HT;    ``Come, Electroboy,'' says the nurse in a thick Jamaican accent.
I take a sip of juice as she grabs my arm and escorts me
downstairs, where my father is waiting with my best friend, a
turkey sandwich and a Diet Coke.
 &HT;    I ask questions. Do I have a job? No. An apartment? Yes. A dog?
No. When I get home, I reacquaint myself with my apartment. I'm not
really sure it's mine. It feels as if I've been away for years.
After a nap, I shower, get dressed and hail a cab. By 8 p.m., I'm
at a restaurant downtown, deliberating between the salmon and the
veal.
 &HT;    After four treatments, there is marked improvement. No more
egregious highs or lows. But there are huge gaps in my memory. I
avoid friends and neighbors because I don't know their names
anymore. I can't remember the books I've read or the movies I've
seen. I have trouble recalling simple vocabulary. I forget phone
numbers. Sometimes I even forget what floor I live on.
 &HT;    It's embarrassing. But I continue treatment because I'm getting
better.
 &HT;    And I actually start to love ECT. I have 19 treatments over the
course of a year. I look forward to them. It's like receiving a
blessing in a sanctuary. I rearrange my treatment schedule so that
one falls on my birthday. I start believing that electric current
purifies me.
 &HT;    I become addicted to the rituals _ fasting the night before,
driving across Central Park to the hospital in the early morning,
connecting to the machines that monitor my vital signs, closing my
eyes and counting backward. It's an oddly religious experience.
It's my meditation, my yoga, my tai chi.
 &HT;    On the one-year anniversary of my first electroshock treatment,
I'm clearheaded and even-keeled. I call my doctor to announce my
``new and improved'' status and ask to be excused from ECT that
week. He agrees to suspend treatment temporarily.
 &HT;    Surprisingly, I'm disappointed. ECT reassures me. Soon I miss
the hospital and my ``maintenance'' regimen. But I never see the
doctor again. Two and a half years later, I still miss ECT. But
medication keeps my illness in check, and I'm more sane than I've
ever been.
 &HT;    If I could only remember the capital of Chile.

 By MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 &HT;    You probably have heard of Scott Ritter, the UNSCOM weapons
inspector _ and former U.S. Marine _ who resigned his post last
August to protest what he saw as the failure of the United States
to act more forcefully against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    But you may not have heard of Denis Halliday, who resigned his
post as head of the United Nations' Oil for Food Program in Iraq
just weeks later to protest the humanitarian costs of the U.N.
sanctions.
 &HT;    ``Four thousand to 5,000 children are dying unnecessarily every
month due to the impact of sanctions,'' he said. ``We are in the
process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and
terrifying as that. It is illegal and immoral.''
 &HT;    Halliday, an Irishman, worked for the United Nations for 34
years. A specialist in Third World development issues, he was
stationed in Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as at U.N.
headquarters in New York. On Sept. 1, 1997, he was appointed U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq; he resigned 13 months later.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD: Why did you decide to resign from the United
Nations?
 &HT;    DENIS HALLIDAY: I found myself in the very uncomfortable
position of representing the United Nations, which in Iraq has two
faces. One is the face of sanctions, which are killing thousands of
Iraqis every month and sustaining malnutrition at the rate of 30
percent for children alone. At the same time, I was trying to run a
humanitarian assistance program, and I found these two functions
incompatible. I don't believe the Security Council has the right to
punish the people of Iraq simply because it is unhappy with the
president of the country.
 &HT;    Q: You have said that the sanctions policy is a breach of
international law. How?
 &HT;    A: It's a complete breach of the Convention of the Rights of the
Child, for example. It's a breach of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. It undermines the very charter of the United Nations.
The preamble of the charter is being clobbered by these U.N.
sanctions: the right of individuals to have a life, liberty,
opportunities to live, work and so on. It's very fundamental stuff.
 &HT;    Q: What is the magnitude of the suffering in Iraq? According to
one U.N. study, 500,000 Iraqi children had died as the result of
sanctions.
 &HT;    A: I believe the 500,000 is a UNICEF figure. It's probably
closer now to 600,000 and that's over the period of 1990-1998. If
you include adults, it's well over 1 million Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: What caused these deaths? What is the chain of fatality?
 &HT;    A: It originated with the horrendous and comprehensive damage
done by the missiles and bombing of the coalition forces during the
Persian Gulf War period, which was of greater extent than any of us
understand. They set about demolishing the civilian infrastructure
of this country, including water supplies, sewage supply systems,
electric power systems, production systems, educational facilities,
places of work.
 &HT;    It's hard to visualize, perhaps, but the infrastructure that
supports a good standard of living has been demolished. So that's
the starting point. And now you have the sanctions for seven or
eight years, and the damage that was done, combined with the lack
of money, or spare parts, upkeep for maintenance in the
agricultural sector. This combined has got us in the situation
where we have poor nutritional intake, very poor health services,
lack of drugs and medicines, and a disastrous water/sewage
situation whereby waterborne diseases like typhus are killing
thousands of Iraqis, particularly children.
 &HT;    Q: Were you an eyewitness to this hardship?
 &HT;    A: Yes, almost every evening driving back from the office I
would have to drive through raw sewage, which was often on the
streets of Baghdad. I would come up against 3- or 4-year-old
children begging for money at the traffic lights. And, of course, I
visited the poor parts of the country outside Baghdad, and I
visited the children's hospital.
 &HT;    Q: What was the hospital like?
 &HT;    A: The conditions are quite appalling. When I was there, there
was raw sewage in the basement of the hospital. The doctors do not
have drugs to deal with the problems they face. I was looking at
young children with leukemia; of four children I got to know, two
died within six weeks. That's a very common situation. Doctors are
making very horrible decisions as to who dies, who lives.
 &HT;    Q: What reaction do you get when you go around and speak about
the calamity of sanctions?
 &HT;    A: When regular, ordinary people understand some of the impact
and realize that Iraqi people are just like you and me, with all
the expectations we have for our children, it hits home that we are
rather callously sitting back and allowing people like ourselves to
be killed. But having demonized Saddam Hussein, policy makers in
Washington have demonized the Iraqi people. And they are just
regular people, with families, and gardens, and dogs, and houses
and all of that stuff. They have the same expectations we have _ to
live a life.
 &HT;    Q: What was your reaction to the massive U.S. and British
bombing campaign against Iraq in December?
 &HT;    A: I must say, I'm appalled that we are resorting to the
brutalization of an innocent people. I find this is incredible.
Apart from that, I really am concerned that nobody thinks through
the consequences of these sorts of actions. There is a bankruptcy
of ideas on how to deal with Iraq, and bombing is the fall-back
position.
 &HT;    It is a totally counterproductive effort. It enhances Saddam
Hussein's image. It outrages the Arab community. It reinforces the
general sense that Washington doesn't understand the Arab world.
 &HT;    Q: Aren't you concerned about the danger of Saddam Hussein
acquiring weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I think no matter what approach is taken, there's going to be
a risk factor here, unfortunately. But I believe that if we are
going to move forward, we have to separate economic sanctions _
which only hurt the people, not the leadership _ from the issue of
the rearming of Iraq. Separate those two things and deal with them
separately.
 &HT;    Q: And how do you ensure that Iraq doesn't cheat?
 &HT;    A: You need an elaborate system of control on the manufacture
and purchases of military items. The Iraqis will have to understand
that there would be a need to monitor military rebuilding well
after sanctions have gone. I think that would have to be one of the
arrangements.
 &HT;    Q: By your own estimation, what is the extent of Saddam
Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I would guess, and this is purely speculation, that it's
extremely modest. I think people overestimate his capacity. The
military is very depleted; the equipment is very old. I think the
capacity is largely diminished and greatly exaggerated. That's not
to say it couldn't be rebuilt. Of course it could. But as of today,
I think it's of no great importance whatsoever _ and certainly
outgunned by the neighborhood American equipment throughout the
gulf countries.
 &HT;    Q: Some people who are harshly critical of Saddam Hussein and
who take a bellicose stand say that the Oil for Food program wasn't
working and that Saddam Hussein was siphoning off the revenues of
the oil sales to feed the military, to feed himself, feather his
nest. What's the truth to that?
 &HT;    A: Well, there's absolutely no truth, whatsoever. Every penny
from oil sales goes into the hands of the United Nations, into a
U.N. bank account, and is released by the United Nations directly
to the contractors _ American, Russian, French, Chinese, whatever
they may be _ who provide the foodstuffs, medical equipment,
medical supplies. There's no possibility of funds being siphoned
off whatsoever.
 &HT;    Q: And what about the extent of the oil revenues? Was there
enough to meet the humanitarian needs?
 &HT;    A: No, absolutely not. It fell short on two counts: On the
day-to-day, current cash-flow needs it fell short in that the funds
available did not provide a balanced diet. We have been providing,
under the Security Council Resolution, a totally inadequate food
basket for the Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: How far short was it falling?
 &HT;    A: In terms of calories it was short, but it was more seriously
short in terms of proteins, basically animal proteins. And that was
only the immediate, day-to-day requirement. What is required to
deal with malnutrition of the kind we find in Iraq is a
multisectoral approach. That means putting real money _ and I'm
talking billions of dollars _ into the health-care situation, into
the potable water and sewage situation, into electric power
production, into domestic agricultural production, into education.
All of that money is simply not available.
 &HT;    Q: After the Iraqi experience, what's your view of economic
sanctions as a tool? And why were they legitimate against the
apartheid regime of South Africa but not Saddam Hussein's Iraq?
 &HT;    A: You've picked out the only possible example of economic
sanctions having worked worldwide. I think there was a severe
penalty for the people of South Africa, but I believe they went
along with this proposed program. This was part of their approach _
the ANC (African National Congress) approach _ to resolving the
problem of apartheid and the government at the time. That is not
the case in Iraq. These are innocent people who were not consulted.
They are bearing the brunt of sanctions in a much greater degree
than ever in South Africa, and we've seen the death and
malnutrition that has resulted. It's not putting pressure on the
Iraqi leadership, and it's certainly not producing the results that
the Security Council had hoped for.
 &HT;    Q: Right now the U.S. government is again trying to find and
fund some forces in Iraq that will overthrow Hussein. Do you think
that is credible?
 &HT;    A: Well, I think it makes no sense whatsoever and frankly, I
believe there are about 70 to 80 different Iraqi opposition groups
outside the country. Within the country, I think very few are even
in a position to contemplate any sort of change in government
systems. I don't understand the viability of this program.
 &HT;    Q: There are those in conservative circles in the United States
who say that the only real answer is for the United States to send
in the ground troops, march to Baghdad, overthrow Saddam Hussein
and occupy the country.
 &HT;    A: That's a total nonstarter. The American people would never
accept that kind of exposure to its troops. The Iraqis would fight
back, and the loss of life would be horrific. It would be another
Vietnam.
 &HT;    Q: But the argument is, basically, ``This guy is Hitler. You
can't appease Hitler. You've got to take Hitler out.'' To what
extent is the Hitler metaphor useful?
 &HT;    A: National Socialism grew up because of the Versailles Treaty
and the harshness of the conditions we placed on Germany after
World War I. The conditions that are being placed on Iraq are
rather comparable, and we're getting the same kind of results. And
that's very dangerous. If Saddam Hussein is gone tomorrow, the
system can continue: The party is there, the military is there, his
people are still there. There's not necessarily going to be a
dramatic change. And because of sanctions, we are building a new
generation of Iraqi leaders who are mad, who are introverted _ more
of the Taliban model.
 &HT;    Q: So what's your solution?
 &HT;    A: I think we'd be much wiser to focus on the reality of Iraq
today, work with what we've got and get the country back on its
feet. When the country is back on its feet, you may see change from
within, that's the only change that is likely to last. Clearly,
sanctions have strengthened the leadership. They've increased the
dependence of the average person on the central government. There
is a naive sense that out of this sanctions situation a miracle of
democracy will emerge. That, of course, is completely nonsensical.
I think there is almost nobody left in the country who has time to
think about governance. They're concerned with survival, putting
food on the table, getting their kids educated and keeping
themselves, their children and their families alive. It's naive to
think that positive change will come out of the present sanctions
regime.
 &HT;    Q: So your policy would be to lift sanctions right away?
 &HT;    A: Lift economic sanctions right away, but retain a series of
devices to control arms manufacture and arms purchases.
 &HT;    Q: What should people do who are concerned about the plight of
the Iraqi people?
 &HT;    A: Well, we already have 43 members of Congress who signed a
letter to President Clinton, making a suggestion of separating the
arms issue from the economic sanctions issue. That's the beginning.
And there are others in Congress who are ready to think and listen
and learn about the impact on the Iraqi people. Therefore it's up
to the American voters to express their views through their
electoral machinery.

 By MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 &HT;    You probably have heard of Scott Ritter, the UNSCOM weapons
inspector _ and former U.S. Marine _ who resigned his post last
August to protest what he saw as the failure of the United States
to act more forcefully against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    But you may not have heard of Denis Halliday, who resigned his
post as head of the United Nations' Oil for Food Program in Iraq
just weeks later to protest the humanitarian costs of the U.N.
sanctions.
 &HT;    ``Four thousand to 5,000 children are dying unnecessarily every
month due to the impact of sanctions,'' he said. ``We are in the
process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and
terrifying as that. It is illegal and immoral.''
 &HT;    Halliday, an Irishman, worked for the United Nations for 34
years. A specialist in Third World development issues, he was
stationed in Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as at U.N.
headquarters in New York. On Sept. 1, 1997, he was appointed U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq; he resigned 13 months later.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD: Why did you decide to resign from the United
Nations?
 &HT;    DENIS HALLIDAY: I found myself in the very uncomfortable
position of representing the United Nations, which in Iraq has two
faces. One is the face of sanctions, which are killing thousands of
Iraqis every month and sustaining malnutrition at the rate of 30
percent for children alone. At the same time, I was trying to run a
humanitarian assistance program, and I found these two functions
incompatible. I don't believe the Security Council has the right to
punish the people of Iraq simply because it is unhappy with the
president of the country.
 &HT;    Q: You have said that the sanctions policy is a breach of
international law. How?
 &HT;    A: It's a complete breach of the Convention of the Rights of the
Child, for example. It's a breach of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. It undermines the very charter of the United Nations.
The preamble of the charter is being clobbered by these U.N.
sanctions: the right of individuals to have a life, liberty,
opportunities to live, work and so on. It's very fundamental stuff.
 &HT;    Q: What is the magnitude of the suffering in Iraq? According to
one U.N. study, 500,000 Iraqi children had died as the result of
sanctions.
 &HT;    A: I believe the 500,000 is a UNICEF figure. It's probably
closer now to 600,000 and that's over the period of 1990-1998. If
you include adults, it's well over 1 million Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: What caused these deaths? What is the chain of fatality?
 &HT;    A: It originated with the horrendous and comprehensive damage
done by the missiles and bombing of the coalition forces during the
Persian Gulf War period, which was of greater extent than any of us
understand. They set about demolishing the civilian infrastructure
of this country, including water supplies, sewage supply systems,
electric power systems, production systems, educational facilities,
places of work.
 &HT;    It's hard to visualize, perhaps, but the infrastructure that
supports a good standard of living has been demolished. So that's
the starting point. And now you have the sanctions for seven or
eight years, and the damage that was done, combined with the lack
of money, or spare parts, upkeep for maintenance in the
agricultural sector. This combined has got us in the situation
where we have poor nutritional intake, very poor health services,
lack of drugs and medicines, and a disastrous water/sewage
situation whereby waterborne diseases like typhus are killing
thousands of Iraqis, particularly children.
 &HT;    Q: Were you an eyewitness to this hardship?
 &HT;    A: Yes, almost every evening driving back from the office I
would have to drive through raw sewage, which was often on the
streets of Baghdad. I would come up against 3- or 4-year-old
children begging for money at the traffic lights. And, of course, I
visited the poor parts of the country outside Baghdad, and I
visited the children's hospital.
 &HT;    Q: What was the hospital like?
 &HT;    A: The conditions are quite appalling. When I was there, there
was raw sewage in the basement of the hospital. The doctors do not
have drugs to deal with the problems they face. I was looking at
young children with leukemia; of four children I got to know, two
died within six weeks. That's a very common situation. Doctors are
making very horrible decisions as to who dies, who lives.
 &HT;    Q: What reaction do you get when you go around and speak about
the calamity of sanctions?
 &HT;    A: When regular, ordinary people understand some of the impact
and realize that Iraqi people are just like you and me, with all
the expectations we have for our children, it hits home that we are
rather callously sitting back and allowing people like ourselves to
be killed. But having demonized Saddam Hussein, policy makers in
Washington have demonized the Iraqi people. And they are just
regular people, with families, and gardens, and dogs, and houses
and all of that stuff. They have the same expectations we have _ to
live a life.
 &HT;    Q: What was your reaction to the massive U.S. and British
bombing campaign against Iraq in December?
 &HT;    A: I must say, I'm appalled that we are resorting to the
brutalization of an innocent people. I find this is incredible.
Apart from that, I really am concerned that nobody thinks through
the consequences of these sorts of actions. There is a bankruptcy
of ideas on how to deal with Iraq, and bombing is the fall-back
position.
 &HT;    It is a totally counterproductive effort. It enhances Saddam
Hussein's image. It outrages the Arab community. It reinforces the
general sense that Washington doesn't understand the Arab world.
 &HT;    Q: Aren't you concerned about the danger of Saddam Hussein
acquiring weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I think no matter what approach is taken, there's going to be
a risk factor here, unfortunately. But I believe that if we are
going to move forward, we have to separate economic sanctions _
which only hurt the people, not the leadership _ from the issue of
the rearming of Iraq. Separate those two things and deal with them
separately.
 &HT;    Q: And how do you ensure that Iraq doesn't cheat?
 &HT;    A: You need an elaborate system of control on the manufacture
and purchases of military items. The Iraqis will have to understand
that there would be a need to monitor military rebuilding well
after sanctions have gone. I think that would have to be one of the
arrangements.
 &HT;    Q: By your own estimation, what is the extent of Saddam
Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I would guess, and this is purely speculation, that it's
extremely modest. I think people overestimate his capacity. The
military is very depleted; the equipment is very old. I think the
capacity is largely diminished and greatly exaggerated. That's not
to say it couldn't be rebuilt. Of course it could. But as of today,
I think it's of no great importance whatsoever _ and certainly
outgunned by the neighborhood American equipment throughout the
gulf countries.
 &HT;    Q: Some people who are harshly critical of Saddam Hussein and
who take a bellicose stand say that the Oil for Food program wasn't
working and that Saddam Hussein was siphoning off the revenues of
the oil sales to feed the military, to feed himself, feather his
nest. What's the truth to that?
 &HT;    A: Well, there's absolutely no truth, whatsoever. Every penny
from oil sales goes into the hands of the United Nations, into a
U.N. bank account, and is released by the United Nations directly
to the contractors _ American, Russian, French, Chinese, whatever
they may be _ who provide the foodstuffs, medical equipment,
medical supplies. There's no possibility of funds being siphoned
off whatsoever.
 &HT;    Q: And what about the extent of the oil revenues? Was there
enough to meet the humanitarian needs?
 &HT;    A: No, absolutely not. It fell short on two counts: On the
day-to-day, current cash-flow needs it fell short in that the funds
available did not provide a balanced diet. We have been providing,
under the Security Council Resolution, a totally inadequate food
basket for the Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: How far short was it falling?
 &HT;    A: In terms of calories it was short, but it was more seriously
short in terms of proteins, basically animal proteins. And that was
only the immediate, day-to-day requirement. What is required to
deal with malnutrition of the kind we find in Iraq is a
multisectoral approach. That means putting real money _ and I'm
talking billions of dollars _ into the health-care situation, into
the potable water and sewage situation, into electric power
production, into domestic agricultural production, into education.
All of that money is simply not available.
 &HT;    Q: After the Iraqi experience, what's your view of economic
sanctions as a tool? And why were they legitimate against the
apartheid regime of South Africa but not Saddam Hussein's Iraq?
 &HT;    A: You've picked out the only possible example of economic
sanctions having worked worldwide. I think there was a severe
penalty for the people of South Africa, but I believe they went
along with this proposed program. This was part of their approach _
the ANC (African National Congress) approach _ to resolving the
problem of apartheid and the government at the time. That is not
the case in Iraq. These are innocent people who were not consulted.
They are bearing the brunt of sanctions in a much greater degree
than ever in South Africa, and we've seen the death and
malnutrition that has resulted. It's not putting pressure on the
Iraqi leadership, and it's certainly not producing the results that
the Security Council had hoped for.
 &HT;    Q: Right now the U.S. government is again trying to find and
fund some forces in Iraq that will overthrow Hussein. Do you think
that is credible?
 &HT;    A: Well, I think it makes no sense whatsoever and frankly, I
believe there are about 70 to 80 different Iraqi opposition groups
outside the country. Within the country, I think very few are even
in a position to contemplate any sort of change in government
systems. I don't understand the viability of this program.
 &HT;    Q: There are those in conservative circles in the United States
who say that the only real answer is for the United States to send
in the ground troops, march to Baghdad, overthrow Saddam Hussein
and occupy the country.
 &HT;    A: That's a total nonstarter. The American people would never
accept that kind of exposure to its troops. The Iraqis would fight
back, and the loss of life would be horrific. It would be another
Vietnam.
 &HT;    Q: But the argument is, basically, ``This guy is Hitler. You
can't appease Hitler. You've got to take Hitler out.'' To what
extent is the Hitler metaphor useful?
 &HT;    A: National Socialism grew up because of the Versailles Treaty
and the harshness of the conditions we placed on Germany after
World War I. The conditions that are being placed on Iraq are
rather comparable, and we're getting the same kind of results. And
that's very dangerous. If Saddam Hussein is gone tomorrow, the

<P>
   Col. Qaddafi's emissary, Youssef Debri, met me in Cairo. He was
in Egypt exploring the ramifications of Libya's surrendering two of
its citizens to stand trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In formal talks in New York, a U.N. official had already managed
to narrow the gap between Libya's concerns and the British-American
proposal for a trial in the Netherlands, but important differences
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now Debri was in Cairo informally, to clarify Washington's terms
with a well-connected, retired American diplomat, in the hope of
ending Qaddafi's equivocation.
</P>
<P>
   An intimate of Qaddafi since their student days at military
college, Debri had contacted me some weeks before to propose that I
visit Libya. Cut off from the world by the U.N. embargo over
Lockerbie, Libya, he said, had grown weary of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the embargo's terms, it could sell oil _ its only export _
to European customers, so it had money for food and medicines. But
the other barriers to trade and transportation were wearing it
down. Few businessmen and almost no journalists came to call.
</P>
<P>
   Debri's message was that Libya, anxious for a new start, wanted
to put Lockerbie behind it. In Libya, he assured me, I would be
free to go where I liked and to see whomever I wanted, including
Qaddafi himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided on the journey, I went to the State Department
for a briefing. Officials there acknowledged that they knew little
about what was going on in Libya. In 1986, two years before
Lockerbie, President Reagan broke off relations with Libya and
imposed economic sanctions in response to a series of terrorist
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the officials said, Libya had committed
no terrorist acts. Unlike Iraq, it posed no strategic threat. But
because of Lockerbie, the United States still shunned Qaddafi and
kept Libya on its list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a U.S. grand jury indicted two Libyans _ Lamin Khalifa
Fhimah, ex-manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines office in Malta, and
Abdel Basset Ali al- Megrahi, a high-level intelligence official _
for the Lockerbie bombing. A British court did the same. In 1992,
the U.N. Security Council imposed its own sanctions, including a
flight ban that effectively closed Libya's airports. Tripoli, in
response, proposed trying the two suspects in a neutral country,
but Washington and London would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last August, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
announced that she would ``call the Libyan government's bluff'' and
offered a trial by a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands.
Libya agreed in principle, but Qaddafi demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   The American embargo did not bar my visit (since it makes an
exception for journalists). I flew to Cairo; then, with Youssef
Debri, set off for Tripoli by car.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Benghazi, then Sirte, chosen by Qaddafi as Libya's
new capital. Around 11 o'clock on the morning after our arrival,
Youssef and I set out, heading south, to see Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour ride across the desert, we were met by a
police escort, which led us to an almost indiscernible dirt track
that ran off the paved road. A bumpy mile or so later, we reached
the gate of a chainlink fence, where three or four limousines sat.
</P>
<P>
   Parking our car among them, we piled into a Land Rover, which
bucked us over rock and sand a half-hour deeper into the desert.
Finally, we reached an encampment of large tents and modern
trailers near which grazed a herd of some 200 camels. No armed
guards seemed to be anywhere in view.
</P>
<P>
   The tent to which I was first directed was ballroom-size, its
sides open to admit the breeze. Seated next to three Africans in
native robes, I was offered tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans made a brief call on Qaddafi, after which Youssef
escorted me to Qaddafi's tent, pitched nearby, and left me there.
Save for a few simple chairs and a table, the tent was bare. Its
camel-skin roof and sides were weathered; the rugs covering the
sand floor were ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi sat alone, except for an interpreter. He wore a thin,
tattered Bedouin robe, embroidered at the edges, over a
much-laundered print sport shirt and khaki pants. His furrowed face
was clean-shaven, his eyes covered by dark glasses. A beige turban
half-concealed his bushy hair.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I began the interview by asking whether the view that Libya had
embarked on a new course was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi did not turn to me to answer. Through the open flaps of
the tent, he fixed his eyes on the horizon. His lips seemed barely
to move. He spoke in a controlled monotone, though from time to
time emotion quickened its pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he said, ``unfortunately treats us as if the world
was the way it used to be. Americans accept that changes have taken
place since the end of communism, but not in their treatment of
Libya. So in the end, they take a racist and fanatical position,
similar to the way Hitler treated the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that America is much like Hitler. We have no
explanation for this, except that it is a religious, fanatical,
racist position. Some analysts call this a new colonialism. But
colonialism is colonialism, and it is always unjust. It is how we
were treated by the Italians, Algeria by the French, India by the
British. This is imperialism, and we seem to be entering a new
imperialist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of our conflict with America is not that we attacked
them. We have never attacked an American target. America started
the aggression against us right here in the Gulf of Sirte. When we
defended ourselves, they attacked us in these very tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombed by missiles in our own territorial waters. In
1986 our own children were killed. No one can bring my daughter
back to me. Then Lockerbie came along. Now we'd like this chain of
events to be over. But America doesn't want to turn the page. We
shall, however, show courage and be patient, and America will be
the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The events about which Qaddafi rambled date back to 1981, when
American jets shot down two Libyan planes in a dispute over the
extent of Libya's territorial waters. In January 1986, President
Reagan, responding to terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, blocked
commerce with Libya and froze its American assets. A few weeks
later, U.S. Navy planes bombed Sirte and destroyed four patrol
boats in another dispute over territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reagan, blaming Libya for a bomb that killed two
American soldiers in a Berlin nightclub, attacked Tripoli and
Benghazi, along with suspected terrorist camps in the desert. Among
the 37 civilians reported killed was Qaddafi's adopted infant
daughter, Hana'a. Libyans say the child's death haunts him still.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Qaddafi if Libya was responsible for the many
terrorist incidents of which it was accused in the 1980s, he issued
no denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents that you mention belong to the past,'' he
said. ``Once Abu Amar (Yasir Arafat) was wanted. Now he enters the
White House with all the trappings, the music, the red carpet
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I detected a note of envy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Libya is a terrorist country. But now that is
illogical, not reasonable. All these things are of the past, an era
that is over. The bombing of the French plane (a French UTA
airliner bombed over Niger in 1989, at a cost of 171 lives) took
place during a time of war in the region _ Libya, Chad, France. It
was similar to America's downing of the Iranian plane in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis shot down a Libyan aircraft over the Sinai. The
Soviet Union shot down a Korean airplane. It was a time of war. So
how come you forgot all about that and you just mention the charges
against Libya? There is no explanation for that. We go back to the
racist, fanatical complexes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Qaddafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Libya, I asked, ready to turn over the two Lockerbie suspects
for trial? His answer, I thought, contained a clue to his
procrastination in resolving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed that a trial should take place. Now let us sit
down and decide how it can be put into practice. I want to find out
the truth about Lockerbie myself. After that, the story will be
finished. I am not so concerned about whether the two Libyans are
convicted or not. What is important is that the problem come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice the number of Libyans have died from the embargo than
were killed at Lockerbie. Whether this one or that is guilty or not
is the business of the lawyers and the courts. What matters is that
once the trial starts, sanctions will be over against Libya. The
embargo will be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good
relations with Europe. We have European embassies and companies
here. But America is different. We are not enemies of the American
people. Millions of Arabs, millions of Muslims, millions of
Africans are Americans these days. How could we be their enemy?
Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''

   A few minutes later I was cautiously sipping camel milk in the
waiting-tent when Youssef returned. In an urgent tone he reported,
``The Leader wants me to remind you that he was not talking
officially and that he was not stating policy. He asks you to
remember that he is a private person and was speaking from his
heart on what he feels.''

<P>
   Col. Qaddafi's emissary, Youssef Debri, met me in Cairo. He was
in Egypt exploring the ramifications of Libya's surrendering two of
its citizens to stand trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In formal talks in New York, a U.N. official had already managed
to narrow the gap between Libya's concerns and the British-American
proposal for a trial in the Netherlands, but important differences
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now Debri was in Cairo informally, to clarify Washington's terms
with a well-connected, retired American diplomat, in the hope of
ending Qaddafi's equivocation.
</P>
<P>
   An intimate of Qaddafi since their student days at military
college, Debri had contacted me some weeks before to propose that I
visit Libya. Cut off from the world by the U.N. embargo over
Lockerbie, Libya, he said, had grown weary of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the embargo's terms, it could sell oil _ its only export _
to European customers, so it had money for food and medicines. But
the other barriers to trade and transportation were wearing it
down. Few businessmen and almost no journalists came to call.
</P>
<P>
   Debri's message was that Libya, anxious for a new start, wanted
to put Lockerbie behind it. In Libya, he assured me, I would be
free to go where I liked and to see whomever I wanted, including
Qaddafi himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided on the journey, I went to the State Department
for a briefing. Officials there acknowledged that they knew little
about what was going on in Libya. In 1986, two years before
Lockerbie, President Reagan broke off relations with Libya and
imposed economic sanctions in response to a series of terrorist
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the officials said, Libya had committed
no terrorist acts. Unlike Iraq, it posed no strategic threat. But
because of Lockerbie, the United States still shunned Qaddafi and
kept Libya on its list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a U.S. grand jury indicted two Libyans _ Lamin Khalifa
Fhimah, ex-manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines office in Malta, and
Abdel Basset Ali al- Megrahi, a high-level intelligence official _
for the Lockerbie bombing. A British court did the same. In 1992,
the U.N. Security Council imposed its own sanctions, including a
flight ban that effectively closed Libya's airports. Tripoli, in
response, proposed trying the two suspects in a neutral country,
but Washington and London would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last August, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
announced that she would ``call the Libyan government's bluff'' and
offered a trial by a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands.
Libya agreed in principle, but Qaddafi demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   The American embargo did not bar my visit (since it makes an
exception for journalists). I flew to Cairo; then, with Youssef
Debri, set off for Tripoli by car.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Benghazi, then Sirte, chosen by Qaddafi as Libya's
new capital. Around 11 o'clock on the morning after our arrival,
Youssef and I set out, heading south, to see Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour ride across the desert, we were met by a
police escort, which led us to an almost indiscernible dirt track
that ran off the paved road. A bumpy mile or so later, we reached
the gate of a chainlink fence, where three or four limousines sat.
</P>
<P>
   Parking our car among them, we piled into a Land Rover, which
bucked us over rock and sand a half-hour deeper into the desert.
Finally, we reached an encampment of large tents and modern
trailers near which grazed a herd of some 200 camels. No armed
guards seemed to be anywhere in view.
</P>
<P>
   The tent to which I was first directed was ballroom-size, its
sides open to admit the breeze. Seated next to three Africans in
native robes, I was offered tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans made a brief call on Qaddafi, after which Youssef
escorted me to Qaddafi's tent, pitched nearby, and left me there.
Save for a few simple chairs and a table, the tent was bare. Its
camel-skin roof and sides were weathered; the rugs covering the
sand floor were ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi sat alone, except for an interpreter. He wore a thin,
tattered Bedouin robe, embroidered at the edges, over a
much-laundered print sport shirt and khaki pants. His furrowed face
was clean-shaven, his eyes covered by dark glasses. A beige turban
half-concealed his bushy hair.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I began the interview by asking whether the view that Libya had
embarked on a new course was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi did not turn to me to answer. Through the open flaps of
the tent, he fixed his eyes on the horizon. His lips seemed barely
to move. He spoke in a controlled monotone, though from time to
time emotion quickened its pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he said, ``unfortunately treats us as if the world
was the way it used to be. Americans accept that changes have taken
place since the end of communism, but not in their treatment of
Libya. So in the end, they take a racist and fanatical position,
similar to the way Hitler treated the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that America is much like Hitler. We have no
explanation for this, except that it is a religious, fanatical,
racist position. Some analysts call this a new colonialism. But
colonialism is colonialism, and it is always unjust. It is how we
were treated by the Italians, Algeria by the French, India by the
British. This is imperialism, and we seem to be entering a new
imperialist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of our conflict with America is not that we attacked
them. We have never attacked an American target. America started
the aggression against us right here in the Gulf of Sirte. When we
defended ourselves, they attacked us in these very tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombed by missiles in our own territorial waters. In
1986 our own children were killed. No one can bring my daughter
back to me. Then Lockerbie came along. Now we'd like this chain of
events to be over. But America doesn't want to turn the page. We
shall, however, show courage and be patient, and America will be
the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The events about which Qaddafi rambled date back to 1981, when
American jets shot down two Libyan planes in a dispute over the
extent of Libya's territorial waters. In January 1986, President
Reagan, responding to terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, blocked
commerce with Libya and froze its American assets. A few weeks
later, U.S. Navy planes bombed Sirte and destroyed four patrol
boats in another dispute over territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reagan, blaming Libya for a bomb that killed two
American soldiers in a Berlin nightclub, attacked Tripoli and
Benghazi, along with suspected terrorist camps in the desert. Among
the 37 civilians reported killed was Qaddafi's adopted infant
daughter, Hana'a. Libyans say the child's death haunts him still.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Qaddafi if Libya was responsible for the many
terrorist incidents of which it was accused in the 1980s, he issued
no denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents that you mention belong to the past,'' he
said. ``Once Abu Amar (Yasir Arafat) was wanted. Now he enters the
White House with all the trappings, the music, the red carpet
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I detected a note of envy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Libya is a terrorist country. But now that is
illogical, not reasonable. All these things are of the past, an era
that is over. The bombing of the French plane (a French UTA
airliner bombed over Niger in 1989, at a cost of 171 lives) took
place during a time of war in the region _ Libya, Chad, France. It
was similar to America's downing of the Iranian plane in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis shot down a Libyan aircraft over the Sinai. The
Soviet Union shot down a Korean airplane. It was a time of war. So
how come you forgot all about that and you just mention the charges
against Libya? There is no explanation for that. We go back to the
racist, fanatical complexes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Qaddafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us.''

for trial? His answer, I thought, contained a clue to his
procrastination in resolving the problem.

 BOSTON: ... who is 17.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I knew then that she was the person I needed to talk to. I
told her that I knew the divorce had caused her a lot of pain and
that I avoided responsibility by acting like it was all Dad's
fault. And I asked for her forgiveness.'' Judie pauses and the
silence is deafening. ``My daughter said, `I've waited two years to
hear this. I forgive you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A sigh like a balloon releasing air can be heard around the
room.
</P>
<P>
   By evening of the second day, many participants are sharing
tissues and crying openly as the painful, most intimate details of
people's lives crash up against them like waves, each more powerful
than the next. And the stories, the awakenings, the tears, flow all
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen such good theater in a long time,'' marvels
Linda Kellay, 40, of Charlton, during one break.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is achieving breakthroughs. At one point,
an emigrant from India gets up and tries to talk about how people
discriminate against him because of his skin color and accent.
Handel lights into him. ``You haven't owned up to your racket,
which is that people discriminate against you,'' she says. ``You're
not taking responsibility for it. You keep pointing your finger at
others. You need to own up to your racket.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, a health professional who asked not to be identified,
persists, saying that a lot of his problems with people at work and
elsewhere had to do with racism. ``You are one of the most
uncoachable people in the Forum,'' Handel replies calmly. ``It's
been two full days and you haven't looked at yourself yet. All you
see is people stepping on you.''
</P>
<P>
   After a short break (during which the man finds himself
surrounded by sympathetic participants telling him to hang in
there), Handel unloads what some would later say is the biggest
bombshell of the weekend: ``Consider that life is empty and
meaningless,'' she says. ``There is no meaning; life just is.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, people's faces crumple with bewilderment. Paula
Houghton, the gift-shop owner from Maine, is one of the first to
get the point. ``If life is empty and meaningless, you can create
anything you want,'' she says triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Reilly follows her to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so powerful,'' Reilly says. ``I don't need to be a
victim anymore. This is better than church; it's almost better than
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Ray Barrieau, the general contractor from
Rockland, raises his leonine head. Barrieau has been slumped in the
back row of the room, eyes half-closed, shoulders bowed. But on the
afternoon of the third day, he strides to the mike.
</P>
<P>
   In a choking voice, Barrieau reads a letter he had written to
his son, who died 18 months ago in a car accident at age 16.
Barrieau says he now realizes that even though his son is dead, he
can still have a relationship with him. ``You were an extraordinary
person, and I miss you terribly,'' Barrieau reads to an audience as
silent as stone. ``But what I realize now is that although my
relationship with you is different, I can continue to give you 100
percent of my love.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finishes, Handel asks, ``Is there anything else you need
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive myself?'' Barrieau replies softly. ``I think I just
did.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the Forum, Tuesday evening, Barrieau walks
into the room smiling. His back is straight, his blue eyes wide and
peaceful. Other participants also pour in with big smiles on their
faces, hugging people they met only five days before and talking
about the changes in their behavior in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   One of the huggers is Joan Hathaway, a real estate broker from
Marlborough. The first day of the Forum, Hathaway, when asked what
she thought, had put a finger in her mouth as if to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, she had a different response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always skeptical of these self-help things,'' said
Hathaway. ``But I couldn't deny what was going on in front of my
eyes. I could see the transformations taking place right in front
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached a month later, Barrieau and other participants also say
their lives and attitudes remain altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my line of work, I deal with people who don't always have a
handle on reality, and I notice that I deal with it differently
now,'' says Barrieau, who is working on restoring a huge farmhouse
north of Boston. ``For instance, if something goes wrong, one crew
is always ready to point the finger at another crew, and in the
past I might have gotten involved in that. Now I just say, jeez,
this is their racket, and I'm not going there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Barrieau or others don't have lapses; it's an
imperfect world out there. Marisa Reilly, who shares custody of her
daughter with her ex-husband, says she still finds herself drawn
into arguments with him over past ``insults.'' But instead of
getting angry and marching off in resentment as she used to, Reilly
says that she was able to defuse their latest squabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a deep breath, went outside, came back in, and made a
request. I said, `You don't have to respect or like me, but I just
want you to respect me as Gwendolyn's mother,' '' she recalls.
``And that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly adds, ``Experiences like that weekend could be like a
bubble _ you get it for the moment and then poof it's gone. But
this has had a lasting effect on me.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They have come from all over New England, from as far
away as Vermont's Canadian border to nearby South Boston. But the
132 souls huddling on chairs in a windowless conference room in
Dorchester don't look particularly lost. They are physicians,
engineers, software consultants, house painters, store owners,
lawyers, students, single mothers, and an Episcopal priest, and
they belong to a group sociologists might call ``the worried
well.''
</P>
<P>
   They have come to the Forum because they sense something is
amiss in their lives, and they've heard that the program's 3 1/2
days of intense self-examination might help them smooth out the
cracks in their relationships with families, friends, and
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Paula Houghton, 50, who runs a gift shop on
the coast of Maine and says she ``hasn't touched'' her husband in
years, even though they run the business together.
</P>
<P>
   Or Marisa Reilly, 39, who owns a body spa in Waltham and is
struggling to raise a 4-year-old daughter amid the turmoil of a
difficult divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ray Barrieau, 42, a general contractor from Rockland, who
lost the will to love when his teenage son died in a car accident
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this mostly white and middle-class group had heard about
the Forum from someone in their lives who had already taken the
program. (In Houghton's case, it was her daughter; in Barrieau's,
several friends.)
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few had also heard about the controversial roots of
the Forum, which reached about 68,000 people worldwide in 1998.
Indeed, the very first question asked by a plaid-shirted woman in
the audience is: ``Is this a cult?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not a cult,'' replies the Forum leader, a
39-year-old former New Yorker named Beth Handel, who addresses the
concern head-on. Handel explains that the Forum is the
reincarnation of est, the self-help movement started in 1971 by a
former car salesman from Philadelphia who left his family and
changed his name from John Paul Rosenberg to Werner Erhard. In
1985, Handel says, Erhard ``retired'' est and retooled it as the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the United States for parts unknown, he sold the
``technology'' of the Forum in 1991 to his employees, who formed a
new company known as the Landmark Education Co., headquartered in
San Francisco, with Erhard's younger brother, Harry Rosenberg, as
its president.
</P>
<P>
   What Handel leaves out is that est was widely criticized in its
heyday for fostering an authoritarian atmosphere, with reports of
est leaders humiliating participants and refusing to let them go to
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum, one participant later jokes, seems to be a ``kinder,
gentler est.'' Anyone can leave at any time, and if people leave
before midafternoon on the first day of the workshop (which takes
place over three 14-hour days and one evening), they get their $325
entrance fee back.
</P>
<P>
   Two people actually take advantage of that offer. The rest stay
planted in their chairs, waiting impatiently for the
``transformation'' that Handel says she has ``produced . . . in
thousands and thousands of people's lives.'' (Among the attendees
is a Globe reporter whom Forum officials and participants know is
there).
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until late in the afternoon, after seemingly endless
plugs for other Landmark courses and a rambling lecture on
linguistics, that Handel gets down to the guts of the session. She
says that all human beings listen through a prism of judgment,
deciding whether what they hear is right or wrong, to be agreed
with or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of listening will never disappear, but I notice it
now when I do it,'' says Handel, a pixieish, dark-haired woman
whose hands and face are in constant motion.
</P>
<P>
   Another fundamental aspect of human nature, she adds, is that we
all want to look good in front of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do is to look good,'' she says, with the
comedic timing of Joan Rivers. ``That's what it will say on your
tombstone: `looked real good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The audience laughs, but a woman in the back row, with coifed
gray hair, looks thunderstruck. A few minutes later, she makes her
way to one of the three microphones set up around the room. (At
regular intervals during the 43-hour-long ride along
self-transformation lane, Handel encourages people to come up and
share their thoughts, revelations, and questions with her and the
group.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 26-year-old son who is a drug addict and an
alcoholic,'' the gray-haired woman says haltingly. ``And we have no
relationship, because I'm too busy looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   At each break, participants are encouraged to find someone they
don't know and share something they have just learned about
themselves. And late that evening, before Handel dismisses the
weary group for the day, she gives everyone a homework assignment:
Go and write a letter to someone in your life whom you have ``run a
racket on.'' A racket, she already explained, is a mind-set that
compels people to respond negatively to others. After you write the
letter, she says, call the person and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, calling the ghosts in one's life _ people you
have unfinished business with, whether a present or former spouse,
a parent, sibling, or child _ is a key ingredient in the Forum's
dynamic. By the next day, the phones in the Forum office are jammed
with participants dialing loved ones and asking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Judie, a flight attendant in her 50s who lives in Quincy, did
her homework the first night. She called her ex-husband to
apologize for blaming him for everything that had gone wrong in
their marriage. ``Our divorce was so bitter that my kids got caught
in the crossfire,'' Judie tells the group the next day, tears on
her cheeks. ``What I've realized is that I had a part in it. My
biggest racket was being a victim, and what I lost was not just my
marriage, my house and my husband, but I lost my girls.''
</P>
<P>
   When she called Friday night, Judie says, her ex wasn't home,
and the person who answered the phone was her youngest daughter,
who is 17.

<P>
   A friend from Colorado spilled the beans to  &UR; Steve Sherman &LR; :
They're making fun of us. A new ad campaign for the Colorado
lottery, based on the slogan ``Stranger things than you winning
Lotto,'' uses a San Francisco example of a ``stranger thing'':

San Francisco Police Department officer could carry his dummy
around with him on the job. ``Our reputation precedes us,'' says
Sherman.

TEACHER STABBED IN FRONT OF STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Calif. _ The father of a fourth-grade student stabbed
and seriously wounded his daughter's teacher in an apparent
disagreement over the girl's progress, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbing occurred Tuesday in front of several students,
including the suspect's daughter. The 43-year-old teacher was
hospitalized in serious condition with a stab wound to her right
side.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gonzalez had been waiting several minutes in the back of
his 9-year-old daughter's classroom at J.O. Ford Elementary School
when the teacher, Nancy Peer, dismissed the students shortly before
3 p.m., Richmond police Sgt. Allwyn Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   As students filed out of the classroom, Gonzalez, 30, began
discussing his daughter's classroom performance with Peer, the
children later told the police. As Peer turned away, he stabbed her
once in the right side with a kitchen knife, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relatively calm conversation, a brief exchange of
words,'' Brown said. ``Nothing that would indicate he intended to
do her harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving his daughter behind, Gonzalez fled the school
immediately, the police said. He was arrested without incident a
short time later outside his home in neighboring San Pablo. He was
booked into Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez on one charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators rushed to the classroom, where they found
Peer sitting in a chair, clutching her side, school secretary Ada
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Peer, in her third year of teaching at the school, was taken by
ambulance to a nearby and then airlifted to the John Muir Medical
Center in Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who were at the school at the time of the stabbing
gathered outside the administration office to comfort distraught
students, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were crying, they were sad,'' Martin said. ``She's a very
well-liked teacher.''

   The family Bible holds a special place in the American home and
imagination. In many families, it is an heirloom, passed from
generation to generation. Whatever the edition (it's usually the
King James) and whatever the language (it's usually English), the
family Bible is considered the authentic Bible, the very word of
God.
</P>
<P>
   The current owners might not even believe that, but they imagine
that once, long ago, someone in the family did.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an ancestor's thoughts about Scripture are scrawled in
the book's margins. Perhaps some of the pages are worn or dogeared,
maybe at a place an ancestor turned to for solace or encouragement.
And often at the back of the Bible is a family genealogy, where the
names, births and deaths of relatives are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everything that the old family Bible provided can now
be found in Bible CD-ROM boxed sets. The Bible software on the
market is distinctly Christian and includes both the Old Testament
and the New Testament. It should be noted that in some of the
supporting material in a CD-ROM called the Complete Multimedia
Bible, there are a few not-too-subtle put-downs of Judaism and
Islam.(There are numerous CD-ROMs of sacred text aimed at the
Jewish and Muslim markets, but they are not included in the
following reviews.)
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Bibles may not become treasured heirlooms, but truth
be told, they can run circuits around the old family Bible. Instead
of one version, the electronic Bibles provide a variety of classic
and modern translations, in English as well as Greek, Latin,
French, Spanish and Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   The reader can divide the computer screen into segments and view
the various translations side by side. Bible commentaries, maps and
dictionaries are instantly accessible to help decipher and
explicate the text.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't want to do the reading yourself, the Multimedia
Bible will read the text for you, in the sonorous tones of James
Earl Jones. Other electronic Bibles provide video scenes of sacred
places in the Holy Land, like the Garden of Gethsemane and the
Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others offer classic religious works of art, like
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and Leonardo's ``Last Supper.''
Others include such inspirational music as Gregorian chant and
Haydn.
</P>
<P>
   Giving new meaning to the term family Bible, the new electronic
sets also include collections of lavishly illustrated children's
stories, like Noah's Ark and the Good Samaritan, and a host of
religious games, including one called Name That Hymn.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling sad or lonely? Need inspiration or advice? No need to
thumb through pages. The electronic Bibles will suggest verses to
turn to in times of need. One recommended verse is Psalms 34:4: ``I
sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible software even gives the user an opportunity to write
commentary, keyed to particular chapters and verses. These can be
saved with the King James Version and labeled _ as ``Joe's Bible
Commentary,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing, of course, is the feel of a hefty leather-bound
or clothbound book in your hand, a book with a musty smell and a
sense of family history. Computer software can never compete on
that level, but the new family Bibles might inspire some people to
take the old book off the shelf for a new look.
</P>
<P>
   The NIV Study Bible Complete Library  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Zondervan Publishing House; $129.95; Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   This is the electronic Bible for the serious student. It has
extraordinary versatility and scope for those who want to prepare
sermons, academic papers and Bible study sessions. The CD-ROM
contains four English versions of the Old Testament and the New
Testament: the New International Version (NIV), the King James, the
New American Standard and the Revised Standard Version; there is
also a version in Greek. Supporting the basic text are a dozen
dictionaries, encyclopedias and concordances.
</P>
<P>
   The user can view up to nine screens at once, but four seemed
just enough for me. I put one Bible translation on each of my four
screens and went exploring. I could easily turn to any chapter and
verse and see how the versions differed. (The Old Testament was, of
course, originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament in
Greek, so all English versions are mere translations.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Word searches were a snap but had to be narrowed to be
meaningful. For example, words like Moses, Jesus, forgive,
sacrifice and pray brought up hundreds of citations each. Words
like gorilla and banana brought none. There were quite a few
``frogs,'' but only one when I matched the search with ``pray,'' as
when Pharaoh prays to rid his kingdom of the plague of frogs
(Exodus 8:8). I had to come up with a more modest word. I tried
``meek.''
</P>
<P>
   The King James was the champion of meek, with 16 references, the
most famous from the Sermon on the Mount: ``Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth'' (Matthew 5:5). The others had
far fewer references to the word meek. The New American Standard
Bible rendered the verse from Matthew as ``blessed are the
gentle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible software allows the user to install the Greek font,
but since I do not read Greek, I did not try that. A Hebrew font is
not available, but a useful Hebrew transliteration is.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM also has an excellent Bible atlas with full-color
maps of things like the journeys of the apostles. It also contains
dazzling photographs of the Holy Land. The images on the screen are
sometimes small, but scrolling in all directions provides the user
with some beautiful panoramas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of this program was the 200-page user's
guide. It helped me with installation and then guided me on my
searches.
</P>
<P>
   There was one area in which the user's guide was of little help,
and that leads me to my only criticism of the NIV Study Bible: when
it came to the Inspirational Reading, the software promised Bible
verses for almost anything that ails you: sickness, confusion,
impatience, temptation, fear.
</P>
<P>
   But the program delivers only chapter-and-verse references,
rather than the verses themselves. The user (perhaps already under
stress) has to search alone.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you are confused, check out Isaiah 42:16. ``I
will lead the blind by a road they do not know, by paths they have
not known I will guide them.'' I just looked it up in the family
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Zondervan New International Version Bible  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Zondervan/Compton's; $49.95; Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   This collection has two CD-ROMs and an unusual touch: a
hardcover book. The CD-ROMs hold the best-selling classics _ one
includes the King James Version (1611) and the other the New
International Version (1978) _ while the hardcover book is the
reissue of a 1925 inspirational volume, ``Streams in the Desert,''
by L.B. Cowman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Cowman book, I could have used a user's guide for
the CD-ROMs. Installation instructions are limited to two scant
pages inside the jewel-box CD cover. There is an online user's
guide, but no printed version.
</P>
<P>
   The two CD-ROMs contain much more than different versions of the
Bible. The King James CD is called The Complete Multimedia Bible
and has graphics, video, music and maps. What most distinguishes it
is the voice of James Earl Jones, who reads selections like the
Sermon on the Mount and the Ten Commandments. When you hear the
commandments from a voice like that, you listen.
</P>
<P>
   The search capabilities were slower than those on other Bible
CD-ROMs and less useful. Rather than searching for specific words
in the Bible, users can also search the CD-ROM by subject. As a
result, you can search a broad category without confidence that you
will catch the reference you want.
</P>
<P>
   The inspirational readings did not disappoint; they gave not
only the citations but the verses themselves. But I began to detect
a certain fundamentalist interpretation. Under ``abortion,'' for
example, the reading was from Deuteronomy 30:19: ``I have set
before you life and death ... therefore choose life, that both thou
and thy seed may live.''
</P>
<P>
   In the videos, you can see devout pilgrims at the Via Dolorosa,
the ``way of sorrow'' that Jesus followed to his crucifixion, or at
the Stone of Unction, where Jesus' body was laid out to be
anointed. The story of the suffering, death and resurrection of
Jesus is told with reverence. But my suspicions about a
fundamentalist approach were confirmed when I saw in the videos
that Jewish and Muslim beliefs were presented as superstition.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, an unnamed narrator walks jauntily through a
Jewish cemetery and almost sneers as he says that Jews believe that
the dead will rise from their graves. Perhaps the most offensive
clip is one that discusses the mosque on the Temple Mount in
Jerusalem. The narrator suggests that Muslims now offer camel rides
there, which is not true. The video clip gratuitiously shows a man
in an Arab headdress helping a tourist off a camel and then giving
the camel two kisses on the lips.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The second CD in this set, called Compton's Interactive Bible,
contains beautiful examples of religious art and music. At the
beginning of Genesis, for example, you can click to hear a
selection from Haydn's ``Creation.'' At the beginning of Matthew,
the ``Hallelujah, Amen'' by Handel. ``Jesu, Joy of Man's
Desiring,'' by Bach, opens another chapter. As for art, there are
details of each of the prophets from the Sistine Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem I found with this CD-ROM was that it was very
slow. Moving from one image to another took inordinately long. I
waited several minutes for a word search. If you have the time (or
a more powerful computer than I have), this CD-ROM would be worth
exploring. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Family Bible Collection, Deluxe Edition  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Encore Software; $49.99; Windows 3.1 or higher.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three CD-ROMs in this box contain a variety of programs. On
one disk, there are 10 Bible versions that can be searched and
studied with the help of 17 Bible study resources, like
dictionaries, commentaries, concordances and maps. I found the
searches lightning fast and precise, but the graphics were not as
clear and inviting as several of the other search programs I
sampled.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished this set was not the Bible study tools as
much as what is in it for families. One disk has 24 Bible stories
that introduce children to the characters and tales from Scripture
through words, song and animation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stories are ``Moses in a Basket,'' ``Jesus on the
Mount'' and ``The Cross and the Resurrection.'' These are geared to
preschoolers and children in the early grades who are just
beginning to read. I found the illustrations vivid and appealing,
but the music grated on my nerves after a story or two.
</P>
<P>
   Another program has a wealth of Bible games. The CD-ROMs
developers seem to be arguing that if children are going to play
video games, they might as well play ones based on the Bible.
Players are gently guided through the games by the Archangel
Michael, who helps them select the appropriate level and lets them
choose from Old and New Testament challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the ever popular Name That Hymn. Was that ``A
Mighty Fortress,'' ``God Is Good'' or ``Holy, Holy, Holy''? The
Archangel Michael rewards you with praise if you get it right.
</P>
<P>
   The set also includes a program that reviews the history of
Jerusalem from a Christian perspective and a program of 1,000
clip-art images for use in church publications and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   You can, of course, find better graphics and sound on other
computer games, but given the difficultly of getting young people
interested in the Bible, the Family Bible Collection can be
considered a noble effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bible Study Companion  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Expert Software; $14.99; Windows 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   Bible Explorer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Expert Software; $14.99; Windows 3.1 and 95.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bible Study Companion has many of the Bible versions and
Bible commentaries that other CD-ROMs offer, but it has superior
graphics, layout and clarity. Reading through ancient texts, even
inspirational ones, can be tedious, but the presentation on this
CD-ROM was among the best.
</P>
<P>
   The makers did not try to put too much on the page by crowding
it with small print, and they kept extraneous art off the screen.
What the user gets is swift searches and clear text.
</P>
<P>
   The CD also offers Scripture in languages not found on other
software, including Latin, Spanish, French, German and Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   And while all the CD-ROM's offered users an opportunity to add
their own Bible comments, The Bible Study Companion was the only
one that always kept a screen open for this purpose _ a definite
plus for the compulsive note taker.
</P>
<P>
   Bible Explorer uses the King James Version as its text. In some
ways, it seemed like the poor man's version of the Complete
Multimedia Bible, one of the two CD-ROMs in the Zondervan set.
While that set featured the voice of James Earl Jones, Bible
Explorer has an unnamed actor reading passages.
</P>
<P>
   The video clips depicting the life of Jesus have the quality of
a mediocre made-for-television movie. One of the best features of
Bible Explorer is the biblical time line, which stretches from
creation through the New Testament books. Moving between two posts
of a scroll, the time line is inventively designed and links the
stories to Bible verses, photographs, videos, historical dates and
narration.
</P>
<P>
   For the money, you cannot beat these Expert Software versions.
They do not have everything that the more expensive Bible CD-ROMs
offer, but not everyone needs all the extras. After all, we got
along for centuries without nine viewing windows in the family
Bible.

   McDonald's said it plans to open 20 restaurants in Bosnia, in
another sign that the divided country's fragile peace is continuing
to take hold and that a kind of normality is returning to the
former Balkan killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Bosnian government said representatives of
the U.S. fast-food giant held talks with Prime Minister Edhem
Bicakcic and other ministers to finalize its plans.
</P>
<P>
   It said the American group planned to open at least three
restaurants in the capital, Sarajevo, though it did not say when
this would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a local population of roughly two million people in
the federation, thousands of foreigners live and work there for
numerous international organizations overseeing the Bosnian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Post-war Bosnia consists of two entities, a Muslim-Croat
federation and a Serbian republic, but it is not clear whether
McDonald's may also be planning to open restaurants in the Serbs'
territory.
</P>
<P>
   If McDonald's does establish a presence in Bosnia it would be
seen as a boost for the country's Western-sponsored efforts to
rebuild its economy following the devastating 1992-1995 war.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few foreign investors have come to the country,
notably German car maker Volkswagen which last August started a
joint venture with conglomerate United Industry Sarajevo (UNIS) to
produce Skoda Felicia cars.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors have been reluctant to enter Bosnia, partly due
to the slow pace of reform to establish a properly functioning
market economy with legislation protecting their investments. &QL;

 By STEVE CONNOR  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered that Martians do exist. A life form
has been uncovered in Antarctica that has been feeding on ``Martian
food'' for many thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   The organism is a common terrestrial microbe that has lived deep
inside the cracks of a Martian meteorite, which fell to earth
13,000 years ago, landing on an ice-sheet at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the microbe has lived off the meteorite's
organic carbon molecules, which originated when Mars had liquid
water, and possibly life, of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the principle `you are what you eat,' it could be
described as a Martian,'' said Dr. Andrew Steele, a British
scientist who made the discovery while working at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steele left Britain two years ago to work with the
scientists at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) who announced in 1996 that they had found
signs of life on the Martian meteorite known as ALH84001.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of finding a Martian microbe, Dr. Steele came across
a type of terrestrial bacteria belonging to a group called the
Actinomycetes, a common microbe found almost everywhere on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have lived deep inside the rock and could only have
got its food source of carbon from the meteorite itself. It is the
only known organism on earth which has been eating Martian food,''
Dr. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the two-year investigation into the ALH84001
meteorite will be released next week at the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference in Houston, where NASA scientists will continue
to argue that the meteorite shows genuine signs of extraterrestrial
life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steele, who analyzed the meteorite using sophisticated
microscopy techniques, said the microbe was overlooked in the past
because scientists had been using inappropriate detection methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the particular case of ALH84001, a terrestrial organism
went undetected by all the techniques that claim to be able to
detect life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorites from Antarctica were once thought to be free from
earthly contamination because of the pristine state of the frozen
continent, but this is no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the microbe could be bad news for NASA
scientists in search of genuine Martians. It will make it more
difficult to convince a skeptical world that their meteorite
evidence of life is truly out of this world. &QL;

   PARIS _ The baguette, one of the cliche symbols of France, is in
gentle but unmistakable decline, squeezed between a youthful taste
for wholemeal bread and the rise of the fake, factory-made bread
stick.
</P>
<P>
   These were the depressing conclusions of a survey of the
bread-eating habits of the French, published by the newspaper Le
Figaro. Although 80 percent of the bread eaten in France still
comes in the shape of long, slender, white loaves, there has been a
rapid decline in the sales of true baguettes (and their larger
sisters, ``pains``) in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from zero 19 years ago, the sales of cheaper,
factory-made, chemically-assisted baguettes has risen to 30 percent
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Such bread is cheaper but spongy and tasteless compared to the
crisp, fresh, handmade loaves for which France is celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Another menacing trend has also been identified. Younger French
people in their 20s and 30s are turning away from baguettes of all
kinds towards wholemeal, longer-lasting bread.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of such people, Le Figaro concludes, the baguette is
a symbol of an ``outdated, caricature France, comparable to the
beret and the pitcher of cheap, red wine.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, history is coming full circle. The baguette is a
relatively recent invention of urban bakers in the 1920s and 1930s.
The traditional French bread of the 18th and 19th centuries, the
shortage of which Queen Marie-Antoinette apocryphally dismissed
(``Let them eat cake``), was like the flat, wholemeal loaves now
favored by the trendy young.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years is long enough to create a tradition, however.
Bakers who make their own baguettes by the old methods _ long
fermentation of the dough, followed by baking in brick ovens _ want
the government to ban the use of the title ``boulangerie'' by the
shops which warm up ready-mixed, factory-made dough. Such a rule
was imposed in 1995 but overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Saint-Ouen, frequent winner of the award for the best
baguettes in France, baked at his shop on the Boulevard Haussmann
in Paris, said: ``Industrial baguettes are the negation of true
bread. They taste like nothing and disgust the consumer.'' &QL;

   TOKYO _ Martin Lee, head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, is
normally a thorn in the flesh to the new Chinese rulers of the
former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this opposition curmudgeon admits to have fallen for
Disney's magic spell, saying, ``All the political parties support
this. Who could say no to Donald Duck?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Sir Donald Tsang, the bow-tied financial secretary
of Hong Kong, who chose to announce in his budget speech last week
that Hong Kong is holding serious negotiations with the Walt Disney
Company to host the first Disney theme park in Asia outside of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   For the Hong Kong economy, it is no laughing matter. Tsang
called last year's 5.1 percent fall in Hong Kong's gross domestic
product ``the worst economic setback our generation has ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney project is just one of several bold attempts unveiled
by Tsang to rekindle growth and stem a hemorrhage of business and
investment to Singapore, including a Hong Kong $13 billion (205
billion yen or $1.7 billion) ``cyberport'' project to help Hong
Kong develop into a global information services hub.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney theme park is intended to revive the flagging tourism
industry, which accounts for about 4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the July 1997 handover to China, there has been a sharp
decline in foreign visitors, particularly Japanese, who were by far
the biggest spenders.
</P>
<P>
   The park would be built on Lantau Island, site of the Hong Kong
$155.3 billion (2.45 trillion yen) new Hong Kong International
Airport that opened last year and is already connected to Kowloon
by the world's longest road/rail suspension bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hong Kong brings a Disneyland theme park to town, it would
generate about Hong Kong $20 billion (316 billion yen) in
construction spending, 3 million additional tourists and about
95,000 low-skill jobs,'' according to Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of talks had already rallied the stock market in Hong
Kong, with prices rising 7.5 percent since last week.
</P>
<P>
   This represents a backhanded tribute to the astonishing success
of Tokyo Disneyland, which in the past 16 years has excited the
envy and admiration not just of other cities and countries, but
even of the Walt Disney Company itself.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1, 1997, to March 31, 1998, Tokyo Disneyland drew
16,686,000 visitors, making it the most popular theme park in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, trailed second; third was
the original Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.; and fourth was
Disneyland Paris (the new name for Euro Disneyland), 32 kilometers
(20 miles) east of the French capital.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike all the rest, Tokyo Disneyland is entirely owned by a
local company, Oriental Land, which only pays royalties to Walt
Disney _ 10 percent of all admission fees and 5 percent of revenue
from restaurants and shops in the theme park.
</P>
<P>
   For its 1997 financial year ending last March 31, Oriental Land
had revenue of 175.5 billion yen and net income of 14.3 billion
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The share price of Oriental Land has fallen steeply from 8,850
yen when it was first listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
December 1997, but its closing price on Friday, 5,950 yen, was
still higher than that of Honda Motor, 4,690 yen, and it has a
higher price-to-earnings ratio than the export giant.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes being made in Japan did not pass unnoticed at
Disney headquarters. Since Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company
had entered what seemed like a terminal decline. Corporate vultures
were circling and there was talk of Disney being broken up and sold
off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the 50th anniversary of Donald Duck, a boardroom
revolution brought in Michael Eisner as chairman and Frank Wells as
president, and the company stopped croaking and began to fly,
becoming one of Wall Street's darlings and hottest stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking they had learned their lesson from Tokyo Disneyland,
the company decided to sink a large sum of its own money in the new
Disneyland outside Paris, to have hotels built inside the park and
to control its management.
</P>
<P>
   The French government had to add expensive sweeteners to lure
Disney away from Spain, such as building a rail extension and a
highway interchange, and reducing its amusement taxes on the theme
park's receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this time the Disney magic failed to work. Euro Disney had
to be rescued from losses by creditor banks and a Saudi Arabian
prince, and Disney had to accept a moratorium on royalty payments
and management fees from Euro Disney, of which it owns 39 percent.
Unlike Oriental Land, the share price of Euro Disney has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the euphoria in Hong Kong about
hosting a Disneyland will be justified. Tsang has warned that
``much hard negotiating lies ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's first choice for a second Asian theme park was
Queensland, Australia, but the company backed out in October after
the Queensland government balked at the amount of subsidies, tax
breaks and land concessions that Disney was demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Queensland Premier Peter Beattie commented that ``only Goofy
would have picked up such a deal.'' &QL;

   Oriental Land is phlegmatic about the challenge from a rival
Disney theme park in Asia. For the business year ending last March
31, it says 96.9 percent of visitors to Tokyo Disneyland were
Japanese, and mostly from the Kanto region (Tokyo and the
neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Saitama, Ibaraki and Kanagawa).
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Japan National Tourist Organization from April
1, 1998, to March 31, 1999, of visitors to Japan from Hong Kong,
mainland China, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea)
found that Tokyo Disneyland was most popular with those from Hong
Kong (visited by 40 percent) and Taiwan (26 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from China showed little interest (only 9 percent went
there) and those from South Koreans were even more indifferent (3.6
percent). For Americans and Europeans, Tokyo Disneyland did not
even make the top 10 places visited in Japan, said a JNTO
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In the year 2000, Oriental Land plans to open a commercial
complex, including cinemas, restaurants, shops and a ``Disney
Ambassador'' hotel, on a 12-hectare site adjacent to Tokyo
Disneyland. This development will cost about 65 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, it plans to open another theme park on 71.4 hectares of
reclaimed land, called ``Tokyo DisneySea.'' This will charge
separate admission to Tokyo Disneyland, and is costing another 338
billion yen to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies want to emulate the stellar success of Tokyo
Disneyland, and the greatest risk now to Oriental Land is from
domestic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Flanking Tokyo Disneyland on either side are two other Tokyo Bay
theme parks under construction, both conveniently near stations on
the Keiyo Line: the 350-billion-yen Lotte World Tokyo on a
19.2-hectare site in Tokyo's Edogawa Ward, and the 20-billion-yen
Legoland near Makuhari in Chiba Prefecture, a project of Denmark's
Lego Group.
</P>
<P>
   In Osaka, the 170-billion-yen Universal Studios Japan theme park
is also due to open in 2001. &QL;

   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried chile flakes

   CHICKEN WINGS IN CARAMEL SAUCE AND GINGER (CANH GA KHO GUNG)
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   Pickled bean sprouts, recipe follows
</P>
<P>
   Caramel sauce, recipe follows
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds chicken wings
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely shredded fresh gingerroot
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Prepare pickled bean sprouts and caramel sauce. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each chicken wing into 3 pieces; the main wing joint, the
second joint and the wing tip. Reserve wing tips for soups or
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In 3-quart saucepan, add chicken wing pieces and shredded ginger
to the cooled caramel sauce. Stir to combine. Set over high heat
and bring mixture to a rapid boil. Cover the pan, reduce heat to
low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 40 minutes, or
until chicken is very tender. Skim off any excess fat.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer chicken wings and sauce to a serving dish. Sprinkle
with black pepper, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spoon some of the sauce over rice and serve with
pickled bean sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Pickled bean sprouts (dua gia):
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh bean sprouts
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch scallions, cut into 2-inch-long sections
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup distilled white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Combine bean sprouts and scallions in large nonreactive bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Combine salt, vinegar and 4 cups water in small saucepan. Bring
to a boil. Cool until warm to the touch. Pour brine over bean
sprout mixture. Marinate for at least 1 hour, or until ready to
serve. Drain before serving.
</P>
<P>
   (Pickled bean sprouts are best served the same day they are
made. They won't stand longer marinating, as they will become
soggy.)
</P>
<P>
   Caramel sauce (nuoc duong thang):
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   4 shallots, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Cook sugar in small, heavy saucepan over low heat, swirling pan
constantly, until brown. It will smoke slightly. Immediately remove
pan from heat and stir fish sauce into caramel, being careful to
guard against splattering (the mixture will bubble vigorously).
</P>
<P>
   Return mixture to low heat and gently boil, swirling the pan
occasionally, until sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes.
Add shallots and ground pepper to taste; stir to combine.
</P>
<P>
   Cool this sauce thoroughly before using. If cold food is added
to a caramel sauce that is hot, the sugar will harden instantly and
you'll end up with a dish of candy chips.
</P>

bean sprouts: 236 calories, 11 grams fat, 16 grams carbohydrates,

</P>
<P>
   Glossary:
</P>
<P>
   Chiles: The Vietnamese use an assortment of chiles, but the most
common is the tiny (but combustible) ``bird'' chile also used
extensively in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Chile sauce: Not the namby-pamby stuff Americans call chili
sauce, the Asian condiment is a thick paste of ground chiles with
vinegar and garlic. Each brand has its own version of heat. Widely
available in Asian markets, the most popular brands are sold in
plastic squeeze bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Fish sauce: The cornerstone of Vietnamese cooking, the sauce is
made by fermenting anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger: As in most of Asia, ginger is an important seasoning
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Green papaya: The Vietnamese prefer the green variety of this
fruit. Look for papayas that are green, firm and unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   Noodles: Noodles appear in the national dish, ``pho,'' as well
as in combinations with curries and stir-fries.
</P>
<P>
   Oyster sauce: An ingredient that was introduced by the Chinese
and is used in stir-fries as an enriching agent.
</P>
<P>
   Rice: Buy aromatic jasmine rice. If you can't find it,
substitute basmati rice.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp chips: Another ingredient borrowed from the Chinese.
These dried chips are sold in bags and should be deep-fried. Do not
buy colored shrimp chips.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar cane: Buy fresh sugar cane (in Vietnamese or Hispanic
markets) if it is
</P>
<P>
   quite moist and heavy with juice. Canned sugar cane, packed in
juice, is a fine alternative in most dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Water spinach: This water-growing vine does not require the
extensive cleaning of our domestic version. The stems are long and
the leaves are shaped like arrows. The stems are tough, the leaves
tender. Break off the bottoms of the stems, pull off the leaves
with some of the tender stems and chop the tougher parts of the
stems.

 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, Alan Rothenberg was a frustrated parent. He was
tired of buying educational CD-ROMs at $45 a pop, only to have his
daughters become bored and abandon them after a couple hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the World Wide Web had plenty of sites with children's
games, but he wasn't impressed with their educational content and
he was reluctant to let his young daughters roam on the Internet,
where they might end up in a seedy corner. Like many parents, he
thought: ``If only there were an Internet just for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So he made one. This month his company, JuniorNet
(www.juniornet.com), begins what it says will be the first safe
online service just for preteen-agers. After purchasing JuniorNet
software and using it to log on, members can access only approved
links, trade messages only with approved friends and post only
approved postings.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies, some still in embryonic stages, plan to
follow with similar pay services in the coming months. They are
jumping on what has become a marketing bandwagon aimed at signing
up parents made wary by scary news reports about the Internet _ or
by what they have seen with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   These services, which are becoming known as ``subscription-based
virtual private environments for children,'' say they are like
roped-off portions of the Internet, where youngsters can get their
feet wet with the ways of the Web without swimming into dangerous
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe playground that's being monitored by people you
trust,'' said Parry Aftab, the author of ``A Parents' Guide to the
Internet'' (SC Press, 1997). ``This is where it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did for the longest time was say `you can't go here
and you can't go here' instead of saying `These are the places you
can go,''' Ms. Aftab continued. ``We were taking the slipper away
from the puppy and not giving them anything else to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   One attempt by lawmakers to keep out the ``bad stuff,'' the 1998
Child On-Line Protection Act, has been delayed by court challenges
every step of the way, said Stephen Valerie. He is the founder of
Kids On-line America (www.kola.net), a service for students,
teachers and parents that hopes to be up and running by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and time again, the courts are not going to enforce any
kind of censorship,'' he said. ``Again the private sector is the
one that's going to have to come to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his small San Francisco-based company is banking on it.
In a survey released in June 1998 by Jupiter Communications in New
York, 53 percent of parents said they would be willing to pay for
an online service for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said almost 4,000 parents signed up to the test an
early version of his JuniorNet, for which a CD-ROM provides access
to the service and allows subscribers to download stories,
activities and games to their hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The content comes from such sources as the publications Ranger
Rick and Highlights for Children. ( Rothenberg says he looked at
the magazines that littered his children's room for inspiration.)
</P>
<P>
   The JuniorNet service has no links to other Web sites, but it
does aim to be an Internet community with e-mail and bulletin
boards. Messages to and from people not on the parents' approval
list will be automatically bounced, and messages for bulletin
boards will be screened by JuniorNet employees before they are
posted.
</P>
<P>
   One selling point pushed by some subscription services is that
they will provide safety not only from cesspools of pornography and
lurking predators, but from a constant barrage of Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole strategy to use kids to get money out of their
parents' pockets,'' said Gerry Bishop, editor of Ranger Rick
magazine. He called his publication and JuniorNet ``refuges from
that assault,'' since neither accepts outside advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Established companies are starting to pay more attention to
their younger consumers. America Online, which has always had a
roped-off area of the Internet pool, has revamped its Kids Only
section. Disney's Blast Online (www.disney.go.com) has memberships
for children, complete with parental controls for e-mail and chat
groups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   To try to jump ahead of the competition, the newest services are
asserting that their security measures are even more strict. KOLA
says it plans to keep its community upstanding through
``registration validation.'' Members join through schools,
community organizations (like the Boy Scouts) or partner
corporations that can verify that a 12-year-old girl really is a
12-year-old girl, not really a 40-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Another service, Safe-Site, which is not yet available, plans to
be so exclusive that it cannot even be accessed through a regular
computer. For $100-150, parents can buy the Electronic Learning
Aids sold by Safe-Site parent company Oregon Scientific. These toy
laptops directly dial up www.safe-site.net, where children can
compare game scores and trade greeting cards. A Safe-Site modem
($50) and Internet Service Provider ($15 a month) are also
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe harbor type of thing,'' said Jean Armour Polly,
whose Net-Mom Web site (www.netmom.com) has links to 100
``mother-approved'' sites. The whole industry is making a move
toward accentuating the positive, she said, not just screening out
the negative. To that end, software filters, which were first
developed to search for ``bad words'' and block access to sites
containing them, now often work from a list of approved sites.
</P>
<P>
   But site addresses have a way of changing overnight, Ms. Polly
pointed out, so any services that link outside their own system
leave a potential door ajar to something creepy from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never hear me saying we are the 100 percent safe
solution,'' said Valerie, whose KOLA service will have outside
links.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, even services like JuniorNet that promise to
provide their young clients with endless new material can offer
only a shadow of the wonders of the Web, said Barry Fagin, a
founder of Families Against Internet Censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a lot of really great stuff on the net that
children's online networks would never capture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to parents to decide whether these services, some of
which use filters themselves, are better than such leading
filtering software as SurfWatch and Cyber Patrol. A truly enclosed
environment might be more prohibitive than the strictest filter,
Fagin said.
</P>
<P>
   Enclosed communities are good for busy parents who might not
have time to scrutinize their children's computer use, he said, but
``there is no substitute for parental involvement and it would be a
mistake to become too complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Marney Morris, an interactive software
designer, has worked on creating such a closed environment for an
educational service called SprocketWorks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we said, you know what? That's not the spirit of the
Web,'' Ms. Morris said. ``And we got feedback from parents, too,
who said, `We don't want our kids restrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, anyone can visit the Web site, www.sprocketworks.com,
where youngsters can use e-mail and do such things s follow stocks
in selected companies (such as The Gap) on the mock Sprock Market.
The site also encourages parents to order a series of educational
CD-ROMs from the Palo Alto-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Seema Williams, an industry analyst with Forrester Research,
predicts that scholastic networks that help teachers pull the
Internet into the classroom will soon make it into the home market
as well. Good educational content, she said, is what will sell
parents on the idea of plunking down $10, $20 or $30 a month for a
subscription service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real challenge for these guys right now: Are they
able to offer enough of extra value that is not available free on
line?'' she said.

VIETNAMESE CUISINE EXTRACTS A WORLD OF FLAVOR AND TEXTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vietnam's food is a happy result of bad times.
</P>
<P>
   This swath of land between China and India has long been coveted
by outside forces. In earliest times, it was the Mongols from China
who came over the bordering mountains to exert their will. Later,
in this century, the French came colonizing, bringing Catholicism
and their system of government. In between, this verdant land was
visited by Portuguese traders and Japanese occupiers.
</P>
<P>
   This historic uproar has resulted in a cuisine that incorporates
elements from all those nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Mongols brought a love of beef, evident in the country's
national dish, ``pho.'' Pho is a broth of noodles and beef stock
garnished with any of various pieces of beef described at great
length on menus. The Vietnamese don't distinguish foods for various
meals, and pho is a popular breakfast item. The Chinese-Vietnamese
populations also brought ingredients such as hoisin sauce and
oyster sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The French were another big influence, bringing their fine bread
(used today to make submarine sandwiches garnished with chopped
pepper and cilantro). The French also introduced their intensely
roasted coffee. The Vietnamese added sweetened condensed milk to
make their own version of cafe au lait.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, the Vietnamese have put their own stamp on
the food. It's lighter than the food of neighbors _ and the
interplay of cooked ingredients served with raw ingredients, smooth
ingredients punched up with crunchy ingredients, is the hallmark of
this delicate fare.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a cuisine of technique, but rather one of texture
and taste.
</P>
<P>
   SHRIMP ON SUGAR CANE (CHAO TOM)
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 to 6 appetizer servings
</P>
<P>
   Nuoc cham dipping sauce, recipe follows
</P>
<P>
   1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   1-inch piece rock sugar
</P>
<P>
   1-ounce piece fresh white pork fat
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cornstarch or potato starch
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large white of scallion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   12-inch-long piece sugar cane, cut crosswise into 4 (3-inch)
pieces, then split lengthwise in half and in half again, or 1 can
sugar cane in syrup, pieces split, see Note
</P>
<P>
   Boston lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Mint sprigs
</P>
<P>
   Cucumber slices
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you can find it in good condition, use fresh sugar
cane, but the canned sticks packed in syrup are also excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the nuoc cham dipping sauce and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Spread shrimp out in an even layer on a baking sheet and freeze
until very firm, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In mortar, pound rock sugar to a coarse powder. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan of boiling water over high heat, cook the
pork fat until translucent, about 2 minutes. Drain and cut into
tiny dice.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the shrimp from the freezer and with a large, sharp knife
chop them fine. Add the pork fat and continue chopping until a
coarse paste forms, leaving some small pieces of shrimp. Put the
mixture in a bowl and stir in the pounded sugar, baking powder,
cornstarch, pepper, salt, and white of scallion until well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   With oiled hands, take about 3 tablespoons of the shrimp mixture
and wrap it evenly around a piece of sugar cane, leaving about 1/2
inch exposed on both ends. Repeat with the remaining shrimp and
sugar cane. You should have about 10 shrimp sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Oil a steamer basket and place the shrimp sticks evenly apart on
it. In a large saucepan, bring 1 inch of water to a boil over high
heat. Put in the basket, cover, and steam the shrimp sticks until
almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Preheat the broiler or
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the steamer basket from the pan and, if broiling, put the
shrimp sticks on a baking sheet. Broil about 5 inches from the
heat, turning often, until deep brown on all sides, about 3
minutes. Or grill the shrimp sticks over a hot fire, turning often.
Serve hot. To eat, remove the shrimp from the cane, wrap it in
lettuce with sprigs of mint and slices of cucumber, and dip it in
the nuoc cham. Chew on the sugar cane if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Nuoc cham dipping sauce (nuoc mam cham):
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 small fresh red chiles, minced, or 1 to 2 teaspoons dried
pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon white vinegar, heated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup bottled fish sauce (nuoc mam)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 small carrot, finely shredded, rinsed and squeezed dry
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   If using dried chile flakes, soak them in the vinegar in a
medium bowl for about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the bowl with the chiles, add the bottled fish sauce, lime
juice, carrot, garlic and sugar. Stir in 1 1/2 cups warm water
until the sugar is dissolved. Serve at room temperature. Store in a
jar in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: At Trinity Meadows ractrack, there was once a triple dead
heat in each position. Who were the winners and what were the
payoffs?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.J., Azle, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like you're referring to the ninth race at Trinity
Meadows on Jan. 5, 1996. In that race, two horses tied for first,
two for third, and two for fifth _ no winners were recorded for
second or fourth because of the ties.
</P>
<P>
   The American Quarter Horse Association is not aware of any other
three-tie races, representative Stacy Krug said.
</P>
<P>
   First-place payouts were for First Heartbeat ($3 to win, $3.20
to place and $3.40 to show) and Comntoaracetraknearu ($5 to win,
$5.20 to place and $3.20 to show). Third-place payouts won for Ima
Last Glass ($2.40 to show) and Tornado Touchdown ($3 to show).
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-place finishers J.J. Shot Glass and Dash On High ended up
out of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Trifecta winners earned $219.40 by picking both first-place
finishers and either of the third-place horses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whom can I contact about an oil painting of Sadie T. Beckham
from Texas Christian University in 1936?
</P>
<P>
   _ I.K., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Beckham, who died in 1955 at age 74, was a TCU trustee for 17
years and was the second woman voted to the board, said Terri
Gartner, administrative assistant in the TCU Office of
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   She began her TCU career as matron of Jarvis Hall and was
appointed dean of women in 1921, retiring from that position in
1937. The sorority house Beckham-Shelburne Hall is named after
Beckham and Elizabeth Shelburne, her successor as dean of women.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact Gartner at 257-7810.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to David Spade?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.D., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Spade in care of his agent, Adam Venit, at Endeavor,
9701 Wilshire Blvd., 10th Floor, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Spade, who resides part of the year in his hometown of
Scottsdale, Ariz., bought a $3 million home in Beverly Hills in
February, according to the ``Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old comedian stars in ``Just Shoot Me'' and will be
appearing in the film ``Lost and Found,'' to be released in April.

CONGRESS, COMPANIES WARY OF Y2K LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Executives at Alstom Esca, a midsized Bellevue
software company, think they're ready for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes energy management programs for
electrical utilities, has tweaked and tested its product. Managers
even plan to dispatch an employee to New Zealand on New Year's Eve
so they can watch the software's reaction to 2000 from a country
close to the international date line and then phone back any alerts
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Alain Steven, says he is confident his
software won't be afflicted by the millennium bug. But Steven has
another worry: lawsuits that could somehow ensnare his company if
anything goes wrong in the complex world of utilities for which he
makes a small part.
</P>
<P>
   Now, egged on by the concerns of businesses ranging from the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce to tiny Puget Sound software companies,
Congress is debating three measures that would restrict lawsuits
arising from damage caused by computers that fail to recognize the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of Y2K liability reform is being promoted by Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., as well as numerous other lawmakers who
argue that fear of lawsuits is diverting resources from fixing the
problem. The supporters cite a variety of studies warning of a
potential explosion of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software companies and software users should concentrate all
of their attention on solving the Y2K problem, and not be
distracted by litigation,'' said Gorton, who has tried
unsuccessfully to rein in other types of product liability
lawsuits. ``The goal is to see to it that we solve the problem, not
enrich lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation is hotly opposed by trial lawyers, consumer
groups and the Clinton administration, who worry that businesses
and individuals will lose legal recourse to which they are
entitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real mistake to talk about restricting rights before we
even know what the problem is,'' said Mike Misner, a Gig Harbor
attorney who counsels companies and lawyers on Y2K liability
issues. ``When Congress starts limiting people's access to courts
or damages, it usually creates a bigger problem than the one they
tried to fix.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: Many computer programs use only two digits
to identify a calendar year, making the assumption that all dates
are during the 20th century. The fear is that, left as is, those
programs will mistake 2000 for 1900, and will fail.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Senate Commerce Committee, more than 40
lawsuits arising from the Y2K bug have already been filed. In one
highly publicized case, a group of doctors sued a Florida software
company that wanted to charge them to replace medical office
software that would crash in 2000. The company, Medical Manager
Corp., settled the case by providing the doctors with a free
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   One expert told a congressional panel last year that ``Y2K has
the potential to become the most litigious event in the history of
civilization,'' and cited a Lloyds of London report estimating that
dealing with the year 2000 _ changing software as well as defending
lawsuits _ will cost $1 trillion in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the litigation resulting from Y2K-related failures is
anything like experts are predicting ... the courthouses will be at
standing room only and Y2K litigation will last for years into the
next millennium,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of
the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   The measures moving through Congress would not prohibit
lawsuits, but would attempt to restrict them by imposing a 90-day
cooling off period in which consumers must notify businesses of a
Y2K problem and allow them an opportunity to fix it. The bills also
limit punitive damages and class-action lawsuits and encourage the
use of arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures is co-sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Dunn,
R-Wash. The measures are generally supported by Republicans and
opposed by Democrats, but one is co-sponsored by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that we need to be certain that Y2K problems are
not going to result in any economic hardship for a responsible
company that is working to solve the problem,'' said Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass, whose state is home to numerous technology
companies. ``But at the same time, we don't want to ... wind up
protecting the negligent company that has failed to meet the
appropriate standard for fixing a negligent product.''
</P>
<P>
   The measures were proposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation
of Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern of the business community is that they don't
get forced to divert resources from fixing the problem to a flood
of lawsuits,'' said Jim Wootton, director of the Institute for
Legal Reform at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has expressed concern about the
proposals. Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson, testifying
about one proposal, said, ``Our preliminary analysis indicates this
bill would be by far the most sweeping litigation reform measure
ever enacted.'' She called some of the provisions ``extremely
unfair,'' and said others might encourage businesses to slow their
Y2K readiness programs.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers argue that it is unfair to restrict the lawsuits
for a problem that they call ``the most expensive negligence in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Misner, the Gig Harbor attorney, said that he anticipates both
businesses and individuals might have reason to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is on a ventilator, and it fails, and that failure
can be traced to a Y2K complication, that patient or patient's
family probably won't be pleased if someone says you can't sue or
your damages are limited,'' Misner pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, already a defendant in one year 2000 lawsuit over the
Foxpro database program, is staying out of the congressional fray.
The company says it is focusing its efforts on debugging its
software, rather than steeling for litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have been very clear to us that Y2K is the No. 1
issue they're facing, and if it's the No. 1 customer issue, we're
going to have the resources and tools for them,'' said Microsoft
Y2K Product Manager Don Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said 93 percent of the 2,000 programs tested by Microsoft
to date are largely free of the Y2K bug. ``We don't expect to get
sued.''
</P>
<P>
   But other companies, particularly those with fewer legal
resources, are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``All major companies are concerned about surviving and making
sure they come out OK,'' said Joyce Shui, vice president for legal
affairs at Data Dimensions, a Bellevue consulting firm that advises
Fortune 500 companies on Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at companies are so desperately interested in staying
in business _ they've got a very powerful incentive (to prevent a
problem.) They don't need the threat of litigation,'' Shui added.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, the Alstom Esca executive, warned that the issue could
have widespread negative impact in the Puget Sound, with its
concentration of small software companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of companies can be caught up in the Y2K liability
issue and put out of business, even if they don't have anything to
do with the problem,'' Steven says. ``For a company our size,
dealing with one case is very expensive. If we end up stuck in the
middle of 10 different cases, we're out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should he worry if his product works? Steven says that if
anything goes wrong in the complex and interconnected world of
electricity transmission, lawyers searching for defendants will
target his company even if his software functions correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about getting caught in the net, because a power
plant is going to trip somewhere that has nothing to do with us,''
he said. ``Imagine a couple of power plants go off line as a result
of the Y2K bug. Industrial consumers may declare that because they
lost power for a day, they're going to cast a net as wide as
possible and go after all the companies involved. That's the kind
of abuse that I see.''

DOING A LITTLE POLITICAL TIRE-KICKING IN AUSTIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, in the Austin Convention Center, auto
dealers were showing off their wares. For the bargain price of $5,
would-be car buyers could peruse a dazzling array of vehicles
produced by a dazzling array of carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   There were sport utility vehicles; there were coupes and sedans
of every size and shape. There was the ever-popular Corvette and
the eye-catching new Chevy Impala.
</P>
<P>
   Car shoppers' heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And just a short stroll down the hall, in Ballroom A, the
national media were kicking the tires on the
soon-to-be-ready-for-the-showroom presidential campaign of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was Bush's official announcement that he was
forming an exploratory committee to raise money and measure support
for a possible White House run in next year's Republican primaries.
Calling Sunday's event a ``news'' conference was a stretch, of
course; it occurred five days after Bush tipped off Texas reporters
that he would take the first major step toward a formal campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The governor had promised the home-state new media that they
would be the first to know. That he made good on his pledge should
have surprised no one; he has made a habit of keeping his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every plank of Bush's 1994 platform became state law
during his first term as governor _ and there is no reason to doubt
that he will steer most of his 1998 campaign promises through the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has vowed to postpone any active campaigning for the
presidency until the legislative session concludes at the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who does in office what I say I will do,'' Bush
said. ``Last year, I told the people of Texas I did not know
whether I would seek the presidency, and they should factor that in
when they went to vote. I also told them I would be here this
spring ... fighting for a bold agenda of tax cuts and education,
welfare and criminal justice reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Legislature adjourns, Bush said, he and wife Laura
``intend to begin traveling to meet with people, to listen to
people and to explore on our own the prospect of a campaign for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his determination to do his job as governor first,
Bush declined to answer reporters' questions seeking his positions
on national and international issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave the state and move around the country, I'll be
talking about all these issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters also wanted to know how George W. Bush the governor
would distinguish himself from George Bush the former president,
who happens to be the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the newshounds were thinking about the car show, where
passers-by gawked at the highly touted 2000 Impala and wondered
what was new and exciting about this car that carries the name of a
Chevy that symbolized a proud but long-gone era in automotive
history.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't offer a detailed comparison of father and son, but
he predicted that ``over the course of time, people will be able to
distinguish differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that his father is a man of ``enormous integrity and
decency, and he handled his most important job of all as good as
anybody can do it _ and that is being a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   One obvious distinction between would-be President Bush and
used-to-be President Bush is the makeup of the governor's campaign
team.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member exploratory committee that Bush introduced Sunday
included longtime Republican mainstays such as former Secretary of
State George Shultz and ex-national chairman Haley Barbour as well
as emerging GOP stars such as Reps. Henry Bonilla of Texas, J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington _ but no central
figures from the Bush White House.
</P>
<P>
   Other distinctions will become evident, as Bush promised, over
the course of time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that car buyers will like that new Impala. I'm
certain that voters will like this new Bush.

G3: BLUE AND WHITE AND DIFFERENT ALL OVER, EXCEPT THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The official name of Apple's most powerful and most stylish
Macintosh is the Power Macintosh G3. Apple Computer, which has been
creative in so many other ways recently and whose current motto is
``Think Different,'' apparently was thinking undifferent that day
and merely recycled the name from an earlier, uglier model also
known as the Power Macintosh G3.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Apple's loyal customers quickly dubbed the new
machine the G3 Blue and White, in an attempt to distinguish this
innovative new desktop machine from its boring, beige and boxy G3
predecessor, which has been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   The new G3 is a gorgeous computer, at least to my eye, far more
interesting than its smaller and cuter but more annoying little
sibling, the iMac. It is unmistakable with its pillow-like curves,
love handles and unconventional color scheme _ translucent blue and
white plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Picasso, one of several deceased celebrities and rebels
whom Apple has enlisted to sell its new line of computers, would
have approved of the bold design, the ads suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Or would he? The master had an eye for imperfection as well as
perfection, and the new G3 has its share of flaws. These
shortcomings are not serious enough to dissuade loyal Macintosh
users from coveting the G3, but they may be annoying enough to keep
undecided customers from joining, or rejoining, the Macintosh
family.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the popular iMac, which comes in five different fruit
colors (blueberry and grape are by far the most popular, retailers
report), the new G3 comes in blueberry only. But the G3 processor
itself comes in three versions: mild, or 300 megahertz; spicy, or
350 MHz, and hot, 400 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   The mildest version costs $1,599, not including monitor, and the
spiciest costs $2,999, although by adding options and necessities
you can easily spend more than $5,000 for a fancy system.
</P>
<P>
   While those current offerings hold their own, and sometimes
surpass, rival systems based on the Intel Corp.'s Pentium II line,
the recent arrival of Pentium III systems highlights Apple's
challenge to match Windows-based machines on price and performance.
A new crop of faster Pentium IIIs is coming before June.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with earlier Macintoshes, however, the new G3 computers
are much faster, thanks in part to a faster internal data bus and
more special, high-speed memory called backside cache.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which makes Apple's Power PC G3 chips, recently
disclosed details of the successor G4 chip, which, like Intel's
Pentium III, has a new set of instructions designed to accelerate
the performance of multimedia applications like 3D graphics, video
and audio. Apple has not publicly discussed plans to add the G4 to
its product line, but Motorola said it would be shipping the chips
in volume before summer. Beyond power, features are the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The new G3s come with an array of connection ports for attaching
peripherals. These consist of two high-speed Firewire ports, two
Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, one Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) port
and a fast Ethernet port for linking the computer to a network.
</P>
<P>
   Firewire is a new connection method, developed by Apple, to
transfer data at high speeds (up to 400 megabits per second)
between the computer and a variety of peripheral devices that need
higher-speed connections to the PC _ digital video and still
cameras, storage devices and so on. Only about 100 Firewire
devices, mostly video cameras, are available today.
</P>
<P>
   Firewire is good. USB is good. The problem arises from Apple's
decision to drop connectors for older SCSI and serial
peripherals.(Apple had the good sense to retain one ADB port for
attaching older keyboards and mice, which is a profound relief
since the new G3 also uses the horrible round mouse and skeletal
keyboard that Apple first foisted on iMac buyers.)
</P>
<P>
   And echoing its unfortunate decision with the iMac, Apple has
not included a floppy drive with the new G3. Apple contends that
the floppy diskette is a thing of the past and that users ought to
be able to choose from a variety of newer alternative portable
storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that means the customer has to pay at least $100 or
$200 extra for an Iomega Zip drive, an Imation Superdisk drive or
some other variant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Apple contends that SCSI is old-fashioned, too, but
what about customers who have invested lots of money in SCSI
devices? They can pay $50 or more for a SCSI expansion card to put
into one of the precious expansion slots, Apple says. There have
been some compatibility problems with early SCSI cards.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a serial port can be addressed by converting one of
the two standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports to a serial port,
again at added cost. Attaching an older, non-USB printer to the G3
requires yet another adapter, at yet another cost.
</P>
<P>
   These are annoyances, as is Apple's decision to cover up the
headphone jack and volume control on the front of the new G3s
built-in CD-ROM drive. An Apple spokeswoman said it was not a
design flaw. ``The customer is expected to connect the headphones
from the rear of the computer,'' she said. Well, of course. They
were just thinking different.
</P>
<P>
   Such decisions do not make the Power Macintosh G3 easier to use,
and that is the main problem. Ease of use is one of the traditional
strengths of the Macintosh line. If Apple is to gain market share
from Windows machines, it has to be the champion for ease of use,
not just brightly colored plastic.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the new G3 has scored a huge advance with its
innovative drop-down side, which makes it refreshingly easy to gain
access to the computer's internal slots and components. Anyone who
has struggled to open the case of a computer will appreciate the
simplicity and elegance of Apple's drop-down design, which lays out
the main circuit board flat on the table. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   And Apple has taken the right step by including an ATI Rage 128
graphics card with 16 megabytes of video RAM, which means the
computer is an excellent game machine. I've been using the spicy,
350-MHz G3 to play the Mac version of ``Myth II: Soulblighter,''
which is a delightful strategy game for anyone who enjoys attacking
demons with an army of homicidal dwarves, warlocks, archers and
swordsmen (www.bungie.com).
</P>
<P>
   The Mac was about equal to the Micron Millennia Max, a 500-MHz
Pentium III machine that came with a formidable 3D graphics system
of its own, a testament to the power of the G3 and its graphics
subsystem. The only drawback was trying to navigate through the
game using the Mac's miserable mouse and keyboard, whose dinky
arrow keys were basically unusable, especially in the heat of
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all, however, is that Apple this week cut
prices of its Powerbook G3 laptop computers by hundreds of dollars,
bringing the base price below $2,000 for the first time. These
stylish portables, which have 14.1-inch screens, can do double duty
as desktop computers by attaching a normal keyboard, a normal mouse
and a normal monitor through its normal, albeit old-fashioned,
connection ports.
</P>
<P>
   They are not svelte, but they are impressive, and now they are a
better bargain than ever. Until the end of April, Apple will toss
in an extra 64 megabytes of RAM or a copy of the Connectix Corp.'s
Virtual PC software, with Windows 98, at no extra charge. Virtual
PC allows a Mac to run both Mac OS and Windows programs.
</P>
<P>
   The price cuts, which are as much as $800 on some models, signal
that Apple is getting ready to introduce a new generation of
portable computers. These new portables will round out Apple's
revamped product line, especially at the lower range of the price
scale.

Richard Kluger, a 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner, is the author of
``The Paper: The Life and Death of The New York Herald Tribune.'' 
 By RICHARD KLUGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One can hardly conceive of a more daunting belletristic
challenge than to undertake a full-scale autobiography when the
subject's first 10 years were in large part spent desperately
dodging the most horrific atrocity of his century. How to prevent
the rest of the tale from dwindling to anticlimax even when, as in
Max Frankel's case, he survived to become for a time the world's
most influential newspaperman?
</P>
<P>
   Rather like Stephen Spielberg, who could not sustain the level
of intensity with which he rendered the D-Day inferno at the
opening of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Frankel, alas, becomes the
victim of his own gripping storytelling. If ``The Times of My
Life'' consisted of nothing more than its first 85 pages,
recounting how Frankel's German-Jewish family, kindly regarded in
its ``well-scrubbed'' hometown near Leipzig, eluded Hitler's ever
more vicious anti-Semitic crackdown _ ``fear created endless
hallucinations of rescue,'' he writes _ it would justify the whole
volume.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's indomitable struggle against mindless bureaucrats
that won her and her only child a last-instant reprieve from the
Nazi cauldron, his father's forced separation from them and
endurance of the Soviet gulag, and Max's own bravery as a
terrorized child fugitive constitute a luminous new chapter in the
Holocaust literature.
</P>
<P>
   While he never forgot his ordeal after his family found refuge
in New York in 1940, young Max declined to accept his spiritual
heritage as his defining essence _ ``Jewish is only a religion,''
he told his displeased father _ and fast grew into a passionately
assimilated American and a skilled user of his new nation's idiom.
The journalism bug bit him badly at Columbia University where he
ran the student daily and came to relish ``the chance to champion
remedies for discovered wrongs'' and ``the reliable armor to shield
an otherwise debilitating shyness.''
</P>
<P>
   On graduating, Frankel joined The New York Times, which he had
served as campus stringer, and never worked anywhere else. Why
would he when, in his estimate, ``it frames the intellectual and
emotional agenda of serious Americans?''
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years the quintessential Timesman, he had a front-row
seat at the great political and diplomatic events of the age and
backstage access to many of its leading players. His mission, as it
evolved with his craft, was to help refine The Times' brand of
journalism into ``a narrative art, connecting past to future, cause
to consequence.'' He continues, ``Our job was to choose, to apply
judgment to events, and to transform mere information into
understanding.'' A worthy conceit, surely, but perhaps more suited
to philosopher kings than harried chroniclers under a tight daily
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering only occasional spasms of the immodesty that almost by
definition infects all who venture into autobiography, Frankel
takes us inside The Times as he advances from night rewrite man,
churning out high-pressure copy on the sinking of the Andrea Doria,
to his foreign postings in Vienna, Moscow and Havana during the
loudest saber-rattling days of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Then on to the Washington bureau, covering the State Department
and White House as United States policy makers slid into the
deepening morass of Vietnam; to Washington bureau chief when The
Times nervily published the Pentagon Papers, letting the public in
on its government's long deceptions over Indochina; to potent tours
of duty directing the plump Sunday edition, the editorial page and,
from 1986 to 1994, the paper's entire news staff of 1,000 as
executive editor.
</P>
<P>
   In this crowning role he opened up the paper's concept of
suitable front page news by inviting it to call attention to wide
social currents, not merely discrete events of the day; encouraged
coverage of gay issues; enlisted and promoted more women and
blacks, and made the paper's graphics more eye-appealing.
</P>
<P>
   For all his chauvinism Frankel is not above faulting The Times
for past sins of both commission and omission. He long opposed his
editors' slavish dependency on ``official'' news as defined by
government spokesmen and instead championed analytical and
interpretive reporting as often the surer route to the truth. He
felt the paper's prose tended to be drab, its business coverage
thin, its sports pages unimaginative and its editorials steeped in
``pious certitude.''
</P>
<P>
   What we miss here, for all his acute intelligence and exhibition
of journalistic virtuosity, is a sense of drama and combat in
Frankel's seemingly inevitable ascent to the pinnacle of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit he is no kiss-and-teller and only briefly dwells
on intramural stratagems, rivalries and flash points. He lionizes
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, The Times' former publisher, as a fierce
but unpompous defender of the paper's traditional embrace of
quality even when it meant leaner profits, and deflates A.M.
Rosenthal, his brilliant predecessor as executive editor, for
brandishing an ego-driven and despotic managerial style.
</P>
<P>
   At its best ``The Times of My Life'' offers deft judgments of
the world figures he encountered up close. He finds Khrushchev
``the most robust politician of my time,'' behind whose ``mask of
bluster I thought I saw a face of decency.'' He believes Richard M.
Nixon ``so despised his own warped nature that he found it
difficult to perceive virtue in anyone else'' and rates Hubert H.
Humphrey ``the most openhearted and ill-disciplined of our national
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Frankel displays his sophisticated grasp of the
built-in tension between the prime sources of the news and its
gatherers. The Washington press corps, he suggests, is ``so
dependent on government information and so dutiful in disseminating
official propaganda that it grows desperate to prove its mettle by
also exposing error, hyperbole, hypocrisy and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Emblematic of Frankel's career-long integrity is his decision
here to use italics instead of quotation marks in recording
revelatory conversations to which he was privy but did not take
notes for or in dialogues that he has recreated from others'
accounts. Many authors of otherwise estimable works have been far
less exacting, but as Frankel remarks in the end note, ``For a
journalist, a quotation mark must be sacrosanct.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a blessing that such a dedicated witness to our times was
not exterminated in his youth along with so many less lucky.

   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Mary Pipher, the psychologist whose book about
adolescent girls, ``Reviving Ophelia,'' was a phenomenal best
seller, was walking on the prairie near her home at sunset, showing
off the quiet beauty of winter in Nebraska. She walks here with her
writers' group for women on weekends, she said, and it is where
they like to celebrate New Year's Day. She walked on the prairie a
lot during the 11 months her mother lay dying in a hospital in
Kansas in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This is the landscape, undramatic and Midwestern, that has
shaped her life and thinking, and landscape is the metaphor she
uses to explore aging in her new book, ``Another Country: The
Emotional Terrain of Our Elders,'' which will be published on March
15 by Riverhead. As in ``Reviving Ophelia'' (Putnam, 1994) which is
as much social critique as psychological treatise, Dr. Pipher, 51,
views aging through the lens of the anthropologist she set out to
be in college. In ``Another Country,'' she observes that to grow
old for many people in today's fragmented, age-phobic,
age-segregated America is to inhabit a foreign country, isolated,
disconnected and misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xenophobia means fear of people from another country,'' she
writes. ``In America we are xenophobic toward our old people.'' She
says she hopes her book can be a guide to that other country and
offer ways for the generations to reconnect. ``The more we love and
respect our elders,'' she writes, ``the more we teach our children
to love and respect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pipher (the name is pronounced PYE-fer) said she has always
loved older people, and her book started out as a way to get
reacquainted with her five aunts, Grace, Henrietta, Margaret, Agnes
and Betty, who are all in their 80s. ``I thought, I'll go and hang
out with my aunts and interview them,'' Dr. Pipher said. ``They're
all wonderful and quirky.''
</P>
<P>
   But she eventually expanded her focus to include the stories of
many other Midwesterners, men and women who have been shaped by the
Depression, World War II and the hardships of rural life. She
describes them as the last generation to have come of age in a
communal culture, and writes that what also defines them, and
causes conflict with their baby boomer children, is that they are
pre-therapy and pre-irony.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pipher says she deliberately chose not to write a book about
90-year-old marathon runners and tennis players and other
age-defying men and women held up as exemplars of ``successful''
aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to explore the experiences of ordinary people.'' she
said. ``And many ordinary people are heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinary people she interviewed for her book ``know about
loss, ill health and diminishment,'' she writes, adding that ``they
cope with experiences that would take down a younger person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things I love most to do are walk and read,'' Dr.
Pipher said. ``I can't imagine not being able to walk and read.
Many older people lose all the things I love.'' The loss is made
doubly difficult, Dr. Pipher writes, in a culture that worships
autonomy and independence. Older people are made to feel ashamed
for needing help. ``They want to be kind and strong,'' she writes,
``and, in America, they learn that to do so means they should ask
little of others and not bother young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pipher knows something about loss and diminishment herself.
One of her retinas became detached two years ago and, at home
during a record blizzard, she was unable to get to a doctor. She
lost the vision in her right eye. ``It started me thinking about my
own aging, how to prepare for it,'' she said. ``I wanted to see how
old people cope.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the morning after the sunset walk on the prairie, and she
was talking in one of her favorite indoor places, the Mill, a
friendly, bustling coffeehouse in downtown Lincoln where the tables
are shared by college students, musicians, mothers, children and
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pipher is wearing beige jeans, a blue cotton turtleneck,
Birkenstocks with socks and no makeup. Her curly graying blond hair
is still damp from her morning swim at the University of Nebraska
at Lincoln. She warmly greets several people she knows, but her
presence does not draw any particular attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviving Ophelia,'' which described how adolescent girls lose
their identities in a culture obsessed with looks, was on the New
York Times paperback best-seller list for 154 weeks. Dr. Pipher
draws sellout crowds wherever she speaks, has been invited to the
White House by Hillary Rodham Clinton and was anointed ``a guru
from Nebraska'' by Newsweek. But in Lincoln, where she arrived in
the early 1970s to go to graduate school in psychology and never
left, she is still just Mary.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband Jim, 49, who is a psychologist and a jazz
and bluegrass musician, have lived a dozen years in a modest stone
house full of books, guitars and family photos in an old
neighborhood south of downtown. They drive a nine-year-old Honda.
They have had the same friends for decades. The couple have two
children, a son and a daughter, in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a really strange, paradoxical way, the reason I've ended up
being a popular writer is that I'm very ordinary,'' Dr. Pipher
said. ``I've had the same sort of experiences most middle-class,
middle-aged people have. I've taken my kids to Yellowstone and gone
to a lot of potluck dinners with friends, and so on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   One Midwesterner who inspired ``Another Country'' was certainly
not ordinary, and that was Dr. Pipher's mother, Avis Bray, who
managed to raise seven children and work a grueling schedule as a
small-town doctor in Nebraska and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd get up in the morning,'' Dr. Pipher said, ``drive 20
miles to a hospital, do her rounds, work at her own clinic, maybe
do house calls in the evening, and the phone would ring at night,
and she'd go sit by some older farmer while he died.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Bray did not draw on her experience with illness and
death when it came to confronting her own decline, from diabetes
and its complications. ``She was in fairly strong denial about her
illness, and her death,'' Dr. Pipher said. ``I don't want to be
critical about my mother, but she wasn't a good role model in terms
of that. She was a wonderful role model in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pipher, the oldest daughter, writes of driving on weekends
to visit her mother in the hospital three hours away, and of trying
to handle her medical care, while at the same time juggling her
responsibilities as a mother of two teen-agers, a writer and a
psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``That year, no matter where I was, I felt guilty,'' she says in
the book. ``If I was with my mother, I wasn't caring for my own
kids or my clients. If I wasn't working, I was ignoring my family.
When I was with my children, I thought of my mother alone in a
faraway hospital. I got depressed and crabby.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her mother, Dr. Pipher said, who without knowing it set
her on the path toward becoming a writer back when she was a young
girl. ``I'd ride with her, and she'd tell me stories about her
childhood, about her patients,'' Dr. Pipher recalled. ``That's
where I started getting really interested in stories. She was a
really good storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were early impediments to Dr. Pipher's translating her
fascination with stories into writing. When she confided to her
father, Frank Bray, that she dreamed of becoming a writer, he
discouraged her, she said, explaining that writers don't make any
money.
</P>
<P>
   Encouragement did not come at school, either. She was about 12
when she wrote a sonnet about the seasons, which her teacher marked
``trite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up on writing,'' she said. ``I just gave up. I thought,
I don't have any talent, and my dad says even if I were talented, I
couldn't make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   She got her undergraduate degree in anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley. But in 1969, the year she
graduated, jobs and graduate school financial aid were scarce. So
when Nebraska offered her a five-year fellowship in psychology, she
took it. She met her husband the first day of graduate school in
Lincoln. Psychology turned out to be the right choice for
professional reasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just a therapist to the bone,'' Dr. Pipher said. ``I'm
fascinated by people, I love to listen to people's stories, and,
modestly speaking, I'm very good at problem solving.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her 20s and into her early 30s, she was busy seeing
patients as a therapist, teaching at the university and raising her
children. But when her younger child entered fourth grade,
something happened. ``I decided, `I want to write,' '' Dr. Pipher
recalled. `` `I will do it even if nobody ever sees a word I
write.'''
</P>
<P>
   She took a writing class at the university. Her teacher was an
ex-football coach from Texas named Charles Stubblefield. ``After my
first story, he said, `You know, you can be a writer if you want.'
'' She started writing every morning _ book reviews, fiction,
essays, commentary for National Public Radio. Her first short story
was published by The Cottonwood Review at the University of Kansas
and won a prize. In the 1980s, she published her first book,
``Hunger Pains,'' about women and their obsession with thinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviving Ophelia'' was rejected by 13 publishers before
landing on the desk of a New York publisher, Jane Isay. ``I read
this proposal for `Reviving Ophelia' from an unknown agent, and I
thought, `I have to publish this,''' said Ms. Isay, who is now the
editor in chief of Harcourt Brace.
</P>
<P>
   In a following book, ``The Shelter of Each Other: Rebuilding Our
Families'' (1996), she observed that families are under siege in a
culture that's driven by technology, money and the media.
</P>
<P>
   The women in Dr. Pipher's writers' group continue to read her
work, offering encouragement and inspiration, she said. They are
all around the same age, she said, and lately they have been
talking about what it will be like when they are old. ``We plan to
be together,'' she said, suggesting that down the line the group
might even set up house together.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she has visited the other country she said she is less
afraid of growing old, in part because of some of the people she
has met. She writes that she learned about the importance of
remaining engaged in the world from Jane Jarvis, still a jazz
musician at 81, and from Sally Gordon, who at 89 holds two jobs in
the Nebraska state government and volunteers at a senior center.
She says she learned about acceptance from an 86-year-old woman
named Alma, who for 66 years not only cared for her profoundly
retarded daughter but embraced the burden.
</P>
<P>
   To love our elders, she said, we have to know them. ``Take your
children to visit their grandparents,'' she said. ``Send them to
spend the summer with an elderly aunt.'' She encourages people to
just sit with their aging parents. ``So many times people send
flowers to their mothers,'' she said. ``Their mothers really don't
want flowers. They want them.''
</P>
<P>
   And she says the younger generation has much to offer. ``I
really do believe that our generation also has a lot to teach about
coping, including the idea that you talk things over, and you tell
the truth, and you say what needs to be said,'' Dr. Pipher said.
``After all, our generation in many families taught our parents to
hug and say `I love you.'''

<P>
   No engineering degree is needed to appreciate how useful a
computer would be in designing an 87-foot steel sphere capable of
holding 585 people at once, apparently floating on air in the
center of a giant glass cube, neither suspended from its top pole
nor supported at its bottom.
</P>
<P>
   However, the architects of the new Hayden Planetarium, which is
to open at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan
early next year, are (italics)really(end italics) marveling at
their ability to design something that is three-sixteenths of an
inch tall.
</P>
<P>
   That is the height of the lozenge-shaped acoustical cutouts _
5,599,663 of them _ that will perforate the skin of the planetarium
sphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never have attempted that by hand,'' said Todd H.
Schliemann of the Polshek Partnership, the New York architectural
firm that designed the planetarium and the surrounding Frederick
Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five and a half million perforations you don't attempt by
hand,'' Schliemann said.
</P>
<P>
   In ways big and small, computer-aided design _ CAD for short _
is changing the built environment. Any doubt about that was
dispelled in 1997 when the world first glimpsed the undulating,
titanium-clad surfaces of the Guggenheim Museum designed by Frank
O. Gehry in Bilbao, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was engineered with Catia, by Dassault Systemes
(www.dsweb.com), a software program that was also used to design
the Boeing 777.
</P>
<P>
   By making possible engineering feats that would have been
impractical in the past, computers are ratcheting up the wow factor
in architecture, that feeling of utter astonishment in those who
behold buildings whose forms defy orthogonal convention and _ it
sometimes seems _ even gravity itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wow factor _ not in the sense of gimmickry but in the
power of the reality of the world around us _ is a most exciting
thing,'' said Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of
Natural History. ``It's the beginning of people wanting to learn
and understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing that sphere seeming to float, with nothing holding it
up at the south pole, will have that effect. The average person's
reaction will be, `I want to get in there.' And the good news is,
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Invited by Ms. Futter to let his mind run free, James Stewart
Polshek, of the Polshek Partnership, happened on the sphere idea in
early 1995 while looking at a cross section of the old Hayden
Planetarium. Completed in 1935 and well loved for generations, the
building was distinguished by a copper dome 75 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Polshek placed the point of a compass on the center point of the
dome in the drawing and twirled the instrument around until it
formed a full circle. Epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then began to get nervous because I wondered how in the
world would we ever be able to represent this to a client,''
Polshek recalled. ``The CAD system allowed us to develop multiple
views, inside the box, outside the box and from a variety of
angles. And I knew we had something.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology informed every step in the design. Besides the
startlingly realistic renderings that were used to convince the
client, impress donors and pacify neighbors, there were skeletal
outlines known as wire-frame views, animated vignettes of changing
sunlight patterns, studies predicting temperature and lighting
levels, and structural drawings refined enough to send via e-mail
directly to the fabricator of the sphere panels in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sphere appears to float, it actually rises from a
tripod of steel legs. They support a circular truss on which the
upper hemisphere rests and from which the lower hemisphere is
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper hemisphere will be the 432-seat Space Theater,
where a Zeiss star projector and a Zeiss video projector will cast
images of the night sky on a dome overhead. In the lower half will
be the Big Bang Theater, where up to 150 viewers will stand on a
circular platform to see the first moments of the formation of the
universe on a curved screen below them.
</P>
<P>
   The theaters are reached by a 320-foot spiral ramp that wraps
around one and a half times, constantly changing in height and
radius.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly simple, the ramp was actually as much of an
engineering challenge as the sphere because none of its dimensions
are constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of a seashell,'' said James A. Schmidt, an architect who
is the museum's executive director for the Rose Center project.
``In nature, it's beautiful. But when you go to build it, you'd
never be able to figure it out. In theory you could _ physics
hasn't changed. But in practice, you couldn't do it without the
strength of computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than beginning with a laborious calculation of the
coordinates for each point in this intricate structure, the
architects created a virtual model of the spiral form and let the
computer figure out the X, Y and Z.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is opening up the possibility of more complex
geometries in buildings,'' said V. Guy Maxwell of the Polshek
Partnership. At age 32, he is squarely on one side of the
generational divide between the architects who grew up with pencils
and tracing paper and those who learned through CAD.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell does not even have a Mayline straight-edge rule on his
drafting board, once standard equipment for any architect. Instead,
a visitor to his cubicle finds an animated study running on his
monitor. Intricate, lattice-like shadows are seen gliding silently
over the spherical planetarium surface, as they would in the course
of a day in June.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell speaks of building a ``model'' of a railing that he
needed to study. The model is not made of paper-and-plastic
Foamcore board; it resides in his computer, which runs the software
Microstation, by Bentley Systems (www.bentley.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other widely used programs include Autocad, by Autodesk
(www.autodesk.com), and Archicad, by Graphisoft
(www.graphisoft.com).
</P>
<P>
   Another architect who grew up with CAD is Trent J. Tesch, 28, a
senior designer at the architectural firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox
Associates in New York. ``When you depict form traditionally, it's
in plan, section and elevation,'' he said. ``What CAD allows you to
do is plan the form intuitively, as you think it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the generational divide is Frederick P.
Rose, the New York real estate developer and patron of the Rose
Center, who earned his engineering degree at Yale in 1944 and still
keeps a slide rule at his desk _ ``the last man in captivity to
have one,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much of the Rose Center could have been created
without CAD, he answered firmly, ``We could have designed all of
it.'' Asked how much time it would have taken to do so, he
conceded: ``Ah! Now you've got it. At least three or four times as
long.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the realm of construction, timing is critical _ the cost
and availability of labor and materials can change day by day,
prime development sites cannot be left fallow for long, financing
can dry up in an instant, and tenants can have their own exacting
demands and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Structural novelty was one of several reasons it took 16 years
and revision upon revision to realize Frank Lloyd Wright's
unorthodox design for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which has a
spiraling ramp somewhat akin to that of the Rose Center. CAD has
not necessarily made architects and engineers more imaginative. But
it has made imaginative solutions more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is the ability to explore alternatives rapidly and
to reach a conclusion on various alternatives that allows you to
make choices,'' said Matthys P. Levy, a principal in Weidlinger
Associates, consulting engineers on the Rose Center. ``The computer
doesn't create the idea, but the computer allows you to make
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   CAD programs have allowed Kohn Pedersen Fox to choose all kinds
of dynamic forms. The Shanghai World Financial Center, for example,
which is to be the tallest building in the world on completion in
2002, will begin as a square block at the base. As it rises, two of
the sides will taper along the lines of intersecting arcs, leaving
a thin slab at the top, 1,509 feet in the air. For good measure,
the upper part of the building is to be penetrated by a
165-foot-high hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the computer,'' said Tomas Hernandez Jr., director of
computer services at the firm, ``most people would seek simpler
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Philip Johnson, who has been designing buildings for more
than half a century, has used CAD in recent years to produce
polymorphous structures like the proposed Cathedral of Hope in
Dallas. The main sanctuary will have 46 different wall planes,
leaning both inward and outward as the building reaches its full
height of 111 feet over the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of these shapes and sculptural forms, the computer is
the right vehicle to do this,'' said Alan Ritchie, the partner at
Philip Johnson/Alan Ritchie Architects who is in charge of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, speaking from the older side of the
generational line, Ritchie cautioned, ``We've all got to be very
careful that the tool does not control the master.''
</P>
<P>
   His words were echoed by Polshek, who has just turned 69 and has
been practicing architecture for 35 years. He worries that CAD
encourages architects to be too facile, doing things effortlessly
that once demanded much intellectual discipline and, at the
drafting table, a lot of elbow grease.
</P>
<P>
   ``For architects of my generation, it's a very threatening
tool,'' Polshek said. By the same token, he allowed, ``In a funny
way, it's made me a young designer again because I feel that I can
accomplish things that I thought for a while were getting away from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schliemann, of the Polshek firm, grew up in architecture as
computers did. He spent almost a semester at Cornell in 1974
working with a four-inch stack of punch cards to produce a
rudimentary drawing of a simple gable-roofed house. (The
(italics)big(end italics) achievement was to coax the computer into
suppressing the lines on the far side of the house, to make it
appear solid.) His embrace of CAD comes with a few reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A computer doesn't understand gravity,'' Schliemann said. ``In
its bounds there are only X, Y and Z planes. You have to willfully
step away from the seduction of the machine and ask, `Is it telling
me the truth?' I don't doubt that it's calculating truthfully, but
is it the appropriate truth for this time and place?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the exterior of the Rose Center, CAD was used to
fulfill a mission. ``The main idea was to open the museum to the
public,'' Schliemann said. ``Through the glass wall, you can walk
down the street and look right inside at this spherical artifact.
That entices you.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a crystalline surface with an overall transparency of
90 percent, the glass panels composing the wall will have no
mullions between them. Rather, they will abut one another, fastened
together at their corners by four-legged stainless steel
``spiders'' attached to struts, which will connect in turn to wall
trusses or hanger rods suspended from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the computer, we were able to refine things to an
extraordinary degree,'' Schliemann said. CAD-generated renderings
of the wall system are so exquisitely detailed they even show the
faint reflection of the steel spiders on the glass surface.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you the ability to see reality before it exists,''
Schliemann said. ``We can imagine it. The computer
(italics)proved(end italics) it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is an unalloyed benefit. In the past, architects
could count on a structure showing unexpected facets after
completion: a fiery sparkle of windows catching an October sunset,
for example, or a pleasing alignment of columns when seen from a
particular perspective that had not been depicted in the
architectural renderings. Now architects can anticipate all of that
at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no surprises, which is too bad,'' Schliemann said.
``I yearn for surprises.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to design a sphere with millions of
perforations, each row different from the next. But how do you
inscribe this complex filigree on the metal panels themselves,
especially when the factory is across the continent?
</P>
<P>
   By e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Because the architects at the Polshek Partnership in New York
used a CAD (computer-aided design) program for the new Rose Center
at the American Museum of Natural History, they were able to send
their drawings electronically to the fabricator, Ceilings Plus of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At the factory, Polshek's files were converted to a program
based on Autocad software, which could be read by the machinery
that punches out the tiny holes in the aluminum panels, each
one-sixteenth of an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   The 87-foot sphere, which is to be enclosed in a glass cube,
will be covered by 2,474 panels. The perforations will absorb sound
around the sphere. (Just think of busloads of schoolchildren _
there will be plenty of sound to absorb.) Gary Kawamura of Ceilings
Plus calculated that the design had yielded 5,599,663 perforations.
</P>
<P>
   A computer plotted out the many arrays of perforations that were
needed to insure that the rows lined up evenly on the panels'
irregular surface without creating distracting patterns or
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, this would have been almost impossible,''
said Albert Kiechle of Ceilings Plus, which was founded in 1932.
The advent of CAD has expanded its business far beyond ceilings and
far beyond Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architects are e-mailing their Autocad files from Singapore or
China,'' said Nancy Mercolino, the president of Ceilings Plus.
``You can punch out these graphic designs and shapes. It doesn't
matter how they're laid out. What you can draw in Autocad now can
be manufactured at extraordinary rates.'' &QL;

NO, WRIGHT`S MASTERPIECE FALLINGWATER WON'T FALL IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (js) 
 By FRED BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAR RUN, Pa. _ Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd Wright's 1936
masterpiece, has a little less far to fall. One corner of the
house, slung over a waterfall here, is more than seven inches lower
than it should be, the result of structural problems that
threatened to bring the building crashing into the rocks below.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when the house opened in early March for its annual
season of public tours, visitors were treated to the remnant of
exploratory surgery: a bathtub-size hole in the middle of the
living room floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened up the floor to look for cracks, and we found
them,'' said Lynda Waggoner, director of Fallingwater, which was
voted the country's most significant building by the American
Institute of Architects in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day, architecture students, looking like visitors to
an archeological dig, crouched around the hole and examined the
concrete beams beneath the flagstone floor and redwood subfloor.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking was the house's exterior, which rests on a
series of steel columns and beams unknown to Wright. The supports
were installed in 1997 to stabilize the building until permanent
reinforcements could be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   From across the stream, the propped-up Fallingwater, which is
owned by the nonprofit Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, looks like
a champion gymnast on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Robert Silman, the engineer who installed the girders,
put it, ``The main cantilever isn't a cantilever anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the building collapsed, it might have cracked the stone
ledge beneath it (perhaps inspiring the headline ``House Crushes
Boulder,'' the architectural equivalent of ``Man Bites Dog''). That
would have been an ironic end to a house renowned for its symbiotic
relationship with nature.
</P>
<P>
   The droop in the southwest corner of the main cantilever is
visible from across the stream. On the house's terrace, the
2-degree tilt increases the vertiginous feeling created by Wright's
unusually low parapet walls, comparable to the low walls at the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan. ``Seven inches is a
lot,'' Silman said of the terrace's sag.
</P>
<P>
   Silman, whose firm is based in Manhattan, decided to install the
girders after discussing the problem with Fallingwater's trustees.
``I told them, `We'll have to shore it up eventually,' '' he said.
`` `Why not now, so your consciences are clear?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about Fallingwater's fate is that it
could have been prevented. The problem, as Silman and others who
have looked at the structure say, isn't age but Wright's failure to
put enough steel reinforcing rods into the concrete _ despite
strong admonitions to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's reasons for under-reinforcing the structure aren't
clear, but appear to be related to his lifelong aversion to being
told what to do. Indeed, when Fallingwater's contractor suggested
increasing the steel in the building to make it safer, Wright
threatened to quit the project.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote Edgar Kaufmann Jr., the Pittsburgh department store
magnate who commissioned Fallingwater, ``I have put so much more
into this house than you or any other client has a right to expect
that if I haven't your confidence _ to hell with the whole thing.''
(To those not familiar with Wright's letters, this was mild
language for the architect, then nearly 70.)
</P>
<P>
   Wright also maintained _ wrongly _ that the weight of additional
steel would weaken the structure. Nonetheless, when Wright was away
from the site, the contractor installed twice as much steel
reinforcing as the architect had asked for.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not done so, Ms. Waggoner said, ``the building probably
would not be standing today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he didn't add enough steel to solve the problem. All
reinforced concrete bends; there is an initial droop, often
pronounced, on the day it is poured, and a slower bending (called
creep by engineers) which occurs mainly in the building's first
year, Silman said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the house never stopped bending. ``If it was still
moving after 60 years, the inevitable conclusion is that it would
eventually move far enough to fall into the river,'' Silman said.
(The bending of Fallingwater's concrete trays is distinct from
settling, a far more mundane problem.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, Kaufmann _ said to be worried about the cantilevers
until he died in 1955 _ kept tabs on the problem, by having
detailed measurements made every year.
</P>
<P>
   But after the family donated the house to the conservancy, which
opened it to the public in 1964, measuring was discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Ms. Waggoner decided it was time to take another
look at the cantilevers. That's when the extent of the problem
became clear. These days, movement detectors, wired to key parts of
the structure, send data to a laptop computer hidden under a
bathroom sink. Each week, the data is sent by modem to Silman.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was known for creating buildings with irritating faults _
his flat roofs often leaked _ and many are deteriorating with age.
Silman's firm has helped save several Wright buildings, including
the architect's Wisconsin studio, Taliesen, which was severely
damaged after a 200-year-old oak fell through its roof last year.
</P>
<P>
   Silman's solution to the Fallingwater problem is
straightforward: he plans to drill holes through the concrete
structure, then insert steel cables through the holes. The cables
will be slowly tightened, increasing the tension in the concrete.
(The process is called post-tensioning.)
</P>
<P>
   The plan, however, won't be made final until architects and
designers have a chance to weigh in during a public forum on April
10, at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. ``This is an icon,
and I want to do it right,'' Silman said. ``I want there to be a
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waggoner, whose office looks down on the building from a
Wright-designed guesthouse, said Fallingwater ``represents all the
aspirations of the 20th century,'' adding: ``These problems don't
diminish the importance of what this building did for
architecture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   She is charged with raising as much as $6 million for
Fallingwater projects (including unsexy jobs like bringing the
drinking water into federal compliance). Silman's post-tensioning
will cost about $1 million and is expected to be finished by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waggoner grew up nearby, led tours at Fallingwater while in
high school, then returned as a curator in 1985. On a tour of the
house, she willingly points out trouble signs, like a door that
doesn't open all the way because its frame has tilted slightly. She
called attention to a ceiling fixture through which water drips
during rainstorms. ``Look at that,'' she said. ``That's not a place
you want to see a leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the house _ thanks to Ms. Waggoner's vigorous efforts
_ hasn't looked better in years. The structural problems don't
diminish Wright's architectural pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater's guides have one concern: that some of the 130,000
visitors a year will drop cameras, keys and contact lenses into the
hole in the living room floor. That's one reason Ms. Waggoner is
considering covering the opening with glass.
</P>
<P>
   The planned restoration of Fallingwater has already fascinated
tourists. Neil Diller, manager of a poultry operation in Fort
Recovery, Ohio, and a first-time visitor to the house, said: ``It's
surprising that as good an architect as Wright screwed up. Sixty
years is a long time, but not that long.''
</P>
<P>
   The temporary supports, the hole in the living room floor and
the candor of the guides about the problems at Fallingwater make
this an unusually good time for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which is about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, will
be open every day except Monday, beginning Saturday. Tours start at
10 a.m.

Museum in Pittsburgh will open an exhibition on the collaboration

   Truism No. 1: Divas make pronouncements. Truism No. 2: A diva
hankering to conquer a new continent makes grander pronouncements
than most.
</P>
<P>
   Lionized in Britain but largely unknown here, Kelly Hoppen has
seen the future, and it is beige, accented with sorbet-sweet shots
of aubergine, blackberry and lilac. The future is also sculptured
with concealed, expensively calibrated light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always trying to convince people to spend money on
lighting and buy a sofa later,'' said Ms. Hoppen, 39, whose
recently remodeled home in London has a glass-walled bathroom.
``Rooms only come alive with light, which is something that a lot
of interior designers aren't especially good at. They're just
interested in the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   A designer who is to English residential design what John Pawson
is to the country's architecture scene, Ms. Hoppen creates
interiors that are sleek, minimalist, obsessively finished and
deceptively simple. But unlike the work of the cerebral Pawson,
known here for the Calvin Klein store on Madison Avenue, Ms.
Hoppen's rooms are a bit more populist, warmed by allusions to
Asian culture and humanizing textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an ethnic look at all, but she gives Oriental design
a crisp contemporary look,'' said Martin Waller, the managing
director of Andrew Martin, a hip British textile company that gave
her its first designer of the year award, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Hoppen's hallmarks is the use of fabric runners,
inspired by obi sashes, flung over tabletops and bed canopies and
deployed as impromptu slipcovers. ``It's easier to throw a runner
over a chair than it is to re-upholster,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Monochromes may dominate Ms. Hoppen's vision of the new
millennium, but the designer is not unaware of their inherent
dullness. Or how to combat it. ``Texture is the new color,'' she
said, with all the gravity of Martha Stewart saying, ``It's a good
thing.'' Which explains why the living room of the Kensington
apartment she shares with her American-born husband, Ed Miller, is
dressed in five types of linen, all shades of beige. And why the
low modernist sofa combines linen upholstery with button-bedecked
cashmere cushions the color of a pencil lead.
</P>
<P>
   The curtains framing the bay windows are linen, too, full-length
and unlined. Says Ms. Hoppen: ``Everything should be sheer, simple,
elegant. Curtains should blow around.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison between America's diva of homemaking and her
potential English doppelganger is not strained. ``Newspapers and
magazines in England are always calling me the diva of design,''
said Ms. Hoppen, who was born in South Africa. A romantic cataract
of red pre-Raphaelite curls is paired with the determined air of a
self-described ``triple A'' personality. She has already laid a
Martha-like foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoppen's first book, the Asian-themed ``East Meets West''
(Rizzoli), was published in America last year. This year, Rizzoli
plans to release her book on texture in design, which will be
followed, the designer intends, by a line of paint with carpeting
to match, furniture and rugs.
</P>
<P>
   A popular line of Kelly Hoppen home accessories, priced under
$60, is already on the shelves of Debenhams, an English chain. Ms.
Hoppen compares her work for it to Ms. Stewart's association with
Kmart. A boutique hotel that she designed as ``a hideaway for
plastic surgery patients'' is due to open this year in London, and
she has created a taupe-and-black car interior for Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to open shops internationally,'' she said. ``England
first, then the United States, Japan, Germany and France.'' She
paused, blinded not by the glory of her global vision but by the
sheer logic of it. ``What's the point of having ideas if you can't
make them happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Take Ms. Hoppen's apartment, for example, where she and Miller,
``an investment banker, of sorts,'' have lived since 1988. (Each
has been previously married, and they have five children between
them, ages 16 to 31.) Occupying a floor of a Victorian building, it
had been a U-shaped arrangement of four small, dingy apartments. In
just three months, the 2,500-square-foot space was gutted,
remodeled and decorated.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to imagine the reason behind the builders'
speed. ``Every single item is ordered and on site before the work
starts,'' she said. ``There is no margin for excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoppen's domestic minimalism starts at the front door, which
opens to a limestone-floored entrance hall that broadcasts a
Stanley Kubrick air, at once sinister, sexy and space age. Seven
taupe-lacquered doors stand closed, reflecting an unearthly tide of
light streaming from glassed-in niches in the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity is key to the Hoppen program. The glass-and-brass
chandelier in the dining room was found in a junk shop and revived
with Porsche car paint. Walls throughout the apartment are
punctuated with support-free shelves that give them the appearance
of floating (under-shelf strip lighting underscores this effect).
In the master bath, Ms. Hoppen removed the legs of a cast-iron tub
and set it up on limed oak blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom, curtains are lingerie satin, and the same
shimmering fabric edges the mohair bedspread. Pale pink artificial
pigskin upholsters the headboard, and some of the cushions are
encased in cashmere, others in basket-weave wicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men say it's very hard core; others call it virginal,''
Ms. Hoppen said, in a tone that implied greater satisfaction with
the former.
</P>
<P>
   What visitors say about the entrance hall doorstops, however,
remains a secret: Ms. Hoppen employs wooden Indian phallic symbols
to hold the lacquered doors open. Martha Stewart, meet Margaret
Mead.

CHICKEN SALAD TO CROW ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon Plankey requested the recipe for the chicken salad served
at the lately departed Bagel Chain restaurant on Hulen Street in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   I love that chicken salad, I have dreams about that chicken
salad, I have devoted prose to that chicken salad. And now it's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Here's the history. Thirteen years ago, when Marc
Lopin began his Bagel Chain chain, he used his sister Leslie's
recipes for tuna and chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Leslie happens to be married to Yogi Florsheim, who owns
Yogi's Deli farther along Hulen Street. And Yogi's Deli also serves
the chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the chicken salad is still available, Leslie and
Yogi were kind enough to give us the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   YOGI'S CHICKEN SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12-16
</P>
<P>
   12 chicken breast halves (including skin and bones)
</P>
<P>
   1 onion
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch celery
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches scallions, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons garlic salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons onion salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups light mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Place chicken breasts in stock pot or pots. Chop the onion and
add to the chicken. Halve the celery and roughly chop (one-half
only) and add to the pot or pots. Season with salt and pepper,
cover with water and bring to a boil. After the water has reached a
boil, lower to medium and simmer for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, slice the scallions (including about 2 inches of the
green part). Finely dice the remaining celery to be about the same
thickness as the scallions.
</P>
<P>
   When the chicken is cooked, remove the pot from the stove and
strain off the liquid. (This stock can be saved and used for
chicken soup or to add to other recipes.) When chicken is cool
enough to handle, remove skin and bones. Chop or shred the chicken,
making sure not to chop or shred too finely. You want texture.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the chicken with remaining ingredients. (You'll be
tempted to add more mayonnaise, but don't. This is plenty, and one
of the things that distinguishes this chicken salad from others.)
Refrigerate until serving. For maximum effect, serve the salad on
Yogi's salt bagels.

   On the sweet side: Stephanie Sterie writes, looking for a good
recipe for baklava. Here's one we've run before, a recipe that came
via my mother-in-law from Doris Scott of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   This makes a lovely dessert with a cup of strong tea. And this
is the proper way to make it _ not the lazy man's way often served
in restaurants. Often, the nut mixture is lumped together in one
layer instead of being dispersed throughout the layers.
</P>
<P>
   DORIS SCOTT'S BAKLAVA
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 50 pieces
</P>
<P>
   18 sheets phyllo dough (1-pound box)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds ground nuts (pistachios, pecans, walnuts or a mix
of any or all), fairly powdery (food processor does this well)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, mixed with the ground nuts
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Grease 16-by-11-inch pan. Using 6 sheets of phyllo, place 1 at a
time in pan, brushing butter on each before topping with the next
layer of phyllo. Sprinkle cinnamon/nut mixture on top of the 6
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Layer 3 more sheets, spreading each with butter. Then add more
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with 3 more sheets. Top with 6 buttered sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Cut into cross-hatch diagonal strips to form diamond-shaped
pieces before baking.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until fairly golden. Cool for several
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Syrup:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/4 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Boil syrup until medium consistency. This takes 15 to 20
minutes, and the syrup will still be fairly runny. Pour over cooled
baklava. Let cool before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Tips on handling phyllo: If frozen, dough should be defrosted in
refrigerator. Don't let phyllo get to room temperature, or it will
be too dry to work with. While working, keep dough to be used under
a damp (not soaked) kitchen towel.

OLD AD SIGNS REAPPEAR, YOUNGER ONES VANISH AMID N.Y. CONSTRUCTION

 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can't miss it. At the corner of Greene and West
Houston Streets, a new billboard for G-Shock watches partially
obscures an early 20th-century sign for the United thread company.
A giant wristwatch, splayed across both advertising panels, appears
to be attached to the building by trompe l'oeil nails. But is the
old sign really old? Or is it new, too?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions crop up often these days, as New York's
construction boom alternately exposes and covers old signs:
advertisements for carriage rentals and patent medicines painted on
brick walls previously hidden by buildings. They appear suddenly,
flashes of the past, when a building is razed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, pedestrians were astonished by a sign that appeared
in the Times Square area at Broadway and 47th Street. Through the
dust of a demolished building, it emerged on the side of the Roxy
delicatessen: J.A. KEAL'S CARRIAGE MANUFACTORY. REPAIRING.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are noticing them more and more,'' said Linda Cooper
Bowen, who wrote an article on the signs in the current issue of
Print magazine. Last year, the New-York Historical Society had a
show of signs photographed by Frank Jump. Ms. Bowen's article
accompanies photos by her husband, Sava Mitrovich, who is preparing
a book, to be called ``The Wall Dog's Art.'' (The itinerant
painters of the signs were called wall dogs.)
</P>
<P>
   Sam Quinones, who painted the G-Shock sign, did not mind
obscuring part of the work of his predecessor. ``There's very
little sentimentality in this business,'' Quinones said. He has
painted over his own work many times, in the same space.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question of saving most of the signs; no landmark
laws apply. ``You can't tell a building owner to save them,'' Ms.
Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   But some forces in the urban economy actually work to preserve
the signs. Buildings erected next to them provide protection from
weathering, producing the eerily fresh look of the 1877 Keal sign.
And since the old paint is lead-based, building owners are
reluctant to sandblast them off.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, I followed Mitrovich and Ms. Bowen as they
went to photograph another sign. Mitrovich is a city building
inspector who, through his work, discovers signs that can't be seen
from the street.
</P>
<P>
   From a balcony on West 94th Street, he had caught sight of a
sign on the old Hotel Paris to the north, boasting, in red-orange
hues, of the hotel's solarium and cafe. (Many signs that are
invisible from the street were meant to be seen from an elevated
track, Ms. Bowen observed.)
</P>
<P>
   As we left the building, Mitrovich made a confession that
astonished me. ``It's the photographs that are important to me,''
he said. ``I couldn't care less about the signs.''
</P>
<P>
   How we see them seems to depend on our perspective. Unlike her
husband, Ms. Bowen enjoys the faded quality of the signs
themselves. Graphic designers and other ``letterheads'' prize the
signs' block alphabets. For Jump, who is HIV positive, they are a
kind of memento mori. He calls them ``dead signs,'' since the
businesses they advertise are gone. For ad agencies, they are found
objects to be replicated or incorporated, as in the G-Shock sign.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a strange mingling of old and new. When I first
spied the Keal sign, in the wake of seeing the G-Shock ad and
retro-styled signs for Players tobacco and Old Navy, I didn't
believe it _ the paint was so fresh, the letters so realistically
antique. It looked so old I was sure it was brand-new.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger than how suddenly the signs appear is how fast
they disappear again. Last week, I noticed that the Keal sign was
about to vanish. The wooden frames for the concrete posts of the
Planet Hollywood Hotel are rising to obscure it. An X painted in
bilious green marks the spot for some construction attachment. The
workers I talked to shrugged off any suggestion that it was a shame
to cover the sign. They were as blase as the languid models in the
Banana Republic ads, looming and lounging at once above the old
sign. In days, it will be gone _ again.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fellini's Roma,'' a famous scene shows subway workers
burrowing into a subterranean chamber filled with ancient wall
paintings. They watch in astonishment as the paintings vanish on
contact with the air. Something similar happens when signs appear,
then disappear, in this far less eternal city.
</P>
<P>
   Some signs have already outlasted one or two generations of
neighboring buildings. In 50 years, given the pace of change in the
city, we may see the Keal sign again. But if we do, in the context
of Gotham future, it will look completely different.

ARCHIVES OF EROTICA: MUSEUM AIMS TO BE A SEX SMITHSONIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When was the last time you loved a building and it
loved you back?
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Museum of Sex, or Mosex, sweeps the floor of its
new home at 233 Fifth Ave. (27th Street), beneath the shadow of the
Empire State Building, in anticipation of renovations that will
deliver a new facade, 12,000 square feet of exhibition galleries
and offices, a shop and a cafe by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If the for-profit institution makes money _ no federal funding,
didn't even ask, thanks _ it will break ground in two years on a
35,000-square-foot, seven-story building for the same site designed
by Shop, a team of five young New York architects. They intend the
new museum, with its translucent, peep-show tease of a facade and
its sinuous, soft-focus interiors, to be a sensual as well as an
architectural experience.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the high-school field trips to the Greek pottery at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the dioramas in the Hall of Biology at
the American Museum of Natural History and Fragonard's French
swingers at the Frick Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Mosex _ at the other end of the block from Le Trapeze, a
towels-only nightclub _ is an adult museum, the first in the United
States to be devoted to ``sex and culture everywhere,'' said Alison
Maddex, 32, who is directing the project with Daniel Gluck, a
30-year-old investor. ``It's going to be the Smithsonian of sex,''
she said, adding that it would not exclusively present a history of
the sex industry nor would it be an excuse for exhibiting a
collection of curiosa.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Maddex said, Mosex will be ``pro-free speech and
anti-censorship, basically an R-rated museum, like an R-rated film.
People under 17 won't get in without adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosex will need 100,000 visitors annually, paying an admission
fee of $6.50, to break even, and 400,000 visitors each year, for
two years, to meet the budget for constructing the new building,
Gluck said. (The Guggenheim Soho drew 119,121 visitors last year.)
</P>
<P>
   At Shop's East 37th Street office, Ms. Maddex, wearing a black
Todd Oldham twin set and a short pleated-satin skirt, paced the
loft's blond wood floor, squeezing numbers into a cellular
telephone as though it were a muscle-toning device. She and Gluck
appear too busy pushing Mosex's big picture to be specific about
what and how it will do what it does when it does it.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's initial installation is to be a time line of ``Sex
in America,'' from the Puritans to cybersex, including items like
Colonial bundling chairs, which measured compatibility between
couples who were roped together, and electronic kiosks with touch
screens like ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The practical assumption is that fascination with Mosex's
subject will propel a kind of perpetual self-promotion while it
picks up the details, like names on napkins at a cocktail party.
Instead of a collection, there will be a study center and a
database to catalog the whereabouts of archives of erotica. There
will revolving curatorial participation from invited guests and
members of Ms. Maddex's board of advisers, or ``sex think tank,''
as she called it. It includes Camille Paglia, who is Ms. Maddex's
partner; Oldham; Robert Francoeur, a professor of biological
sciences at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and actress Sandra
Bernhard.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the design is an elegant sales tool. Lately, Ms. Maddex
and Gluck have been previewing the proposed building, a vertical
stack of glass and plastic facades. Transparent and translucent
panels, stretched like skin across steel frames, will undulate like
a torso in motion, seductively silhouetting the galleries for the
street and creating flirtatious shadows and light for visitors
inside.
</P>
<P>
   It was important to the architects that Mosex be open-looking,
as though it were actually open-minded _ as clear-sighted as glass,
which will be its principal material.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was critical, that it was understood as something that
wasn't behind a dark, dingy door, that there was no shame in
entering,'' said Greg Pasquarelli, a partner in Shop.
</P>
<P>
   The thin building is essentially a sandwich of planes; seen from
the side, the multiple facades look like flaky pastry. The glass
and plastic resin panels, cobbled to steel frames, form walls that
recede, like epidermal layers, from the street to the back of the
site, creating Mosex's interior galleries, halls and stairs as they
fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   The play of dim and bright, of suggestion and sight, between the
skins creates an architecture encounter that the designers hope
will mimic a sexual one _ part Salome's veils, part video pause, a
slow kaleidoscopic come-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That to us was what sexuality was about,'' Pasquarelli said.
``Sexuality is an ambiguous, fluid series of relationships. It
doesn't look like sexuality,'' he explained. ``It performs like
sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The building will is not be without its unexpected modesty, too.
Because of its softly cobbled glass surfaces, ``it will blush,''
said Chris Sharples, a partner in Shop, as the sun or a cloud
drifts drifts across it, or as lights go on for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off the Mosex model at Shop, Ms. Maddex nailed her
non-Platonic enthusiasm for the architecture on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely voyeuristic,'' she said. ``It's like when you
can see through the curtain into the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she and Gluck left the office quickly and leapt into a cab
on Third Avenue at 6 in the evening _ Ms. Maddex was extremely good
at getting to it first _ and headed crosstown.
</P>
<P>
   Mosex has been an idea in search of an institution since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a story about how we know each other,'' Gluck said in
the taxi. ``We both went to the University of Pennsylvania School
of Fine Arts. We dated the same . . .'' Ms. Maddex, applying
Ultra-brown lipstick, nodded her head firmly from left to right and
back again. ``OK,'' Gluck said and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Mosex has had its lawyers look carefully into Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's 1995 law requiring a 500-foot zone between adult
businesses and churches and schools. ``We're in a gray zone that's
OK for a sex shop, even though we're not one,'' Gluck said.
</P>
<P>
   Gluck's principal involvement has been putting together promises
for $1.3 million, the majority of which is now in hand from private
investors. While acknowledging that they might be walking a fine
line in conservative minds, Ms. Maddex explained that Mosex
expected no problems presenting R-rated content in its
neighborhood, with educational, not prurient, intent and without
federal or state funding. Presentations of live performance art,
about which she was not specific, might make the occasional museum
event triple-X.
</P>
<P>
   Mosex intends to be provocative, Ms. Maddex said, but has no
interest in baiting the powers that be.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Chait, a spokeswoman for the mayor's office, said the
city would shut down the museum if it made a wrong move.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex dropped Gluck off at the Mosex building, then headed
south. ``It's not going to be just a dry trip through history,
sexuality as in gender studies or this whole kind of
pseudo-analytical stuff, but real  &UR; sex &LR; . Human drive. We want it to
be very fun and alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the public ready?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madden, arriving at her destination, told the driver to pull
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold that thought,'' she said at the door, then jumped.

WHAT IS ART? THAT CAN MOSTLY DEPEND ON THE CONTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Context is what people use to make sense of new information. An
unfamiliar word can make sense in a sentence. An unfamiliar place
can have meaning on a map. An isolated event can be significant in
the context of history. Context turns information into knowledge.
It's the difference between a warehouse and a museum.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to art, there are many warehouses of digital
information: image libraries, CD-ROM encyclopedias that
cross-reference everything to everything else. There are cultural
institutions that use famous images to promote their Web sites, but
there are very few digital museums.
</P>
<P>
   Le Plus Beau Musee du Monde (The Most Beautiful Museum in the
World), a CD-ROM published by France Telecom Multimedia, is one of
the best. (It's available in French only; you can view a demo at
www.plusbeaumusee.com.)
</P>
<P>
   In it, there are spectacular works from the most famous art
troves in the world: the Louvre, the Prado, the Guggenheim, the
Museum of Modern Art _ three dozen cultural juggernauts from Taipei
to the Vatican. Le Plus Beau Musee houses the crown jewels of art
history, from the celebrity Old Masters to the marquee idols of
modernism. It's the Western canon's answer to the Hollywood Walk of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also works from China, Southeast Asia, Africa and
pre-Columbian Peru. American Indian art from the Pacific Northwest
and ritual objects from the ancient Near East are stored, cheek by
digital jowl, with medieval manuscripts and Renaissance frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this collection a museum, rather than a digital
warehouse, is the context into which it places these 150 works.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there is context for each work as a singular
experience. Every piece of art is displayed in high resolution
against a black background. Icons are illuminated by the cursor,
but are otherwise invisible. There are no buttons, no tabs, no
clutter, no distractions. It's a deceptively simple and supremely
elegant interface, with all the hallmarks of good tailoring. The
seams are perfect, and every pocket of information is beautifully
placed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these pockets contains a different perspective on the
object displayed _ a different context in which to view it. An
hourglass icon generates a time line.
</P>
<P>
   A globe puts the work on a map. Click on the ruler, and a
miniature version of the painting or sculpture appears next to
human figures to create a sense of human scale, which is so often
lost when people view reproductions of art.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of Dali's ``Persistence of Memory'' is
gigantic because they see it blown up to poster size. But the
painting itself is the size of a paperback. It's important to know
that an artwork is huge _ or tiny _ and Le Plus Beau Musee restores
that context, to great effect. It allows you to take a step back.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows you to step forward. Pass a magnifying lens over
an image, and you can see the texture of canvas or hairline cracks
in 12th-century paint. It's reminiscent of the scene in ``Blade
Runner'' where a photograph is digitally reproduced, systematically
magnified and dissected for its details.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone notices the customers at the front tables of Toulouse
Lautrec's ``Au Moulin Rouge,'' but what about the bald customer in
the back? What about reflections in glass? On a computer screen,
you can get closer to the surface of these paintings than you can
in life because no museum is going to let your nose touch the
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   There are ancient debates about whether it is really possible to
understand a work of art by viewing a representation of it. Those
debates, like theological questions, are not meant to be resolved.
But one certainty does emerge from this CD-ROM: If you're going to
view a reproduction, digital media beats dead trees hands down. And
it's not just because a computer close-up gives you more resolution
than a textbook photograph. It's not a question of resolution. It's
a question of context.
</P>
<P>
   Digital media create a much more intimate context for viewing
art, and the difference is disconcerting. The first time you
magnify the Venus de Milo to see how hair falls across the nape of
her neck, you feel as though you're leering. Because the ability to
stare so intently, for so long, whenever you feel like it implies
ownership, and the Venus de Milo clearly does not belong to you.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By subjecting the work to this kind of intense scrutiny and
manipulation, the digital image creates a sense of possession that
physical copies cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Power shifts to the viewer. You no longer have to move. The
image comes to (italics)you.(end italics) That's probably why Bill
Gates installed big flat screens in his dining room instead of
hanging paintings _ digital objects can be controlled in ways that
physical objects cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings have a physical integrity you must respect. Digital
images have no physical integrity, so anything goes. You can
superimpose them, alter them and shuffle them around. It's a power
trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a learning opportunity. In Le Plus Beau Musee du
Monde, digital imagery allows the designers to clarify aspects of
composition and illustrate principles of perspective. Animated
explanations lead the eye toward an understanding of how a painting
works (the great unanswered question of museumgoers who are told
that the painting is great, but never why).
</P>
<P>
   Having provided a context for understanding each work
individually, Le Plus Beau Musee also provides a context for
understanding them in relation to one another. On the main page,
there are eight tours through these works, each organized around a
central theme, like portraits or pictures that illustrate events.
</P>
<P>
   Within these virtual exhibitions, the meaning of each painting
has been slightly altered because it has been put in a particular
order for particular reasons. The art means more because it has
been chosen, because some defining sensibility has established
relationships among these objects.
</P>
<P>
   That's what curators do. In the brick and mortar world, this is
a rare and highly prestigious job. In Le Plus Beau Musee, it's an
open invitation to the viewer. Using the same stunning warehouse of
images, you can compose your own exhibit, complete with annotations
and digital wall text.
</P>
<P>
   The defining sensibility is that of the viewer, and the context
is personal. The most beautiful museum in the world is your own.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the imaginary museum you create in your mind from the
memories of paintings you have traveled to see, your virtual museum
can be readily shared. You can upload it to Le Plus Beau Musee's
Web site. You can also download other people's museums.
</P>
<P>
   What you're downloading is a tiny amount of information _ a text
file containing the annotations and the order of the paintings. But
it is highly potent information because it conjures meaning.
Wandering through someone else's virtual museum, you see the
objects through that person's eyes, and the art makes a different
sort of sense.
</P>
<P>
   You understand it from a different angle, and you also
understand how another mind works, through the prism of a painting.
And you understand how your own mind works, by measuring the
difference. In the context of human intelligence, the meaning of
the work multiplies. It makes a deeper kind of sense.
</P>
<P>
   It's a singular delight, one that is all too lacking on, say, an
Internet search engine, which offers no context at all. A Web
search looks like junk because it's arranged like junk _ piled up,
regardless of quality, in no particular order.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of information but very little meaning. That's why
people gravitate to virtual communities; human intelligence makes
sense of new information. It culls the gems and makes them sparkle.
It makes manmade images into priceless works of art.

<P>
   HICO, Texas _ Dairy farmer Klaas Talsma was a member of
Greenpeace _ until they threatened to sue him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Talsma embodies a growing conflict between farmers, who
depend on the land and water for their living, and groups who are
using every public and private means to protect the environment
from harm.
</P>
<P>
   It's a conflict that promises to heat up even more as the
federal government prepares to step up regulation of livestock
operations and widely used pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   For Talsma, it hit home eight years ago when two days of
unusually heavy rainfall caused his farm's waste-water lagoon to
overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way in the world we could have prevented it,'' he
said. It was the kind of flood that happens only four times a
century _ ``an act of God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talsma and other farmers received letters from a group of
environmental organizations warning of a possible lawsuit over the
pollution caused by the runoff. While the suit never materialized,
Talsma said blaming dairy farmers for a host of water quality
problems is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a scapegoat, and we're the guys,'' he said. But the
truth is that farmers care more about the environment than just
about anyone, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups say their efforts to curb animal waste
pollution do not target all farmers, but only the small percentage
who cause problems. In fact, said Robbin(cq) Marks of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, the issue of animal waste is one that
unites family farmers and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a really big difference between factory farms
and family farms,'' she said. ``The largest facilities are causing
major environmental problems'' such as fish kills, drinking water
contamination and toxic emissions into the air, she said, while
``the communities that are feeling the pollution effects are rural
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks said last year's vote in Colorado to impose rigorous
restrictions on runoff from hog farms was largely a result of a
combined effort between environmentalists and farm groups.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the farming community resent what they see as an
increasing effort to regulate agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think environmentalists are probably good people, (but) some
of them have gone a little overboard,'' said David Jackson, who has
been a dairy farmer in Waco, Texas, for 15 years. Jackson said his
operation is very environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more than $13,000 last year to build a lagoon to keep
ground water from running off, and he says state inspectors stop by
about every two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be good neighbors. We go to church here. Our kids go
to school here,'' he said. Not only that, he added, but the well
where his family gets drinking water is no more than 200 yards from
his waste water lagoon, so it wouldn't make sense to allow leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said farmers have been given a bad name by a small group
of big companies that have bought into agricultural businesses and
``tried to run them like they do their corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those large animal feeding operations have become a target of
environmental groups that are lobbying the Clinton administration
to place tough regulations on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore announced a plan to require
thousands of additional cattle feedlots, poultry farms and large
hog farms to get permits and develop nutrient management plans in
hopes of controlling pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said the plan didn't go far enough. Some
farm groups, who prefer local control, said it would penalize many
farmers who have never had problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the issue of pesticides promises to galvanize both
farmers and environmentalists this year. A decision on whether to
ban two classes of widely used pesticides _ organophosphates and
carbamates _ is expected in August as part of a U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency effort to review 9,600 pesticide registrations
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Newpher, executive director of the Washington office of the
American Farm Bureau Federation, said conflicts between farmers and
environmental groups are not about choosing sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone that's in favor of pollution,'' he said.
``But everybody has a different idea of how, whatever the remedy,
it ought to be employed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers say certain government environmental actions border
on the ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Talsma and other farmers have been circulating a Department of
Interior letter sent to a state agency in response to a permit
request from a North Texas cattle farmer. The letter recommended
that the farmer put giant nets across his waste-water lagoons so
that whooping cranes and bald eagles wouldn't get into them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is absurd, Talsma said, because the birds would likely
get caught in the net and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when people don't use their common
sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agreed the nets were a bad idea, adding that ducks come
into his lagoon and feed off some of the grain that washes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all look fat and happy to me,'' he said.

 &HT;    GORE BALANCES APPEAL TO FARMERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS
 &HT;    With ENVIRONMENT-FARMERS. Moving in (w) Washington and (a)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has been talking to farmers
a lot lately _ and offering them a whole bunch of cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Gore has announced millions of dollars
in federal support for agriculture in what many say is an effort to
improve his standing among farmers in preparation for his 2000
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in the farm community that have read his
book, 'Earth in the Balance,' and are very concerned,'' said Dick
Newpher, executive director of the Washington office of the
American Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants ``to make sure he's regarded for other things besides
his stand on the environment,'' Newpher said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gore announced the government would give $50 million
in direct payments to struggling pork producers and an additional
$80 million to buy diseased pigs to help ease the industry's
oversupply problem.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he announced a $15 million purchase of pork for
government food programs, and on a separate occasion said the
government would spend $20 million on beef to help cattle
producers.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January,
Gore pledged that the Clinton administration would demand major
reductions in the world's farm trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts to reach the agriculture community come at a time
when environmental groups and farmers are squaring off over the
possible banning of widely used pesticides and federal regulation
of animal waste disposal from livestock farms.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues have proven that balancing the two sides isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gore pushed for the creation of an advisory panel
that would include representatives from agriculture and
environmental groups in implementing new pesticide regulations. The
idea came after a warning from Reps. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, and
Marion Berry, D-Ark., that rumors about the loss of the pesticides
were causing an uproar in farming communities.
</P>
<P>
   One environmental group quit the panel, complaining that the
administration was bowing to industry pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said
in a resignation letter that ``over all, pesticide risks have only
gotten worse during the Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension will likely heat up as the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) moves toward an August deadline for deciding the
breadth of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Farm groups and environmental organizations have also expressed
disappointment _ for different reasons _ about a plan from the EPA
and the Agriculture Department to regulate animal waste from
livestock operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced the plan last Tuesday (March 9), saying that
``this comprehensive strategy forges a new partnership with
American agriculture to tackle a major threat to water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan will require thousands of additional facilities to get
permits and develop nutrient management plans in hopes of
controlling pollution from cattle feed lots, poultry farms and
large hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said the plan was a start, but that it
didn't go far enough. They also objected to its timetable, with
most of the more stringent requirements not taking effect until
2002 and in some cases several years after that.
</P>
<P>
   Some farm groups said the plan penalizes many farmers who have
never had any problems, forcing them to deal with more regulations
and burdensome paperwork. Newpher said Gore's quest for the White
House could be hurt if he pushes for more federal regulation of
animal feeding operations and if he supports allowing individuals
to sue states and farmers if they don't comply with new rules. It's
an important issue in many key states including Texas, California
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make a difficult time for him politically,''
Newpher said.

<P>
   Users of the latest car stereo may opt to bring it inside every
night, but not just to prevent theft. Rather, they may want to hook
the stereo to their PC to load it with music.
</P>
<P>
   The Empeg stereo, which is scheduled to start shipping later
this month, is billed as the first MP3 stereo designed for use in a
car. MP3 is a format that allows songs to be downloaded from the
Internet and stored and played in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the relatively limited capacity of compact disk
players or changers, the Empeg player could test the musical
endurance of the most determined road tripper. The 2-gigabyte
model, which will sell for $999, can store and play up to 35 hours
of music, and the 6-gigabyte model, which will sell for $1,399, can
play up to 100 hours. That compares with the more modest 32
megabytes of memory (about 60 minutes worth) found on the popular
Rio PMP300 personal music player.
</P>
<P>
   To load the stereo with music, users pull it from the car, plug
it into the PC and load it with songs downloaded from the Internet
or converted from CDs. The stereo also comes with an FM receiver,
but it does not get the AM frequency; the reason is that the
on-board computer interferes with AM reception, said Rob Voisey,
customer service manager for the stereo's maker, Empeg Ltd., based
in Wells, England.
</P>
<P>
   Voisey said the stereo would appeal to high-end audiophiles who
appreciate its versatility _ that it stores so much music, can be
programmed to play the songs in any order and can also be hooked
into home stereo and PC speakers.
</P>
<P>
   PCs Take Brunt of Workplace Anger
</P>
<P>
   If you have hard feelings toward your hard drive, malicious
thoughts about your monitor and consider drop-kicking your
keyboard, take heart: You are not alone. A new survey suggests that
computers are eliciting rage in the workplace, or at least taking
the brunt of it.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, performed by Concord Communications, a network
consulting firm in Marlboro, Mass., found that 83 percent of
corporate network administrators reported ``abusive and violent
behavior'' by employees toward their computers. The administrators
said employees smashed monitors, threw mice, kicked hard drives and
shattered screens.
</P>
<P>
   But the computers themselves are not, as it turns out, the true
target of the anger, according Dr. Wilfred Calmas, a Boston
psychologist hired to interpret the survey results for Concord
Communications. Instead, Calmas said, employees are merely taking
out the frustration they feel toward their bosses and work in
general on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just displacing those feelings toward an inanimate
object,'' Calmas said. ``It's a loss of control over feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Should we really let computers off the hook so easily? Maybe if
Calmas spent hours trying to download a file from the Internet
unsuccessfully or lost a document he worked on all day, he might
displace a few out-of-control feelings on the keyboard too.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the Tables
</P>
<P>
   The Web site Filtering Facts (www.filteringfacts.org) advocates
use of software filters in libraries to protect children from
``objectionable'' material. One catch: Last week, the site was
itself temporarily blocked by Surfwatch, one of the leading
filtering programs and one that is recommended by Filtering Facts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of filtering, who, among other things, contend that
the automated software sometimes inadvertently blocks innocuous
content, jumped on the Surfwatch error. Surfwatch, which produces
daily filtering updates that its customers can download, promptly
unblocked Filtering Facts. Teresa Marcroft, Surfwatch's director of
marketing, said the Web site had been blocked by mistake because it
shared a commercial server with a pornography site.
</P>
<P>
   David Burt, the creator and keeper of the Filtering Facts,
dismissed the incident. ``Those mistakes do sometimes happen,'' he
said. ``The fact it was unblocked so quickly shows how responsive
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3 Is Offered to Literary Set
</P>
<P>
   The use of the controversial MP3 format to download audio files
from the Internet has taken on a literary twist.
</P>
<P>
   Selections from James Bond novels, Emily Dickinson poetry and
daily selections from The New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal are among the works available for download in MP3 format
from a company called Audible Inc. (www.audible.com). Many of the
offerings are free, the first time that copyrighted books not
already in the public domain are legally available for download in
MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the MP3 format is controversial is that the format is
not encrypted, so files can be readily downloaded and traded by Web
users. Music companies, in particular, have expressed distress that
Web users will simply download music for free rather than pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the case of Audible.com, the company's founder,
Donald Katz, said the idea was not to promote free and illegal
distribution of copyrighted content, but just the opposite. Katz
said the company hoped to entice people to use books on MP3 format
so they would be willing to buy audio files when an encryption
standard is eventually set.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Katz said his company had the full backing of the book
and magazine publishers to give the content away. ``They really
want to promote the spoken-word category,'' he said.

   Geeks Heave a Sigh of Relief
</P>
<P>
   When the venerable Byte magazine bit the dirt in July last year,
it created a void for the kind of computer users who are happiest
when they are up to their pocket protectors in circuit boards and
cables. For more than 20 years, spanning the PC industry's
transformation from an esoteric hobby to an unavoidable part of
everyday life, Byte was the guide for those who are known
affectionately as computer geeks.
</P>
<P>
   Months after the magazine folded because of lack of advertising,
its dormant World Wide Web site was still getting hundreds of
thousands of clicks a month from bereft bit-heads.

   _ PETER H. LEWIS
</P>
<P>
   From Video to the Big Screen
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ``Wing Commander'' opens in theaters around the
country. If the title sounds familiar, that is because ``Wing
Commander'' came to life as a science-fiction video game. In making
the jump to the big screen, it is going where few video games have
gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Several video games, including Super Mario Brothers and Mortal
Kombat, have spawned movies, but ``Wing Commander'' includes a new
twist. It marks the first time that a video game creator has also
directed the movie based on the game _ and it hints at a further
convergence of animated games and video.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Roberts, who created Wing Commander in 1990 and just put
the finishing touches on the film, used extensive film footage in
the making of his games. Roberts said he expected more video games
to make the leap to the theater, particularly because movie
executives like the idea of funding a movie whose story already had
a fan base.

   WASHINGTON _ They have maps, cartoons, news articles, search
engines and more links than a chain fence. With elaborate Internet
sites, environmental groups have gained a public relations
advantage over the better-funded farm industry.
</P>
<P>
   Basic information about harmful pesticides and about water
pollution from livestock, poultry and dairy farming are available
on the Web sites of groups such as the Sierra Club and the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmentalists are using the diverse powers of the
Internet to grab attention in other ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Users can click on a U.S. map and get specific information
about animal waste problems in their state and county.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can e-mail pre-written letters to the Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture urging
tougher regulations.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can listen to recorded ``citizen's stories'' about the
horrors of living near a large livestock farm.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can link to reports tying animal waste to the toxin
Pfiesteria, which has killed thousands of fish on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the North Carolina Environmental Defense Fund's ``poop
counter,'' they can even get an up-to-the-second estimate of how
much manure has been produced by North Carolina's 10 million hogs.
</P>
<P>
   Senior attorney Daniel Whittle said the Web page lets the North
Carolina group counter the millions of dollars spent by hog farmers
on lobbying and in advertising against candidates who favor more
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental groups just cannot match the resources the
industry has,'' he said, ``so we saw the Web as an ideal tool to
get people informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are heavily linked on the Internet.
National groups have links to each other and to state groups which
have links to local grassroots organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In response to increasing attacks from environmental groups, the
National Pork Producers Council has devoted space on its Web site
to proving that pork farmers and producers are good stewards of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody is contending that something is true and it
isn't ... we try to correct it in any way we can _ that's one
way,'' said Steven Cohen, spokesman for the 85,000-member group.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes detailed answers to charges from environmental
groups, followed by extensive citations of research studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some other livestock groups, however, have not been so quick to
use the Internet for such serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Web pages for the National Broiler Council, which represents
most of the nation's chicken farmers and producers, carries lighter
fare. It teaches how to reinvent classic chicken recipes, how to
handle poultry safely, and how Vitamin B in chicken is good for the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The pages for the National Turkey Federation, which represents
about 95 percent of the nation's turkey farmers and producers, are
similar. The main page features a ``Chef of the Month'' and leads
to 12 links about ``Cooking with Turkey'' and 15 on ``Culinary
Trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farm associations, such as the Texas Farm Bureau, have
``legislative updates'' on their sites, along with information on
crop insurance and market trends. But most state farm bureau sites,
which are rarely linked to each other, are dedicated to member
services and education programs.

<P>
   HICO, Texas _ Dairy farmer Klaas Talsma was a member of
Greenpeace _ until they threatened to sue him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Talsma embodies a growing conflict between farmers, who
depend on the land and water for their living, and groups who are
using every public and private means to protect the environment
from harm.
</P>
<P>
   It's a conflict that promises to heat up even more as the
federal government prepares to step up regulation of livestock
operations and widely used pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   For Talsma, it hit home eight years ago when two days of
unusually heavy rainfall caused his farm's waste-water lagoon to
overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way in the world we could have prevented it,'' he
said. It was the kind of flood that happens only four times a
century _ ``an act of God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Talsma and other farmers received letters from a group of
environmental organizations warning of a possible lawsuit over the
pollution caused by the runoff. While the suit never materialized,
Talsma said blaming dairy farmers for a host of water quality
problems is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a scapegoat, and we're the guys,'' he said. But the
truth is that farmers care more about the environment than just
about anyone, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups say their efforts to curb animal waste
pollution do not target all farmers, but only the small percentage
who cause problems. In fact, said Robbin(cq) Marks of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, the issue of animal waste is one that
unites family farmers and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a really big difference between factory farms
and family farms,'' she said. ``The largest facilities are causing
major environmental problems'' such as fish kills, drinking water
contamination and toxic emissions into the air, she said, while
``the communities that are feeling the pollution effects are rural
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks said last year's vote in Colorado to impose rigorous
restrictions on runoff from hog farms was largely a result of a
combined effort between environmentalists and farm groups.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the farming community resent what they see as an
increasing effort to regulate agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think environmentalists are probably good people, (but) some
of them have gone a little overboard,'' said David Jackson, who has
been a dairy farmer in Waco, Texas, for 15 years. Jackson said his
operation is very environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more than $13,000 last year to build a lagoon to keep
ground water from running off, and he says state inspectors stop by
about every two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be good neighbors. We go to church here. Our kids go
to school here,'' he said. Not only that, he added, but the well
where his family gets drinking water is no more than 200 yards from
his waste water lagoon, so it wouldn't make sense to allow leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said farmers have been given a bad name by a small group
of big companies that have bought into agricultural businesses and
``tried to run them like they do their corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those large animal feeding operations have become a target of
environmental groups that are lobbying the Clinton administration
to place tough regulations on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore announced a plan to require
thousands of additional cattle feedlots, poultry farms and large
hog farms to get permits and develop nutrient management plans in
hopes of controlling pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said the plan didn't go far enough. Some
farm groups, who prefer local control, said it would penalize many
farmers who have never had problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the issue of pesticides promises to galvanize both
farmers and environmentalists this year. A decision on whether to
ban two classes of widely used pesticides _ organophosphates and
carbamates _ is expected in August as part of a U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency effort to review 9,600 pesticide registrations
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Newpher, executive director of the Washington office of the
American Farm Bureau Federation, said conflicts between farmers and
environmental groups are not about choosing sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone that's in favor of pollution,'' he said.
``But everybody has a different idea of how, whatever the remedy,
it ought to be employed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers say certain government environmental actions border
on the ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Talsma and other farmers have been circulating a Department of
Interior letter sent to a state agency in response to a permit
request from a North Texas cattle farmer. The letter recommended
that the farmer put giant nets across his waste-water lagoons so
that whooping cranes and bald eagles wouldn't get into them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is absurd, Talsma said, because the birds would likely
get caught in the net and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when people don't use their common
sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agreed the nets were a bad idea, adding that ducks come
into his lagoon and feed off some of the grain that washes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all look fat and happy to me,'' he said.

 &HT;    GORE BALANCES APPEAL TO FARMERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS
 &HT;    With ENVIRONMENT-FARMERS. Moving in (w) Washington and (a)
national categories for release Sunday, March 14.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has been talking to farmers
a lot lately _ and offering them a whole bunch of cash.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, Gore has announced millions of dollars
in federal support for agriculture in what many say is an effort to
improve his standing among farmers in preparation for his 2000
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in the farm community that have read his
book, 'Earth in the Balance,' and are very concerned,'' said Dick
Newpher, executive director of the Washington office of the
American Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants ``to make sure he's regarded for other things besides
his stand on the environment,'' Newpher said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gore announced the government would give $50 million
in direct payments to struggling pork producers and an additional
$80 million to buy diseased pigs to help ease the industry's
oversupply problem.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he announced a $15 million purchase of pork for
government food programs, and on a separate occasion said the
government would spend $20 million on beef to help cattle
producers.
</P>
<P>
   At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January,
Gore pledged that the Clinton administration would demand major
reductions in the world's farm trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts to reach the agriculture community come at a time
when environmental groups and farmers are squaring off over the
possible banning of widely used pesticides and federal regulation
of animal waste disposal from livestock farms.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues have proven that balancing the two sides isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gore pushed for the creation of an advisory panel
that would include representatives from agriculture and
environmental groups in implementing new pesticide regulations. The
idea came after a warning from Reps. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, and
Marion Berry, D-Ark., that rumors about the loss of the pesticides
were causing an uproar in farming communities.
</P>
<P>
   One environmental group quit the panel, complaining that the
administration was bowing to industry pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said
in a resignation letter that ``over all, pesticide risks have only
gotten worse during the Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension will likely heat up as the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) moves toward an August deadline for deciding the
breadth of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Farm groups and environmental organizations have also expressed
disappointment _ for different reasons _ about a plan from the EPA
and the Agriculture Department to regulate animal waste from
livestock operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced the plan last Tuesday (March 9), saying that
``this comprehensive strategy forges a new partnership with
American agriculture to tackle a major threat to water quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan will require thousands of additional facilities to get
permits and develop nutrient management plans in hopes of
controlling pollution from cattle feed lots, poultry farms and
large hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said the plan was a start, but that it
didn't go far enough. They also objected to its timetable, with
most of the more stringent requirements not taking effect until
2002 and in some cases several years after that.
</P>
<P>
   Some farm groups said the plan penalizes many farmers who have
never had any problems, forcing them to deal with more regulations
and burdensome paperwork. Newpher said Gore's quest for the White
House could be hurt if he pushes for more federal regulation of
animal feeding operations and if he supports allowing individuals
to sue states and farmers if they don't comply with new rules. It's
an important issue in many key states including Texas, California
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make a difficult time for him politically,''
Newpher said.

 AT THE BILTMORE ESTATE, KEEPING TRACK OF A RAILROAD BARON'S 23,000
BOOKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the 23,000 books in George Washington Vanderbilt's
collection at the 250-room mansion he built in Asheville, N.C., are
marked with a bookplate he designed featuring an oil lamp and the
Latin inscription ``Quaero Ex Libris Biltmore'': Inquire in the
books of Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five years after his death, that is exactly what is being
done _ with remarkable results _ at the Biltmore Estate, the
stunning French chateau that remains the largest private residence
in the United States with 34 bedrooms, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces
and three kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   George Vanderbilt, the youngest child of Cornelius Vanderbilt's
oldest son, William Henry Vanderbilt, did not just build one of the
country's most opulent residences, he also built an astounding
collection of books. Much of it is housed in the estate's
53-foot-wide, 72-foot-long, 27-foot-high walnut-paneled library,
which remains almost exactly as it was when he died suddenly in
March 1914 at 52 after an emergency appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, the collection is being professionally
cataloged and sorted out by a curator after decades of largely
being left alone. What is emerging is a glimpse of a collection
with strengths in art and English literature, one that is
significant both for its rare books and for its portrait of one
remarkable man's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's remarkable is that this library has remained virtually
unknown,'' said Jerry Patterson, author of ``The Vanderbilts,''
(Abrams, 1989) and former head of the rare books department for the
auction house Sotheby's. ``It's a very significant collection, but
I've never heard a single person in the rare-book trade mention the
library. Even the ones who've been to Biltmore talked about the
fabulous antiques and tapestries, but didn't seem to know anything
about the library. It's a 125-year-old private library that until
now has remained virtually inaccessible and unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most interesting to me is that it's a creation of a
single mind,'' Patterson said. ``It's one man's reading library,
which gives it personality and eccentricity, and to find a
collection of this size still intact for this period of time is
very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vanderbilts created one of America's great fortunes,
beginning with Cornelius Vanderbilt's ferry service across New York
harbor and growing into the great railroad fortune of the 19th
century. Cornelius Vanderbilt left most of his $100 million fortune
to William Henry Vanderbilt, who eventually doubled its assets.
</P>
<P>
   George Vanderbilt, youngest of William's eight children, grew up
in the family's 58-room mansion at 640 Fifth Avenue. In a family
defined by commerce and high society, he was a bookish
intellectual. He moved into bachelor quarters, complete with a
handsome library, in the family mansion and devoted himself to
travel, reading and intellectual pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Asheville in the southern Appalachians, he
decided to build an estate, a Vanderbilt passion, and set about
purchasing 125,000 acres of land and hiring two of the most
influential figures in design, the architect Richard Morris Hunt
and the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead.
</P>
<P>
   Work began in 1889; when it was completed in 1895 there were
elaborately sculptured gardens, farms, woodlands and a four-story
stone house with a 780-foot-long front facade in the richly
ornamented style of the French Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The room that perhaps most showed off its owner's personality
was the library, with its carved walnut bookcases, red damask
drapery and upholstery, black marble fireplace and early
18th-century ceiling painting by the Venetian Giovanni Antonio
Pellegrini. The library holds about 10,000 books, organized by
subject; the rest are in the den, smoking room, hallways and in
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt was described by one contemporary journalist as ``one
of the best-read men of the country,'' and over the years Biltmore
was host to Edith Wharton, Henry James, John Singer Sargent and
other celebrated figures from the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, who went to private schools in New York and was
tutored at home but never went to college, was no mere dilettante
with lots of time on his hands. He started acquiring books in eight
languages at the age of 11. Eventually he became fluent in French,
German and Italian, and gained a reading knowledge of Latin, Greek,
Hebrew and Sanskrit.
</P>
<P>
   A display case includes a copy of notebooks he kept in which he
recorded all the books he read. The last entry, No. 3,159, was the
third volume of Henry Adams' ``History of the United States,''
which means that between 1875 and 1914 he read an average of 81
books a year.
</P>
<P>
   His collection reflected his diverse interests, but researchers
are only now finding out how significant it is. ``We feel like
we're at the beginning of a great journey here,'' said Hal Keiner,
an archivist and historian hired in April 1997 to study the library
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important book in the collection is ``Sibylline
Leaves: A Collection of Poems,'' an 1817 collection of Samuel
Taylor Coleridge's poems that includes a first edition of ``The
Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' with the author's corrections for
subsequent editions inked in and signed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rare first edition of John Milton's ``Paradise Lost''
printed in 1667, a 1737 edition of Alexander Pope's ``Essay on Man
in the Four Epistles to a Friend,'' with handwritten notes by the
author, and a rare first edition of Charles Darwin's ``On the
Origin of Species.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection is particularly strong in art and architecture,
including many titles almost impossible to find in the United
States. It is also very strong in French, German, American and
English literature with first editions of works by Melville,
Hawthorne, Dickens, Thackeray and others.
</P>
<P>
   Biltmore which is owned by George Vanderbilt's grandson William
A.V. Cecil, is open to the public and visited by 850,000 people a
year. But the library collection has been private, with books only
occasionally made available to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The new attention to the library's holdings will almost
certainly lead to more requests from scholars and researchers. Mr.
Keiner said the library did not have the staff, space, security or
resources to become a much more public institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to provide access when we can,'' he said. ``But I'm
not sure we'll ever be set up to operate like a large research
library. We're still not certain how this will work out.''

<P>
   Q: I was born in the South and have been raised to love and
adore the Southern magnolia, Magnolia grandiflora. You can take the
girl out of Virginia but not Virginia out of the girl, so I have
tried to find cold-hardy varieties which will grow at my
Pennsylvania home in U.S. Agriculture Department Zone 6. What
varieties do you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the many species of magnolia, the evergreen M.
grandiflora, with its dramatic deep green, large, patent-leather
leaves; breathtaking fragrance, and waxy white blossoms in June,
July and sporadically throughout the summer, is the one that puts a
Southern lilt in your voice and a julep in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, it's harder to take the magnolia out of the
South than it is to take the girl out. There are some cultivars
that are hardy in Zone 6, including Bracken's Brown Beauty, an
upright 25-foot tree loaded with flowers and with smaller leaves
that have heavily brown felted undersides. Others include D.D.
Blanchard, Poconos, Victoria and Edith Bogue.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all Zone 6 sites are created equal. Dr. Kim Tripp,
vice president of horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden in
the Bronx, says that microclimate is everything, and that the
garden's Magnolia grandiflora does well because it is in a
protected courtyard. Cold winters mean the best place for a hardy
Southern magnolia is near a wall, which will reflect winter warmth
and provide shelter from cold winds. High, light shade from bare
trees nearby will help keep the winter sun from desiccating the
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The same cautions apply to the soil. Your memories may be of
magnolias growing in clay, but in the North, clay soils stay too
wet and too cold for too long, so magnolias need moist but
well-drained, humusy, acidic soils.
</P>
<P>
   If you're really crazy about magnolias, you may want to join the
Magnolia Society, 6616 81st St., Cabin John, Md. 20818, (301)
320-4296; www.supernet.net/magnolia/ to exchange Southern
reminiscences and pick up Northern advice. The society publishes
newsletters and a journal, offers seeds, has regional and worldwide
meetings and provides a place to share information. Dues are $20 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for hardy Southern magnolias include Louisiana Nursery,
5853 Highway 182, Opelousas, La. 70570, (318) 942-6404, catalog $6;
and Gossler Farms Nursery, 1200 Weaver Road, Springfield, Ore.
97478, (541) 746-3922, catalog $2. Good luck, y'all.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm going to be planting trees in a few weeks, so I am
wondering what's the latest scoop on planting. Specifically, is it
really OK to just leave all that burlap around the root ball?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like other things in life that aren't what they used to be,
burlap has changed. Whether for the better depends on your point of
view. A single layer of plain old untreated burlap, now almost a
thing of the past, rots away nicely and lets roots wander freely
out of their soil ball. But you are just as likely to run into a
plastic burlaplike material or into burlap that has been treated
with a rot-resistant chemical. Both are popular in the
horticultural industry for the same reason: they stay intact
longer, through sunshine and waterings, as the tree makes its way
from its growing site to you.
</P>
<P>
   But that perseverance presents problems for growing roots trying
to find their way into new surroundings. Rot-resistant burlap takes
years longer to decay than untreated, and even untreated burlap
presents a formidable boundary if wadded down in layers and left in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic material decays much more slowly, restricting the
diameter of the roots as they grow out. In some cases, the tree may
even die. At that point, you can dig it up and use the original
wrapping to take the dead tree to the dump. Very convenient, unless
you are the tree.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such problems, after placing the tree in that nice,
extra-wide, but no-deeper-than-the-ball hole, untie the twine
around the trunk and cut away the burlap. All that remains is the
portion directly under the root ball, which won't be a problem,
because tree roots grow out, not down.

FOR CYCLISTS, EASIER SHIFTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Calif.)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When cyclists head out on the road, they often bring a lot of
electronics along for the ride, from computers to measure speed,
distance and altitude to wireless heart rate monitors.
</P>
<P>
   But those gadgets don't make a bike go.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the vital task of gear shifting over to electronics is
something different. This year Mavic, the French cycling arm of
Adidas Salomon, and Shimano of Japan, the Microsoft of bicycle-part
makers, are doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Currently even the most sophisticated bicycles used by
professional racers rely on fine steel cables linked to a
mechanical device, usually a spring-loaded ratchet, to select among
the 18 gear ratios increasingly common on racing bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The $799 Mavic Mektronic, on the other hand, lets a cyclist
change gears by tapping small electronic switches located in three
different spots on the handlebars. Those commands travel to a
handlebar-mounted computer that sends a signal to the rear
derailleur to tell it to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Driscoll, marketing manager for Mavic USA in Georgetown,
Mass., said the new system's increased complexity should make it
more reliable than its first system called Zap. The downfall of
Zap, he said, was that it dispatched its electronic orders over
wires, which failed in wet weather, rather than radio waves. Two
European professional teams will shift gears with Mektronic this
season.
</P>
<P>
   While you won't see any pros using the Shimano Nexus Auto D, it
does the Mektronic one better by automatically changing gears. But
it is based on a four-speed system, which is popular for urban
bikes in Europe and Asia but exceptionally unfashionable in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   A central processing unit, sitting in a waterproof box just
ahead of the rear wheel, decides when to shift based on speed
information from a front-wheel sensor. A small motor, assisted by
some old-fashioned pedaling, does the gear changing.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Boehmke, a spokesman for the Shimano American Corp. in
Irvine, Calif., said the automation is intended mostly for people
who don't cycle because they are intimidated by gears. He estimated
that bicycles with the system would probably sell for $400 to $650.

   Cows and computers go together like, well, milk and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway computer company uses the familiar Holstein
black-and-white pattern in its advertisements and packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Nullsoft's Winamp, an MP3 music player for Windows, allows the
user to change the on-screen look of the program by adding
different ``skins,'' one of which is the Moo Amp, a festive cow
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of the Moo Amp is the Ecowlizer _ a digitized
stereo equalizer display that replaces pulsating LED lights with
tiny cow heads bouncing up and down. And cows also turn up in the
darndest places in the South Park Nintendo game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps cows became so popular because of their ubiquitous and
comforting presence in the American consciousness. Or just maybe it
has something to do with the fact that many highly regarded
computer-science programs are located at universities in the middle
of cow country _ the state universities of Illinois, Wisconsin and
Texas, and Purdue University, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the subliminal influence of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream
(and other fine Vermont dairy favorites that go well with all-night
computing) is having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the World Wide Web and its fancy graphics went on
line, there was a sense of bovine inspiration on the Internet,
specifically in the form of simple ASCII art. For those who do not
remember computer visuals before GIF's and JPEG's, popular image
formats that are Web standards, users would create rustic graphics
by carefully arranging alphanumeric text characters. Links to
samples of the great works can be found on a Yahoo page that is
devoted to collections of ASCII cow art (at www.yahoo.com, follow
the trail from Arts to Visual Arts, Computer Generated, ASCII ART,
Cows).
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, cows have also stampeded the World Wide
Web. Moocow.com (www.moocow.com) greets its visitors with a large
winking cow picture and an opportunity to click on one of its
hundreds of Random Cow Links. In addition to many pictures and a
collection of book titles about cows, the site maintains its own
long list of links to cows on the Web _ the Super Moo Web Pages
Index.
</P>
<P>
   Cows on the Web are far from sacred. The Cow Tipping Home Page
(members.xoom.com/toch) lets Web surfers participate in that
infamous rural prank of shoving over sleeping cattle _ albeit in a
much safer, humane and tongue-in-cheek way. The page gives you
several cows to choose from, and with one click, Bossy is upside
down with a startled, indignant ``Moo!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Web's most popular shareware sites, Tucows.com
(www.tucows.com), naturally features a couple of cows on its home
page. Tucows, which is an acronym for The Ultimate Collection of
Winsock Software, has expanded its collection to include Macintosh
and some Java applications.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the Tucows site will reveal a collection of
cow-related software, just in case you need the Moo Amp skin for
your Winamp player or that handsome cow screen saver. And for
comfortable computing wear, the distinctive Ben &AMP; Jerry's Blue Moo
shirt is available at
store.benjerry.com/benjerry1/bluemootshirt.html.

YOUNGER SISTER'S PARENTS NOT LIKE MINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You should meet my sister's parents. They are so great.
</P>
<P>
   They're open-minded, flexible and patient as the day is long.
They are just incredible. I have only one sibling, my younger
sister. More than a decade lies between us. I don't know what
happened during that long child-bearing break, but she is so lucky
to have those cool folks.
</P>
<P>
   She's getting married soon, and she has asked me to be the
matron of honor. I hate that word: ``matron.'' It sounds so ... so
... old. I asked her if I could be the ``head bridesmaid'' or
``leader of the pack,'' but she said no. My dictionary tells me
that a matron is a mature, dignified, married woman. Under the
circumstances, I've gotta wear those dyed-to-match shoes, even if
they don't fit well.
</P>
<P>
   I had good parents, too. They were there for me when I needed
them. They provided shelter, clothing and help with my homework.
They even played Monopoly with me until I had a hotel on every
property and they couldn't get past ``Go.'' But they were just a
little uptight at times as they tried to figure out the best way to
raise their first child. We broke a lot of new ground together.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my parents are a lot like my sister's parents. They
look just like them, so much so that it's uncanny at times. They
sound like them, and they even live in the same house with the same
phone number. If I were not so perceptive, I would be misled into
thinking that they were the same people. But I know that some alien
life forms have taken my parents away and left these kinder,
gentler people in their stead.
</P>
<P>
   It's the little things that give them away. For example, my
sister sleeps until 10 some Saturday mornings. When I call for her,
her mother says, ``Oh, she's tired, so I'm letting her sleep in.''
</P>
<P>
   What? She's tired! When did that become an issue? I had to get
up with the roosters every Saturday and start housecleaning. No one
cared whether I was tired after Friday night football and burgers.
I did more by 10 a.m. than she does all day. Am I jealous? You bet
your feather duster I am.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, we were planning a big family vacation, and my
mother made a suggestion about the destination. My sister
vehemently disagreed, and do you know what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Mom said, ``OK, Jaye, tell us your ideas. Let's try to work out
a compromise that's a win-win situation for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   I do not know this person.
</P>
<P>
   Before, it was always: no money _ no vote. This new democracy is
unfamiliar to me. I'm not saying that I don't like it; I'm just
having trouble becoming accustomed to it.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about this situation is that my sister's parents
are also my children's grandparents. My boys think the sun rises
and sets on those two. My sister's parents let them eat whatever
they want, within reason. They actually watch cartoons with the
boys. And since Grandpa retired, he has a lot more time for
after-school activities and is always available in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Yessir, my sister's folks are definitely keepers. I wouldn't
change a thing about them.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part is _ they let me call them ``Mom'' and
``Dad,'' too.

IBM PACKS A LOT INTO A LITTLE CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As computer manufacturers scurried recently to announce their
plans for the new and much-ballyhooed Pentium III chip from Intel,
another technology giant, IBM, announced what truly seems to be a
breakthrough in chip design. Some electronics experts said IBM's
new design could significantly hasten the evolution of computers
and personal electronics devices, allowing them to become ever
smarter and ever smaller.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's chip is officially designated the SA-27E but is more
commonly called a system-on-a-chip. It is 18 millimeters on each
side, about the size of a thumbnail. In essence, the new IBM chip
promises to do computing jobs that now require two or more chips,
and to do those tasks faster and at a lower wattage and cost. The
results, IBM officials say, will be a range of much more compact,
more efficient and more versatile products, like personal
computers, cellular telephones, household appliances and video
games.
</P>
<P>
   The first devices using these chips are expected to begin
showing up next year, said Phillip Bergman, an IBM spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite exciting,'' said Bijan Davari, vice president
for development at the IBM microelectronics division in East
Fishkill, N.Y. He said the chip's design was unique. It can pack up
to eight times the processing power and four times the memory found
in the PCs typically used today, which use many chips.
</P>
<P>
   Every computer, whether a sprawling work station or the
electronic innards of a washing machine or toy, must be able to
store sets of instructions or programs (its memory capacity) and
use those programs to accomplish tasks (its logic capacity). These
functions are usually assigned to separate chips that communicate
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Pentium-class computer uses a very powerful chip
crammed with millions of transistors to process data. It also uses
clusters of other chips to store programs, data and instructions.
</P>
<P>
   But this arrangement, chip makers say, has always been
inherently inefficient, making for bulkier computers and slowing a
PC's operation by forcing the chips to create streams of data
traffic _ with the inevitable bottlenecks _ in the connections
among them.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scientists have sought ways to combine logic and
memory into one chip without compromising the performance of
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the processing power and data on separate chips was
like having the materials you need to do your job in another
office,'' Davari said. ``This forces you to keep going next door to
get what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Davari said the new IBM chip, combining high-performance logic
and memory, was the first of its kind. It manages the combination
of tasks mostly through an innovative approach that embeds memory
components into a sliver of silicon, the common material of all
microprocessors. That is done, Davari explained, by burrowing
beneath the surface of the silicon and placing the chip's memory,
as much as 32 megabytes, into tiny trenches. These ``trench cells''
are as much as 6 microns deep. (A human hair is about 100 microns
wide.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chip's surface is then left flat and uncluttered for the
placement of highly compact logic transistors. Using special copper
circuitry as thin as 0.15 microns, the entire package remains very
small and very efficient, IBM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip may cost less than current chips because of the
consolidation of functions and the need for less complex
motherboards and other related components.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been working on this for a while,'' said Chan Suh,
chief executive of Agency.com, a consulting company based in New
York that specializes in interactive technologies and strategies.
He said IBM was the first to offer designers this innovation
because of the company's use of special copper circuitry for the
logic functions; the tiny circuitry allows more memory to be packed
inside the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Suh said the new technology, while not as groundbreaking as the
shift from vacuum tubes to transistors in the 1950s, is still an
important step to greater miniaturization. And making devices
smaller is ``the Holy Grail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the new IBM chip technology is considered along with recent
industry steps to establish a common computer language for small
electronic devices, Suh said, the dawn of the talking toaster
appears to draw closer.

   Rick Doherty, director of research for the Envisioneering Group,
a technology testing and marketing company in Seaford, N.Y., said
the IBM chip would above all open a universe of new possibilities
to designers, freeing them from the constraints of multichip
designs. ``This allows people to get ideas in product form and to
market a lot faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty added that he could envision, for instance, a ``Palm
Pilot X'' using the system-on-a-chip. It would possess the power of
a Pentium III and have lots of memory storage space, yet run on a
single small battery.
</P>
<P>
   In about a year, an IBM spokesman said, the company expects to
see the chips first put to use in improving Internet routers and
hubs. Placing the chips, which will be made by IBM, in personal
computers is part of the second phase of the chips' deployment,
said Bergman of IBM. He noted that such a use was probably two to
three years away. The chips, ready for custom designs next month,
will be ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits. Such
chips are commonly found in things like digital cameras and
automobile air-bag systems.
</P>
<P>
   The SA-27E will make ripples in the technology world, Suh said.
For consumers, he said, ``the price of computers will definitely
come down, and people will be able to get more things around the
house with computerization built in.''

Richard Kluger, a 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner, is the author of
``The Paper: The Life and Death of The New York Herald Tribune.'' 
 By RICHARD KLUGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One can hardly conceive of a more daunting belletristic
challenge than to undertake a full-scale autobiography when the
subject's first 10 years were in large part spent desperately
dodging the most horrific atrocity of his century. How to prevent
the rest of the tale from dwindling to anticlimax even when, as in
Max Frankel's case, he survived to become for a time the world's
most influential newspaperman?
</P>
<P>
   Rather like Stephen Spielberg, who could not sustain the level
of intensity with which he rendered the D-Day inferno at the
opening of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Frankel, alas, becomes the
victim of his own gripping storytelling. If ``The Times of My
Life'' consisted of nothing more than its first 85 pages,
recounting how Frankel's German-Jewish family, kindly regarded in
its ``well-scrubbed'' hometown near Leipzig, eluded Hitler's ever
more vicious anti-Semitic crackdown _ ``fear created endless
hallucinations of rescue,'' he writes _ it would justify the whole
volume.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's indomitable struggle against mindless bureaucrats
that won her and her only child a last-instant reprieve from the
Nazi cauldron, his father's forced separation from them and
endurance of the Soviet gulag, and Max's own bravery as a
terrorized child fugitive constitute a luminous new chapter in the
Holocaust literature.
</P>
<P>
   While he never forgot his ordeal after his family found refuge
in New York in 1940, young Max declined to accept his spiritual
heritage as his defining essence _ ``Jewish is only a religion,''
he told his displeased father _ and fast grew into a passionately
assimilated American and a skilled user of his new nation's idiom.
The journalism bug bit him badly at Columbia University where he
ran the student daily and came to relish ``the chance to champion
remedies for discovered wrongs'' and ``the reliable armor to shield
an otherwise debilitating shyness.''
</P>
<P>
   On graduating, Frankel joined The New York Times, which he had
served as campus stringer, and never worked anywhere else. Why
would he when, in his estimate, ``it frames the intellectual and
emotional agenda of serious Americans?''
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years the quintessential Timesman, he had a front-row
seat at the great political and diplomatic events of the age and
backstage access to many of its leading players. His mission, as it
evolved with his craft, was to help refine The Times' brand of
journalism into ``a narrative art, connecting past to future, cause
to consequence.'' He continues, ``Our job was to choose, to apply
judgment to events, and to transform mere information into
understanding.'' A worthy conceit, surely, but perhaps more suited
to philosopher kings than harried chroniclers under a tight daily
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering only occasional spasms of the immodesty that almost by
definition infects all who venture into autobiography, Frankel
takes us inside The Times as he advances from night rewrite man,
churning out high-pressure copy on the sinking of the Andrea Doria,
to his foreign postings in Vienna, Moscow and Havana during the
loudest saber-rattling days of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Then on to the Washington bureau, covering the State Department
and White House as United States policy makers slid into the
deepening morass of Vietnam; to Washington bureau chief when The
Times nervily published the Pentagon Papers, letting the public in
on its government's long deceptions over Indochina; to potent tours
of duty directing the plump Sunday edition, the editorial page and,
from 1986 to 1994, the paper's entire news staff of 1,000 as
executive editor.
</P>
<P>
   In this crowning role he opened up the paper's concept of
suitable front page news by inviting it to call attention to wide
social currents, not merely discrete events of the day; encouraged
coverage of gay issues; enlisted and promoted more women and
blacks, and made the paper's graphics more eye-appealing.
</P>
<P>
   For all his chauvinism Frankel is not above faulting The Times
for past sins of both commission and omission. He long opposed his
editors' slavish dependency on ``official'' news as defined by
government spokesmen and instead championed analytical and
interpretive reporting as often the surer route to the truth. He
felt the paper's prose tended to be drab, its business coverage
thin, its sports pages unimaginative and its editorials steeped in
``pious certitude.''
</P>
<P>
   What we miss here, for all his acute intelligence and exhibition
of journalistic virtuosity, is a sense of drama and combat in
Frankel's seemingly inevitable ascent to the pinnacle of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit he is no kiss-and-teller and only briefly dwells
on intramural stratagems, rivalries and flash points. He lionizes
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, The Times' former publisher, as a fierce
but unpompous defender of the paper's traditional embrace of
quality even when it meant leaner profits, and deflates A.M.
Rosenthal, his brilliant predecessor as executive editor, for
brandishing an ego-driven and despotic managerial style.
</P>
<P>
   At its best ``The Times of My Life'' offers deft judgments of
the world figures he encountered up close. He finds Khrushchev
``the most robust politician of my time,'' behind whose ``mask of
bluster I thought I saw a face of decency.'' He believes Richard M.
Nixon ``so despised his own warped nature that he found it
difficult to perceive virtue in anyone else'' and rates Hubert H.
Humphrey ``the most openhearted and ill-disciplined of our national
figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Frankel displays his sophisticated grasp of the
built-in tension between the prime sources of the news and its
gatherers. The Washington press corps, he suggests, is ``so
dependent on government information and so dutiful in disseminating
official propaganda that it grows desperate to prove its mettle by
also exposing error, hyperbole, hypocrisy and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Emblematic of Frankel's career-long integrity is his decision
here to use italics instead of quotation marks in recording
revelatory conversations to which he was privy but did not take
notes for or in dialogues that he has recreated from others'
accounts. Many authors of otherwise estimable works have been far
less exacting, but as Frankel remarks in the end note, ``For a
journalist, a quotation mark must be sacrosanct.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a blessing that such a dedicated witness to our times was
not exterminated in his youth along with so many less lucky.

FINDING OLDER USENET POSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is there any way I can find a particular posting from a few
months ago in a Usenet newsgroup? I know the author's name but
cannot recall the exact subject line.
</P>
<P>
   A. For those unfamiliar with Usenet, it is an international
electronic bulletin board where Internet users can post messages
(also referred to as articles) in newsgroups, which are public
discussion areas devoted to specific subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet now has newsgroups available on just about any topic
imaginable. For example, Lynne Russell, a CNN ``Headline News''
anchor, is the subject for a newsgroup of adoring fans commenting
on her every move, at alt.fan.lynne-russell.
</P>
<P>
   With so much material available and thousands of postings from
around the world every day, finding things in Usenet can be
time-consuming. As with many kinds of research, one of the quickest
ways to find information is on the Web. The Deja News site
(www.dejanews.com) will let you search through Usenet articles
using keywords, including the author's name.
</P>
<P>
   If you search for the author's name or e-mail address, Deja News
will show you the articles posted by that person, along with all
the different newsgroups the person has contributed to. The Deja
News archive of postings goes back about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How accurate are the scanners that let you copy documents
into your computer so you can edit them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Software that lets you scan text documents into your computer
is called an optical character recognition (OCR) program. These
programs analyze the images of type on a printed page, and
translates them into text that can be edited with a word-processing
program.
</P>
<P>
   For most home users, a basic scanner and off-the-shelf software
like Caere's Omnipage Pro or Expervision's Type Reader will work
just fine. Most OCR programs can distinguish a variety of fonts and
formats and usually come with proofreading and spell-checking
functions to help catch any errors right away.
</P>
<P>
   Although some software makes claims of up to 99-percent accuracy
in the translation from paper to computer file, the legibility of
the document being scanned affects the results. Any program will
have a much better time with a clean, clear page from a laser
printer than with a blurry photocopy of a fax or a magazine article
with coffee rings all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
postal mail to Questions, Circuits, The New York Times, 229 West
43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036-3959 or by e-mail to

PAIR MAY RIDE `LAST TRAIN' TO FAME 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By SCOTT HADLY   
 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ They're not young wannabe movie moguls
on Hollywood's up-and-coming hot list, but the writing partners who
took home this year's top prize for screenwriting at the Santa
Barbara Film Festival are generating a buzz all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't just get out of film school,'' said Jane Ilsa Wells,
who with Ian Ginsburg penned this year's first-place winner in the
festival's annual Peter Stark Screenwriting Competition. ``But with
the win, I really feel things starting to happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, a widow and mother of a teen-age daughter, and Ginsburg,
a music teacher, have so far produced five scripts. Their latest
and winning script, ``The Last Train,'' follows the lives of two
brothers shipped out of New York City on the eve of the Great
Depression aboard the last of the so-called orphan trains.
</P>
<P>
   A real part of history, the trains were started in the 19th
century by a minister who wanted to help young orphaned immigrant
children find better lives. The trains were loaded with youngsters
sent to rural homes in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the children ended up in loving families, sometimes
they ended up in near servitude, and Ginsburg and Wells' screenplay
follows both fates. In their script, two teen-age Jewish brothers
sent to rural Texas end up in very different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, who is 35 and lives in Phoenix, got the idea after
listening to a survivor of the orphan train tell his story on the
radio. He said it wasn't until he started working with Wells, who
is 40 and lives in Cottonwood, Ariz., that the plot took off. She
recognized the story needed to immediately draw people in, so she
put together an arresting opening sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The script begins with no dialogue. The camera focuses on the
face of a tired, disheveled young mother standing atop a New York
tenement. The pretty young woman's sons sit crying nearby behind a
railing. The woman steps off the ledge of the building. The camera
turns to the face of the older of the two boys who plaintively
cries, ``Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw what we had, I said, `This is hot, let's write
it,''' Ginsburg said. ``There's no doubt about it that it was a
brilliant beginning and we were off from there. We fight sometimes,
but we work very well together. When we get going we can be writing
six to eight hours without stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Since learning that they won the award, the writing partners
have also attracted an independent film company interested in
another of their scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how the Hollywood world works _ until you're
validated by a star that champions your work or you win a contest
like this one, you don't get much recognition,'' Ginsburg said.
``Now things are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-place award earns the writing partners a $5,000 check
and an introduction to a Hollywood agent. The competition drew
entries from more than 100 script-writing hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   The award will be handed out at a ceremony on Sunday.
</P>

A GOOD FILM NEED ONLY COST A SMALL FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TOM SCHULTZ   
 Santa Barbara News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ So, you want to make a cutting-edge or
influential independent film on a tight budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake that people make is thinking that there is one way
to do it,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, director of programming and
special projects for the influential Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore would know. He watches thousands of independently
written, directed and produced movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sage advice from the Sundance organizer, along with common-sense
suggestions from Hollywood deal-makers and low-budget film
producers, was the subject of a seminar at the 11-day Santa Barbara
International Film Festival that ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven experts at a panel discussion on ``How To Make a Movie for
Under $1 Million'' offered numerous strategies for finishing and
selling an inexpensive motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   Can't get tracks for your cameras to roll on? Use a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Can't keep your crew happy? Feed them more often. Or find people
who don't mind lots of overtime. Or don't mind working for free.
</P>
<P>
   Can't afford elaborate sets, helicopter chases, big gun fights
or night lighting? Shoot a gritty movie about life on the streets,
with a documentary style.
</P>
<P>
   That last approach helped independent filmmaker John-Luke
Montias finish ``Bobby G. Can't Swim,'' a low-budget film about a
troubled drug addict living in the heart of New York's Hell's
Kitchen district that premiered here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing was planning,'' said Montias, who
shot the film in 18 days. ``You don't want to have 8 million
different locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Atchison, who shot his independent film ``The
Pornographer'' in 20 days, agreed that planning ahead of time is
crucial to keeping costs down once the shooting starts.
</P>
<P>
   His film about a porn-obsessed 25-year-old man in search of an
innocent female to turn into an adult-film star premiered here last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you decide to make a film, all the forces of nature line
up against you,'' Atchison said. ``You don't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In search of funds, ``We went to Dubai, solicited rich Arab
companies,'' he said. But that never panned out.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, ``I reversed it,'' Atchison said. ``Look at scripts
and do one that fits the means that you have. You can have a vision
and very little money and people will respond. You can have big
eyes and a small pocket and people will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, modesty is not always the best approach to finding
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the people closest to you because it's harder for
them to say, `No,''' said Randy Simon, who produced the critically
acclaimed independent feature ``Pi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your rich uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   And get a lot of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're about to make a movie, sign up for all of them
quickly,'' Simon said. ``There's always your significant other. If
they do not have a rich father or uncle, switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding suitable locations to film at can also be tricky. If you
decide to shoot without proper permits, Simon recommended a lookout
_ someone armed with a walkie-talkie and a good eye for spotting
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Once the movie is made, selling the film becomes the next
challenge. That's when retaining an established producers
representative comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to figure out whether you need to have
representation,'' Gilmore said. ``Getting good advice ... It really
make a huge difference. It's really an enormous benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a representative with enough clout to generate industry
interest in your film, and enough know-how to secure you a good
deal under pressure, can be crucial. Often a buyer will put their
deal on the table for no longer than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Producers' representative Neil Friedman recommended gathering as
many potential buyers for the film's premiere as possible to foster
competition. In addition, invite members of the target audience to
the screening, so the potential buyers can witness positive
reaction to the piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give out cassettes, number one,'' Friedman said. ``Make
it a real theater experience, not that TV or VCR experience.''
</P>

 &HT;    THERE SHE IS: THE NEW MISS ISRAEL IS MEMBER OF ARAB MINORITY
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ She wears the sequins, sash and gleaming smile of
beauty queens the world over, but no one should take the new Miss
Israel at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Crowned Tuesday night, 21-year-old Rana Raslan is the first Arab
ever to win the Miss Israel pageant. A Muslim, she will represent
the Jewish state in the Miss World contest late this year.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of nearly a million Arab Israelis -- distinct from
the neighboring Palestinians in that they are Israeli citizens and
within the recognized borders of Israel, rather than the disputed,
occupied areas. Though facing high rates of poverty and
unemployment, the Arab Israelis have slowly increased in numbers
and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Raslan's photo, with her crown set atop her long, dark curls,
was on the front of Israel's major dailies Wednesday and she seemed
to scramble the region's religious and ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I belong to Israel. I'm Israeli Arab,'' the exhausted beauty
queen told the Cox News Service in a telephone interview from a
party in her home in Haifa Wednesday. ``We must, the Jewish and the
Arabs, live like brothers. We must show all the world we can live
together.''
</P>
<P>
   A legal secretary, who speaks Arabic, Hebrew and English, Raslan
wants to eventually become a teacher. But, Wednesday was filled
with photo sessions, interviews and comparisons to her predecessor,
a Jewish Israeli who won the Miss World title last November.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits here noted that beauty pageants pale in importance in a
land of periodic war and terrorism. Privately, some Israelis
groused that the pageant had made a choice based on political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   But, Raslan's victory was seized upon by politicians and
commentators from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that
he was ``proud'' of the choice as ``a clear expression of
equality,'' to a pageant judge who called it a peace gesture to the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Most acknowledge that Raslan was, if nothing else, a sign of
Israel's increasingly multi-cultural make up -- a Jewish Ethiopian
Israeli also made history Tuesday by taking second place -- as well
a small triumph for the sizeable Arab minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a creeping recognition. It is very limited and still
not the norm, and not rooted in Israeli political culture,'' said
Majid Al-Haj, an Arab Israeli who heads Haifa University's Center
for Multi-Culturalism.
</P>
<P>
   He said Israeli Arabs are seeking integration into Israeli
society more than ever and could change Israel's identity as the
Zionist, Jewish state. Jews, in turn, he said are slowly starting
to recognize Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-sixth of the six million Israelis living here are
Arabs, either Muslims or Christians. Unlike the 2.5 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the families of Arab
Israelis did not flee or get forced out of Israel when neighboring
Arab nations attacked in 1948. Some Israeli Arabs prefer to call
themselves Palestinians or ``Arab citizens of Israel'' rather than
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Israel are segregated, and
Israeli Arabs complain that they receive only a fraction of the
services of Jewish sectors.
</P>
<P>
   But, they have generally the same legal rights, including the
right to vote and hold public office. An Arab Israeli recently
became the first Arab appointed to a nine-month term on the Israeli
supreme court(CQ lower case).

Theodore Roszak is the author of ``The Cult of Information: A
Neo-Luddite Treatise on High Tech, Artificial Intelligence and the
True Art of Thinking'' (University of California Press, 2nd
Edition, 1994). His most recent book is ``America the Wise: The

<P>
   Is there any chance, I wonder, that we might prevail on the
movie industry to change its rating for ``Shakespeare in Love''
from R to G? I'd be willing to risk whatever harm a few flashes of
Gwyneth Paltrow's breasts might do to our children in exchange for
the contribution the film makes to computer literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know there are no computers in the movie. That's the
point. As brazenly anachronistic as the film is about Elizabethan
life and times, it is reasonably accurate in the few brief scenes
that stuck with me. Shakespeare at work doing what history most
remembers him for.
</P>
<P>
   Not bedding fair ladies, but writing. And with what? A tattered
feather dipped in liquefied carbon. We see the hard-working
playwright softening the tip, cutting it at just the right angle,
stopping to sharpen it again and again, and finally casting it
aside when it grows too mushy and reaching for another.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who has experimented with quills tells me that goose
feathers provide more durability than those plucked from a duck or
chicken, but even the best goose quill will not last longer than a
few pages. And the result? With all the skill in the world, by the
time one finishes crossing out and revising, the page has turned
into a semilegible chaos of India ink and needs to be recopied.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is how ``Romeo and Juliet'' was written. And ``Hamlet''
and ``King Lear.'' All were laboriously scribbled into existence by
an inspired poet who cared above all for the depth, eloquence and
intellectual force of his work and got right down to it. Between
the days of the ancient stylus and the advent of the steel-tipped
pen of the industrial period, the quill and the hollow reed brought
every major and minor piece of writing in Western civilization to
life. I wish our kids could see that happening.
</P>
<P>
   It might teach them a basic cultural truth they will never learn
from Bill Gates or school administrators who cannot spend enough
wiring our classrooms, often at the expense of hiring teachers.
Quality is in the mind, not the machine. Someday we may have a
computer on every desk in every school, but that won't make us a
nation of Shakespeares _ or Newtons or Chopins or Jane Austens or
Thomas Jeffersons, all of whom scaled the heights of excellence
without the benefit of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like my students to ponder the fact that by the time they
have located their style sheets and selected their fonts,
Shakespeare was probably well into Act One, Scene One. In the time
they take to puzzle over some inscrutable error message (``Invalid
Signature _ Checksum Does Not Match''), Shakespeare might have been
revising Mercutio's glorious Queen Mab speech. In the time they
spend rebooting and waiting for 20 drivers to load after their
machines have locked up, he would very likely have been roughing
out the balcony scene.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I would want to see children struggling with quill and
ink. I can recall how I dreaded my penmanship classes, back in the
days when schools still cared about handwriting. The steel-nib pen
may have been a breakthrough in the history of the written word,
but it was a torment for me. Every careless upstroke left the
newsprint paper my school supplied shredded and smeared. Before I
got my first ballpoint in 1945 _ I remember the occasion: it was an
Eversharp pen guaranteed to keep writing for 15 years! _ everything
I wrote with pen and ink was an eyesore. Now I am so habituated to
Word Perfect (Version 6.1 for DOS, still the world's fastest word
processor), I sometimes forget that in the throes of inspiration,
any pencil will do.
</P>
<P>
   And that is lesson No. 1 in computer literacy: the computer
contributes nothing essential to the life of the mind. No, not even
all the information that comes gushing out of the World Wide Web.
Remember, Shakespeare never needed to surf his way to
www.traveleurope.net/verona.htm to write the play that made the
city famous.
</P>
<P>
   Am I saying that computers might actually get in the way of
significant intellectual work? Yes, I am, especially where children
are concerned. Because even user-friendly machines are a barrier
that need not be there between the kid and the idea. A child with a
pencil in her hand is ready to write. A child with a crayon in his
hand is ready to draw.
</P>
<P>
   A kid with a computer is ready to . . . begin a learning curve
that starts with booting up, virus-checking, configuring, rebooting
if the machine hangs, searching for misplaced files, undeleting
lost files, arranging the desktop, rearranging the desktop,
customizing icons, fussing with screen savers, creating button
bars, resizing and positioning windows, formatting, reformatting,
downloading, uploading, clicking on menus and choosing fonts,
unless, of course, teacher does all that for the kids and creates
the illusion that it's easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   And once the machine is ready to work, there is all the
whizzing, whirling distraction of a million Web sites to contend
with. Computer enthusiasts tell us that the Internet brings
children a ``world of information.'' And there's the rub. Children
simply do not need that much information to learn how to think or
taste the joys of creativity. Not first of all.
</P>
<P>
   What they need are impassioned ideas to think with. Where are
those found? In other knowledge-loving minds. True, the Web can
search out such minds. But they are most readily and least
expensively available from the authors of books and from teachers
in classrooms. A good teacher equipped with enough cheap copies of
``Huckleberry Finn'' to go around can do more to make young minds
blossom than the same teacher forced to revamp all she knows to fit
the limited capacities of a roomful of expensive computers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Information is worthless if it is not informed by ideas, values
and judgment _ or worse than worthless if one recognizes why the
Web exists at all. The Web is the product of a predatory
entrepreneurial sensibility. Like a spider's trap, it exists to
ensnare attention with high-tech effects and eye-popping tricks.
Those who weave the Web are seeking desperately to transform the
medium into the new television, the new movies. Their objective is
to lure millions to their sites so they can make lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   That is no secret; the main, ongoing story about the Web is how
much profit its backers are taking in. What passes through the
medium is being shaped by those values, not by any significant
regard for quality, truth or taste. Currently, in one of the most
bizarre and outrageous campaigns in the history of hucksterism, the
Apple company is encouraging us to ``think different.'' (I gather
the iMac comes without a grammar-checker.) Apple's advertisements
show Picasso, Einstein, Cesar Chavez, Gandhi and Martha Graham, all
of whom seem to be endorsing the iMac. I would not be surprised to
see Shakespeare and Jesus joining their number soon. These people
had only one thing in common where computers are concerned: they
never used one.
</P>
<P>
   If they had, they might have wound up thinking ``same'' rather
than different. Those who created this campaign may not have so
intended, but they invite us to remember that all the greatest
thoughts were thought before there were computers. For that matter,
the scientific insights and engineering principles that are
embodied in the computer itself were discovered before computers
existed.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Wiener, a founding father of information technology,
believed that the computer was our chance to make ``the human use
of human beings.'' He may have had certain forms of secretarial
drudgery in mind: memos, records, reports, inventories. Computers
are good at all that.
</P>
<P>
   But he surely did not think that great literature, significant
thought and true education needed computational technology. As
``Shakespeare in Love'' reminds us, our cultural heritage comes
down to us from men and women who needed no machines to think with,
but only the resources of their own naked minds working upon deeply
pondered experience _ and beyond that, perhaps a sharpened feather
to scrawl those thoughts on any waiting surface.

   Ebert _ and Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   Star-Telegram film critic Elvis Mitchell is among the guest
hosts named to fill in for the late Gene Siskel on the movie-review
show that Siskel shared with Roger Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is also the longtime movie reviewer for National
Public Radio's ``Weekend Edition,'' will tape the show with Ebert
in Chicago next week. It will air at 10:45 p.m. March 14
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shales, who reviews television for The Washington Post and
movies for National Public Radio, has taped two programs with
Ebert. Joel Siegel, the movie critic for ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' has also agreed to do an episode.
</P>
<P>
   Shales, who taped two episodes before Siskel's death, has said
that he doesn't want to continue in the slot permanently.
</P>
<P>
   No co-host has been named for March 21. Although Siegel has been
confirmed as a fill-in, his air date has yet to be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   No plans have been set to have Ebert do the show alone, the
spokeswoman said, because Buena Vista wants two reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the format: two people debating about movies,'' the
spokeswoman said. ``Although in the past, Roger has done two shows
on his own. For scheduling reasons then, we were unable to have
someone else with him. But our goal is to have a series of guest
critics until the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The season ends in August.

A NEW `ANNIE,' THE SAME OLD BERLIN MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March 14) 
(bl) 
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irving Berlin, born Israel Baline, was 5 when his
family emigrated from Byelorussia to the United States in 1893 and
settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. By 1910 he was an
established Tin Pan Alley songwriter. The following year, with his
first great success, ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' his career as
America's premier composer and lyricist took off and never
seriously faltered for much of the rest of the century.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of his death in 1989 at 101, he had moved
chameleonlike through the ragtime, jazz and swing eras, absorbing
and learning as he went, turning out songs in every conceivable pop
style. He had also created some of the most enduring Broadway and
movie scores ever written. George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter,
Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, and Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein
all shaped American popular music in their own ways. Yet no single
mind mastered as much of the popular American musical idiom, for so
long with such an unaffected wit and elegance, as Irving Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the romantic pessimism of ``Let's Face the Music and
Dance,'' the gung-ho patriotism of ``God Bless America,'' the
nimble soft-shoe satire of ``A Couple of Swells,'' the contrapuntal
bliss of ``(I Wonder Why) You're Just in Love,'' the double-edged
sentimentality of ``White Christmas,'' the disenchanted doughboy
comedy of ``Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning'' and the Dom
Perignon fizz of ``Top Hat, White Tie and Tails.''
</P>
<P>
   How Berlin did it remains forever mysterious. He grew up in a
home where Yiddish was spoken. He had no more than a few years of
schooling. Words, with all of their associative connections, seem
to have come to him as easily as the melodies he conceived without
formal musical training. He gave status to the vernacular. Further,
he was plugged into the temper and tempo of the decades. Possibly
because he felt himself to be an outsider, he saw and heard the
world around him with a clarity denied the rest of us. The American
experience was sunlight to his talent.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, Berlin had his humiliating flops, but when
he was finally bested, it was only by time: he gave changing
fashions a longer run for their money than anyone else on the
American entertainment scene.
</P>
<P>
   This is the context that makes the new production of ``Annie Get
Your Gun,'' directed by Graciela Daniele and starring the exquisite
Bernadette Peters, now at the Marquis Theater, such an engaging and
welcome theatrical event.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that you'll suddenly forget the robust,
inimitable Ethel Merman, who originated the role of Annie Oakley in
the 1946 production. I mean only that Ms. Peters, who looks like a
wasp-waisted kewpie doll, can be just as implacably funny and as
fully audible as Merman, though in her own deceptively fragile way.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret that Peter Stone has revised the original Herbert and
Dorothy Fields book to make it less offensive to minorities. The
jokes at the expense of American Indians were never that great
anyway, nor was ``I'm an Indian, Too,'' a Berlin patter song that
has been cut from this production. Notable mostly for the number of
tribal names it squeezes into a very short space, ``I'm an Indian,
Too'' isn't missed from a score that is otherwise rich with vintage
Berlin contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly less felicitous is the introduction of an interracial
romance as a subplot: the love of a youngman, who is half-Indian
and half-white, and a young woman who is all white. Though it
doesn't impede the show, it does seem an extremely half-hearted
attempt to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   If political correctness has not diluted the show's charm, it
also has not noticeably enriched the humor of the book. This
remains a perfectly serviceable, hugely idealized tale suggested by
the real-life story of Annie Oakley and her romance with Frank
Butler, her co-star in Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show in the
1880s.
</P>
<P>
   As conceived by the Fields writing team, Annie is an illiterate
country girl whose spectacular marksmanship creates a rivalry with
Frank that nearly wrecks not only their lives but also Cody's
traveling show. Though ``Annie Get Your Gun'' concludes with their
marriage, it clearly points the way to what would happen later in
real life: Frank Butler retired from performing to become his
wife's manager and assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Get Your Gun'' was initially the idea of Dorothy Fields
who, with her brother Herbert, planned to write the show's lyrics
as well as its book. Rodgers and Hammerstein were to produce,
Jerome Kern to compose the music, Joshua Logan to direct and Merman
to star. When Kern died of a stroke just before work was to begin,
Berlin was brought in. Because Berlin insisted on writing his own
lyrics, the Fields team agreed to stay on to do only the book.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Berlin was not eager to do ``a situation show,'' which
is what he called the integrated musical, or musical play, that had
been newly defined in 1943 by the success of ``Oklahoma!'' Yet he
adapted himself to the demands of the project and, without apparent
effort, produced a score that was probably as integrated as any
true musical comedy up to then, with the exception of ``On the
Town.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Get Your Gun'' is a glorious bridge between the old era
and the new. In all technical ways it is an integrated musical. But
Berlin's music and lyrics _ while defining characters and
situations sometimes sweetly, sometime hilariously _ have all of
the light-hearted charm of the kind of musical that refuses to take
itself too seriously. The score also includes a marvelous ``new''
number, ``An Old-Fashioned Wedding,'' which Berlin wrote for the
1966 revival at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Play a Simple Melody,'' which he had written in 1914 for
the show ``Watch Your Step'' and ``(I Wonder Why) You're Just in
Love'' from the score of ``Call Me Madam'' (1950), ``An
Old-Fashioned Wedding'' is a lilting, comic two-part song. Placed
in the the second act of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' it more or less
spells out the future of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Butler.
</P>
<P>
   While Frank, who has described his wifely ideal in ``The Girl
That I Marry'' in the first act, repeats those sentiments in even
more chauvinistic terms, Annie, singing in counterpoint, offers her
own vision of what their marriage will be like, if and when it ever
takes place. The number is the highlight of this new production, as
sung by Ms. Peters and her excellent leading man, Tom Wopat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, most of the show's familiar numbers, which have since
become standards, are also very fine: ``They Say It's Wonderful,''
``My Defenses Are Down,'' ``Lost in His Arms,'' ``I Got the Sun in
the Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   I even like the placing of the classic Berlin anthem ``There's
No Business Like Show Business'' at the top of the show, where it
is begun by Wopat, a cappella and almost mournfully, before he is
joined by the rest of the company and the full orchestra for its
rousing conclusion. The way that ``Annie Get Your Gun'' is now
played, the audience is seeing a show-within-a-show as Buffalo Bill
(Ron Holgate) invites the audience to watch the true story of the
legendary Annie Oakley and Frank Butler.
</P>
<P>
   This conceit is more or less forgotten as the musical continues,
but it helps to explain Tony Walton's handsome unit set, a big-top
tent where all the action is set, no matter what the locale.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's comic songs ``Doin' What Comes Natur'lly,'' ``Anything
You Can Do (I Can Do Better)'' and ``You Can't Get a Man With a
Gun'' demonstrate his easy way with the racy, 1940s-style doubles
entendres. Sample: ``A man's not so hot/ When he's shot/ Oh, you
can't get a man with a gun.'' They also have a way of settling in
your mind and refusing to leave; like happy houseguests, they stay
on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   There is never any doubt that Ms. Peters is the star of the
show, though she receives superb support from Wopat, best known for
his role in the television series ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' Though
he has also appeared on Broadway in ``I Love My Wife,'' ``City of
Angels'' and ``Guys and Dolls,'' his easy stage manner and fine
singing voice seem to come into their own in this production. His
Frank Butler is stalwart, ruggedly handsome and self-assured in a
laid-back manner that enchants the awkward Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny creature that she is, Ms. Peters is the big, grandly comic
stage presence that keeps ``Annie Get Your Gun'' on track. Looking
like a dream, with or without smudges on her face, she has
authority and humor that can't be faked. One can even hear in her
gorgeous singing voice the thin line of resonant brass I associate
with the voices of the kids who performed on the old ``Horn and
Hardart Children's Hour.'' Ms. Peters was apparently 5 when she
appeared on the show to give an imitation of Sophie Tucker. An
imitation? Those kids were incubi who could assume any identity
they chose. There is still a little of Sophie Tucker to be enjoyed
in Ms. Peters' performance here, especially in her timing and
control, which are irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   What there is of the choreography devised by Ms. Daniele and
Jeff Calhoun is so attractive that one would appreciate more. There
is a certain parsimoniousness about this physical production _ the
costumes and lighting, in particular _ that I hesitate to mention,
in part because of the high cost of staging any musical show these
days. Also because the production is so ingratiating, I don't want
to sound like a scold. A major bonus: the amplification system
seems to have been devised by people who feel no need to establish
their credentials by blasting the audience into the next world.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, ``Annie Get Your Gun'' returns Irving Berlin to
Broadway, where he belongs. He is more than a theater treasure. He
is a national resource.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In Paris the day's runway shows are broadcast each night
on television like basketball games in America. The Chambre
Syndicale, French fashion's organizing body, is the NBA, Yves Saint
Laurent is Michael Jordan, and Alber Elbaz is the upstart brought
in to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Each night without fail, Marie-Christiane Marek calls the day's
plays with speed and finesse.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the French take their fashion seriously. And there's
no more serious business here right now than the first Yves Saint
Laurent collection by Elbaz, who worked for Geoffrey Beene and Guy
Laroche before being hired to make Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear
relevant again. Ms. Marek devoted almost her full hour to his
collection last night. Elbaz looked terrified.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in America, ``Cut the guy some slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Deneuve did. ``It was a beautiful homage to Yves Saint
Laurent,'' she said after the show. ``It's a very difficult
exercise to design for someone who is still there, and Yves Saint
Laurent is still doing the couture.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Berge, the chairman of the YSL Groupe, did, too. ``I'm
very happy,'' he said. ``I made the right choice.'' Saint Laurent
was not around to give his blessing; he is sunning in Morocco,
Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he had his own private viewing of the collection a
week ago, and approved. ``I'm happy because Saint Laurent is
happy,'' said Elbaz, who was in danger of being crushed by
photographers descending on him backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz took the wise path of producing a collection that was sort
of the greatest hits of Yves Saint Laurent, as sung by Alber Elbaz.
There was the masterly trench coat, now tied with a thin cord; the
infamous groundbreaking sheer chiffon blouse; the fur chubbies that
Tom Ford has redone so well at Gucci; the bold color mixes like an
orange sweater with pink satin skirt, and, of course, ``le
smoking,'' Saint Laurent's signature style of evening dress, done
in black tuxedo pants suits and trouser shorts.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Elbaz must be allowed to design free of the need
to pay homage to the master. The House of Saint Laurent's public
face is fading fast. The designer is no longer his former self, a
fact made startlingly clear a few years ago when a British
documentary, ``Look,'' caught Saint Laurent backstage emptying a
can of hair spray onto his coiffure, while his staff prepared for
his show, oblivious, or perhaps sadly accustomed, to the decline of
a master.
</P>
<P>
   Far too young to start falling apart, John Galliano made a
sudden wraithlike appearance on the runway, which was as startling
as his unconvincing hodgepodge for Christian Dior. Galliano
possesses a sensitivity and romanticism that he breathes into his
designs. But there's a point, which he reached with undue haste in
this show, when romanticism turns mawkish.
</P>
<P>
   Like a tin-eared conductor, Galliano would send out a look in
perfect pitch _ a slither of gold in a satin gown with trapunto
stitched collar and bow _ only to follow it with a cacophonous
clunker.
</P>
<P>
   Notable in their discord were the teal green knit skirts and
suffocating sweaters with huge unflattering collars. Teal, as is
well known, is never an easy color except for painting trim. One
draped pair of overalls with wide legs in Galliano's collection was
one too many. Women don't want to look like schoolgirls, just
youthful.
</P>
<P>
   Yohji Yamamoto distanced himself this season from the dramatic
romanticism he helped usher into vogue. Paradoxically, on runways
from here to America, it's all Yohji all the time. Some designers
copy him well and some less well, and Junya Watanabe was one of the
former, unveiling a beautiful collection unabashedly inspired by
Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a through-line from the aggression of his work in the
mid-'90s to the feminine flow of the collection he showed Tuesday,
Watanabe expertly folded the neckline of a sweater so it was more
than just a T-shirt. Neoprene shifts were treated to heavy dollops
of elegance with couture-like seaming or jet beading and
embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   The delight spread to silver-handled handbags that converted to
jackets and water-washed prints in simple, innocent shifts. In so
obviously evoking another designer, Watanabe, normally a proven
innovator, has less to lose than some others whose collections are
habitually more derivative.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Yamamoto volleyed back with relaxed masculine
suits cut boldly in navy or black with full trousers or a long
skirt. Yamamoto sometimes covered them with funereal coats. The
look recalled his work of the late '70s and early '80s when Miles
Davis, fashion plate, cut a dash in Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly languid, Martin Margiela's collection for Hermes was a
slow meander through a meadow. Only a retailer like Phil Miller,
chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, would look at the models strolling
down the runway and say they brought to mind women strolling down
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his imagination, Miller probably saw them going into Saks to
buy more Hermes. But wait. Saks doesn't sell Hermes clothes. And
that's OK Miller has plenty of Zoran.
</P>
<P>
   Quite clearly, this is the same customer, and there are more
spawned every day, as more and more baby boomers who would rather
take a pass on tight-fitting clothes turn 50. The Hermes collection
included an oatmeal knit vest and alpaca drawstring pants,
mushroom-colored lambskin trousers and a long cashmere pullover _
Margiela called it ``comfort cashmere.''
</P>
<P>
   For a balancing taste of exuberance, look to Marc Jacobs in his
third Louis Vuitton collection.If Jacobs has any say in the matter,
international style will soon come to be equated with Louis
Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   Witty and fresh, the collection included Vuitton logo blankets
as hooded coats, black and white furs as luxuriously funky parkas,
trousers with Margiela-esque references like side plackets, and
others, all of Jacobs' making, that unsnapped over the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   An international bon vivant must of course be able to change
looks depending on the continent, and Vuitton sweaters came with
detachable turtlenecks and sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Creepy is the best word to describe an utterly different
movement afoot in Paris, which may change the way we look at
fashion in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Led by newcomers like Olivier Theyskens (think of Madonna's
scary Oscar dress last year), Veronique Branquinho and Raf Simons,
the trend toward Goth looks has found added strength in Ocimar
Versolato, Dries Van Noten and to a lesser degree Ennio Capasa for
Costume National.
</P>
<P>
   Dark and moody, its ominous overtones are slapped over a veneer
of innocence. Like vampires in search of eternal life, Goth is
determined to see the light of day. The mysterious millennium finds
an unexpected voice in these clothes, sweeping black coats, long
dresses and black leather.
</P>
<P>
   Theyskens' view of the world extends to pale models stalking in
precipitous high-heel boots, coats expertly slashed up the sides
over black leather jeans so tight it would not be wrong to call
them leggings.
</P>
<P>
   How Versolato, of all people, once known for doing drop-dead
sexy, came to embrace an esthetic of ugly glamour will remain one
of fashion's great mysteries. He showed long black dresses in
feathered mohair, or leather with sheer turtlenecks in feathered
mohair, or loose sweaters with black skirts. Finishing everything
were futuristic-looking Wellingtons in black suede or white
leather, the models' long, blow-dried hair adding a paradoxically
carefree note to an ominous mood.
</P>
<P>
   At Costume National, Capasa continued changes he had introduced
last season. But now, so much of his work was in black. Jackets
were cut away to reveal a navel; fur was used in ruffian ways, as a
sporty vest or a sexy raw-edged skirt. Newest and best here, in
this spotty outing, was the idea of the back as erogenous zone.
</P>
<P>
   Daringly, Capasa cut knits into halter sweaters that scooped
down into the very small of the back, and trousers that revealed
the buttocks' cleavage, or others that sat precariously just above
it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as observers wonder how on earth young men keep their
oversize jeans from falling off their hips to their ankles, the
same question will arise for these tight curvy versions.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increasing breezes from the southeast will begin to draw moist
air northward from the Gulf of Mexico Thursday. As the moist air is
forced to ascend up and over a front, scattered heavy showers will
blossom over eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, and the lower
Mississippi Valley. Isolated thunderstorms will also erupt,
especially near the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coasts, where the air
is especially humid. Farther north in the colder air, a period of
sleet or snow will occur in northern Oklahoma and western Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of snow will accompany a jet stream disturbance crossing
the interior Southwest. The snow will be locally heavy in the
mountains of northern Arizona, southeast Utah and western Colorado,
where over six inches of new snow could accumulate by evening. As
the disturbance presses farther east, moderate to heavy snow will
develop later Thursday night over eastern Colorado and northeast
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Generally dry and cool conditions will cover an expansive area
from the Middle West to the Middle Atlantic States. Sinking air
currents associated with high pressure nosing south from Canada
will promote partly to mostly sunny skies across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine will cover the Great Lakes and southern New
England regions Thursday, but a band of moisture pin-wheeling about
a low near Nova Scotia will promote clouds and snow showers over
the mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, sunshine will be dimmed by high clouds near the
Southeast Coast, while Florida stays mainly sunny and seasonably
warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: D.C. Snow
</P>
<P>
   The snow drought in Washington, D.C. ended on Tuesday when 8.4
inches of snow were measured at Reagan National Airport. Last
winter, a mere 0.1 inches of snow were recorded, and, until
Tuesday's storm, only 2.9 inches of snow had been measured this
winter. The average winter snowfall in Washington, D.C. is 18
inches. There have been huge swings in snowfall in the 1990s. The
0.1 inches of snow that fell during the winter of 1997-98 tied as
the least snowiest season on record, but the 46 inches of snow that
were measured during the winter of 1995-96 ranked as the snowiest
this century. &QL;

 &HT;    WEAPONS LABS IGNORED 10 YEARS OF WARNINGS ON SECURITY LAPSES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Security at U.S. weapons labs, now the center of a
major espionage probe, has been lax for more than a decade,
prompting repeated warnings from government investigators that were
unheeded until recently.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of reports, secret briefings and public testimony
going back to 1988, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has told
Congress and top administrative officials that nuclear secrets were
at risk from the thousands of foreigners who visit the
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, as he fired a scientist
Tuesday suspected of leaking secrets to China from the laboratory
at Los Alamos, N.M., pointed to upgraded counter-intelligence teams
and tighter procedures ordered a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also tried to allay concerns _ and shift
the blame _ when he told CNN this week that a presidential
directive ``fixed problems that we had inherited, and changed and
vastly improved the security procedures in the national laboratory
system.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a chief investigator of the labs said Wednesday that
``it's very unlikely'' that the new safeguards have corrected more
than a decade of inattention to glaring security problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good first step, although I think it's long overdue,''
said Keith O. Fultz, assistant comptroller at the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House Science Committee asked the GAO this week to begin an
assessment of the new security measures at the weapons labs, which
include Los Alamos and the Sandia laboratories in New Mexico and
the Lawrence Livermore laboratory in California.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1997, the accounting office found serious lapses in
security, which had followed a pattern since the mid-1980s. Among
the disclosures:
</P>
<P>
   _ Six boxes of papers marked ``sensitive materials'' in red
letters were left in an open hallway in 1997 at a Los Alamos
facility to which foreign visitors had access.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also at Los Alamos, foreign visitors as late as 1997 were
allowed to roam unescorted through buildings after work hours, ``to
preserve what one official described as an open 'campus atmosphere'
for researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Although procedures called for background checks before
admission of visitors from communist and other potentially
unfriendly nations, the Energy Department in 1988 checked out fewer
than 10 percent of the 500 visitors in this category. FBI checks of
visitors found that some were suspected foreign agents, although
the exact number is a classified secret.
</P>
<P>
   _ The follow-up investigation in 1997 found that more than 1,800
visitors from ``sensitive'' countries such as China, India and
Russia visited the three weapons labs, but most underwent no
background investigations. At Los Alamos and Sandia, less than 5
percent were checked. At Livermore, about 40 percent were checked.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department in both 1988 and in 1997 agreed with
findings by the GAO and has issued plans to tighten security for
the program, which is aimed at encouraging international exchange
by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In February of last year, President Clinton issued an order to
tighten up controls of the foreign visitor program. The Energy
Department has doubled its budget for countering spying and has
instituted more security checks and the use of polygraphs for lab
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman Stu Nagurka said the new policy is that all
visitors from sensitive countries will be cleared by the FBI and
CIA as not being identified with espionage. ``That's our goal,'' he
said. He also said that the weapons labs have a policy that ``no
visitors are allowed within the secured part of the complex''
unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   Fultz said that he could not yet assess whether these measures
would work immediately. ``It will take a while to change the
culture, the procedures and the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that the Department of Energy, from the late
1980s until very, very recently, has not taken serious enough
actions on this very significant issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``They're working on it.''

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wendell Burnette's first building, a house for himself at the
edge of the Sonoran desert, has graced the covers of numerous
international magazines. The British magazine Architectural Review
proclaimed him ``one to watch in 1998'' and Metropolitan Home
recently named him one of ``21 Rising Stars for the 21st Century.''
A 36-year-old architect from Phoenix, he has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Or has he? The only job his office has right now is a small
remodeling project; he can't remember when he last paid himself,
and he can barely maintain a payroll for his one trusty employee.
``The irony is that there are all these accolades,'' Burnette said
on a cell phone last week as he drove to a potential project site
at 7 a.m., ``and at the same time, I'm wondering where the next
meal is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Berkeley, Calif., Ralph Nelson and Raveevarn
Choksombatchal, both 37, who were married in 1989, have shared an
architectural practice called Loom for six years. Their combined
curriculum vitae is 12 pages long, but it wasn't until they
received a Progressive Architecture award last year that people
began returning their calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent 10 years becoming an overnight success,'' Nelson
said, adding that teaching stints kept the firm afloat. ``Savings?
What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Burnette's practice and Loom are among eight architecture firms
selected as ``Emerging Voices'' of 1999 by the Architectural League
of New York, a nonprofit organization that has sponsored public
programs in architecture since 1881. But rising stars need more
than a winning way with a T-square _ or a CAD program _ to make a
name for themselves. The simplest projects require a fanatical
commitment and Job-like patience. For those struggling to
distinguish themselves, ``the will to be independent overrides all
sensible decisions'' about life and gainful employment, Nelson
said, gamely.
</P>
<P>
   The League's winners offer a telling glimpse of the state of
architecture _ a mirror of the built world of today and a window
onto the next century. Drawing inspiration from sources as
unexpected as the extreme shapes assumed by materials distorted by
stress, or as poetic as the play of light in a Cartier-Bresson
photograph, these eight firms, for all their travails, are shaping
the future in ways that are strikingly individual but also
surprisingly in synch.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every significant architect who came of age in the
last two decades, including Steven Holl, Tod Williams and Billie
Tsien, Deborah Berke, and Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson
has been an Emerging Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the year he was selected (1982), Steven Holl, who
comes from Seattle, said: ``Here I was, an architect basically
coming out of the woods to New York. And they chose me. It gave me
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerging Voices is incredibly important, and not for crass
reasons of career advancement,'' he continued, ``because it
acknowledges and respects the ideas swirling around in the heads of
young architects.''
</P>
<P>
   An interest in the physical world, with all its warts and
wonders, distinguishes one group of winners. Call them the New
Sensualists: they're less interested in the eye-catching photogenic
image of a building, more in how it feels to the touch, or sounds
beneath the foot.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are the Philosophers, exploring
ideas that straddle the worlds of theory and practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an intensity of design, a commitment to new
technologies and a passion about detail and materiality in all
their work,'' said Craig Conyk, a New York architect, who served on
the Architectural League's selection committee. ``It's a very
healthy sign for architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   In a multi-generational house the Loom team designed in Bangkok,
for instance, a rosewood and teak staircase rings as resonantly as
a music box, and concrete walls overlap to create openings that
weave sunlight into each room.
</P>
<P>
   For Ada Tolla and Giuseppe Lignano of Lotek in New York, the
future means embracing discarded industrial and consumer products,
turning oil cans into armchairs, detergent bottles into lamps. In a
penthouse, they've made a sun-filled bedroom on the roof out of a
truck body, and they divided a loft into living and working spaces
with a wall made of one sheared side of a 40-foot-long aluminum
shipping container. What makes that space so intriguingly efficient
is the way the sink and refrigerator are embedded in the room
divider, in a manner that recalls Jean Cocteau's anatomical
candelabra in ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Brian Healy in Boston, who grew up surrounded by
cornfields in Bucks County, Pa., only to watch them give way to
subdivisions and strip malls, that experience of transition left
him with a desire to ``make buildings that tap into a place,'' even
as it changes. Healy, 42, is designing a modern writer's and
artist's studio in the Catskills, with references back to the Arts
and Crafts movement, a powerful design force there in the late 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Burnette, who has a naturalist's love of desert geology, applies
an artist's abstraction to his designs, inspired in part by James
Turrell and Richard Serra.
</P>
<P>
   He based his design for a decorator's studio and showroom in
Scottsdale, Ariz., on two mesquite trees in the courtyard. Instead
of cutting them down, as others had proposed, he wove the trees and
the building together, cutting notches in the masonry walls to
frame the trees and let them grow.
</P>
<P>
   A self-taught architect who went to work at Frank Lloyd Wright's
Taliesin right out of high school, Burnette aims for rich spatial
and textural experiences. Passage through the decorator's studio is
labyrinthine: one climbs past several levels that appear to float
free of the structure and, at one point, are illuminated by a scrim
of Indian onyx so thin that sunlight passing through casts a golden
glow on an oak staircase.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in doing many things with one stroke,'' Burnette
said, comparing his work to Cartier-Bresson's photography, as it
captures and distills a singular moment in space and time.
</P>
<P>
   The tension in the work of Kevin Daly, 41, and Chris Genik, 39,
in Santa Monica, Calif., oscillates between technological invention
and hands-on craft. High-performance technologies get them going,
but so does the chance to work side by side with woodworkers and
metalsmiths. For instance, a house in Canada for Genik's parents
bursts like a crystal from a massive pile of boulders. Ten years on
the job and still fascinated by clients who dream of the
impossible, Daly and Genik are interested in ``finding the
extraordinary in the very familiar.'' They look for inspiration in
the seamless craftsmanship of the physical world _ from a World War
II plywood and glue airplane to a tiny 1,000-year-old reliquary
covered in gold that bears no trace of tool marks.
</P>
<P>
   While an appeal to the senses and to found objects animates the
work of the New Sensualists, the Philosophers, like Asymptote, Evan
Douglis and Michael Bell, are investigating ways of building that
seem radical today but may well become the traditions of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Hani Rashid, 40, and Lise Anne Couture, 39, of Asymptote utilize
the most advanced computer technologies to create a kind of space
that exists simultaneously in the real world _ ``first-reality
architecture,'' Rashid calls it _ and in virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   From their Asymptote office in New York, in Soho's fanciful
wrought-iron Singer Building (and their home in the loft next
door), Rashid and Ms. Couture are ``set on running all our credit
cards into the ground'' to realize the objective of designing at
the edge of reality through such commissions as a
computer-generated theater of operations at the New York Stock
Exchange, which opened Monday. Recently, they designed a showroom
for a research company in Kyoto, Japan, to showcase new computer
technologies in the hush of a museum-like setting, complete with a
black box theater.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Douglis has been on his own since 1991. He has yet to find
a client entirely tuned into his ideas about the poetry of
architecture. ``Early on, I rejected building at any cost,''
Douglis, 39, said at his office in a warehouse in New York's
Chelsea area. ``It wasn't necessarily my best move.'' Luckily, the
architect, as director of the Columbia University Architecture
Galleries, has been able to commission himself to design
installations. Borrowing from military technology for
quick-assembly bridges, he suggests an alternative to solidity
itself: why not a wall made from weather balloons caged in steel?
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 38, lives and works in Houston, dividing his time between
running his firm (six employees when there's work) and teaching at
Rice University. He hopes to combine his theoretical interests ``in
the sheer brutality of economic forces'' with an active commercial
practice that gets things built. Most recently, he was the curator
of a gallery exhibition in Houston, ``16 Houses: Owning a House in
the City,'' which has turned into a commission from Houston's Fifth
Ward Community Redevelopment Corp. to build his entry in the show.
</P>
<P>
   His is not necessarily a pretty house. At 900 square feet, the
design reminded one local critic of two boomerangs squeezed back to
back. All the walls are made of off-the-rack sliding-glass doors to
make the point that we all lead transparent lives. The house, which
will cost $74,000 or $52,000 with federal vouchers, was chosen
along with others in the exhibition to be built later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a breakthrough I'm excited about,'' said Bell,
who has endured seven clients in seven years who he says
``chickened out'' at the last possible minute. (One client, he
said, lost interest when the architect couldn't squeeze the cost of
a design down to $36 a square foot, from $38.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointments of the past, and uncertainty that
the housing project will truly happen (``Everyday, I wait for
someone to say it's dead,'' he said), Bell wants to keep designing
houses. After all, he added, houses are ``how we imagine ourselves
participating in the life of the city and the world.''

<P>
   Trying to attach furring strips or other wood members to a
concrete surface might seem like a difficult, almost impossible
task. There are, however, a number of fasteners available today
that make the job easier. Having the right fastener is only part of
the job. You also need to use the right tools. Ordinary woodworking
tools are too light, and steel drill bits are too soft for concrete
work.
</P>
<P>
   Your tool kit should also include safety gear: goggles,
heavy-duty gloves to shield your hands from flying chips of stone,
and ear protection when using power tools.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest and simplest method of securing a piece of wood to
concrete is by nailing it in place. Obviously you cannot use
ordinary nails for this, but there are heavy-shank, hardened nails
that will penetrate masonry. There are two types of masonry nails:
cut masonry nails and hardened concrete nails. Choosing one type
over the other is largely a matter of trial-and-error, since
performance varies with each job.
</P>
<P>
   The nails should be long enough to penetrate at least 3/4 inch
into the concrete. Shorter nails won't hold, and longer ones may
not penetrate all the way. Whichever type of nail you use, you'll
need a four-pound hammer to drive them. These nails are difficult
to drive into hard concrete and they tend to work loose over time,
so they should only be used for temporary fastenings.
</P>
<P>
   For a more permanent attachment, it is best to choose a fastener
that is driven into a predrilled hole. These fasteners fit into two
basic categories: nails or screws, and expansion fasteners. Nails
and screws have a slightly larger diameter than the drilled hole
and must be driven in place with either a hammer or a screwdriver.
Expansion fasteners, on the other hand, have a smaller diameter
than the hole and expand to grip the surrounding concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Use a carbide-tipped drill bit to bore the hole. Depending on
the number of holes, their diameter, and the hardness of the
concrete, you may be able to use your 1/4- or 3/8-inch drill for
boring the holes. You can, for example, drill six 1/8-inch holes
with a standard 1/4-inch drill, but if you have to bore that many
1/2-inch holes in hard concrete, it may be better to rent either a
1/2-inch drill or a hammer drill.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer drills look similar to ordinary heavy-duty drills, but
they are fitted with a hammer-action mechanism that converts rotary
motion into percussive blows. They can deliver 500 blows per second
as the drilling progresses. You must use special percussion drill
bits for this operation.
</P>
<P>
   Nails and concrete screws are slightly larger than the hole that
they are inserted in. As they penetrate into the hole, they bite
into the surrounding concrete to hold fast. When attaching a board
to concrete, the length of the nail should be twice that of the
board's thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion fasteners, on the other hand, have an expansion sleeve
_ made of metal or plastic _ that slides into the hole. Within the
sleeve is a screw or bolt that expands the sleeve as it is
tightened. The expanded sleeve wedges against the sides of the hole
to hold fast.
</P>
<P>
   When attaching a board to concrete, select an expansion fastener
that is twice as long as the board's thickness. As the bolt is
tightened, it will extend past the tip of the fastener, so drill
the hole an extra 1/4-inch deep. One advantage that expansion
fasteners have over nails is that they can be tightened if the
board becomes loose.
</P>
<P>
   Professional builders often use air-powered or powder-actuated
tools to drive hardened nails into concrete. The air-powered tools
are hooked up to a compressor. The powder tools, sometimes called
stud guns, use a small charge of explosive powder to drive the nail
in place. These tools can quickly drive a nail through a thick
board into the concrete. In addition to being fast and powerful,
they can be dangerous. The do-it-yourselfer should steer clear of
them unless fully acquainted with all operational procedures and
safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use construction adhesive to glue boards to a
concrete wall. The adhesive is available in standard-sized
cartridges that load into a caulking gun. For lightweight boards a
1/4-inch wide bead is sufficient, but for heavier pieces or for
very rough surfaces use more. Surface preparation is important to
insure a good bond. Both surfaces should be clean, dry and free of
loose paint. The boards must be held in place until the adhesive
has time to set. For this reason, many builders prefer to use the
adhesive in conjunction with another type of fastener: the adhesive
acts as a damper to absorb vibrations that may loosen a mechanical
fastener and the fastener holds the boards until the adhesive sets.

FINDING SOLACE (AND NUTRITION) IN THE SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Few outdoor activities offer easier opportunities
for intimacy than cross-country skiing or snowshoeing. Privacy
comes quickly away from groomed trails.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only minutes to get far enough from the frenzied crowds
to feel alone amid snow-draped pines and stark brush. Bird,
squirrel and deer tracks signal that other living souls have been
here recently, the sorts of creatures you are happy to interact
with on a winter afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But if you haven't packed properly for this outing, you will rue
the day. Plenty of water and high-energy snacks are absolutely
essential for a memorable Nordic adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Davis, assistant manager at Eastern Mountain Sports in
Albany, is a cross-country ski enthusiast. Packing the right foods
for a weekend outing, he says, is just as important as including a
map and compass in your backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to bring food _ it's one of the
essentials,'' Davis says. ``In fact, we tell people it's really not
safe to go cross-country skiing without food. You never know how
long you'll end up being outside, and it's important to keep your
energy level up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustenance, not elegance, is the goal. Davis and other experts
advise skiers to be sure to include high-energy snacks like trail
mix, or gorp, as well as fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Another cardinal rule is to leave wine and other spirits at
home, no matter how romantic the image of a decanter of zinfandel
as the centerpiece of a winter picnic might be. Because alcohol
dilates the capillaries of the skin, more body heat is lost when it
is consumed. This can lead to chilling, loss of energy and,
possibly, hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   While water is essential for maintaining hydration, Davis often
carries only one liter and relies on the snow to refill his
container.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis knows he will be on the trail for several hours or
longer, he packs a single-burner stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to heat up soups that I made the night before,'' he
says. ``Sometimes we bring rice so we can stick it in the soup for
extra starch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also use the stove to whip up some hot drinks, like
hot cocoa. Some of us get wacky and make hot Tang. It's not very
appetizing, but it's a hot drink.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a Thermos usually works just as well as a camping stove
and weighs less. It is a fine receptacle for soups or hot drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Woods and Gordon Hardy, authors of ``Cross Country Skier's
Trailside Guide,'' advocate carbohydrates and simple sugars over
heavy, high-bulk foods that take hours to process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some foods are so classic for day tours as to be almost de
rigeur: fresh or dried fruit, cheese, bread, and crackers are all
favored,'' they wrote, ``along with some sweet treats like
chocolate (be careful no to overdo chocolate; it's loaded with fat
and can cause stomach cramps when you're exercising).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuts and seeds are great, of course, along with cut-up
vegetables, smoked meats, and peanut butter with jam. Try what you
like: Your menu is limited only by your imagination and willingness
to make lunch a special stop.''
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible to have it all _ privacy, good nutrition
and elegance _ on a cross-country sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a relatively easy recipe for trail mix, or gorp, that
will keep you going all day long. Just remember to pack water, too,
and the peace be with you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GORDY'S GORP
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 16)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chocolate or carob bits
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped almonds
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cashews
</P>
<P>
   1 cup salted peanuts (or unsalted Spanish peanuts)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sunflower seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped, dried apricots
</P>
<P>
   2 cups raisins (or currants)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped dried apples
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup flaked coconut, if desired
</P>
<P>
   2 cups oats
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup maple syrup or honey
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, blend oats, oil and maple syrup. Spread on a
cookie sheet and bake in oven at 275, turning occasionally. When
oats are crisp (about 45 minutes), remove, and cool. Mix with
remaining ingredients. This recipe makes enough gorp for 16 skiers,
and it may be reduced proportionally.

GORE, LAWMAKERS PUSH FOR AIRLINE PASSENGER BILL OF RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers and consumers unleashed a barrage of
criticism against the airline industry Wednesday with complaints
ranging from being stuck hours on airport runways to getting wrong
or inadequate information about flights.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers warned the airlines that unless they improve their
service, Congress will impose consumer-oriented rules.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time. the Clinton administration proposed its own
``passenger bill of rights'' legislation and announced new
Department of Transportation guidelines requiring airlines to give
consumers more information about flights when they are making
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who introduced the administration plan
with Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, said the so-called
``fair treatment initiative ... empowers passengers with all the
information they need to make good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud
Shuster, R-Pa., said at a hearing of the committee's aviation
panel, ``The airlines must refocus their efforts on providing
better customer service.'' He added that the number of consumer
complaints made to the Federal Aviation Administration about
airlines rose 26 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster and other lawmakers introduced various passenger-rights
bills last month after airline passengers complained of being
forced to sit on airport runways for up to nine hours after a
January snowstorm in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   A similar horror tale was told Wednesday by Patricia Shank of
Frederick, Md., who said she was confined for nine hours that month
on a London-bound Virgin Atlantic plane that never took off from
Washington's Dulles International Airport. She said that when she
declined to take another plane the next day, the airline refused to
return her luggage, which was flown to London.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Plecas, of Walled Lake, Mich., told of being stuck in
Detroit on a Northwest Airlines plane for eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could almost reach out and touch the terminal,'' Plecas
said. ``The lavatories were overflowing and unusable. There was no
food or water. Passengers who needed to take their medication with
food and water were in a panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hopp, of Royal Oak, Mich., told of spending the night on
the airport floor in Minneapolis and then, after taking a Northwest
flight to Detroit, being stranded on the plane outside an airport
gate there for almost three hours after it landed.
</P>
<P>
   What really irked her, she said, was that she had offered to
stay in Portland, Ore., where she and her family had spent the
holidays, for a few more days when she heard of the Midwest
snowstorm. But a ticket agent had advised against the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Pearlman of Columbia, Md., said he was stuck on a plane
near a gate in St. Louis for more than two hours in good weather
last Christmas. He later learned the airline didn't have enough
employees to direct the plane to the gate because they were staging
a ``sick-out.'' Pearlman said when he asked airline personnel about
that and other delays, one answer he got was that there were
mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struck a raw nerve here,'' Shuster said. ``I can't
walk through the halls here without members and constituents
telling me their horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's legislation mirrors many provisions
contained in Shuster's bill and one authored by Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, new Department of Transportation guidelines will
require airlines to tell passengers when they are making a
reservation the name of another carrier that may actually operate a
portion of the flight. Passengers flying on United Express, for
example, are often put on planes operated by a smaller airline.
</P>
<P>
   The administration rules, which will take effect in July, will
also require airlines to tell passengers if they will have to
change planes while making a single flight. In some cases a person
may have a ticket that shows one flight number, but it may include
one or more flights.
</P>
<P>
   Under Shuster's bill, airlines would have to tell passengers why
a flight is delayed or canceled and reimburse passengers if they
are kept waiting on the ground for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Shuster and McCain-Wyden bills would require airlines,
upon request, to disclose the number of seats on a flight that are
reserved for frequent flyer awards. They would also allow
passengers to use any portion of a ticket without penalty, which
would end airline restrictions on passengers who buy two
inexpensive round-trip tickets and then use one segment of each
ticket. Passengers often find this tactic cheaper than buying one
round-trip ticket that does not require a Saturday night stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, as well as the administration proposal, would
require airlines to hold a reservation for 48 hours at the same
price, giving people time to comparison shop. Consumers are often
told they must book a flight immediately to secure a particular
price.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposal would also require airlines to
provide food and restroom facilities during flight delays and
provide information about lower-priced fares.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry originally warned that legislation could
result in higher ticket prices, but it has since softened its
criticism. Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport
Association, which represents the major airlines, said in prepared
testimony for a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Thursday that the
airlines are ``taking steps'' similar to ones outlined in the
Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House Transportation Aviation Subcommittee plans to continue
its hearings next week when it will hear from airline industry
officials.

BASEBALL That bright morning sky in the background of your favorite
player's baseball trading card might easily be the dazzling light
of Arizona spring-training sunshine. Once each spring, the players
dutifully march before the hoards still and video photographers on
picture day. It's these photos and video clips that not only grace
the ever-expanding variety of trading cards, but they also are the
ones pulled during the regular season for mugs in newspapers,
highlights on television and lineups on the jumbo video screens of
stadiums across the continent. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in
the ``S'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - On my father's Little League teams, even
the best hitters needed to learn how to lay down a sacrifice bunt.
He believed in sacrifice. He'd learned about it as a kid during the
Great Depression, and from the war, and from 45 years working three
shifts in a steel mill. Not long ago, a doctor asked him a series
of tough questions, each thrown at him like a high, hard fastball.
He never backed away from the plate. ``No,'' he said to more
needles and tubes. No to more poking. No to more prodding. Whatever
was to come, he decided to face it on his terms. And he did. By
E.J. MONTINI Story moved in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - It was my first day at the gym. Eager to
start a new habit that would shrink my butt from a couch to a love
seat, I was going to begin exercising. I had just opened my locker
and slapped on the new lock I had bought at Target the day before
when it happened. She walked by me, then headed toward a bench
across the aisle. Standing in front of me was a naked lady, fresh
from the shower. I guess I just couldn't believe it. I had never
really seen a naked lady before, except for one time when I was 5
and my mom let our hippie neighbor, Honey, take me shopping with
her and her 5-year old daughter. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in
the ``L'' category. &QL;

PULITZER-WINNING NOVELIST WRITES AND TEACHES HAPPILY EVER AFTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla.)   By BEN STEELMAN   Wilmington (N.C.) Morning Star  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Once upon a time, there was a little girl
named Alison who loved fairy tales. &UR;  &LR; As she grew up to be a famous
and successful author, she kept on reading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the first stories we hear _ historically, they're the
first stories anyone ever heard,'' said Alison Lurie in her small
office, tucked away behind the stacks in Randall Library at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington. ``The old stories are
still there, behind modern writing. Cinderella, Jack and the
Beanstalk, Humpty Dumpty all show up again and again, in different
guises.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurie teaches folklore and children's literature as Whiton
professor of American literature at Cornell University. She's also
edited the Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales for Oxford University
Press, written three collections of fairy tales and published a
witty and critically praised study of children's stories, ``Don't
Tell the Grown-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   But does she use those tales in her novels for adults?
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I don't,'' she said, ``but there are parallels.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics, for instance, caught the connection between ``The
Frog Prince'' and Lurie's ``Foreign Affairs,'' the novel that won
the Pulitzer Prize in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In that book, Vinnie Miner, a 54-year-old spinster professor,
flies to London for a semester abroad. On the jet, she's seated
next to Chuck Mumpson, a loud, middle-aged Oklahoman in a cowboy
suit, who irritates her considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, their paths keep crossing in England. Chuck
becomes first Vinnie's close friend and then her passionate lover _
the first true love of Vinnie's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turns into something better, at least in her eyes,'' Lurie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed by critic Polly Paddock Gossett as ``one of our most
gifted and astute chroniclers of the gender wars,'' Lurie is
spending a semester at the UNCW as a visiting professor, teaching a
graduate fiction workshop.
</P>
<P>
   She's living in a rented house nearby in Wrightsville Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' she said, pausing, ``in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a different way, that is, from Key West, Fla., where she's
lived part-time since 1980 and where she's set two of her nine
novels, ``The Truth About Lorin Jones'' published in 1988 and her
most recent, ``The Last Resort.'' ``It's a very small island
populated by strange people at the end of the Florida Keys,'' she
told a audience in a recent appearance at a local Barnes &AMP; Noble
book store. ``Also, Key West is a place where things can happen.
People come and go and have all sorts of adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Last Resort,'' the two adventurers are Jenny and her
husband, Wilkie, a once-famous naturalist. At Key West, Jenny, who
had been in Wilkie's shadow, blooms, taking a job and meeting new
friends _ in particular, Lee, the stunning manager of a women-only
guest house.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wilkie slips into depression and decides to drown
himself _ only to be frequently (and sometimes comically) foiled by
random events.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Resort is Lurie's first novel in a decade, ``but I've
been busy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, she published a collection of stories of the
supernatural, ``Women and Ghosts,'' edited her Oxford anthology,
published ``Don't Tell the Grown-ups'' and updated her 1981 study
of fashion, ``The Language of Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 3, 1926, in Chicago, Lurie grew up knowing she
wanted to be a writer. Her father was executive director of the
Council of Jewish Federations; her mother was an editor with The
Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie published stories and poems while she was a student at
Radcliffe College. Yet marriage and motherhood kept her preoccupied
until the late '50s, when she began to edit the plays and poems of
her friend V.R. Lang, an actress and writer who died in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, ``Love and Friendship,'' appeared in 1962. One
recurring theme has been adultery and extramarital sex, notably in
``The War Between the Tates,'' her most critically praised novel
before ``Foreign Affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plots are independent but interlinked. Characters from one
novel reappear in others.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie said she usually starts her books by making verbal
portraits of the main characters. She then works from an outline,
compiled after she knows her characters well, but added ``I move
things around'' as the story develops.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie won't discuss current projects but said, ``If I'm living
in a settled place, I try to write every day.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds time for frequent readings, often with her husband,
the novelist and folklorist Edward Hower, the author of ``Night
Train Blues,'' and ``Queen of the Silver Dollar.'' (An earlier
marriage to a professor ended in divorce in 1985).
 &UR;  &LR; Lurie emphatically denies that her books are autobiographical &UR; . &LR; 
``We're not that adventurous,'' she said.

LIVING THROUGH A RAIN DELAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sunday morning smelled like rain. On the way to Good
Samaritan Hospital I rolled down the windows and sped up, filling
the inside of the car with the air's dank perfume.
</P>
<P>
   From my father's room on the 11th floor I watched a lid of
clouds slide up from the south over the mountains, closing the
valley like a retractable dome.
</P>
<P>
   The city had gone too long with the roof open and the sky blue
and clear all the way to heaven. We needed rain.
</P>
<P>
   When it fell, though, it fell softly and for only a few minutes,
barely enough to wash the roofs of houses I could see south of the
freeway, less than a groundskeeper might spray on a dusty infield
before the start of a game.
</P>
<P>
   We'd have to wait for more. Just as, in the room on the 11th
floor, we waited.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:45 a.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 23, my dad lost the grip on his
throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   He'd had heart bypass surgery the day before and gotten through
it fine, but as doctors were removing a breathing tube from his
throat he had a stroke. It's affected his right side.
</P>
<P>
   He could no longer hold a drawing pencil, as he had so often. Or
a steering wheel. A hammer. A rosary. A grandson's hand.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pitches he threw were made during Little League
batting practice. He lobbed them in for his weaker hitters, then
added a little mustard, maybe even a curve, for those accustomed to
having their way at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It all depended on what the young player needed to improve, and
what he needed to feel good about himself.
</P>
<P>
   He started coaching baseball years before I was born, and kept
at it long after his own two sons had passed the age of Little
League eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   At a Cactus League game last year, watching a grandson lean on
an outfield fence near a professional player, he smiled and said,
``There's nothing like being at a ball field.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before World War II, he was a bow-legged infielder
with bad eyes and just enough speed to beat out a grounder now and
then.
</P>
<P>
   But he never developed the killer instinct, in baseball or in
war.
</P>
<P>
   It just wasn't in him.
</P>
<P>
   He taught batters to keep their eyes on the ball and to swing
hard (in case they hit it.)
</P>
<P>
   He taught fielders to get in front of a ground ball, even it if
scared them.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if it scared them.
</P>
<P>
   There's some pain involved in baseball, and luck, and skill.
They're all mixed in with the pleasure of the sport, the way it is
with any game, with life.
</P>
<P>
   Players on the field were ordered by my father to ``talk it up``
for the pitcher, to supply a constant stream of encouragement no
matter how many runs had been allowed.
</P>
<P>
   He'd taken a lot of hits himself in the past few weeks. My
brother and I, and the rest of his family, kept talking it up, just
as he'd taught us.
</P>
<P>
   On my father's teams, even the best hitters needed to learn how
to lay down a sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   He believed in sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   He'd learned about it as a kid during the Great Depression, and
from the war, and from 45 years working three shifts in a steel
mill.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, as more and more complications set in, a doctor
asked him a series of tough questions, each thrown at him like a
high, hard fastball.
</P>
<P>
   He never backed away from the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said to more needles and tubes. No to more poking. No
to more prodding. Whatever was to come, he decided to face it on
his terms. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   He died Monday morning, only a few hours after the great
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when we can no longer ignore coincidence or
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day, I watched again from my father's room as clouds
gathered on the horizon, remembering the old saying he'd repeat in
the dugout when a sudden storm swept in, interrupting our game.
</P>
<P>
   `'That's baseball,'' he'd tell us. ``Sometimes you win.
Sometimes you lose. Sometimes _ it rains.'' &QL;

LIVING THROUGH A RAIN DELAY

<P>
   PHOENIX - Sunday morning smelled like rain. On the way to Good
Samaritan Hospital I rolled down the windows and sped up, filling
the inside of the car with the air's dank perfume.
</P>
<P>
   From my father's room on the 11th floor I watched a lid of
clouds slide up from the south over the mountains, closing the
valley like a retractable dome.
</P>
<P>
   The city had gone too long with the roof open and the sky blue
and clear all the way to heaven. We needed rain.
</P>
<P>
   When it fell, though, it fell softly and for only a few minutes,
barely enough to wash the roofs of houses I could see south of the
freeway, less than a groundskeeper might spray on a dusty infield
before the start of a game.
</P>
<P>
   We'd have to wait for more. Just as, in the room on the 11th
floor, we waited.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:45 a.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 23, my dad lost the grip on his
throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   He'd had heart bypass surgery the day before and gotten through
it fine, but as doctors were removing a breathing tube from his
throat he had a stroke. It's affected his right side.
</P>
<P>
   He could no longer hold a drawing pencil, as he had so often. Or
a steering wheel. A hammer. A rosary. A grandson's hand.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pitches he threw were made during Little League

TWO PROTESTERS KILLED BY PALESTINIAN SECURITY FORCES, WITNESSES SAY
 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip shot
and killed two teen-agers Wednesday in violent protests that
erupted after a suspected member of the militant group Hamas was
sentenced to death for killing a Palestinian police officer,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes reminiscent of a seven-year uprising against Israel,
hundreds of demonstrators poured into the streets of the town of
Rafah, threw stones at the police, burned tires and barricaded
streets after a Palestinian security court there pronounced the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest was a serious test for Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, who faces growing disillusionment among his people over the
performance of the Palestinian Authority and its security forces.
Amid worsening economic conditions and a freeze in peace efforts,
many Palestinians accuse the authority of corruption, abuse of
power and violating the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began after the security court sentenced Raed
al-Attar, 25, a suspected member of Hamas who served in the
Palestinian security forces, to die by firing squad for the killing
of a police captain last month. Another suspected militant,
Mohammad Abu Shamala, 25, was given a life sentence, and a third,
Osama Abu Taha, 24, was sentenced to 15 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Rifat Joudah, was shot and killed as he tried to
arrest the three men, who were wanted by Israel and had enlisted in
the Palestinian security forces. Although witnesses gave
conflicting accounts of the shooting during the two-week trial, all
three defendants were found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justice in Palestine!'' Attar shouted as he was
led from the courtroom by police officers. He cannot appeal his
death sentence, but the execution requires Arafat's final approval.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second death sentence handed down by a Palestinian
court in recent weeks. A Palestinian colonel was executed last
month, shortly after a speedy trial in which a security court
convicted him of rape and inciting the public against the
Palestinian Authority by his actions. Such quick trials have been
condemned by Palestinian and international huan rights groups as
miscarriages of justice.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing Wednesday, relatives of Attar and other
protesters marched on the home of Joudah's family and on local
police headquarters, throwing rocks and bottles as police officers
confronted them.
</P>
<P>
   The officers opened fire, killing two teen-agers and wounding
several other protesters, witnesses said. The dead youths were
identified as Ala al-Hams, 17, and Hamis Salamah, 19.
</P>
<P>
   The protests flared again during Hams' funeral hours later, as
mourners stoned police headquarters and officers, shouting
``Arafat, pull out your dogs!'' Witnesses said the officers fired
back, wounding two protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In a belated response to the clashes, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Jabali,
the Palestinian police chief, denied that his forces had shot at
demonstrators and asserted that Israeli soldiers had fired the
fatal shots when protesters shot at their outpost near Rafah on the
border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli military spokesman emphatically denied Jabali's
charges, asserting that there had been no shooting by Israeli
forces in the Gaza Strip.

ANOTHER DROUGHT IS FORECAST, AND TEXANS ARE NERVOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Still reeling from a 1998 drought that devastated the
state's farming and ranching communities, Texas officials are
growing increasingly alarmed about what appears to be a potentially
more serious drought looming this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still time for it to turn around, but we are not
looking good over much of the state,'' said Roland Smith, an
agricultural economist at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``People are really
getting nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusually warm winter and dearth of rainfall, particularly
in the western two-thirds of the state, have severely damaged the
winter wheat crop and stunted the growth of hay and natural grasses
for cattle and other livestock. And during the next two months, a
crucial time for the spring plantings of cotton, corn and other
crops, drier than normal conditions are predicted for most of the
major farming regions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department's Climate Prediction Center
lists the Trans-Pecos region in far western Texas and most of the
state's Mexican border areas as abnormally dry, and the long-term
drought severity index shows the Trans-Pecos and parts of the
plains of west-central Texas in a state of moderate drought. If
rainfall projections hold true, officials say, most of West and
South Texas will experience a moderate to extreme drought as early
as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Agriculture Commissioner Susan
Combs are expected to unveil drought-related initiatives on
Thursday morning, including declaring emergencies in 170 of the
state's 254 counties where dry conditions have created a
significant risk of fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the La Nina thing,'' Ms. Combs said. ``We are right today
at the same point in drought index comparisons where we were when
the governor declared a drought emergency in June of 1998. We're
three months ahead of last year, and that's what's giving people
heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite flooding last fall in towns like Del Rio, Texas is
flirting not only with a second consecutive year of paralyzing
drought, but the third year of drought in the last four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain areas of the state did have some very large amounts of
rain in the fall,'' Smith said. ``But that was rains that came so
fast that a lot of the water ran off and we haven't had much rain
in any of those places since.''
</P>
<P>
   And where rain fell over the winter, ``none of it has penetrated
into the subsoil, which is so necessary to make a reasonable cotton
crop,'' said Carl Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a particularly windy winter, adding to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody knows, that when the wind blows across the surface of
the land, it actually sucks the moisture out,'' Ms. Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ground is especially dry going into the spring
rainy season, which should be starting about now. ``We keep hoping
for three inches or so each time one of these fronts moves through,
but they just keep on blowing past, dropping just a half-inch here
and there, and then heading out East,'' Mr. Anderson said. ``If it
stays dry another six weeks or so, we will see some tremendous
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service projections call for below-normal
rainfall in Texas in the coming months. But even if the spring
rains come in normal amounts, they may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials say, copious spring rains might produce an
adequate crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is time for a turn around,'' Anderson said. ``This is
only just now becoming a serious threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas agricultural economists predicted last summer that the
1998 drought would mean a drop of $2.1 billion in the state's farm
and ranch production. In fact, a report released in February by
Texas A&AMP;M found that the drop was $2.4 billion, and that $8 billion
more was lost in farm-dependent businesses, mostly in the smallest,
rural towns.
</P>
<P>
   Most agricultural economists are loath to speculate, but the
Texas Agricultural Extension Service estimated that the 1998
drought persuaded as many as 10 percent of the state's farmers and
ranchers to quit the business. ``People are giving up, they just
can't make it,'' Ms. Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas agriculture is very vulnerable as we move into 1999,''
Smith said. ``Another year like last year, without additional
significant federal help, and we're going to lose a lot of
farmers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A bill is working its way through the Texas Legislature that
would provide $25 million in drought relief, but it is aimed at
those suffering from last year's drought. In October, Congress
passed $5.9 billion in disaster aid to farmers affected by droughts
throughout the country and an estimated $2.4 billion remains to be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Combs said Texas officials will urge the federal government
to speed up those payments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's drought hit every corner of the state. For the
moment, at least, this year's drought threat is more localized.
</P>
<P>
   The Trans-Pecos areas have had just 19 percent of the rainfall
this winter that they would have had in a normal year, Ms. Combs
said, and the Edwards Plateau region of west-central Texas has had
just 24 percent. But the rolling plains, north of the Edwards
Plateau, have had 69 percent of normal rainfall, and the high
plains of the Texas Panhandle have had 93 percent.

   Disney's at it again.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, to promote the video release of ``Mulan,''
entertainment's most synergistic company built a replica of the
Great Wall of China in the hamlet of China, Texas. This week, in
the near-China city of Beaumont, the company is hyping the video
reissue of the animated ``101 Dalmatians'' by building a
24-foot-tall Dalmatian-spotted fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   Why Beaumont? Because it's the home of the Fire Museum of Texas.
And Disney's not about to stop at a massive fire hydrant. During
the dedication ceremony Tuesday, 101 Texas firefighters performed a
production number to the tune of ``Cruella de Vil.'' The
firefighters formed a 101 figure around the hydrant, and the number
concluded with the hydrant showering them with water and confetti.
They had Dalmatian-patterned umbrellas to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Look, we're not making this up. We swear. But it did inspire us
to make up a whole bunch of other stuff. Just imagine what other

NEW DRUGS CAN HELP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST MIGRAINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pain of her migraine headaches is so intense that Fort Worth
artist Kathy Suder once threw herself headfirst into a snowbank in
Colorado, burying her face in the snow to get some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headaches sound so minor,'' Suder says. ``Migraines shouldn't
be called headaches. They are more like brain explosions,
completely incapacitating.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has experienced a migraine knows they are unlike
ordinary headaches. In a migraine, severe, often throbbing pain
starts on one side of the head and usually stays there, although it
can shift to the other side the next time a migraine occurs. The
pain may cause nausea, vomiting, chills or sweating, cold hands,
shaking and sensitivity to light and sound. Attacks can last
several minutes or several days; most last four to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   For years, there was little relief for the 26 million Americans
_ 18 million of them women _ who suffer from migraines. But for two
to three years, the mysteries surrounding debilitating migraine
attacks have begun to unravel, and new drugs to prevent and treat
migraines are offering much better pain control.
</P>
<P>
   Maxalt, the most recent drug approved for migraine treatment,
won the nod from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June. It
is the newest member of a medications class known as the
``triptan'' drugs, and is closely related to sumatriptan (Imitrex,
which six years ago became the first major drug approved
specifically for migraine), naratriptan and zolmitriptan.
</P>
<P>
   Maxalt is available in several forms, including a new ``orally
disintegrating tablet,'' a small tablet that can be taken easily
without water. It has a faster onset of action than other forms,
with relief in as little as 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for health-care professionals is getting the word
out to migraine sufferers. Although the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention report that the prevalence of
migraine in the United States increased nearly 60 percent over the
past decade, many people don't seek treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Migraine sufferers are not treated well at all, even now,''
says Dr. Ninan Mathew, president of the International Headache
Society. ``We have good treatments for acute attacks and for
preventing migraine, but less than 40 percent of patients with
migraines ever get proper diagnosis and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that until the recent research advances,
there were no effective medications, and many patients feared being
labeled hypochondriacs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myths prevent proper treatment,'' says Mathew, a clinical
professor of neurology at the University of Texas-Houston Health
Science Center. Mathew is medical director of the Houston Headache
Clinic and its satellite, the Dallas Headache Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we have the common myth, `It's all in the head, it's
all psychological,' and that is not true. Stress, depression,
anxiety can produce a migraine, but they are not the cause, only
some of the triggers,'' Mathew said.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the mistaken belief that every headache in the front
of the head is a sinus headache, and that the best treatment is to
take decongestants and antihistamines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the so-called sinus headaches are not that at all.
They're a myth,'' Mathew says. ``If you have recurrent, throbbing
headaches, it's not sinus.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most troubling myths is the belief that migraine is an
``emotional problem'' caused by an inability to deal with the
stress of daily living. It is particularly disturbing because it
may reflect a hidden prejudice against women, who are three times
more likely than men to suffer chronic headaches, the American
Council for Headache Education said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the greater vulnerability of women is due to
biological triggers _ primarily fluctuations in estrogen levels _
not emotional or psychological factors,'' said Dr. Joel Saper, a
physician member of the council.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of migraine sufferers have a family history
of headaches, and recent research indicates that the headaches have
physical causes, according to the National Headache Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is dilation during an attack and inflammatory changes
around the blood vessels of the brain. That's what causes the pain,
but ultimately biochemical changes in the brain itself are what
cause a migraine attack,'' Mathew said. ``The whole thing is caused
by a sequence of events. Something triggers biochemical changes
that cause blood vessels in the brain to dilate, resulting in the
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of possible triggers is extensive: stress, the wrong
diet, lack of sleep, missing a meal. Chocolate, red wine, MSG
flavor enhancer, anything with Nutrasweet, and aged cheese can
provoke a migraine; so can noise, certain odors, bright lights and
watching TV. Migraine sufferers are often affected by cigarette
smoke, too much or too little sleep, menstruation and changes in
altitude and temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for migraine usually begins with lifestyle changes:
determining individual triggers and removing them; avoiding bright
lights and sudden altitude changes such as those caused by airplane
flights and even fast elevators in tall buildings; and taking
over-the-counter pain relievers. Excedrin has a formulation
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically
for migraine.
</P>
<P>
   Some headache doctors are also recommending magnesium and
riboflavin (vitamin B-2) and the herbal remedy feverfew, along with
pain relievers.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathew says he saw a man recently who had been taking 200
Excedrin a week for months before he sought a headache specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are taking OTC (over-the-counter) pain medication every
day, it's not good,'' Mathew says. ``People feel nonprescription
drugs are safe, but they have many side effects. The stomach and
liver can suffer, and people who take frequent pain medication can
get into analgesic rebound headaches where they feel better for an
hour or two, then their headache's back and they take medicine
again, and it becomes a vicious cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have not developed a cure for migraine. But for some
patients, there's good news _ attacks sometimes become milder or
even stop on their own, especially in women after menopause.
</P>
<P>

Headache Foundation toll-free at (800) 843-2256.

   Disney's at it again.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, to promote the video release of ``Mulan,''
entertainment's most synergistic company built a replica of the
Great Wall of China in the hamlet of China, Texas. This week, in
the near-China city of Beaumont, the company is hyping the video
reissue of the animated ``101 Dalmatians'' by building a
24-foot-tall Dalmatian-spotted fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   Why Beaumont? Because it's the home of the Fire Museum of Texas.
And Disney's not about to stop at a massive fire hydrant. During
the dedication ceremony Tuesday, 101 Texas firefighters performed a
production number to the tune of ``Cruella de Vil.'' The
firefighters formed a 101 figure around the hydrant, and the number
concluded with the hydrant showering them with water and confetti.
They had Dalmatian-patterned umbrellas to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Look, we're not making this up. We swear. But it did inspire us
to make up a whole bunch of other stuff. Just imagine what other

FORT WORTH'S OPERA CONTEST FLIRTS WITH THE BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTH WORTH, Texas _ It's not just a homey little contest
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Marguerite McCammon Vocal Competition of the
Fort Worth Opera Guild will move downtown, beneficiary of a growing
endowment and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the fans were admitted for free and often barely
outnumbered the staff, jury and competitors in the daylong event at
the Scott Theatre. The volunteer staffers, competitors and members
of the press mingled at a casual potluck supper, trading gossip and
tips, before the evening finals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sophistication and prestige have crept up on the McCammon.
</P>
<P>
   The McCammon has sacrificed the up-close intimacy (but generally
poor acoustics) of the 481-seat Scott Theatre for the grandeur of
Bass Performance Hall in downtown Fort Worth. Audience members will
pay $10, which covers admission to both sessions (still a bargain,
considering that the next Placido Domingo or Cecilia Bartoli might
be onstage). The finals will be held in the late afternoon, to
clear the hall in time for the evening performance of Puccini's
``Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera buffs can make a day of it downtown, attending the first
session at noon, the finals at 4 p.m. and then Tosca at 7:30 p.m.
Particularly hardy fans can also attend a panel discussion at 10
a.m. in the Grand Salon of Bass Hall, at which jurors will discuss
``Ten Ways to Sabotage Your Audition.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still not quite the operatic equivalent of the Cliburn
competition, with its international audition tour, its two weeks of
performances in Fort Worth, its undisputed spot at the top of the
piano competition world and its prize package valued at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCammon has established a secure niche in the operatic
world _ where, admittedly, auditions are the main source of
advancement. And, although it won't challenge the Cliburn as the
focus of local loyalty and pride, it has two elements that
Cliburn's fans might envy.
</P>
<P>
   First, two recent first-prize winners _ mezzo-soprano Vivica
Genaux and Frank Hernandez _ have gone on to establish good careers
in the operatic world.
</P>
<P>
   Second, for competition groupies who really get emotionally
involved, the McCammon lets audiences choose _ and reward _ a
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a year in which chronic controversy over the dismissal
and rehiring of general director William Walker has engulfed the
Fort Worth Opera, the McCammon has provided a focus for members of
the Opera Guild. Legally independent of the Fort Worth Opera
Association (though supporting the Fort Worth Opera is its main
function), the Opera Guild has stayed outside the fray and kept its
collective mind on the McCammon.
</P>
<P>
   The McCammon was founded in 1969 with a gift of $5,000 from Mary
Ann W. Armstrong of Natchez, Miss., in honor of her niece,
Marguerite McCammon, of Fort Worth, who was then president of the
Opera Guild of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The gift from Armstrong originally financed a scholarship
limited to singers in Texas; the concept eventually expanded to a
national competition for professional singers.
</P>
<P>
   The prize money is up, as well. With an endowment fund now at
$91,000, the McCammon can afford to give the top winner, who is
also offered a role with the Fort Worth Opera, a prize of $5,000.
(It was $3,000 at the most recent competition, in 1997.) Second-
and third-place winners will take $2,000 and $1,500, respectively,
compared with $1,200 and $1,000 at the 1997 contest. The three
nonplacing finalists will each receive $250, and the remaining
semifinalists will each receive $150.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the audience ballot will take home $600 in memory
of past opera President Rick Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three applicants _ an all-time high _ submitted tapes
this year. The competition was open to singers pursuing a
professional career in opera, ages 21-32 if female and 21-35 if
male. A jury _ including former Vienna State Opera bass-baritone
Reid Bunger of the Southern Methodist University faculty; Fort
Worth Opera associate conductor Jing Ling Tam; and tenor David
Sundquist of the faculty of the University of North Texas _
selected 12 semifinalists and two alternates in February.
</P>
<P>
   As Walker, who frequently hears regional Metropolitan Opera
auditions, points out, this is an unusual group in that men
outnumber women.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Metropolitan Opera auditions these days, about 80 percent
of the competitors are women,'' Walker says. ``And 75 percent of
those are lyric sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   The semifinalists will arrive Thursday and Friday and rehearse
with piano accompanists Alan Buratto of the Fort Worth Opera staff,
and Tara Emerson, staff accompanist at SMU, on Friday. Several live
or grew up close by and will stay with family, but most will stay
in the homes of volunteers, as at the Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   The main competition jury will include Walker, Boston Lyric
Opera general director Janice Mancini Del Sesto, Portland Opera
general director Robert Bailey and Fort Worth Opera principal
conductor Richard Barrett. In the two sessions, the jurors will
select from a list of four arias submitted by each contestant,
including at least two non-English arias and one aria in English.
</P>
<P>
   The competition also presents the chance for exposure to other
opera companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our judges are unique,'' Walker says. ``Each of these people
can offer a job to any of these singers.''
</P>
<P>
   One only need recall the case of mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux.
Genaux, then 23, drove from Pittsburgh in wintry March weather to
participate in the 1993 competition. With her extraordinary
flexibility and stamina, she walked away with first prize; Jonathan
Pell, of the Dallas Opera, was on the jury, and he immediately
offered her a contract. Genaux has since moved up to title roles in
major houses and an acclaimed Metropolitan Opera debut.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, picking the winner is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes a couple of bars,'' Barrett says.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautions, ``Some people are good at competitions, and
can win them, and then get on the stage and can't perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Sesto, a frequent judge at vocal competitions, says she
looks for theatrical as well as vocal talent. Even in a recital
set-up, you can spot that dramatic flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see it in the way they deliver the sung word,'' she says.
``Beyond the voice, one of the most powerful means of expression is
the face _ particularly the eyes. I've seen singers who didn't have
to move an inch to be theatrical.''
</P>
<P>
   With its steadily growing endowment, its handsome venue and the
success of recent winners, the McCammon hopes to continue growing
in prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that this year is a jumping-off point to become
even bigger,'' says opera guild President Jan Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   And then, perhaps, the Cliburn won't be the only classical
competition that Fort Worth is famous for. (Visit the

 &HT;    CLINTON PROPOSES EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL CENTRAL AMERICAN
IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    EDs: With optional add begins at 650 words.

   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ President Clinton, addressing
lawmakers assembled in El Salvador from across Central America,
said Wednesday he would seek to make it easier for refugees who
fled political oppression in the region -- regardless of the type
government -- to obtain permanent residency status in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here later from El Salvador, however, and tried to
heal old wounds by acknowledging the U.S. role in supporting
repressive military regimes in Guatemala during the 1980s and the
first half of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support for military forces or intelligence units which
engaged in violent or widespread repression was wrong, and the
United States must not repeat that mistake,'' Clinton said at a
roundtable of Guatemalan civic leaders to discuss the nation's
recent peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The president further urged that the United States be viewed
``in a new way, as a partner, a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement came two weeks after a Guatemalan truth
commission released a report detailing that U.S. policy was pivotal
to state-sponsored genocide against Mayan peasants during the war,
in which an estimated 200,000 died. A 36-year civil war between the
army and leftist rebels, which ripped Guatemala apart, ended as
recently as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the past U.S. involvement, about a hundred
demonstrators protested Clinton's arrival here from El Salvador.
They carried signs decrying genocide, murder, oil companies and
poor wages.
</P>
<P>
   The president will complete his four-day goodwill mission to
Central America Thursday with a summit of regional presidents here
in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, in an address to the Legislative Assembly of
El Salvador, Clinton said he would support equal treatment for
refugees from the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been reviewing the 1997 immigration law
which granted amnesty to some 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees who
arrived prior to 1996 to determine whether it can also apply to
refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The law was aimed at refugees from Nicaragua and Cuba who fled
communist regimes. It made it easier for refugees who fled
right-wing dictatorships in El Salvador and Guatemala before
October 1991 to apply for permanent status, but was not as generous
as to those who fled communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of those countries have been urging a change in U.S.
policy to allow the refugees to remain. They argue that the money
sent back to the region from those refugees is an important source
of revenue for Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in response to Hurricane Mitch, Clinton gave
refugees from Nicaragua and Honduras an 18-month amnesty from
deportation to relieve those countries from absorbing the returning
citizens at a time of economic difficulty. He also granted a 60-day
amnesty to Guatemala and Salvadoran refugees. That period ended
Monday, but none are scheduled to be deported this week.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's expiration of a temporary amnesty program, nearly
3,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala face
deportation. They are seeking parity with Nicaragua and Honduras,
covered by more liberal rules.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Salvadoran assembly, Clinton pledged to
urge Congress to support equal treatment for all Central American
refugees, as well as through administrative changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything I can to remove that different treatment,
`` Clinton said. ``Our treatment of people from Central America
should reflect what they suffered, not who caused the suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday whether the administration would seek
to include Haitians in that extended amnesty. Critics of extending
amnesty to Haitians argue that they fled extreme poverty, not
oppression.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Central American leaders to give every child a
chance to go to school; adopt environmental practices to avert the
deforestation which may have caused the mudslides that killed 2,000
people in Nicaragua; and crack down on the transportation of
illegal drugs through the region.
</P>
<P>
   For education, Clinton announced an $8 million grant to enable
countries in Central America to enroll more children in schools and
keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the region's civil wars have been replaced by
democratically elected governments throughout Central America,
Clinton said ``we have a solemn obligation to deliver democracy''
for today's children.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a saying among those who work around Cher. If there's a
nuclear war, only two species will survive: the cockroaches and
Cher.
</P>
<P>
   She may be the only singer who had No. 1 hits in the 1960s and
'70s to return this decade with a new No. 1 single. This week, her
song ``Believe'' went to the top of the pop charts, resurrecting a
mutating career that refuses to be buried. The song has been No. 1
in 22 countries so far, and with a Spanish version on the way this
may be only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   To a listener, ``Believe'' may sound like a sure hit regardless
of the performer's history. The verses are rich and bittersweet,
with the added gimmick of breaking up Cher's voice through an
effect that makes her sound robotic. And the choruses are catchy
and uplifting, with Cher wailing, ``Do you believe in life after
love?'' All of it bounces over a bed of '80s-style electronic dance
pop. It is a song with a universal theme _ a woman trying to
convince herself that she can survive a breakup _ that has crossed
pop borders to appeal to old and young, mainstream and alternative
music fans, and even those who have little affinity for
contemporary pop.
</P>
<P>
   So where does a hit like ``Believe'' come from? There are six
songwriters credited with writing the single. Of those, Cher knows
only one. Digging deeper, at least four others, including Cher,
contributed to the music and lyrics of ``Believe'' but are not
credited on the record because there were already too many people
listed. How much work, how many people and how much luck does it
take to make a four-minute pop song?
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe'' began nine years ago in a small flat in Sussex,
England. Brian Higgins had returned home from his job selling
advertising space for Reed, a paper company. He was 23, and trying
to teach himself how to write songs. He sat at one of the keyboards
in the far end of his bedroom, lifted his fingers to play a few
chords and it happened. ``The lyrics and the melody just flowed out
at the same time,'' he said. ``Normally you play a few chords,
establish a melody and then start to apply a few lyrics. But this
time, I promise you, the whole thing came out at once, which is
really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Higgins' career began to blossom, and he
started getting odd jobs with such pop stars as Diana Ross, Dannii
Minogue and Pulp. Practically every time Higgins met with an
artist, manager or record executive he played them his unborn dance
song, ``Believe.'' But no one showed the slightest interest.
Higgins knew the song wasn't perfect; the choruses were great but
the verses were only skeletal. As he began gathering his own team
of songwriters, he had them tinker with the verses every so often.
But no matter what they did there were no takers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rob Dickins, president of London-based Warner
Music U.K., had decided that the only thing Cher could do to make
up for her last album, ``It's a Man's World,'' a set of rock
ballads that sold disappointingly, was to focus on her gay audience
with a high-energy dance record. Dickins, who would oversee the
album, was in his 27th year with the company, and this would be his
last project with Warner Brothers. He did not know it at the time,
but he was on the verge of being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I want you to make a dance album,' '' Cher said the
other day in a telephone interview from Paris. ``I said I didn't
want to. But I have that problem: If someone says I want you to do
something and I'm not sure, I usually just say I don't want to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cher said she was not interested in dance music anymore because
it was not a genre with real songs. Dickins walked away, intent on
finding real songs to disprove her argument. That was when luck
intervened, and a chance encounter set the wheels in motion that
would make Cher a pop star again. Higgins was visiting Warner
Brothers to talk about the Minogue album he had worked on. As he
waited outside the office of an executive who was on the phone,
Dickins happened to walk downstairs and down the corridor, where he
met Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Dickins asked the songwriter if he would be interested in
submitting a song or two for consideration for the Cher album.
Three days later, a tape with 16 of Higgins' songs arrived. ``I lay
on my bed and put the tape on and listened to every song,'' Dickins
said. ``The ninth song was `Believe.' I thought: `Cher could do
this chorus, especially the lyrics, with her private life the way
it is. She's gone through all these things.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dickins called the songwriter the next day and asked him to
complete ``Believe.'' ``About a week later he comes in with the
finished song and it's terrible,'' Dickins said. ``I've got this
great chorus and this terrible song. So I told him, `We're taking
it away from you.' He says, `What do you mean?' I said, `You've
done no justice to your own song.'''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins handed over the song, admitting that he was probably too
close to it. Meanwhile Dickins had found a song for the album
called ``Dove l'Amore,'' which was written by Paul Barry and Mark
Taylor, an English songwriting team. Cher visited their studio in a
suburb west of London with the intention of recording only that
song. She said she remembered the studio, called Metro, as ``this
little dungeon of a place, the smallest studio I've ever been in in
my life.'' Even Dickins had second thoughts about the place: ``I
went down and saw Cher sitting in this horrible room on this
horrible sofa and thought, `What have I done to her?''' But the
chemistry was good.
</P>
<P>
   When Dickins sent ``Believe'' to Metro studios, a staff
songwriter, Steve Torch, took a crack at the verses. Dickins was
not happy with the result. ``I said, `What is wrong with all you
people? I've got a hit chorus and none of you can write a song,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rawling, the producer who runs Metro, begged for another
chance and got it, handing the song to Barry, who kept hitting
brick walls. ``I remember one version in particular that Cher
didn't like,'' Barry said. ``My son had just been born and I was
ecstatic. One lyric Cher said was total garbage. She said, `You're
too happy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was during this time that Dickins was asked to leave his job
at Warner Brothers as a result of a personality clash with Bob
Daly, a chairman of Warner Brothers and Warner Music. That this
album would be his last word at Warner Brothers was ``probably why
I was so relentless with the song,'' Dickins said.
</P>
<P>
   (Last month, a fellow ad salesman and songwriting partner, Mark
Scott, sued Higgins and Warner Music, saying he helped write
``Believe' in 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally Barry's partner, Taylor, turned in a version good enough
to begin working on. The lyrics began to match the strength of the
chorus. The first verse now ended: ``It's so sad that you're
leaving/It takes time to believe it/But after all is said and
done/You're going to be the lonely one.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry began putting together the music, starting with a rough
drum track he made on a computer program called Cubase, a crude
keyboard melody and a bass line. He and Taylor remember trying to
make a dance song that was a little different, with subtle melodies
and quiet backing vocals tucked away; verses in the style of Lamont
Dozier and soulful '80s funk touches influenced by Stevie Wonder
and Prince.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickins was still dissatisfied. He thought the eight-bar
section of the song, known as the middle eight, before the final
chorus which simply repeated the lyric ``I don't need you
anymore,'' was too repetitive and didn't take the song anywhere.
This time he was ignored. But Cher had a more pressing problem. She
said the second verse was simply a repetition of the ``so sad that
you're leaving'' sentiment expressed in the first one. ``I thought,
`You can be sad for one verse, but you can't be sad for two,' ''
Cher said. ``That night I was lying there in my bathtub with my toe
in that little faucet, playing around with the words, and it came
out in one line. I thought, `I've had time to see it through/Maybe
I'm too good for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But when the song was finished the verses still seemed lifeless,
no matter how many different ways Cher sang them. And that was when
luck smiled on ``Believe'' again.
</P>
<P>
   One morning Cher turned on her television set and saw a program
featuring a singer named Andrew Roachford, whose CD she instantly
bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tackling `Believe' for the gazillionth time,'' she
said. ``And I said: `I'm so tired of doing this. Let's just put on
this CD and listen to music and get away from this.' '' On one song
the vocals were processed through a vocoder to sound mechanical.
Cher remembers suggesting that they add something like that to
``Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim a new voice-tuning program for Cubase had arrived
in the studio, and Taylor decided to teach himself how to use it.
He randomly chose two bars of ``Believe'' and looped it on the
computer. In his tinkering, he came across the wavering, soulful,
robotic vocal sound that is now the song's most loved and
recognizable element. But he was afraid that if Cher heard it, she
would object to his experimenting with her vocals. ``But something
just snapped, and a couple of beers later we decided to play it for
her, and she just freaked out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is, freaked out in a good way. ``We high-fived,'' Cher
said. ``It was like some stupid `Rocky' film.'' When Cher left the
studio to begin filming ``Tea With Mussolini,'' Taylor put together
a quick mix of ``Believe'' and sent it to Cher and Dickins, who
thought they had gotten carried away with the robotic sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Everyone loves that song but wants to change that
part of it,' '' Cher said. ``I said, `You can change that part of
it, over my dead body!' And that was the end of the discussion. I
said to Mark before I left, `Don't let anyone touch this track, or
I'm going to rip your throat out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And no one changed the track. That rough mix became the final
version of the song. And when the song leapt to No. 1 on the
British pop charts and stayed there for seven weeks, resulting in
champagne toasts every Monday at the Metro studio, was everyone
finally happy? Well, sort of. When Dickins called Rawling to tell
him the song was No. 1, the news wasn't all good. ``I told him:
`We're No. 1, fantastic position. But the middle eight still
doesn't cut it!'''

PHYSICIST AND THEOLOGIAN AWARDED RELIGIOUS PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Calif., Conn., Ill.) (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world's largest monetary prize, the Templeton
Prize for Progress in Religion, has been awarded this year to Ian
G. Barbour, a physicist and theologian who has devoted four decades
to fostering a dialogue between science and religion.
</P>
<P>
   His selection as recipient of the prize, valued at (PS)750,000,
or about $1.24 million, was announced at a news conference
Wednesday at the Church Center for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, 75, professor emeritus of science, technology and
society at Carleton College, in Northfield, Minn., has written or
edited a dozen books on religion and science. In an interview, he
said the relationship between the two fields had developed into a
far wider discussion, as a result of technological breakthroughs,
than when he first began writing about it in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask what's different, it's that we are able to do
things we couldn't before and these raise ethical issues,'' Barbour
said, citing cloning and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He added that in questions raised by new technologies, religious
tradition mattered most because it sensitized believers ``to enter
into the public debate and hold up values, like the value of the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course the religious community has to be informed about
the scientific side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said he planned to give $1 million of the prize money as
an endowment fund to the Center for Theology and the Natural
Sciences, an affiliate of the Graduate Theological Union in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Templeton Prize was created by Sir John M. Templeton,
founder of several investment funds, to honor originality in
advancing public understanding of God or spirituality. An
independent jury selects a recipient each year.
</P>
<P>
   The first, in 1973, was Mother Teresa, founder of the
Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic order. Last year, the
prize went to Sir Sigmund Sternberg, a British businessman who
promoted interfaith dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The prize has also been awarded to scientists. In 1995, it went
to Paul Davies, a British-born physicist in Australia who argued
that advances in knowledge of the universe pointed to evidence of a
design or purpose behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, a member of the United Church of Christ, a Protestant
denomination, graduated from Yale Divinity School and the
University of Chicago, where he completed a doctorate in physics
and was a teaching assistant to the physicist Enrico Fermi.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour has said the idea of an unbridgeable conflict between
religion and science is only one of four possible models of
interaction between the two fields. Alternatively, he said, one
could see science and religion as coexisting separately; or
science, through its discoveries about the universe, as inspiring a
sense of religious awe, or _ his own preference _ science and
religion entering into dialogue, discovering each other's wisdom.

 &HT;    Traditional recipe and variations of biscuits
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Take that meal from b-o-r-i-n-g to BOING! in one
easy trick: Bake a biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap and fast, a homemade biscuit elevates any meal _
breakfast, lunch or dinner _ beyond its normal status.
</P>
<P>
   Like a culinary makeover, this pillow of bread _ light as a
cloud _ will make the most of such simple offerings as a bowl of
soup, grilled or fried chicken, a slice of meatloaf, a link of
Texas sausage or a veggie plate.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never made biscuits from scratch, it's a tad more
effort than a bowl of cereal but nothing like you think. There are
tricks out there that make this bread a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   It helps, of course, if you start with the right ingredients:
especially self-rising flour. Soft, low-protein self-rising flour
such as White Lily makes the best biscuits, but it's not always
easy to find in Texas. Thus, some cooks pick up a bag of this flour
on trips through Southern states or order it from the company
(www.whitelily.com) and keep it in the freezer just for biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shirley Corriher, that Georgia queen of biscuits and
author of ``Cookwise,'' says if low-protein flour is not available,
you can use 1 cup of national self-rising flour and 1/2 cup instant
flour (such as Wondra) or cake flour, plus 1/2 teaspoon baking
powder. That you can find easily in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, forget all those tips you might have heard from your
grandmother about the messy task of cutting shortening into flour.
Not necessary. Times have changed. Think cream instead of
shortening. Think stirring instead of cutting. Think patting
instead of rolling. Think: Is this all there is to it?
</P>
<P>
   Yep, we're talking only two ingredients here _ self-rising flour
and cream. Maybe 15 minutes of effort. Not that you need to tell
anyone. Just let people be impressed that you seemed to have
mastered that generations-old art of baking that gives Texans a
reason to get up in the morning or makes supper a celebratory
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, master this recipe and you are no longer a one-bread
wonder. You can stir in all sorts of flavorful accents from herbs
to cheeses. And the same technique works for strawberry shortcakes
or scones, which are basically biscuits with a touch of sugar. Yet
other opportunities to shine.
</P>
<P>
   Cream Biscuits
</P>
<P>
   2 cups self-rising flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cream, whipping or half and half
</P>
<P>
   Place self-rising flour in a large bowl. Stir in cream, just
until dough is blended.
</P>
<P>
   Use two large serving spoons to drop dough onto a very lightly
greased cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   For rolled biscuits: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface,
knead four or five times. Then roll or pat dough out to 1/2-inch
thickness. With a biscuit cutter, cut dough into biscuits.
(Old-time cooks may have used a jelly glass to cut out the
biscuits, but a cutter makes a prettier biscuit with a cleaner
edge.) Reroll any scraps and cut more biscuits. Bake for 10-15
minutes or until lightly browned in an oven preheated to 450
degrees. Makes 8-10 biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   If substituting 2 cups all-purpose flour, add 1/2 teaspoon salt
, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 3 teaspoons baking powder.
</P>
<P>
   Note: For shortcake, add a tablespoon of sugar
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Biscuits
</P>
<P>
   2 cups self-rising flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   2/3 or 3/4 cup milk or buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   Place flour in a large bowl. Add shortening and cut in with
pastry cutter or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Add just enough milk for dough to come together and leave sides of
the bowl. Place dough on lightly floured surface. Knead lightly
about 10 times. Pat or roll dough out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut
with biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet, close
together for soft-sided biscuits, about an inch apart for crisper
edges. Bake in a preheated 450-degree oven for 10-15 minutes, until
golden brown. Makes about 10 biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   If substituting 2 cups all-purpose flour, add 1/2 teaspoon salt
, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 3 teaspoons baking powder.
</P>
<P>
   Cream Scones
</P>
<P>
   2 cups self-rising flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup white or brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dried currants or raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon and sugar
</P>
<P>
   Combine flour and sugar in large bowl. Add currants or raisins.
Stir in cream, reserving at least a tablespoon to brush on top of
the scones. Mix just until ingredients are moist. Gather the dough
into a ball and knead it gently against the sides and bottom of the
bowl 5 to 10 times. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and pat
the dough into an 8-inch round about 3/4 inch thick. Cut into 8 or
10 wedges and place at least 1/2-inch apart on a large ungreased
baking sheet. Brush the scone tops with the reserved cream and
sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Bake in a preheated 425-degree
oven until tops are golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Makes 8
to 10 scones.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all purpose flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1/2
teaspoon of salt may be substituted for the self-rising flour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adapted from ``Joy of Cooking''
</P>
<P>
   Biscuit boosters
</P>
<P>
   A tablespoon, or more to taste, of one of these will transform a
batch of plain biscuits:
</P>
<P>
   Sage, above Thyme Rosemary Chives Cracked black pepper Grated
ginger Orange zest Goat cheese Cheddar cheese Sweet potatoes Bacon
bits Peanut butter Sundried tomatoes Chiles Top this
</P>
<P>
   Butter, gravy, jam? Everyone's got a favorite biscuit topper.
The most popular is margarine or butter. Second is jelly, jam or
preserves. Gravy is third; honey, fourth. Lagging far behind is
cheese or breakfast syrups.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought people had switched to bagels exclusively, think
again. In the past five years, sales of big refrigerated canned
biscuits have grown more than 38 percent industrywide.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is the most popular meal for biscuits nationwide. But in
the South, breakfast is biscuit time, although dinner is fast
catching up.
</P>
<P>
   More biscuits are eaten on Sunday in the United States than any
other day. Saturday is the runner-up.

 &HT;    Let your Irish stew for hours with a wee bit of Guinness
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austinite Helen Frink says her family loves the
Frugal Gourmet's recipe for Irish Stew, but wondered if it could be
adapted to a slow cooker for convenience.
</P>
<P>
   We sent her request to the test kitchen of the Texas Beef
Council, and director Anne Bried worked out the details in time for
St. Patrick's Day next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Beef Stew with Guinness Stout
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds beef stew meat
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large yellow onion in 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound carrots, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme, whole
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup beef stock
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Guinness Stout
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2-3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Brown the meat in the olive oil on both sides on high heat.
Place onions and carrots on bottom of slow cooker. Add meat, bay
leaves, garlic, thyme, rosemary, stock, Guinness and parsley. Cover
and cook in slow cooker on high 4-6 hours or follow guidelines for
low setting.
</P>
<P>
   After removing meat from pot, thicken juices with the 2
tablespoons of flour that have been mixed well with 2 tablespoons
water. Add to pot and cook on high until boiling. Add salt and
pepper to taste. Return meat to pot.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for slow cooking
</P>
<P>
   Any dish that is cooked with moist heat does well in a slow
cooker.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce liquids by half. Another rule of thumb is that 1 cup of
liquid is enough for any recipe. Because liquids don't boil away in
a slow cooker, you'll have more liquid at the end of cooking
instead of less.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce most steps in recipes by adding all the ingredients to
the slow cooker at once.
</P>
<P>
   Add milk, sour cream or other dairy products during the last
hour of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Cook pasta and rice before adding to the cooker.
</P>
<P>
   Dried beans should be boiled 10 minutes before adding to the
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of leaf or whole herbs will intensify, so start with
half the recommended amount in a conventional recipe. Add ground
herbs and spices during the last hour of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Most uncooked meat and vegetable combinations will require
cooking at least 8 hours on low.
</P>
<P>
   If a conventional recipe says cook 15 to 30 minutes, slow-cook
on low 4 to 6 hours or on high 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If a conventional
recipe says cook for 35 to 45 minutes, slow-cook on low 6 to 10
hours or on high 3 to 4 hours. If a conventional recipe says cook
for 50 minutes to 3 hours, cook on low 8 to 18 hours or on high 4
to 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Food cooked in a slow cooker is safe. The direct heat from the
pot, lengthy cooking time and the steam created inside the
tightly-sealed container act together to destroy bacteria,
according to the Food and Drug Administration. However, because
these cookers can take several hours to reach a safe
bacteria-killing temperature, meat and poultry must already be
defrosted and must be kept in the refrigerator until it's time to

 &HT;    More than two-thirds of CEOs choose Bush as GOP's hope
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ George W. Bush is more than the ``spittin' image of
his dad,'' according to Fortune (March 29). He's the man who could
be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wildly popular Texas governor, a man with enough of a
past to make him interesting _ and the Republican Party's hope for
the future,'' says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   America's corporate chief executives like the son of the former
president. Fortune said 68 percent of the CEOs contacted in a
special poll chose Bush over any of the other likely GOP
candidates, including Elizabeth Dole (8 percent) and former Vice
President Dan Quayle (3 percent). Pitted against Vice President Al
Gore, the CEOs chose Bush 86 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Fortune says the state of Texas has made a strong
comeback from its long era of economic distress because of
declining oil prices. The recovery occurred when state leaders
turned their attention from finding oil to making computers.
</P>
<P>
   WHY GREENSPAN IS SERENE
</P>
<P>
   With the bond market pushing up long-term Treasury yields,
there's no need for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term
interest rates, Business Week (March 15) says in a look at the
recent trend in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the economy and prospects of inflation caused bond
traders to panic, which pushed bond yields to the highest levels in
six months before leveling off recently.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in bond yields takes some of the heat off of Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan to engineer a rate hike at the Fed,
Business Week says. Not only that, Fed insiders believe the economy
will slow anyway, which also will make a rate hike unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW OFFICE WARFARE
</P>
<P>
   We're accustomed by now to sexism in the workplace, where men
have privileges women don't have, and so-called age-ism, where the
discrimination is against older workers. The new generational
warfare, says Forbes (March 22), is between young women and older
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just women fighting women. . . much of the
friction takes place between different generations: the older,
trailblazing women who had to sacrifice family for careers and the
younger, want-it-all-now women,'' says Forbes. In both cases, the
biggest problem is balancing career and family.
</P>
<P>
   FROM SURFING TO INVESTING
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Funds (April) magazine takes readers inside the emerging
world of investing on the Net, or cybertrading.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6.8 million U.S. households were involved in online trading
in 1998, and the number will double to 13.8 million households by
2001, says the magazine, which offers a menu of how-to and
where-to-find articles for the fledgling online trader.

 &HT;    MindSpring to offer $800 million in securities, possibly for
expansion, acquisitions
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises, the Atlanta-based Internet
service provider, Wednesday notified the Securities and Exchange
Commission of plans to offer up to $800 million in securities,
which could be used to pay for expansion, including acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Desimone, MindSpring executive vice president and general
counsel, would not elaborate on MindSpring's plans for the
offering. ``We've established it to permit MindSpring to react in a
time-efficient manner to market opportunities as they present
themselves. I can't really tell you what the specifics are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, industry analysts and Internet watchers believe the
$800 million is being put in reserve for MindSpring's future growth
plans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serious competition from AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom's
Internet divisions, the eventual mass market deployment of high
speed cable and phone access threaten to make obsolete ISPs that
use conventional telephone lines. Although analysts say that
transition is several years away, MindSpring may be thinking about
ways to retain and perhaps convert its 1 million subscribers to
alternative Internet delivery methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving consolidation in a very fragmented ISP market is what
they should be doing,'' says Jupiter Communications analyst Abhai
Chaki, who feels there are many growth opportunities MindSpring
could take on with $800 million. ``They may not do any of these
things, but there are lots of options open to them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chaki says that acquiring larger ISPs should be MindSpring's
goal, even though it's an expensive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring could also be looking at expanding into broadband,
making investments into offering DSL technology and talking with
BellSouth or other telecos.'' (Both broadband cable connections and
the competing technology from the telephone company, Digital
Subscriber Line, offer high speed connections.)
</P>
<P>
   Then again, MindSpring could be thinking along different lines.
``They could be looking at cable operators and considering giving
them significant up-front commitments in return for carriage
rights. Or they could be buying up smaller cable operators or
create some new company like At Home and partner with smaller cable
operators, who would do the marketing while MindSpring provided the
service,'' Chaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Charles Brewer is credited by many analysts with
building an executive team that is planning for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job Charles Brewer has done is exceptional,'' said Charles
A. Morris, manager of the T. Rowe Price &AMP; Science Technology Fund.
``He's to be commended.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morris also feels the next 18 months are going to be tough
times for MindSpring, Earthlink and other independent dial-up ISPs.
``We believe as we get into the high selling season in 1999, the
customers are going to be offered Internet service from their PC
manufacturer,'' Morris said. ``They will have a customer
relationship that's going to make it very difficult for consumer
ISPs.''
</P>
<P>
   In its registration filing, which listed no underwriters,
MindSpring said the securities could include common and preferred
stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription
rights, share purchase contracts to purchase common or preferred
shares, and share purchase units.
</P>
<P>
   Besides acquisitions, the company said the proceeds could be
used for additional working capital; capital expenditures; general
purposes; and to fund net losses and repay debt.

 &HT;    WebMD links with Lycos for $52.5 million
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD announced a $52.5 million deal Wednesday that
will give it exclusive rights to provide health information on the
Internet network of Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With the three-year pact, Atlanta-based WebMD took another leap
toward its goal of becoming the Net's first name in health
information. And while the company's first stream of business
revenue came from selling subscriptions and services to doctors,
entre to Lycos means access to millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which has one of the Net's best-used search engines
(http://www.lycos.com), claims nearly 30 million users. USA
Networks reaches about 70 million homes. Lycos users looking for
health data will soon be guided to a joint WebMD-Lycos site. WebMD
will also get advertising and promotions on USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, WebMD is paying for the audience
enjoyed on the Net by Lycos and on television by its soon-to-be
corporate parent, USA Networks, said Bob Davis, Lycos president,
who will become a WebMD board member as part of the deal. ``This
whole thing translates into audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD officials cited a recent survey by Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland,
which showed that Net users are three times less likely to seek out
a particular health site than to use a search engine like Lycos or
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos now offers a range of links and stories about health, as
well as many other subjects. WebMD's offering is more consistent
and sweeping, Davis said. ``There are too many places that show you
snapshots of information and not enough that give you something
comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's consumer offerings are free. But WebMD _ like Lycos _
sells advertising space on their Web pages. WebMD also sells
various products, many of them through partners. The greater the
number of visitors to the site, the more advertisers can be charged
and the greater profit likely to come from product sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to quarterback the health channel on Lycos,''
said WebMD founder and Chief Executive Jeff Arnold. ``It gives us a
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold shrugged off the investment of $52.5 million as a modest
expense when compared to the potential market WebMD is attacking.
``This business is not as difficult to project as one might think.
You just look at the markets in healthcare and information products
and the dollars being spent by consumers are enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD _ in business for only about six months _ has announced
plans for a public offering of stock. Like other deals WebMD has
recently forged, the Lycos announcement seems likely to bolster the
value of WebMD's coming offer.

BUSH LEADS FIELD OF LIKELY GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, POLL
INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas holds a commanding
lead among likely participants in next year's key Iowa Republican
presidential caucuses, a new poll finds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with 32.7 percent, led former Republican Cabinet official
Elizabeth Hanford Dole, at 14.7 percent, according to the survey by
PSI, a marketing and survey research firm, for four television
stations with Iowa viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing were former Vice President Dan Quayle, 7.3 percent;
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, 7 percent; and
columnist-commentator Pat Buchanan, 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other prospective Republican contenders polled less than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has a wide base of support among all age groups, both
sexes and Republican political activists,'' said PSI president
Craig Tufty, a former Iowa Republican operative.
</P>
<P>
   Tufty said Dole, who on Wednesday announced formation of a
national committee to explore a presidential campaign in Des
Moines, Iowa, was the only other ``genuine contender'' at this
point in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said 56 percent of Dole's votes go to Bush as a second choice
and 45 percent of Bush's votes go to Dole as a second choice.
</P>
<P>
   All the other possible contenders ``just fell off the end of the
earth,'' Tufty said.
</P>
<P>
   But the views of likely caucus attendees may give hope to some
of the candidates who are more outspoken about their conservative
views, especially their opposition to abortion, than Bush and Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Seven percent of respondents ranked abortion as the most
important issue, which ran closely behind the four leading issues:
Social Security, 11 percent, followed by taxes, morality and
education, 10 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the PSI poll a year before the Iowa caucuses
found Dole's husband, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, with a
giant lead, at 36 percent, 25 percentage points above the
second-ranked former Vice President Dan Quayle, who did not run in
1996 but is expected in the race for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 Iowa caucuses, Dole ran a lackluster first, with 26
percent, followed by Buchanan with 23 percent and Alexander with 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses historically have emphasized candidates' ability to
sell themselves directly to voters, often in small meetings, and to
organize on a grassroots, precinct-by-precinct basis.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not been in Iowa in the last two years, and Dole has
made four appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest poll, Bush led among male and female respondents
but more narrowly among women. With women, the race broke down Bush
29.6 percent, Dole 15.9 percent. With men, the split was Bush 35.8
percent, Dole 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   PSI made 5,857 random phone calls in Iowa to find the final
sample of 300 Iowans deemed likely to attend the Iowa precinct
meetings next February at the beginning of the presidential
nominating season. The final sample was polled March 4.

SHOULD SMALL LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES ADOPT A MORE PRACTICAL FOCUS TO
SURVIVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Endowments are up, and so are applications. At the nation's 550
small private liberal arts colleges, times have seemingly never
been better. So why do many educators fear for their future?
</P>
<P>
   In the winter issue of Daedalus, the quarterly journal of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, being mailed to subscribers
this week, several scholars warn that these institutions face a
serious quandary in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   One, Eva Brann, a former dean at St. John's College in
Annapolis, Md., goes so far as to call these institutions ``an
endangered species.'' And Paul Neely, a trustee of Williams College
who is publisher of The Chattanooga Times, writes that ``there may
simply be more pure liberal arts colleges than we need.''
</P>
<P>
   About half a dozen small private residential colleges close
their doors every year, and many others survive only by merging
with larger institutions. Furthermore, the number of accepted
students who eventually enroll _ a critical percentage that
educators call ``yield'' _ is as low as 30 percent at even some of
the most admired of these campuses, against well over 90 percent
for the Ivy League institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, educators _ and not just those writing for Daedalus
_ are posing a long-term question for the small liberal arts
colleges: Should they shift their focus from a high-minded,
education-for-its-own-sake approach to a more down-to-earth,
job-oriented curriculum featuring programs in subjects like
computer science, the global marketplace and accounting?
</P>
<P>
   More than a few have already made the shift. ``Pre-professional
programs are a definite trend in our schools,'' said David Warren,
president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities, which represents most of the nation's small four-year
residential liberal arts colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But others warn that the shift to a heavily pre-professional
curriculum will blur the distinction between the liberal arts
colleges and their less expensive competitors _ publicly supported
colleges and universities _ and thus weaken the private colleges by
drawing students away.
</P>
<P>
   At least two-thirds of the 550 colleges are almost unknown
outside their local communities, while a few _ like Williams,
Swarthmore, Haverford, Kenyon, Amherst and Wellesley _ are among
the best-known names in American education.
</P>
<P>
   Their principal selling point in the educational marketplace is
that their diminutive size _ most have only 1,800 to 2,000 students
_ permits faculty members to devote themselves to being teachers
and mentors; research and publishing are preoccupations mainly at
the big universities.
</P>
<P>
   The claim is only partly valid, since small-college professors,
like those at universities, are well aware that throughout academe,
professional advancement is largely based on research and
publishing and therefore are ignored at one's peril.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, universities argue that good researchers are
usually good teachers, and that students are energized by
association with professors working at the cutting edge of their
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, universities from Harvard on down assign
small-section discussion leadership to teaching assistants
(graduate students), a practice that the small colleges generally
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But small classes and one-on-one instruction are expensive _
maybe too expensive. Writing in Daedalus, Michael S. McPherson, the
president of Macalester College in Minnesota, and Morton Owen
Schapiro, a professor of economics at the University of Southern
California, report that the almost explosive growth of public
colleges and universities in recent decades has led to a steady
shrinking of the small private college customer base that is
``willing and able to cover the costs of the enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely, the Williams trustee who contributed to Daedalus, blames
``vocationalism, credentialism or even dollarizing'' on the part of
students for the financial stress.
</P>
<P>
   The small colleges most vulnerable to failure, he writes, are
the handful in the lowest economic tier that ``have not had the
resources to develop an additional, career-oriented curriculum''
that many students and their parents are now demanding.
</P>
<P>
   But paradoxically, Neely writes, most of the several hundred
small mid-level liberal arts colleges that have been able to
provide specialized, career-oriented training have done so at the
expense of low tuition, small classes, close faculty-to-student
relationships, competitive faculty salaries and painstaking campus
maintenance _ characteristics that have traditionally distinguished
these colleges from public ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even the small private colleges with national prominence are in
jeopardy, Neely warns, unless they can present themselves as
alternatives to a culture that chooses ``trends over permanence,
image over substance, money over values, and the market over
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   In agreement with Neely, Richard H. Hersh, president of Hobart
and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., warns against
``McUniversities _ learning malls catering to the whims of their
customers,'' and urges his liberal arts colleagues to provide
students with ``a coherent body of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the dangers faced by the small private liberal arts
colleges, most educators who have studied them conclude that their
special contribution to higher education is inextricably related to
their size.
</P>
<P>
   In a personal essay in Daedalus, Geoffrey Canada, president and
chief executive of the Rheedlen Center for Children and Families,
told how he as an African-American student was transformed in the
1970s by four years at the almost all-white Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about the smallness of Bowdoin that brought
about an intimacy that I will never forget,'' Canada wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cared about one another. Students would go out of their
way to help you if you needed it. A student who left school because
of poor academic performance, although a rare occurrence, was felt
to be a real loss,'' he continued. ``The faculty seemed to feel the
same way.''

<P>
   Since the paperless office has turned out to be a fantasy, there
have to be ways to get all those words and pictures on pieces of
paper into a computer. Thus, the scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, a scanner and a digital camera do the same thing.
Each takes an image and translates it into digital information that
a computer can store. Each uses a number of lenses and an
analog-to-digital conversion chip to convert an image into binary
bits. The difference is that scanners are made specifically for
processing images of documents, not images of people or vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mid- and late 1980s, when scanners first came to
market, they were predominantly the domain of graphic artists and
designers. As computer design became part of everyday business,
artists needed a way to store and manipulate things like
photographs and newspaper and magazine clippings.
</P>
<P>
   The first scanners mimicked the style and shape of a standard
photocopying machine. A large flatbed surface supports the document
that is being reproduced. But the machine produces a digital image
instead of a paper copy. Scanners can also be used with optical
character recognition software, which reads the image of a page of
text after it has been captured by a scanner, then translates the
image into the computer code that a word processor can read.
Without such software, a page of text is stored in the same way a
drawing or photograph is stored, as an image, not text.
</P>
<P>
   The technology used is generally the same from scanner to
scanner. A light source shines upon the selected document, and the
image is reflected through a series of mirrors. Then it passes
through a lens, which reduces the image and focuses it onto an
array of charge-coupled devices. A CCD, a semiconductor chip that
is sensitive to even tiny amounts of light, measures light
intensity and converts it into voltage.
</P>
<P>
   This CCD array is part of a circuit board that contains other
electronics as well. Through the use of color filters, the
information the array stores about the image includes the intensity
of each of three colors: red, green and blue. The colors and shapes
are translated into different patterns of voltages by the CCD
array. Through other chips, the voltage levels, which are analog
signals, are given digital values. In the end, that allows the
computer attached to the scanner (or the scanner itself, depending
on the system) to re-create the image.
</P>
<P>
   Scanners to satisfy all types of consumers are now available
from companies like Hewlett-Packard, Visioneer and Epson.
</P>
<P>
   Today's flatbed scanners are about half the size and weight of
the original models, but they are still the largest and most
cumbersome scanners. They remain the most popular because they
provide a clean, efficient way to handle a large volume of
documents, like newspaper articles and fragile family photographs.
Sheet-fed scanners are smaller and more compact because the
document is fed through a narrow slot in the middle of the device.
They are less versatile than flatbeds because a large object may
not fit through the slot and a small one might get crumpled. The
image quality tends to suffer, but frequent travelers find that it
is enough to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   For people who want more of a hands-on experience, handheld
scanners are the most portable of all. They are most often used to
scan small objects, like business cards or newspaper headlines; the
photosensitive strips tend to be only a few inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Canon and Hewlett-Packard have been introducing
more comprehensive, all-in-one scanning systems, which combine a
scanner, a fax machine, a printer and a copier into one device.
Because only one slot is included in the product, however, the
scanner is limited to a sheet-fed design. With all these new
scanners on the market, prices are dropping accordingly. Ten years
ago, a scanner might cost nearly $1,500; today, some can be had for
as little as $100. In addition, more consumer software _ like
greeting card programs, photo-manipulation packages and Web-page
creation tools _ takes advantage of digital imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Pershall, public relations manager for Hewlett-Packard
Scanjets, said that nearly 60 percent of the company's scanners
were purchased for home use. The most popular use for a scanner is
storing and transferring photographs, he said. It seems that the
family album is increasingly ending up online.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will always be those who find other uses for
the devices. Earlier this year in New York, in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn, a theater group performed a play in which an
actress used a handheld scanner to digitize herself onto a screen.
The resulting image, needless to say, was grotesque. Perfection in
digital imaging, alas, is not always the point.

Sussex County discovered garbage. Five years ago, it embarked on a

NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC CHAIR HINTS AT DOUBTS ABOUT GORE CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY _ The chairwoman of the New York Democratic Committee
suggested Wednesday that Vice President Al Gore may not be the
party's best choice for a presidential candidate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have high regard for Vice President Gore, I think we
do need to be mindful that in the past (vice presidents who run for
president) have not produced victories for the Democratic Party,''
Judith Hope said in a public radio interview. ``We simply need to
examine all the talent we've got and make certain we are going with
our very best talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Hiltzik, spokesman for the Democratic Committee, said
the party leadership believes Gore would ``make a fine president.''
He said Hope is, however, uncommitted to Gore or anyone else at
this early date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make certain we are going to go with our very best
talent,'' Hiltzik said. ``It is quite likely that Al Gore will be
the choice of Democrats in New York ... Al Gore has been a great
friend of New Yorkers. We trust our primary voters will make the
right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope was interviewed on the WAMC-FM program ``Capitol
Connection,'' a weekly political program.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, running the vice president has proven
unsuccessful for Democrats: both Hubert Humphrey, who was Lyndon
Johnson's vice president, and Walter Mondale, who served under
President Jimmy Carter, suffered crushing defeats in their bids for
the presidency. Johnson was the last Democratic vice president to
ascend to the presidency when he succeeded President John F.
Kennedy in 1963. A year later, Johnson was elected over Barry
Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, three Republicans who had served as vice president
became president _ although only one of them was elected to the
higher office while serving as vice president: George Bush. Richard
Nixon had served as President Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice
president, but lost the 1960 election to Kennedy. Ford inherited
the presidency when Nixon resigned, but was then defeated by
Carter. Bush went from the vice presidency under Ronald Reagan to
the presidency, only to lose a re-election bid to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on the program about Gore's Boy Scout image, Hope
responded: ``I do think that American voters like to vote for a
human being that they can identify with on some level. But they
also want someone whose lives are not greatly divergent from the
kind of lives that most others lead.''

COMEDY CENTRAL'S `THE DAILY SHOW': MORE ADULT (AS IN ADULTERATED)
NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Program airs Thursday night at 11 p.m. ET on comedy central) 
(bl) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky jokes worked. Last week, after Ms.
Lewinsky's astronomically high-rated ABC interview with Barbara
Walters, Jon Stewart reported on ``The Daily Show'': ``Lewinsky
said her liaison with Clinton was `the most amazing experience of
my life,' a description she had only previously given to reading
`Flowers in the Attic,' seeing `Phantom' on stage in Baltimore and
helping special-ed kids pull taffy at high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Show,'' Comedy Central's three-year-old half-hour
parody of a news broadcast, has always straddled the fence between
adolescent humor and grown-up wit. When Craig Kilborn was host, the
adolescence fit. Now that Jon Stewart has taken over (and
negotiated his name into the show's title), it doesn't. But Stewart
is so personable and so genuinely funny that he gets away with it.
And after two months on the job, he seems to be adjusting to the
mismatch. He's one of the writers now, and maybe the others are
finally getting the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 36, is never better than in self-deprecation mode. This
week, in defense of New Jersey, after a report that the state's
residents name sex only as their 10th-favorite activity, Stewart
said: ``Folks in New Jersey have plenty of sex. I didn't, but I
only lived there until I was 24.'' Beat. ``OK, 30.'' Beat. ``I
still live there.''
</P>
<P>
   And at times his Kilborn-like smirk is convincing. It worked
during a report on the complete cluelessness of IRS employees and
one on health maintenance organizations, which, having never heard
of psoriasis, are recommending only one treatment: shunning. But
then everybody hates the IRS and HMOs. The same is not true of,
say, archaeologists. Stewart recently referred to one who had
appeared on an opening-the-tombs special as ``trusted enough to be
allowed inside the pyramids but discredited enough to be working
for Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart often wears a sheepish look on camera, as if he were
being forced to make fun of people just to fit in with the other
guys at school, but he never seems embarrassed during the show's
four-minute celebrity interview.
</P>
<P>
   He's best when he has another person to play off and even does
well with guests who have little to say, like Ryan Phillippe,
plugging the film ``Cruel Intentions,'' and Jeri Ryan, who plays
Seven of Nine (a character name, not a fax-page notation) on ``Star
Trek: Voyager.'' He and Billy Crystal had such a good time that
Comedy Central turned the interview into a half-hour special
(Thursday night at 10:30). And when Stewart has a distinguished
guest, he gets humor just out of showing the proper respect. When
Ian McKellen appeared, Stewart suggested that if he won the
best-actor Oscar for ``Gods and Monsters'' and felt like saying in
his acceptance speech, ``I want to thank my wife, Jon Stewart,''
that would be just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Even the guests, however, aren't sure this is the right forum
for Stewart. Earlier this week, Jon Voight turned to the host and
said, with clear irony, ``This is such a high-level show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the humor really is idiotic. For an item about Barbara
Walters, Ms. Walters' photograph is shown with a mustache and horns
drawn in. The writers can turn almost anything, even an item about
cosmetic surgery, into a masturbation joke. In a book title, the
writers change the word ``public'' to ``pubic.'' When that gets a
big laugh, Stewart ad-libs, with appropriate dismay, ``I found the
level of the room.'' That may be a problem; sometimes his opinion
of the material seems at odds with his audience's. But at least he
does great asides.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not clear whether Stewart and ``The Daily Show'' will
turn out to be a beautiful marriage, but he's far from the show's
only asset. Its absolute fearlessness is what comedy is all about.
The writers are not afraid to joke about the most recent of deaths.
Thus, on Monday night Joe DiMaggio was called ``the man NBC tried
to kill two months ago'' (a reference to an unfortunate premature
death announcement), and it was announced that in the case of
Stanley Kubrick's death, HAL the computer was being questioned as a
suspect.

WANNA LOOK LIKE MONICA?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Monica at the Oscars, Monica authoring books,
Monica back in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And what about that fab lipstick and those great brows Monica
Lewinsky sported on her TV interview with Barbara Walters?
</P>
<P>
   All over town, women have been buzzing about the former White
House intern's new look. Especially the lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all of her makeup (including foundation) was from Club
Monaco, the trendy Canadian chain of boutiques. According to Club
Monaco's national spokesman Gerald Levac, Lewinsky was wearing
Bronze and Topaz eye shadows priced at $11 each; brow powder and
pencil at $10 each; a sheer, berry-hued lipstick called Glaze at
$13; and Bare lip liner, $10.
</P>
<P>
   That glossy smile created by makeup artist Denise Markey of the
Cloutier styling agency in Los Angeles got so much attention that
Club Monaco salesman Brian Choi, lamented, ``We're having a million
calls about that lipstick. Women, middle-age to teens, want it, but
we're already sold out.'' But he says the Beverly Hills location
should have more in stock by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's hairstyle was created by Richard Keogh, also of
Cloutier, and while it did force us to focus on her face, it got
mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   According to Keogh, Lewinsky wanted something sleek that would
be low-maintenance and nondistracting, so he trimmed her thick,
naturally wavy hair, then straightened it with an iron and sprayed
gel on it to keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   But he and the other artists weren't happy about those unplanned
shots from the back, or the fact that they weren't allowed to do
any touching up during the all-day filming. ``They never shot over
Walter's shoulder,'' he commented, adding that he'd like to give
Walters a new 'do as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the 70 million or so viewers who were fascinated with the
spiffed-up Lewinsky, that understated suit she was wearing was by
Tahari.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we didn't send it to her. She purchased the suit herself
at Bloomingdale's in Century City and paid $496 for it,'' said
Tahari spokeswoman Christina Juarez. In case you couldn't see the
entire suit, Juarez describes it as a classic indigo blue
reefer-style (long and lean) jacket over a slim pant, with a
lavender knit shell.
</P>
<P>
   So, come Oscar time, Lewinsky could wear another Tahari number.
Or maybe a Ralph Lauren gown, since the designer bought the Club
Monaco retail chain earlier this month. &QL;

MAKING BOOKS FOR VANITY AND OBSESSION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Publishers are not yet madly bidding against each
other for the rights to books about making movies, but quite
suddenly, it seems, these and other movie-related books are popping
up in numbers that no longer can be ignored. It's a genre about
vanity and obsession: the conceit of the moviemakers and the
infatuation of those who, to a great degree, get their culture in
the flickering darkness of the picture show.
</P>
<P>
   Movie scripts and the novelization of them have been a minor
publishing accessory for a long time, although they are getting
even more popular, particularly during the Oscar hype. What's new
in the genre's growth are what publishers call ``the making of'' or
the ``companion to'' books about the production of particular
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The two classics of the movie-set genus in controlling and
paranoid Hollywood were separated by 39 years. They are ``Picture''
(Rinehart, 1952) by Lillian Ross, about the making of ``The Red
Badge of Courage,'' and ``The Devil's Candy: `The Bonfire of the
Vanities' Goes to Hollywood'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1991) by Julie
Salamon. In each the writer had unlimited access to the production
and the reporting was rigorous and incisive, ultimately at times to
the dismay of the moviemaker who had been bold enough to open his
set.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been nothing in between or since that could be
called journalism in its most muscular form. Although the ``making
of'' books do provide interesting information for the movie fan or
the techie, they are mostly driven by the moviemaker's ego _
there's no critical analysis _ and are generally puffery, with
little tough reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for instance, in ``Titanic and the Making of James
Cameron'' (Newmarket Press) by Paula Parisi, a reporter and editor
of The Hollywood Reporter, a trade paper, the director is depicted
as a ``tempestuous auteur,'' a sort of combination Napoleon and
Humphrey Bogart. He is regularly described as a hero who does his
job amid confusion ``with the quiet intensity of a tightrope
walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times these books are subsidized, one way or another, by
studios. Esther Margolis, the president and publisher of Newmarket
Press, which almost specializes in movie-related books, said that
about half the titles she publishes have a guarantee by the studio
to buy so many copies. These are used for the studio's marketing,
as a way to showcase their movies for overseas distributors and for
home-video producers months before the movie is available. They
have to be approved by the moviemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometimes these books are best sellers. In the great popular
sweep of the movie ``Titanic,'' the debris in its wake included
``James Cameron's Titanic'' (Harper Entertainment), which sold more
than a million copies. It was a species of the ``making of'' genre,
which is the increasingly popular glossy movie coffee table book
with beautiful photographs from the movie set and some text that
gently discusses, for instance, the research that went into making
the movie authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first best seller in the genre was Ballantine Books'
1993 paperback ``The Making of Jurassic Park'' by Don Shay and Jody
Duncan. While the printings of most of these books stay within
about 10,000 copies, the genre has produced some big successes.
About 25,000 copies of ``The Men in Black'' (Newmarket Press) were
sold. In the book, the actor Tommy Lee Jones was said to have
``sought and found a deeper side to his character in the
screenplay,'' befitting a talented actor and a Harvard graduate,
and the director, Barry Sonnenfeld, wrote a foreword titled ``The
Aliens Are Us.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 copies of ``Saving Private Ryan: The Men. The
Mission. The Movie.'' (Newmarket Press) were sold, with about 5,000
bought by the movie studio for marketing. ``What makes them work is
the additional material we get from the scriptwriters and the
directors,'' Ms. Margolis said. Such cooperation is seldom
withheld, since the moviemaker has the final say on the book's
contents. A book, no matter how slight, is one of the great
validators: for a director or screenwriter to be interviewed as
Norman Mailer would be for a book is apparently a heady high.
</P>
<P>
   These books are not simply a matter of regurgitating the movie.
John Silbersack, the publisher of Harper Entertainment, said that
these ``making of'' books ``give a reader an appreciation that film
and television are genuine art forms,'' with their chatter about
production and screenwriting and special effects and with
interviews with directors and actors. Harper Entertainment does
book tie-ins with any studio, but mostly with its sister company,
Fox, a partner in the production of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant of this relatively small but growing part of book
publishing is Hyperion Books, a division of Disney, which publishes
not only books from Disney movies but also from movies of the
Disney-owned Miramax and Touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Miller, the Hyperion publisher, takes the high ground
on what can almost be called vanity press publishing. ``Miramax is
the only movie studio that has a brand name, in a sense, for
intelligent high-quality movies for adults,'' he said. One of the
Hyperion/Miramax Books spun off ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a Miramax
movie, is a small book of Shakespeare love poems, from the plays
and sonnets, with 57,000 copies in print. There are nearly 35,000
copies of the Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman screenplay in print.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion also benefits _ through Disney _ from the increasing
number of people who are becoming serious fans of animation
artwork. Thus its ``Art of the Lion King'' sold nearly 60,000
copies at $50 a pop, and 20,000 copies of ``Mulan'' at $60 each.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is but a lead-in to the tidal wave that will hit
book publishing in May when the first of the three Star Wars
prequels, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' will be in
the theaters, and Ballantine Books will have all its literary
satellites: the screenplay, the making of, the novelizations
(Ballantine has sold more that 13 million copies of the first Star
Wars novelizations), the picture books, the guide books, the
children's books. The entire galaxy, with 9-year-old Luke Skywalker
as King Arthur.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANUR, Indonesia _ From the taut streets of Jakarta to the tense
villages of East Timor, democracy is making unsteady progress in
this far-flung Asian country. But here on the tropical island of
Bali, democratic-style politics is bursting out with a joyful
clamor.
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia prepares for elections in June, its first
multiparty vote in four decades, Bali has become a swirl of waving
flags and banners. They hang from houses and shops and billow
behind trucks and motorcycles. On street corners, young people
noisily hawk T-shirts, caps and bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other parts of Indonesia, where excitement about the
election is tinged with fear that it could unleash violent social
unrest, Bali has no reservations. Having escaped the riots that
convulsed Java and other islands, people here are exercising their
new political freedom with cheerful abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Ketut, a 34-year-old auto mechanic in this
small coastal town, said as he manned a roadside stand festooned
with banners for a popular presidential candidate, Megawati
Sukarnoputri. ``We could never do this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketut, who like many Indonesians has only one name, is an ardent
supporter of Ms. Megawati. Throughout Bali the vast majority of
campaign paraphernalia champions the soft-spoken opposition leader,
who is the daughter of Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno.
</P>
<P>
   Bali is Megawati country. Her famous father was half Balinese,
and though Ms. Megawati lives in Jakarta, people here regard her as
a native daughter. Political analysts say her party, the Indonesian
Democratic Party, could carry 85 percent of the vote in Bali, which
has three million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megawati has a simple way, and people will follow her,'' said
Ketut Puja, a wood carver. Outside his shop he has hung a giant
party flag, with its distinctive glowering bull's head on a
blood-red background.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Balinese, Puja still bridles at the mention of
Suharto, the longtime leader of Indonesia, who was forced out last
May in a spasm of riots and economic despair. Puja said the coming
election was a chance to sweep out once and for all the remnants of
the Suharto government.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie, the aeronautical engineer who replaced
Suharto, is fighting to keep his job. But while he has tried to
distance himself from his predecessor and close friend _
overturning old policies and approving an investigation of
Suharto's huge wealth _ he has not been able to dispel the
impression that he is a crony of the disgraced former leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believes Habibie is a legitimate leader,'' Puja said
with a wave of his hand. ``He should go back to flying his
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the yearning for change, people here recognize that Ms.
Megawati and other challengers face an arduous struggle. Last week
the government licensed 48 parties to field candidates in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Megawati is one of three candidates with mass political
support. The others are Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of
Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, and Amien Rais, a Muslim
intellectual who gained prominence by opposing Suharto and recently
formed his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that despite Habibie's tarnished image,
it would be a mistake to write him off. He can still pull powerful
levers in the electoral process through the governing party,
Golkar. And he has won praise from people here and abroad for his
energetic handling of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is overconfidence among the Megawati supporters,'' said
Umar Juoro, an economic adviser to Habibie. ``The competition will
be very high among the political parties, and the president could
do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's president is chosen by the People's Consultative
Assembly, which has 700 elected and appointed members. For three
decades the assembly was a largely ceremonial body dominated by
Suharto. But now, some analysts predict that none of the
candidates' parties will be able to win a clear majority, which
suggests that Indonesia may be entering an era of coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Megawati's supporters predict that her party will win a
majority because she is a nonsectarian candidate at a time when
many people fear that tensions between religious groups pose a dire
threat to Indonesia's stability.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, fierce clashes between Muslims and Christians
have torn apart the Indonesian island of Ambon, about 1,000 miles
northeast of Bali. As the violence has worsened in recent days,
crowds of Islamic activists have marched in Jakarta, demanding that
the Indonesian Army protect the Muslims in Ambon. Some even called
for a jihad, or holy war, against the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megawati is the leader of the only party that represents
pluralism,'' said Laksamana Sukardi, one of her chief advisers.
``It is not a party based on race or religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a distinction matters in Bali, a predominantly Hindu island
in the middle of the world's most populous Muslim country. People
here believe that Bali has escaped social unrest because of its
religious homogeneity. But with the collapse of the national
economy, Muslims are migrating to Bali from nearby islands, and
that has prompted fears that the turmoil could flare up here.
</P>
<P>
   Sukardi said that when the Indonesian Democratic Party held its
convention here in October, attracting more than one million
people, provocateurs from outside Bali mingled in the crowd, trying
to stir trouble. He said the government had planted the
troublemakers to subvert the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the government did not want to see our congress go
smoothly,'' Sukardi said. ``They wanted to disgrace our image.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has been subverted before. In 1996
pro-Suharto forces engineered the ouster of Ms. Megawati as party
leader, and the police sacked the party's Jakarta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In Bali, at least, the campaign has been trouble-free so far.
But the Democratic Party is taking no chances. To bolster security
it has constructed roadside stands in almost every village here,
which are staffed by volunteers like Ketut, the mechanic. The
rough-hewn structures have become gathering places for young
people, who escape the tropical sun under the corrugated tin roofs.
</P>
<P>
   As they talk about the future, people agree that no matter who
wins the election, the new leader's top priority must be fixing
Indonesia's devastated economy. Although Bali's tourism industry
has sheltered the island from the full fury of the economic
typhoon, it has suffered as well. After plunging disastrously last
May, hotel occupancy rates here are still below pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem is the economy,'' said Puja, the wood carver,
as he chipped away meticulously on his next creation. ``The
government says things are changing, but the people are still
suffering.''

NASA PLANS REPAIR MISSION FOR HUBBLE TELESCOPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Astronauts will make an emergency shuttle flight to
the $3.8 billion Hubble Space Telescope in mid-October to replace
failing components in the mechanism that points the large
observatory at distant stars, NASA said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the shuttle Discovery, four veteran astronauts will
make three to four spacewalks to replace all six of the Hubble's
gyroscopes and make other repairs. All four astronauts have been in
training since mid-1998 for a Hubble servicing mission that had
been scheduled for June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, without an expedited visit by a shuttle repair crew,
NASA could be forced to call a halt to Hubble observations, said Ed
Weiler, NASA's chief space scientist. Those observations have
included faint galaxies on the frontiers of the universe, stellar
nurseries, black holes and other mysterious objects that have
become the hallmark of Hubble activities for the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The spin of the gyroscopes enables the telescope's computers and
other electronics to accurately point the telescope. Weiler and
others responsible for the 13-ton, five-story observatory stressed
that the spacecraft is in no danger of drifting away or plunging
through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency,'' Weiler said.
``We think of this as more of a science emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the gyroscopes must spin to maintain the
three-dimensional reference in space required by the telescope to
point precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Two gyroscopes have failed since the most recent visit to the
the telescope by shuttle astronauts in February 1997. A third
gyroscope faltered Jan. 25, and has been placed in a standby mode,
leaving the minimum needed for observations.
</P>
<P>
   Telescope engineers calculate an 80 percent likelihood of a
fourth failure if the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
waits until mid-2000 to send a shuttle crew.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have traced the problem to breaks in the two hair-thin
wires of copper and silver that supply electricity to the spin
motor of each gyroscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the telescope is working just fine and we see no
day-to-day impact in our normal science operations from any of
these issues with the gyroscopes,'' said David Leckrone, the
Hubble's senior project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But with the loss of a fourth gyroscope, ground control teams
would be forced to begin to curtail observations. When it finally
fails, the telescope will slip into an electronic slumber called
``safe mode.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the gyroscopes are at least 11-years-old and the oldest
is 14-years-old. Two of the three fully functioning gyroscopes are
among those originally installed on the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   NASA believes the mission will take nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The seven months it has to prepare for the flight will be the
shortest for any it has attempted, and there is a possibility NASA
could advance the launch into late September. The commander, pilot
and robot arm operator will be named later this week, joining the
spacewalking team of Mike Foale, John Grunsfeldand Steve Smith of
the United States, and Claude Nicollier of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This flight will be a challenge, I can tell you that,'' said
NASA's Linda Ham, who will serve as the lead flight director for
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Following a rendezvous at 360 miles above the Earth, the 50-foot
shuttle arm will be used to grab Hubble and carefully mount it on a
work platform in Discovery's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gyroscopes, the spacewalkers will install a
new flight computer on the telescope as well as a data recorder and
transmitter. They also are prepared to replace reflective
insulation on the exterior of the Hubble, which is deteriorating
from its long exposure to corrosive elements in the Earth's upper
atmosphere and to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior damage was a surprise when first detected by
shuttle astronauts who last visited the space telescope in February
1997. Smith was among them and participated in makeshift repairs
from materials the 1997 crew scrounged from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble has never been trouble free. The observatory was
launched in April 1990 after years of delay caused by the fatal
Challenger shuttle accident of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, NASA discovered that an optical flaw had escaped
detection before launching. It rendered the spacecraft near-sighted
and hurt the space agency's public credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the orbiting telescope was designed for regular
upgrades by visiting shuttle astronauts. NASA restored the losses
with a much-publicized rescue mission in December 1993 that
featured a record five spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Since them, the telescope has enabled astronomers to boast of
discovery after discovery. Those include almost irrefutable
evidence of super-massive black holes; images of dust disks around
distant stars that appear to be planetary systems in formation; and
the first image of a planet outside the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble is enabling astronomers to refine estimates of the age of
the universe and recently bolstered theories that the universe will
continue to expand without limit.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency recently decided to operate the telescope
through 2010 instead of phasing out operations five years earlier.
In addition to the emergency mission, shuttle astronauts will
return to the Hubble sometime between late 2000 and the spring of
2001 to install a powerful new camera, install new electricity
generating solar arrays and to replace the cooling system for the
powerful infrared detectors installed in 1997.

 &HT;    BellSouth venture aided by PageNet deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell

<TEXT>
<P>
   BellSouth reinforced its only national gambit Wednesday,
announcing a deal in which PageNet will market BellSouth's
interactive paging.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in May, Dallas-based PageNet will add BellSouth's pager
to its product list, using the names of both companies to sell the
service. BellSouth will also put some of its own sales staff in
PageNet stores and kiosks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is increasingly facing competition from companies that
are national and even global, and the company does have a strong
presence in Latin America. But BellSouth still reaps the lion's
share of its revenues from its local phone business in the nine
Southeastern states, where it has most of its wireless business as
well. That dependence looks _at least to some analysts _ like a
recipe for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   However, BellSouth's paging unit is based in New Jersey, and it
sells service throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive pager permits users to respond to e-mail and
other messages by typing on the device's keypad. The company's
major competitor in national interactive paging is Skytel.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For all the exotic locales through which the reader is
led in Alex Garland's two well-received novels, ``The Beach'' and
``The Tesseract,'' his personal coordinates seem comfortably local.
A native North Londoner, he shares an apartment with his girlfriend
in upmarket Belsize Park, just around the corner from the
downmarket state primary school he attended as a boy. His mother
lives across the way in one direction, and his father is
equidistant in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking out a lunch spot for an interview, his first choice was
a place prized for its bacon sandwiches, but it turned out to be
closed for the day. ``I could murder a bacon sandwich,'' he said,
no small threat, given the violence of his novels. But the violence
jars with the manner of the writer who conjures it. Settling for
pizza, Garland, 28, is relaxed, unassuming and vaguely hip in
maroon sweatshirt, ear stud and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   He hand rolls cigarettes slim as spindles to cut down on the
nicotine. His looks are Mediterranean, from a distant relative, a
Lebanese Maronite Christian on his mother's side. But his language
is London in the 1990s. One writer described his facial expression
as ``somewhere between impassive sulk and semi-hostile frown.''
</P>
<P>
   The impression from an interview is that Garland does not yet
trust his muse to stay with him. ``It could slip away easily; I
don't have doubts about that,'' he said. ``I'm aware that this is
not a career that comes with guarantees or security. But it's a
career I want to keep doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He does wonder what he will do if commercial success falters, he
said. ``I think I'll be a writer who doesn't get published.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland's startling, youthful talent was first manifest in ``The
Beach,'' set in Thailand and currently being made into a movie
starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Now, it is on display in ``The
Tesseract,'' just published in the United States by Riverhead
Books. A more sinewy second work that he's busily promoting on a
book tour, it takes place in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Garland's work places him in an arena of young and successful
British novelists, but authorship was not always his ambition. As a
graduate in art history from Manchester University, he began his
working life drawing comic strips until it occurred to him, he
said, that he would ``never be as good as my father,'' a cartoonist
for The Daily Telegraph. Those early days turned out to be
invaluable for the kind of writing through which Garland draws his
readers into his novels, offering snapshot, cinematic moments.
</P>
<P>
   He builds his plots, he said, with comic-strip storyboards in
mind. ``I leave a lot of gaps,'' he said, ``and in order for the
book to work, the reader needs to fill in those gaps. The reader
needs to engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers have engaged. After a slow start, ``The Beach,'' a
picaresque tale of young European backpackers seeking nirvana on a
Thai island and finding horror worthy of Conrad's ``Heart of
Darkness,'' sold 300,000 copies, he said. ``The Tesseract,'' a
multidimensional tale that fuses its disparate strands in a gory
shooting, jumped off to a faster start.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Asia as locale, Garland said, stems from the year
between his high school and university studies. A planned
three-month stay in the Philippines was extended to six months with
frequent return visits. Most recently, he said, he flew to Thailand
for a firsthand look at the controversy brought to the filming of
``The Beach.'' Environmentalists were protesting the moviemakers'
uprooting of a natural beach to remodel it as a movie-set beach.
The altercation did not trouble him, he said, because he thought
the environmental concerns exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it, and I thought, this is crazy,'' he said. ``And I
haven't really worried about it since.''
</P>
<P>
   Other things do worry him, though. Garland dislikes comparisons
between ``The Beach'' and William Golding's ``Lord of the Flies,''
which also deals with the unraveling of human values on a remote
island. Golding, Garland said, ``was writing about the breakdown of
a society,'' while that same societal collapse was ``the premise''
of ``The Beach.'' If he were going to be accused of following
another writer, he said, he would rather his work be compared to
J.G. Ballard's ``Empire of the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind people saying, he's just ripped off this writer
or that writer,'' he said, ``as long as they get the right
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence, too, has led to other unwelcome comparisons,
notably with Quentin Tarantino's movies. Garland cannot, he said,
see depictions of violence simply in a ``hip and ironic context''
because violence is invariably personal and painful. He bemoans the
glamorization of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence always has for me a particular kind of impact,'' he
said. ``I just try to convey that as honestly as possible. The
reason there's a lot of it in `The Tesseract' is that it does
interest me how people react to the same scene. The response to
violence can be clear-cut to some and not to others.''
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, a ``short book set in the Philippines'' and now
consigned to ``beneath the bottom drawer'' of his desk, proved a
lesson not just in rejection but also in the book trade. Without an
agent he sent his manuscript to a publisher, who sent it back with
a kindly note suggesting that he keep on trying and find an agent.
It was, he said, ``the most useful bit of advice'' he had been
given about building this new career.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, he said, very slowly and preferably at night. He
finds the art of composition ``obsessive,'' a characteristic that
infects another of his passions, computer games. His books have
been labeled cult classics, but Garland seems far more down to
earth about his perceptions of why people buy his books. ``Mainly,
it's people who want a book to read on the tube,'' he said.

 &HT;    Nova stock drops after CFO sells all of his shares
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nova Corp.'s stock plunged as much as 21 percent Wednesday after
the company's chief financial officer, James M. Bahin, disclosed
that he sold 251,911 shares _ representing all of his direct
holdings in the credit-card processor _ for nearly $7.5 million
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The stock fell to a 52-week low of $17.87 1/2 before rebounding
to finish at $21.87 1/2, down 87 1/2 cents. Nearly 1.6 million
shares changed hands, or seven times average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   The stock traded as high as $37.87 1/2 last July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Bahin said the sale _ at prices ranging from $29.66 to $29.77 on
Feb. 12 and Feb. 16 _ wasn't related to the company's prospects,
but rather to a desire to diversify his portfolio and for
retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have immediate plans to leave the company,'' said
Bahin, who joined Nova seven years ago from the old Fuqua
Industries. ``But I do have retirement plans that I hope to make
happen in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahin, who turns 55 on Sept. 11, said Nova began a search for
his successor several weeks ago. He said he will remain a director
of the Atlanta-based company, which processes credit-card
transactions for 480,000 merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Bahin said Nova's prospects remain bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on target in our operating plan,'' he said. ``Earnings
are on track.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Edward Grzedzinski, chairman and
chief executive, in a statement late Wednesday, confirming Bahin's
plans to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's fundamental business indicators remain strong,
with an expected 20 percent or better internal growth in the first
quarter,'' Grzedzinski said.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Nova posted fourth-quarter earnings that matched
Wall Street's expectations. Analysts generally expect the company
to earn $1.14 a share this year and $1.73 a share next year,
according to IBES International.
</P>
<P>
   Bahin said that, with the help of financial advisers, he began
diversifying his portfolio three years ago to include other assets,
such as real estate and fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   According to CDA Investnet, Bahin sold a total 627,400 shares
over the past three years for $15,711,560, including the latest
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, generally, it's very important not to be too heavily
weighted in one investment,'' said Bahin, adding that about half of
his net worth still is tied to the company. He is vested in options
entitling him to acquire 380,000 shares, many at $1.18 each. He
also has options to acquire an additional 185,000 shares. But those
options aren't vested yet, Bahin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable where I am right now,'' he said of his
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bahin, who has homes in Dunwoody and on Lake Hartwell in South
Carolina, said he plans to spend his retirement to ``fish and golf
and spend time with my three grandchildren.''

 &HT;    Southern sees natural gas as an 'advantageous addition'
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern Co. would like to add natural gas to its electricity
holdings, but ``it's not an imperative'' for achieving the
company's financial goals, said A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg, chairman,
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg said natural gas pipelines and storage would be an
``advantageous addition'' as the $300 billion-a-year utility
industry moves toward electricity and natural gas combinations.
But, he added, ``we would not add something at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern, the largest U.S. electricity generator, gets a vast
majority of its profits from five regulated utilities in the
Southeast, including Georgia Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   Adding natural gas assets would back up its growing U.S.
wholesale energy marketing arm as Southern expands into unregulated
utility businesses around the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg, in an interview, declined to comment on reports that
Southern held talks earlier this year with El Paso Energy Corp.
about acquiring the Houston-based natural gas company valued at
more than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A swirl of rumors last month about a possible combination of the
companies sent El Paso stock soaring and contributed to Southern's
recent downward trend. Southern's stock, which is down 15 percent
since the first of the year, hit a 52-week low Wednesday before
closing at $24.12 1/2, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two companies reportedly ended without a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg would not discuss ``market rumors'' about El Paso but
said he has met with the company's chairman, William Wise, just
like he has with chief executives of a long list of utility firms.
Other companies include Virginia-based Columbia Energy,
Birmingham-based Sonat, Consolidated Natural Gas of Pittsburgh,
Texas-based Houston Industries, PG&AMP;E of California and Williams
Cos. of Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to everybody,'' he said. ``It's not necessarily about
acquiring their business or acquiring a pipeline, but about trends
in the industry.'' He also said he's talked with companies about
possible ``synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dahlberg downplayed the significance of a natural gas
acqusition, a leading utility industry financial analyst said
acquiring such an operation would be ``very important'' for
Southern if it is to maintain or enhance its standing as a top
wholesale energy marketer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be competitive with Duke Energy and Houston
Industries, (which) have electricity and gas, you've got to have
gas,'' said Barry M. Abramson of PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's access to the commodity through its joint marketing
venture with Vastar Resources, a Houston-based natural gas company,
is not adequate, Abramson said. ``You need to acquire a natural gas
pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Energy, Coastal Corp. of Houston and Sonat have figured
in recent speculation as potential takeover targets in the natural
gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson said he's maintaining a ``neutral'' rating on Southern
stock because of uncertainty over a potential natural gas deal.
``We want to see what the next move is,'' he said. ``We assume a
major acquisition over the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dahlberg, who briefed Wall Street analysts last week and
heads to London and Scotland for meetings with investors later this
week, said Southern already has plenty on its plate for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to consummate $1.2 billion worth of
announced acquisitions of electric power plants in California and
New York, and is scheduled to start up a $1.4 billion plant in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg also said:
</P>
<P>
   Southern is sticking to wholesale and large industrial customers
and steering clear of mass marketing in its energy marketing
business. An energy management business, which included Federated
Department Stores as a client, ``probably didn't work as well as
many anticipated,'' he said. The company is letting contracts to
manage energy purchases expire and not signing up customers.
</P>
<P>
   He does not anticipate a write-down against earnings for
Southern's holdings in Asia like the company's $200 million
write-down last year to reflect decling value of South American
investments. ``We don't have any underperforming assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees no major push for electric utility deregulation in
Southern's Southeastern service territory because of relatively low
electricity rates. Recent problems with Georgia's natural gas
deregulation may ``give people pause,'' he said.

AMERICAN WOMAN IMPRISONED IN PERU SAID TO BE IN POOR HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Members of an American delegation who visited a
New Yorker sentenced to life in prison in Peru three years ago said
Wednesday that she appeared to be in poor health but was still
protesting her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   One delegate, the Rev. Lucius Walker of Pastors for Peace, said
the woman, Lori Berenson, had fingers that were ``purplish with a
kind of scratchy look'' and was suffering ``gastric problems'' that
he attributed to poor food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Ms. Berenson's family, the group was the first from the
United States permitted to visit her.
</P>
<P>
   Another delegate in the six-member group, Amy Goodman of
Pacifica Radio, said that Ms. Berenson's hands were purple, that
her face was very red and that she had circulatory, digestive and
vision problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman reported Ms. Berenson, 29, as saying she was
innocent of the charges of which she was convicted in Peru. In
January 1996, Ms. Berenson, who was working as a journalist in
Peru, was convicted of treason and sentenced to life in prison for
planning terrorist acts. She was tried before a secret military
court presided over by a masked judge and was not allowed to
present evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter written in Spanish to human rights organizations
that the delegation released, Ms. Berenson denied that she was a
member of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a terrorist
group, and said she had never planned violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   After two and a half years at the Yanamayo maximum-security
prison 12,500 feet above sea level, where she developed health
problems, Ms. Berenson was moved to the Socabaya Prison, where she
was in solitary confinement for 115 days.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission has classified her jailing as
``arbitrary detention.'' The Human Rights Commission of the
Organization of American States has agreed to hear her case against
Peru, and Amnesty International and other rights organizations have
protested her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of U.S. senators and 180 House members have signed
petitions for a fair trial for Ms. Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   Delegation members criticized the Clinton administration and the
State Department for not having tried more forcefully to have her
freed. They said that the U.S. ambassador in Lima, Dennis Jett,
refused to visit her and that she had just four consular visits a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest State Department report on human rights in Peru,
issued on Feb. 26, has a passing reference to Ms. Berenson. The
report notes that Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra called for
her release and expulsion to the United States in June but was
overruled by President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the Peruvian judicial system is ``inefficient,
often corrupt,'' and that it ``has appeared to be easily
manipulated by the executive branch.'' The document also describes
prison conditions as ``extremely harsh, particularly in
maximum-security facilities.''

 &HT;    CLINTON PROPOSES EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL CENTRAL AMERICAN
IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects quotes in 15th graf and deletes next graf (both
before the optional add)
 &HT;    With optional add begins at 650 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ President Clinton, addressing
lawmakers assembled in El Salvador from across Central America,
said Wednesday he would seek to make it easier for refugees who
fled political oppression in the region -- regardless of the type
government -- to obtain permanent residency status in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here later from El Salvador, however, and tried to
heal old wounds by acknowledging the U.S. role in supporting
repressive military regimes in Guatemala during the 1980s and the
first half of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support for military forces or intelligence units which
engaged in violent or widespread repression was wrong, and the
United States must not repeat that mistake,'' Clinton said at a
roundtable of Guatemalan civic leaders to discuss the nation's
recent peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The president further urged that the United States be viewed
``in a new way, as a partner, a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement came two weeks after a Guatemalan truth
commission released a report detailing that U.S. policy was pivotal
to state-sponsored genocide against Mayan peasants during the war,
in which an estimated 200,000 died. A 36-year civil war between the
army and leftist rebels, which ripped Guatemala apart, ended as
recently as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the past U.S. involvement, about a hundred
demonstrators protested Clinton's arrival here from El Salvador.
They carried signs decrying genocide, murder, oil companies and
poor wages.
</P>
<P>
   The president will complete his four-day goodwill mission to
Central America Thursday with a summit of regional presidents here
in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, in an address to the Legislative Assembly of
El Salvador, Clinton said he would support equal treatment for
refugees from the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been reviewing the 1997 immigration law
which granted amnesty to some 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees who
arrived prior to 1996 to determine whether it can also apply to
refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The law was aimed at refugees from Nicaragua and Cuba who fled
communist regimes. It made it easier for refugees who fled
right-wing dictatorships in El Salvador and Guatemala before
October 1991 to apply for permanent status, but was not as generous
as to those who fled communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of those countries have been urging a change in U.S.
policy to allow the refugees to remain. They argue that the money
sent back to the region from those refugees is an important source
of revenue for Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in response to Hurricane Mitch, Clinton gave
refugees from Nicaragua and Honduras an 18-month amnesty from
deportation to relieve those countries from absorbing the returning
citizens at a time of economic difficulty. He also granted a 60-day
amnesty to Guatemala and Salvadoran refugees. That period ended
Monday, but none are scheduled to be deported this week.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's expiration of a temporary amnesty program, nearly
3,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala face
deportation. They are seeking parity with Nicaragua and Honduras,
covered by more liberal rules.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Salvadoran assembly, Clinton pledged to
urge Congress to support equal treatment for all Central American
refugees, as well as through administrative changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything I possibly can to overcome that different
treatment, `` Clinton said. ``Our treatment of people from Central
America should reflect what they suffered rather than who caused
the suffering. This is wrong and we should change it''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Central American leaders to give every child a
chance to go to school; adopt environmental practices to avert the
deforestation which may have caused the mudslides that killed 2,000
people in Nicaragua; and crack down on the transportation of
illegal drugs through the region.
</P>
<P>
   For education, Clinton announced an $8 million grant to enable
countries in Central America to enroll more children in schools and
keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the region's civil wars have been replaced by
democratically elected governments throughout Central America,
Clinton said ``we have a solemn obligation to deliver democracy''
for today's children.

NEA CANCELS FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S BOOK WRITTEN BY ZAPATISTA
LEADER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ It is a whimsical tale of how the macaw got
its colors, a Mexican story told by a character named Old Antonio
deep in the jungle of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   So engaging are the mythical text and vibrant illustrations of
``The Story of Colors'' that a small El Paso, Texas, publishing
house won a highly competitive grant from the National Endowment
for the Arts to print 15,000 bilingual copies.
</P>
<P>
   But with the books hot off the press, the chairman of the NEA on
Tuesday received some troubling news. The author is Subcomandante
Marcos, the quixotic, witty, literary leader of the Zapatista
guerrilla movement in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Marcos was hiding behind a pen name. His name appears
on the book's cover, and its jacket features a photograph of Marcos
in his signature black ski mask, with bullets slung around his
chest in the best tradition of Mexico's revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Told of this by The New York Times, NEA Chairman William Ivey
promptly canceled the $7,500 grant, leaving El Paso's Cinco Puntos
Press with no money to pay its printer. Wary of Republican attacks
that in past years almost led to the death of the government's arts
funding source, Ivey worried that some taxpayer money might get
back to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was clearly an inappropriate use of government dollars,''
Ivey said Wednesday from NEA headquarters in Washington, D.C. ``I
was concerned about the final destination of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   How could this have happened after the NEA's yearlong screening
process, ``one of the most rigorous in the arts world,'' according
to spokeswoman Cherie Simon? ``This is unique, one in a million,''
Simon said. ``Nobody can remember anything analogous to this, and
we wouldn't expect it to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is little comfort to Bobby Byrd, co-publisher at
Cinco Puntos, who accused Ivey of caving in when he received a
phone call from a Times reporter questioning the book.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said that at every step of the lengthy grant application
process he told NEA officials that Marcos had authored the
children's book. He said money from the project was never intended
for the Zapatistas. Marcos meant the tale for the public domain,
Byrd said, including it in a 1994 communique from Mexico's Lacandon
jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivey made a spineless decision without accumulating all the
facts,'' said Byrd. ``He completely disregarded the panel's work.
The NEA is making decisions based on its fears and not standing up
for the literature that it is supposed to be nurturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though NEA spokeswoman Simon said the content of ``The Story of
Colors'' had nothing to do with the decision not to fund it, the
book is a bit of a departure from mainstream children's literature
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with Marcos lighting his pipe and Old Antonio rolling
a cigarette. Antonio sets out to tell the story of a world of only
black and white, where the ``men and women were sleeping or they
were making love, which is a nice way to become tired and then go
to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the book's somewhat sensuous themes, Mexican
Indian artist Domitila Dominguez includes a picture of a naked
woman in what seems to be a sexual embrace with a male god.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, which is based on a Mayan creation myth, the macaw
at first is almost colorless. Then the gods begin to fight because,
with only black and white, the world is a boring canvass to paint.
</P>
<P>
   So, the story goes, the gods create red, green, brown, blue and
yellow. Then, goes the text, they ``drank some corn liquor and went
to sleep,'' leaving the colors in a box underneath a ceiba tree.
</P>
<P>
   But since the box is not closed tightly, the colors escape and
``start to play happily and make love to each other,'' creating new
hues. Finally the gods take all the colors and, fearing they might
forget the vast array of hues, pour them on the feathers of the
macaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was how the macaw took hold of the colors,'' the book
reads, ``and so it goes strutting about just in case men and women
forget how many colors there are and how many ways of thinking, and
that the world will be happy if all the colors and ways of thinking
have their place.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a jacket note by Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, a
socially conscious pop duo, the text does not address the
Zapatistas. In her note, Ray calls the ``The Story of Colors'' a
reminder that ``the Zapatista movement is one of dignity that
emanates from the grass roots of the indigenous people of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the Zapatistas waged an armed uprising against Mexico
but have since favored less violent tactics in their quest for
social justice. Ironically, Marcos, whose real name is Rafael
Sebastian Guillen Vicente, is the only non-Indian among Zapatista
leaders. He is a former university professor.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos' tale, known as ``La Historia de los Colores,'' in
Spanish, was published in 1997 by a group known as Colectivo
Callejero. Byrd happened upon the story at a book fair in
Guadalajara, Mexico, and last March proposed that the NEA fund its
translation.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal included four other books, for which together with
``The Story of Colors'' he sought a $30,000 grant. When the NEA cut
that amount in half during the final stages of the grant
application process, Byrd scaled back his projects to just two
books, one of them the story by Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   With the grant approved last month, but the NEA money not yet in
hand, ``The Story of Colors'' went to press with an initial run of
5,000 copies. It appears with a seal that says it is funded in part
by the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   Though Byrd is out $7,500 for that book, the publisher and poet
is not altogether worried. He believes the publicity surrounding
the Marcos flap will help sell the controversial book, and is
already predicting that his independent publishing house will have
to print more copies of the 40-page book selling for $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   But for the record, Byrd is angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivy says this is not a censorship issue,'' said Byrd,
referring to the NEA chairman. ``Well I say it certainly is.''

JAILED GANG LEADER WINS RIGHT TO MINGLE WITH 3 NOTORIOUS FELLOW
INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mont., Okla.)  (wg) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the nation's most infamous terrorists _ the
Oklahoma City bomber, the Unabomber and the World Trade Center
bomber _ are ordered out of solitary confinement so that they can
have one hour of exercise in the nation's most secure federal
prison, what do they do?
</P>
<P>
   They apparently just chat.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a fourth notorious prisoner, the convicted leader of
the Latin Kings gang, has successfully petitioned to join in, even
though he is considered so dangerous that he cannot even write to
anyone except his close relatives and his lawyer. A federal judge
decided that there was no harm in letting the man, Luis Felipe,
take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the oddest coffee klatsch in the history of western
civilization,'' said Steven M. Cohen, a former prosecutor on the
case who now works in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   The four inmates share little in common ideologically. Timothy
McVeigh is a right-wing extremist convicted of carrying out the
Oklahoma City bombing, while Ramzi Yousef is a Muslim terrorist who
masterminded the World Trade Center attack. Theodore Kaczynski is a
mathematics whiz and loner whose string of bombings was carried out
from the woods of Montana, while Luis Felipe is a Bronx street
tough known for his ruthless hold _ even from prison _ on a
Hispanic gang. Felipe was convicted in 1996 on 18 counts of federal
racketeering charges for ordering three murders.
</P>
<P>
   The four are being held 23 hours a day in special 7-by-12-foot
cells where they are not able to glimpse into the eyes of other
prisoners and must take their meals through slots in their cell
doors. The prison, the ADX Maximum Security Facility in Florence,
Colo., is so secure that it is known as Super Max.
</P>
<P>
   The three charter members of the prison rec group, McVeigh,
Kaczynski, and Yousef, who are otherwise allowed no contact with
each other, are permitted to spend their one-hour exercise period
in separate cages in the prison yard, speaking to each other
through the mesh fences. Because of their distance from each other,
they must speak loudly, so prison officials can hear what they say.
</P>
<P>
   But their prison colleague, Felipe, who has been serving a term
of life plus 45 years, had not been included. In ruling that he
could be, the judge in the case, John S. Martin Jr. of U.S.
District Court, concluded that he did not ``perceive any
substantial danger'' in allowing Felipe to join in the fence talks
with McVeigh, who is awaiting execution for the 1995 Oklahoma City
bombing that killed 168 people, or Kaczynski, who is serving a life
term for his deadly letter bomb campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge drew the line at Yousef, who is serving a sentence
of life plus 240 years for masterminding the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing, which killed six people and wounded hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence at Yousef's trial, Martin said, ``suggests that,
like Felipe, he is part of a larger organization. Thus, there is
some danger that Felipe might try to use Yousef to convey messages
out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Felipe's treatment in prison has become the focus of debate over
what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In past rulings, the
judge not only barred Felipe from having any contact with other
prisoners but said he could not write to anyone or have visitors,
except for his lawyer and close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, his lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, felt that Felipe
should have contact with his fellow prisoners. Feitell wrote to the
judge that he had seen on a television news program that McVeigh,
Kaczynski and Yousef were allowed to have their daily exercise
chats in the prison yard. He asked that Felipe be allowed ``to
share'' with the three famous bombers ``in their outdoor mutual
recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government strongly opposed the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``While _ in the view of prison officials _ McVeigh, Kaczynski
and Yousef are unlikely to communicate any messages for Felipe,''
two prosecutors, Richard Zabel and Alexandria A.E. Shapiro, wrote
to the judge, ``it is difficult to justify allowing his first
contacts with other prisoners to be with such relatively
sophisticated and dangerous individuals, only two years after he
was sentenced.''
</P>
<P>
   Feitell said that he was pleased with the ruling because his
client was deteriorating under the harsh prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felipe has virtually refused to come out of his cell and has
isolated himself,'' Feitell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Felipe now does not want to speak with the bombers or
any other prisoner, and wants to be deported to Cuba. The court's
ruling may help with his socialization, Feitell added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that Felipe takes advantage of the opportunity to
communicate verbally with human beings who are in a similar
situation,'' he added.

DOLE FORMS PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ With a description of what she would offer
the nation ``as a woman,'' Elizabeth Hanford Dole put her
Republican presidential campaign on the same official footing as
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, Bush's chief competition in the early running for the 2000
nomination, announced at a public rally that she is starting an
exploratory committee, which can raise and spend political money
without her declaring that she is definitely a candidate. Bush
launched his committee Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But like Bush, Dole left little doubt that she will run for the
White House, were she served as transportation secretary under
President Bush and as labor secretary under President Reagan.
Supporters at the rally were asked to fill out postcards, paid for
by the committee, that say, ``Yes, Elizabeth, I want to help you in
your run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of Republican voters, 11 months before any primary votes
are cast, show Bush and Dole as the dominant candidates. That
status gives Dole the realistic chance of being the first woman
nominated for the presidency by a major political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I, as a woman, offer our country? I'm not a
politician and frankly I think that's a plus today,'' she said,
triggering loud applause from an overflow crowd at a downtown
convention center. ``But I have spent a lifetime in public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have experience in government and, believe me,
I've had a lot of that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, resigned as president of the American Red Cross in
January to germinate her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her nonpolitician label aside, Dole mentioned that she has
visited all 99 counties of Iowa, the site of the pivotal
presidential caucuses early next year, on behalf of other
candidates. Her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, lost the 1996
presidential election to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's campaigned out here at least since 1979,'' national GOP
official Steve Roberts of Des Moines told the crowd. ``We want her
to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of her speech to the 1996 Republican National
Convention on behalf of her husband, Dole roamed her own audience
Wednesday, speaking through a wireless microphone in the style of
TV talk-show hosts. On the stage behind her were photographs from
her career: Dole snow skiing, standing with Reagan, hugging
children, posing with military officers and riding a motorcycle
with comedian Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I place public service over politics, consensus over
confrontation, and I think it's important that you know that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing her work with the American Red Cross and the
federal government, taking credit for making airline travel and the
national blood supply safer, Dole offered the bare beginnings of
her campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   America needs tax relief, its military defense budget is too low
and a strategic missile defense system is needed to protect against
nuclear weapons from countries such as North Korea, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must return our public schools to greatness'' and renew the
government's campaign against illegal drug use by the young, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she will supply details on these issues later,
``because we want to do it in a thoughtful way.''
</P>
<P>
   She said voters have become cynical about politics because it is
dominated by ``special interests,'' but was no more specific about
that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Introductory speakers cast Dole as a role model for the country.
Their statements dove-tailed with a videotaped Dole speech being
circulated in some early primary states. Alluding to President
Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal, Dole says in the speech: ``I
believe our people are looking for leaders who will call America to
her better nature. Yes, we've been let down, and by people we
should have been able to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's campaign committee paid for the 14-minute videotape to
air on TV stations in Iowa and New Hampshire, host of a key primary
in February, starting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both states were the location for bitter political battles
between her husband and the Texas governor's father. Both ran for
the 1988 nomination, captured by then-Vice President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This year's polls have shown Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush
running virtually even among New Hampshire Republican voters. In
Iowa, a similar independent survey conducted March 4 showed Bush
ahead of Dole, 32.7 percent to 14.7 percent. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; A national Gallup poll released Wednesday showed Dole with a
narrow lead, 50 percent to 45 percent, in a one-on-one match with
Democratic Vice President Al Gore. Bush had a 56 percent to 41
percent lead over Gore in a one-on-one race.
</P>
<P>
   The poll said four out of 10 Americans think a man would make a
better president, citing the tradition and their emotional makeup,
and three out of 10 said a woman would be better at the job, noting
their common sense, compassion and the need for a change.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's rally, Dole underscored her role as the lone
woman in the race by walking a few blocks to shake hands at a state
high basketball tournament for girls' teams.
</P>
<P>
   She was to make stops in Arizona and New Hampshire this week
before returning Saturday to her hometown, Salisbury, N.C.

QUEBEC ISSUE BRINGS CANADA BOYCOTT OF PARIS MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Staging a tantrum over what seemed diplomatic small
potatoes, Canada Wednesday boycotted an international meeting in
Paris to protest what it considered an untoward sign of diplomatic
respect given to Quebec separatists by the French government.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of bizarre news conferences, Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy implied that France had insulted Canada and had violated
diplomatic protocol by extending a ``government-to-government''
invitation to Quebec to a ministerial meeting on development and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think France would be happy if Canada organized a
meeting and invited Corsica,'' Axworthy told reporters, referring
to the French island in the Mediterranean where there is separatist
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble was the latest in a string that started in 1967,
when President Charles de Gaulle stood on the balcony of Montreal's
City Hall and exhorted, ``Vive le Quebec Libre!'' (Long Live Free
Quebec). The rallying cry warmed the hearts of Quebecers _ and put
a chill on France-Canada relations that lasted for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Canada was similarly unamused when France proposed issuing a
stamp honoring de Gaulle's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec is the only Canadian province dominated by
French-speakers, and the Parti Quebecois government of Premier
Lucien Bouchard makes no bones about its desire to cut political
ties with Ottawa and to form a sovereign republic.
</P>
<P>
   France hedges on how actively it supports the separatist
movement. But Paris has pledged to extend diplomatic recognition to
an independent Quebec, this to the huge irritation of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Canada's show of petulance Wednesday was startling,
mainly because it was so public _ with angry utterances in
Parliament, faxes sent to foreign correspondents covering Canada,
supposedly impromptu news conferences by fuming politicians and a
formal protest to the French government from Canada's embassy in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is an independent country, and there are international
rules to be followed, and France did not follow those rules,''
thundered Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a French Quebecer but also
an ardent federalist.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec separatist leaders, meanwhile, were laughing at Ottawa's
discomfiture. ``I'm surprised Canada would boycott an international
meeting just because Quebec is present.'' said Quebec's
International Affairs Minister Louise Beaudoin. ``It's very
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   According to diplomatic protocol, invitations to
nation-to-nation meetings should be extended only to national
governments, so France technically may have made a boo-boo. But the
session in Paris was hardly a major session, and bemused French
officials insisted no slight was intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're talking about some super meeting of
sovereign states,'' said Louis de Corail, spokesman for the French
Embassy in Ottawa. ``It was more of an informal get-together, with
artists and so on.''

 &HT;    Amazon.com, Dell link in Web venture
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Hoping to build on the Internet's promise of
shopping convenience and product customization, Dell Computer Corp.
and Amazon.com Inc. unveiled joint Web pages Wednesday to lure each
other's customers to each other's Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The links, located at the check-out pages at each company's Web
sites, go to co-branded pages that contain information about
products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Chief Executive Michael Dell said Wednesday both companies
want to exploit the Web to develop deep relationships with
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell and Amazon.com will each offer our mutual customers
customized services, competitive price, and easy navigation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies operate two of the most active electronic commerce
sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which had $728 million in sales last year, is the most
popular electronic commerce site with more than 9 million different
visitors a month, according to Media Metrix Inc., a research
company. Dell has more than $14 million a day in online sales,
which projects to about $5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement, which Dell described as a ``statement
of direction'' rather than groundbreaking news, means each company
gains initially by exposure to each other's customers.
</P>
<P>
   After the exposure, tailored sales pitches based on customer
interests are likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be providing Dell customers with a very focused,
customized content experience,'' said Amazon.com Vice President Ram
Shriram.
</P>
<P>
   For Dell, linking with Seattle-based Amazon.com is part of
long-held strategy of developing the Internet as a sales tool,
while developing partnerships with existing businesses rather than
building one from scratch or buying one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had every opportunity to pursue that and chose not to,''
said Bob Langer, director of Dell.com.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com shares closed at $137.12 1/2, up $7.18 3/4 in Nasdaq
trading Wednesday. Dell's shares were off 75 cents to $43.31 1/4,
also in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   An example of how the companies may work together is that
customers who buy a notebook computer from Dell may receive e-mail
from Amazon.com containing titles of books about mobile computing,
said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies in Campbell,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While that doesn't break new ground, it opens the way for
sharing more information that would allow each company to
personalize sales information to each other's customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going into it as if they're in a trial marriage,''
Bajarin said. ``They're saying, 'I'll share a little bit of
information, you share a little bit. If it works out, we'll share a
lot.'''

 &HT;    Bill would give businesses statewide a 5 percent credit on their
state franchise taxes
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Efforts to give Texas business interests a much
wanted tax break for spending on research and development took a
big step forward Wednesday thanks to a legislative proposal that
has the backing of an unusual alliance of border Democrats and
business-oriented Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal, by Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, would give
businesses statewide a 5 percent credit on their state franchise
taxes to offset spending for research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Two other tax credits, designed to help create jobs and foster
investments in machinery and equipment, would apply in 92 of the
state's 254 counties with above-average unemployment and below
average personal income. Most of those counties are along the
Mexican and Louisiana borders, and none are in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incentives will help Texas compete nationally and even
internationally for jobs and investments,'' Sibley said at a press
conference. ``By directing development toward economically
distressed areas of the state, the state as a whole will become
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   If they become law, the tax credits would cost state government
about $100 million in the next two-year budget cycle and about $725
million in the 2006-2007 budget cycle. The credits would expire in
2007.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, a spokesman for Motorola Semiconductor Product Sales
in Austin, said the company had not yet studied Sibley's proposal
in detail but that earlier estimates indicated the company would
save $1 million a year in Texas with the research and development
tax credit _ money, he said, that could be plowed back into more
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tax credits come not a moment too soon, said Jerry
Marlar, president of Austin-based Sulzer Orthopedics Inc. Sulzer
Orthopedics and a sister company, Sulzer Carbomedics, are working
in a new field of biomedicine in which substances derived from cows
are used to stimulate human tissues, such as the gums or along the
spine, to regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   Sulzer now has researchers in Texas and Colorado but intends to
put them together in one place _ along with a new manufacturing
plant that within five years will employ up to 600 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have a lot of competition,'' Marlar told the Senate
Finance Committee during a hearing on Sibley's bill.
``Specifically, I am telling you Colorado is being very
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlar said Colorado officials, including the governor, offered
him a number of tax incentives to locate the new facility in that
state. Texas has done nothing, though local officials are working
with him, Marlar said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Marlar noted, Sibley's legislation would provide him
only a research and development tax break. The other tax breaks
would not apply because Travis County is not among the 92 counties
that would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Given the insistence of many lawmakers that the state should do
more for its economically lagging areas, Sibley's proposed
legislation may be the biggest tax break business interests can
expect _ but he would appear to have a good chance of winning
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him at the press conference to tout the bill were Sen.
Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, and two Democratic senators representing
border areas, Eddie Lucio of Brownsville and Eliot Shapleigh of El
Paso. Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, is a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Also in support is Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, chairman
of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, who said he had
filed it in the House. Praising Sibley's leadership in drafting a
compromise, Oliveira said,
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to see it on a bi-partisan basis. And it's not a
border bill; it's a Texas bill.''
</P>
<P>
   If somebody got left out, it was lawmakers representing poor
areas of otherwise prosperous counties that would be excluded from
the investment and job creation tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said that ``it won't be easy'' to
support the bill as proposed but that he expected to submit an
amendment that would extend the tax credits to low-income areas.
Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, a member of the Finance Committee,
raised similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Lavine, an analyst with the Center for Public Policy
Priorities, said he could support the tax breaks as a package
because it would help create job in struggling areas. But he said
the center, which seeks to represent the interests of low-income
Texans, could not support such items as the research and
development tax credit alone.

 &HT;    Wrestlers pump up T-shirt printer's trade
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Superstar grappler Bill Goldberg and the galaxy
of World Championship Wrestling villains and heros were a bonanza
for Littlefield, Adams &AMP; Co. last year as sales and profits of the
Huber Heights T-shirt imprinter exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield, Adams watched as its revenues ballooned to $25.9
million in 1998, compared with $2.5 million the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Profits of the publicly traded company (OTC BB: FUNW) jumped to
$2.6 million, or 60 cents per share, versus a net loss of $1.9
million, or 70 cents a share, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Balber, president and chief executive, said the
turnaround dates to April 1998 when the company signed a licensing
agreement with World Championship Wrestling and New World Order,
another wrestling series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success is due in great part to the popularity of
wrestling,'' said Balber, whose company employs 55 workers at a
T-shirt and garment imprinting plant at 6262 Executive Blvd. ``We
started shipping last May.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping retailers stocked with WCW T-shirts and related apparel
imprinted with photos of Goldberg, the Nitro Girls and the Four
Horsemen has kept Littlefield, Adams busy and prosperous, Balber
said. This year the company bolstered its portfolio by signing a
cross-licensing agreement with Warner Brothers to produce T-shirts
featuring WCW wrestlers with cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny,
Yosemite Sam and ``Taz,'' the Tasmanian Devil.
</P>
<P>
   The company's WCW contract runs another 2 1/2 years, Balber
said, and he believes the licenses can be extended further.
</P>
<P>
   He said the WCW product wasn't available for licensing until
last year. ``When it came up we jumped all over it. We had to
outbid a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Littlefield Adams licenses include The Simpsons and King
of the Hill cartoon characters and Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The company went into a tailspin two years ago when a lucrative
Harley-Davidson license expired and was not renewed. Harley decided
to withdraw its logo from mass marketers such as Wal-Mart and
Kmart, Balber explained.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield, Adams shares were listed on the American Stock
Exchange until the Harley-Davidson license expired. ``We
voluntarily got delisted after we looked at our forecast and saw
that our prognosis was very bad,'' Balber said. ``Now we're trying
to get on the NASDAQ Small Cap list.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield, Adams shares closed Wednesday at 4, up 3/4. The 52
week trading range is just over 2 to 6 1/8.

FINDING MODERN TOUCHSTONES IN A CORSETTED IBSEN CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March 14) 
(bl) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ever since Henrik Ibsen wrote ``Hedda Gabler'' in
1890, the role has tantalized and lured actresses. The tragedy,
about a bored, vengeful wife on the edge of madness, has been
interpreted, with various degrees of Freudian and feminist
shadings, by Eva Le Gallienne, Geraldine Page, Maggie Smith, Glenda
Jackson, Jane Alexander and Dianne Wiest, among others. ``What
Hamlet is to men, Hedda is, in some ways, to women,'' said Annette
Bening, the latest Hedda, who has found the role the most complex
and haunting of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping a fruit drink one recent morning at a table in the Bel
Air Hotel dining room, Ms. Bening, an animated and coolly beautiful
actress, said: ``Hedda is not the romantic heroine that Nora was''
_ the protagonist of Ibsen's ``Doll's House.'' ``But she's as
poignant as Nora. She's richly ambiguous and extremely disturbing.
And she's someone whom people can relate to. Even though it's a
different time, even though we're dressed in corsets onstage, what
interests me is there's so much subtext here. We think, `Is there
really that much difference between then and now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The production, which begins previews Sunday evening and opens
March 24 for a limited run at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood, has
an unusual pedigree by Los Angeles standards. Here, where there is
an abundance of actors, writers and directors focused on film and
television, theater can seem a stepchild of the arts, though some
do seek out the challenge of live performance. In this case, those
involved have a long relationship with the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Daniel Sullivan, who has known Ms. Bening for
years, ran the Seattle Repertory Theater for 16 years. He has also
directed the playwright Jon Robin Baitz's work since 1989. Baitz,
who adapted the Ibsen text for the production, is the author of,
among other plays, ``A Fair Country'' and ``The Substance of
Fire,'' both of which Sullivan directed in New York, as he did
Wendy Wasserstein's Broadway plays, ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' ``The
Sisters Rosensweig'' and ``An American Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   How the current production of ``Hedda Gabler'' came together was
in some ways remarkably simple. Gilbert Cates, the producing
director of the 498-seat Geffen Playhouse, asked Ms. Bening about
two years ago if she was interested in starring in a Noel Coward
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bening, who began her career at the American Conservatory
Theater in San Francisco, was unsure. ``I said to her, `What would
you really like to do?''' Cates recalled. ``And she said, `Hedda
Gabler.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once the dates were set, Ms. Bening suggested Sullivan, who
agreed to direct, and he called in his friend Baitz to adapt the
play and make the language of the mainly British translations less
stilted and more contemporary. The cast includes Byron Jennings as
Hedda's husband, George Tesman; Rosemary Murphy as his aunt Julia,
and Paul Guilfoyle as Hedda's confidant, Judge Brack.
</P>
<P>
   The production is the most high-profile yet at the former
Westwood Playhouse. In 1995, the David Geffen Foundation gave $5
million to the graduate school of theater, film and television at
the University of California at Los Angeles for the purchase of the
building. The idea was to create a resident professional theater
company associated with the graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Ms. Bening, Sullivan and Baitz came to the play
with their own agendas _ personal and professional. Ms. Bening had
never seen a production of ``Hedda Gabler'' but was stirred by
Janet McTeer's acclaimed performance as a frenetic, sensual Nora in
the British import of ``A Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Bening is hardly similar to the trapped woman she
portrays onstage, the 40-year-old actress made it plain that
``Hedda Gabler'' tugs at her personally in ways she does not fully
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bening herself was destined for major stardom in the early
1990s. After a grounding in theater _ her performance in Tina
Howe's ``Coastal Disturbances'' off-Broadway in 1986 won her a Tony
Award nomination when the play moved to Broadway _ she received an
Academy Award nomination for her 1990 role as a sexy con artist in
the movie ``The Grifters.'' This was followed the next year by
``Bugsy'' in which she starred opposite Warren Beatty, whom she
subsequently married. The decision to have children _ the couple
now have three _ forced her to pass on some major film roles of the
early and mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women would say they relate to `Hedda Gabler' _ there's a
part of her in them,'' said Ms. Bening, who was seated with
Sullivan and Bates at the Bel Air and was about to rush off to take
one of her children to a birthday party. ``I think Ibsen was
writing about a deep ambivalence that many women feel about
domesticity. I think about myself and friends of mine _ we have
some of Hedda's qualities and traits.''
</P>
<P>
   While she confessed to a deep nervousness about playing the
part, ``the desire to do it is stronger than the fear I have,'' Ms.
Bening said. ``There's such a rich ambiguity about her, and she's
complicated: sympathetic one moment, extremely disturbing the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   Biographers have noted that the Hedda character was loosely
modeled on a young woman whom Ibsen met at a resort when he was in
his early 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ibsen had a deeply repressed sexual energy,'' Baitz said.
``There was almost no physicality to his life at that point. He had
a loveless marriage, and this young woman somehow lit him up and
triggered something in him, and they apparently had a chaste
friendship.'' The woman later wrote about the relationship and sold
the articles in a manner reminiscent of the 1990s. ``A typical
20th-century story,'' Baitz said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   The drama itself goes far beyond the issue of domesticity and
female repression. ``Hedda Gabler'' is an enigmatic study of a
possibly pregnant woman _ it is left ambiguous _ who is trapped in
a marriage to a plodding man. As the play unfolds, Hedda glides
toward self-destruction as she schemes and shatters lives. Henry
James once said of her, ``She suffers, she struggles, she is
human.'' But the critic Brooks Atkinson wrote in 1936, ``In cold
fact, she is the most hateful woman in dramatic literature.''

 LOS ANGELES: dramatic literature.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baitz said he was still unsure how to characterize what he did
to the classic. ``I don't know what to call it,'' he said. ``I
worked from a literal translation of the play, and I think I
de-Anglified it and got out of its way. I see other people who do
that same thing and say, `It's a new version by Christopher Hampton
or David Hare.' I don't know what to say. I sort of curated it.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the assignment, he said, partly because he was flattered
by it. ``It seemed to be too good to get so close to something so
exquisitely crafted.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a personal element, too, for the 37-year-old
dramatist. He had spent the last two years working as a
screenwriter on projects that have not seen the light of day. He
was well paid but frustrated. Baitz said he began thinking that he
was turning into Clifford Odets, the archetypal New York playwright
who went to Hollywood in the 1940s and endured misery, albeit a
lucrative one, at poolside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left me feeling practically worthless as a writer,'' Baitz
said. ``The variables that I could not control just stymied me. I
was left feeling impotent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to complain,'' he added. ``This is not self-pity.
But I think Dan Sullivan asked me to do this to jump-start me out
of a long period of writer's block. It made me go back to work. I
became reacquainted with the exhilaration of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baitz said that within days of starting the adaptation _ which
he considered at first almost a writing exercise _ he became
mesmerized and obsessed by it. ``I always thought it was a mountain
of a play; it would never occur to me to go near it,'' he said.
``By the end of the first scene, I felt I had been seduced by how
cold and hard and righteous and angry the play was, how modern it
was. It's modern in that it's sphinx-like, it defies easy
cataloguing.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Baitz kept thinking of David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly,''
the bleak drama about a group of male friends in the Hollywood
Hills whose lives are at a dead end. ``Take out the Hollywood
stuff, the two plays work on a very brutal level _ you have the
menace between the sexes,'' Baitz said. ``There's a nice parabola
from Rabe to Ibsen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Bening, Baitz said he began identifying with the drama.
``It's a play about fear, infectious fear; I felt attuned to
that,'' he said. He said the character of Hedda's husband, who is
infatuated with her, struck close to him. ``His desperate need to
make this person happy _ that seemed like my own personal need,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baitz said he would view the adaptation as a failure if
audiences left the playhouse saying ``Hedda Gabler'' was merely a
theatrical relic with no relevance to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Hedda find her access denied in some ways? Yes,'' Baitz
said. ``Do we live in a world where people find access to a future
denied? Yes. Is she someone in free fall, someone whose sense of
panic starts the second before she wakes up and never ends? Yes. Do
we live in a world of Xanax and Ambien and isolation? Are we less
isolated now just because everybody's lives are cantilevered in a
way they weren't 100 years ago? I don't think we're any less
isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Baitz said it was absurd to depict the play as a feminist work
of art. ``That's an infuriating limitation,'' he said. ``What makes
it riveting is that there's no ideology, no agenda. It makes no
attempt to apologize for despicable behavior. It's a picture of
people being crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a quiet-spoken, almost diffident man, said the drama,
in contrast to some of Ibsen's other works, is driven by one actor
_ the woman playing Hedda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You not only need a strong actress but a strong persona, and
when Annette called me about the play, I said, `That's a wonderful
idea,''' he said. ``She fits the role. She has the kind of
vividness as a performer that the play needs. And she can very
easily get to that trapped place where you feel that the
personality, the mind and the ambition of the character are much
larger than the circumstances she found herself in.''
</P>
<P>
   The director said it was almost impossible to underplay ``Hedda
Gabler'': ``It's a kind of minefield of emotional excess. You have
to play it with full stops out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Sullivan said, ``Hedda Gabler'' is not about gender
issues or about feminism. Such notions, he said, diminish a drama
as timeless as a Greek tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bening and Baitz agree with Sullivan, and so, apparently,
did Ibsen. ``I have been more of a poet and less of a social
philosopher than people have generally been inclined to believe,''
he said at a testimonial banquet given by the Norwegian Society for
Women's Rights. ``I thank you for your toast but I must decline the
honor of consciously having worked for women's rights. I am not
even sure what women's rights really are. To me, it has been a
question of human rights.''

INNOCENT OR NOT SO? THE SHIFTING VISIONS OF CHILDHOOD  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)

<P>
   The exact dates are debated, but many historians agree that the
idea of childhood innocence developed in the 18th century. Before
then, they argue, children were generally viewed as little adults
who would benefit from discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Early artistic images of children generally portrayed certain
types: the Holy Child, lamenting cherubs, cupids awakening passion
in feckless mortals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the 18th century, the concept of the child was
basically as a small person born into sin, especially if they were
Christian,'' says Anne Higonnet, an art historian and author of
``Pictures of Innocence: The History and Crisis of Ideal
Childhood,'' which documents art-historical and contemporary images
of children. ``What happened in the 18th century was a radical
revision of that view.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Images of young people painted by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas
Gainsborough coincided with Enlightenment-era ideas about childhood
and seemed to validate Jean-Jacques Rousseau's argument that
children were naturally innocent and corrupted by society and that
they should be raised as ``naturally'' as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This ideal shifted again with the invention of photography in
the 19th century. In stark counterpoint to entrenched romantic
ideas, realist photographs by Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine, taken at
the turn of the 20th century and later, presented grim views of
child poverty and labor (images like these, in fact, changed
American juvenile labor laws).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other 19th- and early 20th-century photographs
continued to portray children without connection to a cruel world:
young people in society portraits or dressed as literary
characters, or 19th-century postmortem pictures of beatific
children who looked asleep _ and eternally innocent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Childhood innocence, or the lack of it, still receives a lot of
attention. Children in the 1990s are often overprotected and
treated like hothouse flowers to insulate them from dangerous
situations, according to Kiku Adatto, director of the
interdepartmental Children's Studies at Harvard University.
``People remain children for an awfully long time, as any parent of
a child who returns home at the age of 30 knows,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But specific protections of childhood are also under fire, and
the use of glamorous youths in film and advertising causes
perennial controversy over ethical portrayals of children: most
recently, Calvin Klein discontinued a magazine and billboard
advertising campaign for children's underwear last month following
criticism from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Rosie O'Donnell, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The legal age of childhood is also under debate, as children who
commit serious crimes are tried as adults in some states. ``The
movement to push back the age of childhood from a judicial point of
view brings us back to the idea that children are not necessarily
innocent,'' says Ms. Higonnet.
</P>
<P>
   Devils or angels, children remain hugely popular subjects for
artists, especially photographers. Though art photographers like
Larry Clark and Nick Waplington track the seamy side of youth in
the 1990s, it is the free-and-easy tradition of child photography
that endures and continues to influence the family albums and
greeting cards of today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four museum shows with photographs of children reflect
historically contradictory views of young people: romantic visions
from the past; more jaundiced views from the 1980s and '90s.
``Future Present: Contemporary Photographs of Children From the
Reader's Digest Collection,'' 73 works by contemporary
photographers on view through Sunday at the Aldrich Museum of
Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, Conn., presents a generally warm
and fuzzy view of young life.
</P>
<P>
   Two continuing New York exhibitions of Victorian-era photographs
featuring pictures of children by British photographers _
``Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Centenary Lewis Carroll
Exhibition'' at the Equitable Gallery and ``Julia Margaret
Cameron's Women'' at the Museum of Modern Art _ offer differing
perspectives on Victorian sentimentality toward young people.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, ``Through the Looking Glass: Visions of
Childhood'' at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island
will mix historical and contemporary images and promises some
disquieting moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future Present,'' culled from some 250 photographs of children
from the corporate art collection at Reader's Digest, is in keeping
with the company's family-oriented public image, though there are a
few provocative pictures in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children represent hope,'' says Jill DeVonyar-Zansky,
associate curator of the Reader's Digest corporate art collection.
``That is the essence of a lot of stories in the magazine.'' The
collection is also meant to appeal to baby boomers, Reader's
Digest's newly targeted audience as their traditional readership
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Some well-known, edgy photographers are present here, but with
relatively tame images, not necessarily typical of their work. Tina
Barney is represented with a stagy scene of affluent domesticity,
and Robert Mapplethorpe with a defiantly posed (and fully clothed)
portrait of the daughter of the art dealer Bruno Bishofsberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odalisque,'' a 1989 image by Sally Mann, portrays the
photographer's self-consciously reclining, semiclad young daughter.
Sebastiao Salgado's 1981 ``Three Communion Girls, Brazil,'' who
pose puttilike in white dresses and wings _ while one girl glares
angrily at the camera _ is quite different from the searing
photographs of manual labor and famine for which Salgado is
famous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a gentler note, Abelardo Morell's 1994 ``Laura and Brady in
the Shadow of our House'' _ a favorite image among Reader's Digest
employees, according to Ms. DeVonyar-Zansky _ conveys a charming
sense of teamwork between photographer and children: a boy and a
girl pose in the dark shadow of a pitched-roof house, an ephemeral
play-home decorated with window shapes drawn on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Groover's 1990 ``Untitled (Holding Baby's Hand)'' is a
soft-focus, sepia-toned print showing infant fingers held in an
adult hand, like a parental version of the Creation scene's spark
of life imparted through the touch of a finger. In Charles Hagen's
1996 ``Anna with Magnifier, Brooklyn, New York,'' a young girl
peers through a large magnifying lens, her teeth a twisted
surrealistic display. (The Surrealists themselves, however, were
not known for photographing children. ``They were a very adult kind
of group,'' Ms. Higonnet says.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, photographs of children from the 19th century often
appear more static because of the long exposure time, but many of
them are compelling. At the Museum of Modern Art, Cameron's
soft-focus images of Pre-Raphaelite Madonnas and children are often
overtly religious portrayals; her portraits of mop-haired girls and
boys refer to classical and literary themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cameron had a vision that she was imposing on the children;
they were going to pose for her in a particular manner and way,''
says Roy Flukinger, senior curator of photography and film at the
Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas
in Austin, which owns one of the world's largest holdings of
Carroll and Cameron photographs. ``Carroll was just delighted that
kids were kids, basically. He was interested in showing the heart
of the child. He would have a lot of fun. It was a collaborative,
even wonderfully conspiratorial experience: him and the children
against the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron and Carroll were acquaintances who occasionally
photographed the same people, but they didn't like each other's
photographs: Carroll, an Oxford don whose real name was Charles
Dodgson, particularly disliked what he called Cameron's ``large
heads taken out of focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Higonnet argues that early photography made it possible for
the ideal of romantic childhood to seem completely natural. ``In
the 19th century, there was a massive reproduction of images,'' she
says. ``The image of childhood was widespread and intensely
visual.''
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of the era's ideal of innocent childhood also
emerged from literature: the Grimm fairy tales were translated into
English in 1823 and lost their more macabre details in the process.
``They were stripped of potentially dangerous elements for
children,'' says U.C. Knoepflmacher, author of ``Ventures into
Childland: Victorians, Fairy Tales and Femininity'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   In these post-Lolita times, observers can't help seeing a
disquieting sensuality in both Carroll's and Cameron's pictures of
children, some of whom were photographed scantily clad. The
Victorians romantically equated children with an untainted purity
of spirit; the less encumbered by clothes, the more angelic and
charming.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's evidently obsessive attention to young Alice Liddell,
the inspiration for ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' has made
many view his images in a prurient light. As Knoepflmacher points
out, however, not only Carroll but other formidable Victorian
literati, including John Ruskin, William Thackeray and George
MacDonald, composed fantasy tales for special female children.
</P>
<P>
   Male Victorian authors were ``far more sentimentally attached to
childhood and children'' than their female counterparts,
Knoepflmacher says, because middle-class Victorian boys were sent
away to boarding schools with strict regulations while girls stayed
at home in more nurturing environments.
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts, Carroll's child-friends, including Alice,
thoroughly enjoyed his company; his willingness to tell stories and
indulge in childish fantasy appealed to them. An 1873 image of
9-year-old Xie (Alexandra) Kitchin in Chinese robes, perched on tea
boxes, or an enchanting picture of young Agnes Hughes reclining in
an elaborate headpiece and robe, suggests young people's delight in
dressing up.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's children, by contrast, tend to look rather uniform,
with tangled hair, sleepily gazing out at the viewer. Alice,
impudent and coquettish in Carroll's famous portrait of her as
``The Beggar Maid,'' is dour and expressionless in Cameron's
photograph ``Pomona,'' taken when Alice was a young adult.
</P>
<P>
   Many contemporary portrayals of children refer to these
carefully orchestrated depictions, which to modern eyes fuse
eroticism and innocence. Inez van Lamsweerde's 1997 photograph
``Kirsten, Star,'' which will be at Snug Harbor, is part Cameron
child, part JonBenet Ramsey: a close-up image of a young girl's
face, with adult-size eyes, closed and glistening red lips.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann has drawn on Cameron's imagery, according to Shannah
Ehrhart, who is curating the Snug Harbor show: Cameron's 1864 ``The
Double Star'' reveals two young girls locked in a dreamy embrace _
perhaps asleep _ with lips touching; Ms. Mann reinterpreted this
image in her 1988 ``Kiss Goodnight,'' a blurry image of her
daughters, Virginia and Jessie, similarly posed.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer Anna Gaskell, who once worked as Ms. Mann's
assistant, based a series of photographs on ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland''; these large color prints of five girls in starched
pinafores pushing, pulling and tussling with each other give a
distinctly unsettling edge to Carroll's tale. (Ms. Gaskell's images
were at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami, Fla., and
others are now at the Guggenheim through May. 16. She declined to
participate in the Snug Harbor show and an exhibition curated by
Ms. Higonnet last year. Casey Kaplan, her New York dealer, says,
``She doesn't like to be in shows that are specifically about
childhood.'')
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of all these pictures, past and present, may lie in a
nostalgic yearning for simpler times _ before children's schedules
were filled with the play dates and day-care regimens that mimic
the rhythms of 1990s working life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adatto, of Harvard, sees in unsupervised children's play the
freedom ``to imagine, to be an agent, to be a master of your
world.'' Today, she says, ``We have one cultural trend that speaks
to the erosions of the ideals of childhood, and another that
upholds the old beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   These exhibitions make one thing clear: In photographs,
childhood usually appears the way adults want it to. Innocence, it
seems, is in the eye of the beholder.

ELIZABETH DOLE SETS HER EYE ON THE WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (See related DOLE-POLITICS) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Reprising her most famous moment in the 1996
presidential campaign, Elizabeth Dole bounded into an audience of
Iowans on Wednesday to announce her presidential exploratory
committee and to present herself both as a nonpolitician and as a
prepared government insider.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after she made a passionate case at the
Republican Party's national convention for the election of her
husband and the party's nominee, Bob Dole, Mrs. Dole sought to do
the same for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Using no notes in her 25 minutes of remarks, Mrs. Dole did not
fumble one word (even repeating her campaign's Web site address) as
she strolled about with a microphone pinned to her dress as she
methodically reviewed her service in five administrations and as
president of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Mrs. Dole sought to set herself apart as the only
woman in a field of as many as 10 men. ``Now what would I as a
woman offer our country?'' she asked. ``I'm no politician. And
frankly, I think that's a plus today. But I have spent a lifetime
in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was scrupulously conceived as a counter to Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, who in his exploratory committee announcement in
Austin three days ago surrounded himself with party luminaries.
Although Mrs. Dole places second to Bush in the polls here and
around the country, she thus far cannot compete with his parade of
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she portrayed herself as a woman of the people, and
appeared on a stage at the convention center here after receiving
testimonials from a local farmer, a working mother, a high school
teacher and a 12-year-old black student who praised Mrs. Dole's
message against drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Diandra Rollings, was taken by surprise when Mrs.
Dole pulled her into the audience for the beginning of her talk.
``We like some spontaneity, don't we?'' said the decidedly
unspontaneous Mrs. Dole, who moments later walked directly to a
spot on the floor marked with tape and began her own remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole spoke in vague terms of popular Republican themes such
as improving education, tax relief, pumping more money into the
military and combating the ``evil in American society'' of illegal
drug use. But she stayed clear of specific positions and gave no
clues as to where she might fall on an ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make this a crusade,'' Mrs. Dole said of her call to end
drug use. ``Remember Nancy Reagan's `just say no?' She made a huge
difference with that program.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably her most substantive comment was about the nation's
missile defenses. ``At a time when the secretary of defense is
saying that North Korea within a year may have nuclear bombs that
could reach the United States,'' she said, ``and we know Iraq is
manufacturing biological weapons, I think we need to do everything
to develop and deploy a strategic missile defense system.
Immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole told the audience that her positions would come soon
enough. ``I want to hear from people _ I want to listen,'' she
said. ``Then we're going to be laying out positions on all of these
issues. But we want to do it in a thoughtful way. Right?''
</P>
<P>
   As has been her practice since leaving the Red Cross nearly six
weeks ago _ and at events throughout most of her career _ Mrs. Dole
refused to take questions from reporters, whom her entourage kept
away from her. It was a striking contrast to Gov. Bush, who
bantered with reporters at his exploratory announcement on Sunday,
even as he said he too needed more time to fashion his positions.
</P>
<P>
   Kayne Robinson, the new state party chairman, commended Mrs.
Dole for her ``different style'' on Wednesday, but said that
Republicans who participate in the first important presidential
caucuses in this state expect give-and-take with the candidates.
``You won't have anyone coming to this state if you run a media
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dole committee unveiled a 14-minute commercial that
will run beginning Wednesday for one week only in Iowa and New
Hampshire, which holds the first primary. Mrs. Dole looks into the
camera and repeats many of the identical lines in her speech
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Wednesday that was taken for several television
stations found that among likely Republican caucus goers in Iowa,
Bush was supported by nearly 37 percent of the vote, followed by 16
percent for Mrs. Dole. The other candidates all placed in the
single digits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Mrs. Dole's announcement Wednesday had been widely
expected, the exploratory committee allows her to raise money to
finance travel and other campaign-related costs _ and leaves no
doubt of her designs on the White House. Mrs. Dole also has begun
assembling a staff.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign manager is Tom Daffron, a former top aide to Sen.
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, and the top strategist is Kieran
Mahoney, who has worked for two New Yorkers: Gov. George E. Pataki
and former Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole borrowed from the announcement of candidacy on Tuesday
by former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who in his speech
reminded the audience of how Ronald Reagan asked people if they
were better off now or four years before. Mrs. Dole repeated the
line, and posed another question as well: ``Perhaps the relevant
question now is, Are you better? Are your families stronger? Are
your children safe from drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   But the qualities that make her appealing could turn off other
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's a fine woman,'' Wayne Lilly, a Republican from
Chilton, N.H., said after a recent Christian Coalition event in his
state. ``But I don't believe a woman ought to be in that particular
place of leadership. She would be a good help mate. But the Bible
teaches us that a woman should not have authority over men. It's
nothing but foolishness.''

ANN CORIO, RACY STAGE PERFORMER KNOWN AS `QUEEN OF BURLESQUE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Corio, the auburn-haired, green-eyed beauty who bumped and
ground her way to fame and fortune as the ``Queen of Burlesque,''
died March 1 in Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She kept her
age a closely guarded secret, but was thought to be in her 80s.
</P>
<P>
   During her prime, attendance at one of her performances in the
Old Howard Theater in Scollay Square became a rite of passage for
young men in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She retired from show business about eight years ago, but had
practiced her earthy ``art'' long enough to present it as a put-on.
In the 1970s, she toured the straw hat circuit as the star of
``This Was Burlesque'' at summer theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize comedy,'' she said in an interview in 1976.
``There is not total nudity. The girls are lovely and artistic and
they're terribly, terribly pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked down on recent practitioners of her specialty. ``What
is called burlesque today isn't that at all,'' she said in 1976.

 &HT;    CLINTON PROPOSES EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL CENTRAL AMERICAN
IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    EDS: Adds ellipsis in 3rd graf
 &HT;    With optional add begins at 650 words.

<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ President Clinton, addressing
lawmakers assembled in El Salvador from across Central America,
said Wednesday he would seek to make it easier for refugees who
fled political oppression in the region -- regardless of the type
government -- to obtain permanent residency status in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here later from El Salvador, however, and tried to
heal old wounds by acknowledging the U.S. role in supporting
repressive military regimes in Guatemala during the 1980s and the
first half of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support for military forces or intelligence units which
engaged in violent or widespread repression . . .was wrong, and the
United States must not repeat that mistake,'' Clinton said at a
roundtable of Guatemalan civic leaders to discuss the nation's
recent peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The president further urged that the United States be viewed
``in a new way, as a partner, a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement came two weeks after a Guatemalan truth
commission released a report detailing that U.S. policy was pivotal
to state-sponsored genocide against Mayan peasants during the war,
in which an estimated 200,000 died. A 36-year civil war between the
army and leftist rebels, which ripped Guatemala apart, ended as
recently as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the past U.S. involvement, about a hundred
demonstrators protested Clinton's arrival here from El Salvador.
They carried signs decrying genocide, murder, oil companies and
poor wages.
</P>
<P>
   The president will complete his four-day goodwill mission to
Central America Thursday with a summit of regional presidents here
in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, in an address to the Legislative Assembly of
El Salvador, Clinton said he would support equal treatment for
refugees from the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been reviewing the 1997 immigration law
which granted amnesty to some 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees who
arrived prior to 1996 to determine whether it can also apply to
refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The law was aimed at refugees from Nicaragua and Cuba who fled
communist regimes. It made it easier for refugees who fled
right-wing dictatorships in El Salvador and Guatemala before
October 1991 to apply for permanent status, but was not as generous
as to those who fled communist regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of those countries have been urging a change in U.S.
policy to allow the refugees to remain. They argue that the money
sent back to the region from those refugees is an important source
of revenue for Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in response to Hurricane Mitch, Clinton gave
refugees from Nicaragua and Honduras an 18-month amnesty from
deportation to relieve those countries from absorbing the returning
citizens at a time of economic difficulty. He also granted a 60-day
amnesty to Guatemala and Salvadoran refugees. That period ended
Monday, but none are scheduled to be deported this week.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's expiration of a temporary amnesty program, nearly
3,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador and Guatemala face
deportation. They are seeking parity with Nicaragua and Honduras,
covered by more liberal rules.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Salvadoran assembly, Clinton pledged to
urge Congress to support equal treatment for all Central American
refugees, as well as through administrative changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything I possibly can to overcome that different
treatment, `` Clinton said. ``Our treatment of people from Central
America should reflect what they suffered rather than who caused
the suffering. This is wrong and we should change it''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Central American leaders to give every child a
chance to go to school; adopt environmental practices to avert the
deforestation which may have caused the mudslides that killed 2,000
people in Nicaragua; and crack down on the transportation of
illegal drugs through the region.
</P>
<P>
   For education, Clinton announced an $8 million grant to enable
countries in Central America to enroll more children in schools and
keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the region's civil wars have been replaced by
democratically elected governments throughout Central America,
Clinton said ``we have a solemn obligation to deliver democracy''
for today's children.

 &HT;    Surveys show big variation in salary
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making a good living in the Southeast might boil down to where
you live, according to two wage surveys released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Database administrators, bookkeepers and receptionists fare best
in Georgia, where the average hourly pay in nonmanufacturing jobs
was highest of five Southeastern states surveyed by Randstad
Staffing Services in its first wage and employment report.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, on the other hand, had the highest hourly pay for
computer programmers and systems analysts: $28.73 and $25.15,
respectively. The high pay was tied largely to the Huntsville area,
which relies heavily on high-tech and defense work.
</P>
<P>
   Randstad surveyed 2,500 companies in Georgia, Tennessee,
Alabama, South Carolina and Mississippi last fall. It looked at
employers' concerns and pay scales of 45 job categories in
manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms.
</P>
<P>
   A study by New York compensation consultant William M. Mercer
showed variations in salary for the same job in different cities.
That could pose a problem for worker-strapped companies with
operations throughout the country. The study looked at wages in 200
cities in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A salary averaging $50,000 nationally pays $52,700 in Atlanta,
or 5.4 percent above the national norm, the Mercer study said. The
same job would pay as much as 20 percent higher, or about $60,200,
in San Jose and as low as $41,750 in Brownsville, Texas, 17 percent
less than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's still a hotbed of employment. It's got a very low
unemployment rate and that's going to affect what a potential
employee may ask for. Employees are in a buyer's market,'' said
Atlanta-based Mercer consultant Eric McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   Through the early 1990s, Atlanta's salaries mirrored the
national average, but started edging up in 1995, McMillan said. Now
Atlanta is almost in the same pay league as Chicago, Boston and
Washington, D.C., which tend to pay more than the national average,
McMillan said. Mercer has been tracking salaries for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report points up the complexities that large employers
face in managing salary programs covering operations throughout the
United States,'' said Darrell Cira, another Atlanta-based Mercer
consultant. ``Sensitive compensation issues can arise, for example,
when companies relocate employees from comparatively high to
comparatively low salary areas, and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Salary variations leveled off at higher pay scales. A job that
averages $80,000 nationally would equate to about $81,599, or 2
percent higher, in Atlanta, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies are an interesting glimpse of employer concerns
in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly what came back from employers was that offering a
competitive wage is key to keeping employees,'' said Jim Reese,
Randstad's managing director of operations.

MORE BLOODY, LESS INTERESTING THAN ORIGINAL `CARRIE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, March 12 by NYTimes News Service) 
OUR RATING: 1 1/2 STARS 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Carrie,'' the 1976 film directed by Brian De
Palma and based on the best-selling Stephen King novel, created
horror-movie conventions that are copied to this day. ``The Rage:
Carrie 2'' merely swipes from the original and a slew of more
recent teen horror flicks, such as ``Scream.'' In short, it's a
bloody bore.
</P>
<P>
   It's 23 years later in the same suburban town where ``Carrie''
was set. There's a new telekinetic (having the ability to move
objects with the mind) girl named Rachel in school. Like Carrie,
she's a misfit. The movie uses blood as a motif.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the similarities end. In an apparent attempt to
be topical, the bad events of this movie are triggered by a Spur
Posse-like cabal of jocks who make a game out of keeping score of
the many girls they sleep with. The rage of the movie's title is
set off by the fact that Rachel feels she and her best friend have
been victims of these boys, even after one of them genuinely falls
for her.
</P>
<P>
   This change of focus to tension between the sexes destroys one
of the most shocking elements of ``Carrie.'' The original featured
an almost all-female cast (besides William Katt and a very young
John Travolta, in a small role), and explored the very real power
for both beauty and evil among teen-age girls. They didn't need to
be menaced by men; they were terrifying all by themselves, from
their vicious taunts at the opening of the film to their dousing
Carrie with pig's blood at the fateful prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage'' isn't totally worthless _ it could, like the
original, turn out to be the debut of several talented young
actors. First-time film actor Emily Bergl imbues the main
character, Rachel, with as much complexity as the script allows.
But the new movie is, overall, a prime example of studios trying
and failing to find a known franchise to turn into a contemporary
hit. Perhaps it's a sign of the times, or the absence of De Palma
and King. This film was directed by Katt Shea (``Poison Ivy''), and
written directly for the screen by ``Hackers'' scribe Rafael Moreu.
</P>
<P>
   De Palma and King have both had a hand in some very bad movies.
But ``Carrie' combined a fascinating character study with a
relentless, almost obsessive directorial style. ``The Rage,'' by
contrast, is an R-rated ``Beverly Hills 90210'' meets ``The
X-Files,'' a compilation of referential scenes which rely on the
use of gory special effects for shock value.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may not matter to the teens who will go see the
movie. But it's a mystery why Amy Irving would choose to reprise
her role. Irving's Sue Snell has survived the events of 23 years
ago to become a high school guidance counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Irving has the most unintentionally funny line of the film. She
takes Rachel to the site of the school auditorium fire from 1976.
In an otherwise tidy town, twisted metal and charred brick walls
have supposedly been left to rot for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never cleaned this up ... I haven't been back here for 23
years,'' Snell tells Rachel with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   Give us a pig's blood shower any day.

SENATE PANEL BACKS BILL LOWERING ALCOHOL LIMIT IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After tearful pleas from the parents of four
high school girls who were killed in a drunk-driving crash and
little outside opposition, a Senate committee unanimously endorsed
a bill Wednesday that would lower the legal amount of alcohol
drivers can have in their body.
</P>
<P>
   The measure approved by the Senate Criminal Justice Committee
would lower the legal limit from .10 percent to .08 percent blood
alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   In his second attempt to pass a bill that would lower the
state's legal definition of ``intoxication,'' Sen. Mario Gallegos,
D-Houston, said he proposed SB 114 because he is ``greatly
concerned with the alcohol-related fatalities in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has been endorsed by Gov. George W. Bush, Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and numerous state
residents, will now be considered by the full Senate. The House
version of the bill, HB 210 sponsored by Rep. Scott Hochberg,
D-Houston, is waiting to be heard by the Criminal Jurisprudence
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie and Doug McWhorter, parents of 15-year-old Mandi
McWhorter who was killed in December with three other girls by an
alleged intoxicated driver, voiced their support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our daughter would be here today if we had a stricter
law,'' said Lezlie McWhorter.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband agreed. ``It's time that we, as a state, make a
difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas in 1997, 1,748 people were killed in alcohol-related
crashes, a 13.9 percent decline from the previous year's 1,991
similar fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the bill said that MADD and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration distort their data by citing all
``alcohol-related'' deaths, rather than the more narrow term of
``alcohol-caused.'' For a crash to be referred to as
``alcohol-related,'' only a small presence of alcohol needs to be
in the driver's blood system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fraud that's being perpetuated on the public,'' said
Luke Ball, state chapter coordinator of the National Motorists
Association. ``The numbers are manufactured and used to say that
(lowering the blood alcohol content from .10 to .08) will save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
in 1996 5.5 percent of all alcohol-related fatalities involved a
driver with .08 to .09 blood alcohol content or lower, whereas 19.4
percent of the drivers had a percentage of .10 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of the bill argue that lowering the legal
definition of ``intoxication'' will deter people from drinking
socially among friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only effect of an .08 law is that many social drinkers
will be jailed, fined and suffer costs of up to $15,000 for
behavior that is considered responsible,'' said Rick Berman,
general counsel for the American Beverage Institute.
</P>
<P>
   If the limit is lowered, a 170-pound man would have to stop
drinking after four drinks, while a 120-pound woman would have to
stop after three drinks, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the parents and friends of the four students at Brock High
School, west of Fort Worth, who were killed Dec. 19 said people who
drive after drinking are irresponsible and that state laws should
be tougher on those who choose to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who killed my friends wasn't a student or a minor. He
was an adult who should've known better,'' said Candice Sanders, a
friend of the four girls.
</P>
<P>
   David Lee, the father of 16-year-old Staci Lee who was killed in
the same crash, said if lowering the blood alcohol content to .08
percent will help save even one life, then the change will not be
made in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slapping them (people who drive while intoxicated) on the
wrist isn't going to deter them,'' he said. ``We need to start
saving lives now. This can be used as a stepping stone to make laws
more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Osina, the mother of 17-year-old Lacey Osina, echoed Lee's
concerns: ``One life lost is one too many.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Heart-rending and yet overwhelmingly tedious,
``The Deep End of the Ocean'' bears a passing resemblance to Robert
Redford's powerful ``Ordinary People'' in that both deal with a
family's traumatic reaction to the loss of a son.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas ``Ordinary People'' demonstrated an understanding
and even empathy for its subjects, ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' is
content to wear its pained emotions on its sleeve. It's all
superficial _ the characters, the plotting, even Elmer Bernstein's
tired score _ giving the film the feel of an overwrought television
movie that has been blown up for the big screen. Here,
unfortunately, you don't have the luxury of commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Beth Cappadora, a devoted, if
absent-minded, mother of three living in Madison, Wis. When Beth
attends her 15-year high school reunion in Chicago, she takes the
kids so her husband, Pat (Treat Williams), can tend to his
restaurant. Beth arrives in the crowded hotel lobby, hands her baby
girl to a friend and then asks her 5-year-old, Vincent, to watch
3-year-old Ben while she registers for their room. In the blink of
an eye, though, Ben disappears, setting off tensions within the
Cappadora family that reverberate for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Beth becomes distant and irresponsible, preferring to stay in
bed than face any kind of normalcy. Pat (in what little there is of
him) pretends everything is going to be OK. A gay police detective
(Whoopi Goldberg) does her best to help, but once the notoriety of
Ben's disappearance wanes, there's not much she can do. The family
settles into a quiet detente of unspoken guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years pass, and then one day, Ben shows up on the
Cappadoras' door step (they've moved), asking if they need their
lawn mowed. Ben _ now named Sam _ lives just two blocks away with
his devoted ``father'' and has no memories of his previous family.
Beth and Pat are overjoyed, but soon must cope with the realization
that their ties to their son are tenuous at best and not all that
easily renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is adapted from Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling
novel, the first book to be featured by Oprah Winfrey on her
popular book club. Little fault can be found with the novel (aside
from perhaps its pat ending), but screenwriter Stephen Schiff has
removed most of its insights and tough truths and replaced them
with generalizations that fail to engage the audience.
</P>
<P>
   There are also glaring gaps. In one scene, the now teen-age
Vincent (Jonathan Jackson, whose charismatic performance is the
best thing about the movie) has long hair; in the next, it's
closely cropped. Goldberg's detective character is incredibly
under-developed. All we know about her comes from her introductory
scene. After that, nothing; although director Ulu Grosbard assumes
a familiarity that hasn't been earned.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer has played this kind of brittle character before and
certainly does a credible job in showing Beth's rocky
transformation. But the only way for this off-putting film to work
would be to really get inside its characters, avoid emotional
shorthand and explore the pain, guilt and betrayals in ways that go
beyond the trite and true. Then ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' would
still be hard to like, but at least it would say something about
the human condition.

U.S. ENVOY FAILS TO BUDGE MILOSEVIC ON KOSOVO PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-REPUBS)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy,
emerged from daylong negotiations with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Wednesday, admitting he had failed to win any change
in the Serbian leader's opposition to the international peace
proposal for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As intense fighting continued in Kosovo, Holbrooke was ensconced
with Milosevic in Belgrade. Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton
accords that ended the war in Bosnia and who negotiated the
now-tattered cease-fire in Kosovo, was brought in to press
Milosevic toward an agreement before peace talks resume in Paris on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet shortly before midnight, after his second meeting of the day
ended, Holbrooke said that there had been no progress. ``After a
long day of talks, there has been no change in the Yugoslav
position during the day nor in our position,'' he said. ``We
discussed every aspect in Kosovo and in Bosnia and I made clear the
significant concern of our government with the fighting that is
continuing at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to keep in close touch. They were very engaged, very
intense talks,'' he said, adding he would return to the United
States on Thursday to report to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. Holbrooke declined to speculate what his failure meant
for the next round of talks. ``We are in a very difficult situation
tonight,'' he later told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point remains Milosevic's refusal to accept a
NATO-led military force in Kosovo to enforce a political
settlement. Holbrooke had been expected to use his personal
relationship with Milosevic and his forceful style to achieve some
movement. But despite an atmosphere described by one American
official as ``business-like,'' there was no hint that Milosevic was
ready to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic told Tanjur, the Yugoslav news agency, that any
attempt to make the presence of foreign troops in Kosovo a
condition of the political agreement was ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had played down the chances of a breakthrough before
the talks began. Western mediators had hoped to have a deal ready
for signing by both parties but now it appears the Serbian and
ethnic Albanian delegations are likely to reassemble only for more
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There was an underlying sense of urgency, as the consequences of
heavy fighting in southern Kosovo emerged Wednesday. Reporters who
reached the still smoldering village of Ivaja found at least four
dead in the abandoned village, along with dead animals and scorched
farm buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces seized control of the village Tuesday after some
fighting. Much of the village was destroyed and the houses were
burned. Villagers had fled, some to the nearby village of Kotlina,
but aid agencies were still searching for an estimated 400 refugees
hiding somewhere in the wooded mountains above.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke had warned on his arrival in Belgrade Tuesday that
Kosovo was heading for an even greater tragedy and Belgrade was on
a collision course with the West. After the talks he reiterated
that the threat of NATO air strikes still hangs over Milosevic and
that the Yugoslav president was aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke said the current fighting in Kosovo, while
reprehensible, was part of the process and did not entirely disable
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Holbrooke will depart from Belgrade on Thursday, the
steady stream into Belgrade of foreign officials from the six
members of the Contact Group overseeing the region will continue.
Little change is expected before Monday when the talks begin,
however.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holbrooke was seen as the key to persuading the Yugoslav
president to accept the deal. He was accompanied by Christopher
Hill, the United States Ambassador to Macedonia. Hill has been
largely responsible for drafting the proposed peace plan that would
grant ethnic Albanians in Kosovo self-rule and the protection of
NATO-led troops for an interim period.
</P>
<P>
   The view in Belgrade is that Milosevic will eventually agree to
an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo but that he is not
yet ready to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Grubacic, editor of the independent VIP news service
in Belgrade, said this was not the end of the discussions, but
rather a few steps before the end. ``It will be a transfer of
messages, and seeing what are the limits of the other, what can be
the bargaining chips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grubacic suggested that a peace agreement is still several weeks
away. Milosevic, meanwhile, was looking for some guarantees from
the West, he said, namely that his position of power not be
attacked, that he not be pursued by the international tribunal's
investigation into war crimes, and that he win some lifting of
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also has to listen to an extent to the generals of the
Yugoslav Army. Many of them want to continue the war to suppress
the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and are also
violently opposed to the presence of NATO troops on Yugoslav soil.

HARMONISTS: THE FAB FOUR OF THEIR DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, March 12 by NYTimes News Service) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The German film ``The Harmonists'' tells a
fascinating story that never fails to fascinate, even though it
could have been told better. Strangely but helpfully, whenever this
naturalistic ``Cabaret'' slips into predictable plotting and
gathering Nazi storm cliches, an odd, amusing little musical number
soon comes along and saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   The film, like the controversial new Broadway production ``Band
in Berlin,'' is based on the true story of the Comedian Harmonists.
A vocal quintet and their pianist, the Harmonists apparently were
the Beatles of Weimar Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for their complex, well, harmonies, the weird noises they
made with their voices and clever nonsense lyrics (asparagus was a
major motif in one song), they enjoyed a series of hit recordings,
sold-out concerts and international tours before Hitler pulled the
plug on the half-Jewish combo in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Joseph Vilsmaier, follows a typical
rags-to-riches pattern, with the focus on the group's founder,
Harry Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen) and his relationship with driven
basso Robert Biberti (Ben Becker). The men disagree over just about
everything _ and in an unnecessarily contrived subplot, even vie
for the same woman's affections _ except their love for music and
respect for each other's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   As the political situation around them deteriorates, Jewish
Harry and gentile Robert are sorely tested and test each other _ in
one of the film's best scenes, Robert accuses Harry of having a
persecution complex, and his colleague slaps him repeatedly for
trivializing the dire situation; instantly chastened, Robert
accepts the blows without argument.
</P>
<P>
   The whole story revolves around the singers' willful refusal to
believe that Nazi anti-Semitism could be stronger than their own
popularity. And even though the other four Harmonists are, at best,
sketchily presented, the way the awful truth creeps into each
individual's consciousness is nicely delineated.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Cycowski (Heino Ferch), a Pole who went on to become the
oldest working cantor in America, insists that his fiancee convert
to Judaism under what he knows are the most difficult historical
circumstances. Erich A. Collin (Heinrich Schafmeister), all
monocles and cigarette holders and haughty Prussian superiority, is
more bemused than anything when he officially is declared
non-Aryan. Ari Leschnikoff (Max Tidof), a boisterous Bulgarian,
just hopes the band can work long enough for him to bed another
hundred or so groupies. And the pianist Erwin Bootz (Kai Wiesinger)
starts thinking up reasons why his marriage to a Jewish woman no
longer is working.
</P>
<P>
   Performances range from good to, where Noethen and Becker are
concerned, excellent. But it's the long-gone Comedian Harmonists
themselves whose work really stands out. Many of the film's musical
tracks are their old, brilliantly preserved and remastered
recordings, and although the modern actors do marvelously evocative
lip-synching, it's those impossibly weird vocal gymnastics that
truly give the movie its distinctive voice.
</P>
<P>
   There's a marvelous bit when the group-in-training, just
rejected by a clueless promoter and considering breaking up, break
instead into an improvised run-through of Duke Ellington's ``Creole
Love Call,'' each singer mouthing the sound of a different musical
instrument. It's a transcendent moment of creative joy in a smoky
old beer hall; seeing and hearing this, you can forgive the
Harmonists their delusion that art could survive the firestorm.

`THE CORRUPTOR' HAS ITS MOMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, March 12 by NYTimes News Service) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Remarkably well-crafted for a fundamentally
unremarkable police thriller, ``The Corruptor's'' pleasures are
modest but consistent. Set in Manhattan's Chinatown, it's a Ken
Starr Era tale of professional compromise, personal betrayal and
secret taping among New York's not-so-finest and competing
underworld tongs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a spectacularly destructive car chase, lots of posturing
by top Hong Kong tender/tough guy Chow Yun-Fat and some streetwise
soul-searching from Mark Wahlberg. Cop or crook, everyone double-,
triple- and octuple-crosses everybody else, and more people are
shot up in under two hours than have probably been killed in New
York since Mayor Giuliani took over.
</P>
<P>
   Generic and junky as all this sounds, director James Foley
(``After Dark, My Sweet,'' ``Glengarry Glen Ross''), instills more
humor, suspense and moral intelligence into the piece than
shoot-'em-ups usually bother with these days.
</P>
<P>
   Racial issues are handled with an interesting combination of
in-your-face bluntness (when Wahlberg's detective Danny Wallace
joins the all-Asian unit run by Chow's Nick Chen, his new
colleagues bust his chops about only being there to meet Chinese
girls) and drooling hypocrisy (every opportunity to undress a young
Asian woman is lovingly exploited).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some stereotypical exoticness is ascribed to a tong
mobster or two. For the most part, though, the film manages to
portray Chinese-American gang life persuasively, with a convincing
mix of cultural specificity and all-American ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg gives another psychologically solid, unfussy
performance, while Chow projects Eastwoodian formidability despite
his penchant for pulling goofy faces. Together, they make one of
the more engaging mismatched cop teams we've seen lately. And Foley
places them in a palpably restricting world of, yes, endemic
corruption, shot through with traps both ethical and physical.
</P>
<P>
   It's not ``Chinatown,'' Jake. But through efficient
storytelling, a few distinctive ideas and superior craftsmanship,
``The Corruptor'' makes its case. &QL;

WOODWARD DEFENSE DOCTOR'S FEE IN DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Roiled by conflicting accounts of how much a key expert
was paid by the defense team, the tempest continued Wednesday over
Sunday night's ``60 Minutes'' report, which raised questions about
the cause of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen's death.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another twist in the case, ``60 Minutes'' reporter Mike
Wallace said that Dr. Marvin Nelson told him Wednesday he was paid
a total of $1,000 by the defense team rather than the $300 Nelson
initially acknowledged receiving. Nelson was one of two experts
whom the program relied upon for the theory that the infant had
died from strangulation, rather than from being violently shaken.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward's defense team disputed the new figure of $1,000,
insisting that Nelson was paid only $700. Nelson did not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scores of doctors released a strongly-worded
statement refuting the claims by Dr. Floyd Gilles and Nelson, both
of Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, that the infant had been
strangled up to 48 hours before he died. The letter, sent to CBS
and other media outlets, labeled the theory ``preposterous,'' and
called for both the network and the doctors to apologize to Deborah
and Sunil Eappen, the infant's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The network's reaction was far from contrite, however. Wallace
called the letter ``old hash.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued controversy exposed nerves never far from the
surface since Woodward's frantic 911 call two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997 a jury found Woodward guilty of second-degree
murder, agreeing with prosecutors' claims that she killed Matthew
Eappen by violently shaking him, and slamming his head against a
hard object. Woodward was set free after Judge Hiller B. Zobel
overrode the jury's decision, reducing her conviction to
manslaughter and sentencing her to the 279 days she had already
served.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' report raised questions even about that
conviction, suggesting that the baby could have died from a
strangulation that took place up to 48 hours before he died, but
which did not have any visible effect until the baby began seizing
under Woodward's care.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Nelson, one of the proponents of the
strangulation theory, had been paid more than originally thought
for his 1997 services to the defense team had Wallace rethinking
the presentation of the doctor on Sunday night's segment.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he now wishes he had mentioned the defense team's
payment to Nelson during the ``60 Minutes'' broadcast, though he
reiterated his belief that the payment did not influence the
doctor's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known about it, I would have said something about a paid
consultant,'' said Wallace. ``However, I would have appended to
that the fact that both (Dr. Floyd) Gilles and Nelson disagreed
with the defense team's theory of the reasons for the death.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he learned of the higher sum when he called Nelson
Wednesday. According to Wallace, the doctor told him he was paid
$700 for a two-hour telephone consultation with defense attorney
Barry Scheck three weeks before Woodward's murder trial began in
September 1997. The payment also covered Nelson's examination of CT
scans and other medical records at the request of the defense.
(Though the defense team contacted him as a prospective expert
witness, Nelson did not testify in the trial.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wallace said, Nelson told him he was paid an
additional $300 from Elaine Whitfield-Sharp, then a member of the
defense team, after Sharp visited him at Children's Hospital in Los
Angeles to discuss the case in February 1998. But Sharp denied
making that additional payment of $300. Defense attorneys Harvey
Silverglate and Andrew Good said they did not make an additional
payment, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no knowledge of that (second) meeting, we have no
knowledge of a $300 payment,'' said Woodward defense lawyer Andrew
Good. ``Barry (Scheck) didn't pay anybody either. I don't think the
$300 happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``60 Minutes'' report prompted a censorious
letter Wednesday to CBS and other media outlets signed by 77 child
abuse, neuropathology, and forensic specialists from Massachusetts
to California condemning the strangulation claims. Many of the
doctors named in the letter had also signed a 1997 letter attacking
the defense's theory that Eappen had died of old injuries sustained
while he was not in Woodward's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory that (Matthew Eappen) sustained an injury that
would lead to his death and then appear normal for two days is
preposterous (and) not supported by the medical literature,'' the
letter said. The strangulation theory did not account for the
infant's severe head injuries, either, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people have very strong feelings about this case
because the family has suffered so much,'' said Dr. Carol Jenny,
professor of pediatrics at Brown University Medical School. ``We
felt it was only fair that we counter what we believe to be
misinformation in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter concluded by calling on CBS, and the doctors, to
apologize to the Eappens. ``Once again the Eappen family has been
revictimized by the media and by Louise Woodward,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Gilles refused comment on the letter Wednesday.
``Their view is that everybody is entitled to their opinions,''
said Children's Hospital spokesperson Steve Rutledge. ``As long as
it's an informed opinion based on examining the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace suggested the physicians had not seen enough of the
medical evidence to arrive at their conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not unexpected,'' he said. ``What are they going to
say, `We were wrong, we were wrong'? If someone will assemble a
dozen senior pediatric neuropathologists, get them to sit down with
the medical evidence and let them write a letter, then we'll begin
to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the new theory will be tested in a
courtoom. ``We want to investigate this as any responsible, ethical
lawyer would, with a view to seeing what the investigation shows,''
said Good. ``Then you decide what to do. What we want to do is get
to the facts. This may lead to the truth. At this point, going back
to court is hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-producer Katie Leishman, who originated the story for ``60
Minutes,'' sharply denied a Boston Herald report in which Dr.
Umberto De Girolami, a prosecution witness, asserted that she had
called him the day before the ``60 Minutes'' segment and asked for
a written endorsement of the strangulation theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she said. ``I never asked Dr. De Girolami to
endorse anything.'' What she was seeking on Saturday, Leishman
said, was permission to use a De Girolami quote on a different
scientific matter.

`WING COMMANDER' WHETS SPACE-OPERA APPETITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, March 12 by NYTimes News Service) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It may be the most eagerly awaited film of all
time, causing some people to buy a movie ticket just to watch its
preview trailer. The story line, the special effects, the long-ago
galaxy far, far away, all have been driving some folks into a
``Phantom Menace'' frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``Wing Commander'' isn't going to menace the ``Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Wing Commander'' remains a pretty entertaining
piece of work, the kind of grade-A movie of the B variety that's
just made for wasting a hot Saturday afternoon in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Except that this year, the hot Saturday afternoons cooling in a
theater may be devoted to the 15th watching of the new ``Star
Wars'' epic, due out in late May.
</P>
<P>
   So the producers of this movie wisely pushed its production
schedule a bit to let the show take wing before all falls under the
looming shadow of a young Darth Vader's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' is based on a hugely successful series of
video games of the same name created by Chris Roberts, who also
directed the movie and created its story line.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cinematic nature of the games _ which populated hours
of full-motion video and special effects with big-budget casts
including Mark Hamill, Malcolm McDowell and John Rhys-Davies _
Roberts' jump to the wide screen isn't so preposterous as it might
otherwise sound.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, he does a good job keeping the pace brisk and
engaging, though the story treads over extremely well-traveled
ground.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, there's the gifted and sensitive young half-breed
protagonist, Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.), on whom the fate of Earth
turns as a menacing (though goofy-looking) race of aliens tries a
surprise attack. There's the gonzo sidekick, Maniac (Matthew
Lillard), destined to get himself or others killed.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship is straight out of the ``Top Gun''
screenwriting school, where testosterone drips off every fighter
pilot in the ready room of the aircraft carrier-like TigerClaw
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a tough-guy ship's executive officer who's hard on the
half-breed (Jurgen Prochnow), a more-forgiving commanding officer
(David Suchet), the war-weary admiral who knew the half-breed's
father (David Warner) and a somewhat mystical freighter pilot who
has his own hidden forces, er, talents (Tcheky Karyo).
</P>
<P>
   If any of this sounds unfamiliar, surely you've never watched a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   There are some minor, though refreshing differences in the space
navy of the future, however.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the initially standoffish love interest (Saffron
Burrows) also commands the fighter squadron. And Maniac carries on
an instant love affair with another female pilot who's better than
he is (in and out of bed) before his rashness shortens the
relationship tragically.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he explicitly wanted to create a film evocative of
the old World War II films he grew up watching, such as ``Battle of
Britain'' and ``Midway.''
</P>
<P>
   That's clear, even down to the retro design of the fighter
ships, which look far more like the gull-wing Chance-Vought
Corsairs of World War II than a Lucasian Tie fighter or X-Wing.
</P>
<P>
   For further inspiration/recycling, Roberts also taps into the
old submarine-being-hunted-by-a-destroyer scene and even dips into
the days of wooden ships, with a lethal broadside battle between
two space ships.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects are fabulous, however, and Roberts doesn't
let too much emotional stuff sog up the zippy ride. And if this
spring proves to be unseasonably hot, you could do far worse than
devote a Saturday afternoon to ``Wing Commander,'' getting ready
for the ``Menace'' of summer. &QL;

CLINTON APOLOGIZES FOR U.S. SUPPORT OF GUATEMALAN MILITARY DURING
CIVIL WAR
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ President Clinton apologized on
Wednesday for U.S. support for right-wing governments in Guatemala
that killed tens of thousands of rebels and Mayan Indians in a
36-year civil war and promised American support for national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum with Guatemalan leaders, Clinton said, ``For the
United States, it is important that I state clearly that support
for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in
violence and widespread repression was wrong and the United States
must not repeat that mistake.'' He made the statement in his
opening remarks to an informal gathering of leaders from many
sectors of Guatemalan society, including prominent Indians, women,
government officials and representatives of a truth commission that
recently issued a report on the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A commission report, released late in February, concluded that
the United States gave money and training to Guatemalan forces that
committed acts of genocide against Mayans and other extreme human
rights abuses during the brutal conflict here, which began in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   CIA involvement in Guatemala's campaign of terror against Mayan
and leftist insurgents had long been an open secret, but the report
of the Historical Clarification Commission confirmed the CIA's
participation in a civil war that killed more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that American training of Guatemalan military
officers in counterinsurgency techniques played a significant role
in the torture, kidnapping and execution of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   American officials previously endorsed the findings of the
commission, but no president had directly confronted the U.S. role
in the war's atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday praised Guatemala as a society that is
coming to terms with its painful past and is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will no longer take part in campaigns of
repression, Clinton said. ``We must and will instead continue to
support the peace and reconciliation process in Guatemala,''
Clinton said on the third day of a four-day journey through Central
America. Earlier on Wednesday, in El Salvador, the president told
regional legislative leaders that it was time to put the bitter
ideological struggles of the past behind them and begin to address
their gaping social and economic inequalities.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on
Wednesday, Clinton obliquely acknowledged the U.S. role in the
civil wars that bloodied this region. But the president stopped
short in that speech of apologizing for American support for
murderous military regimes that perpetrated a decades-long reign of
repression throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   American backing for right-wing governments in Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua and covert actions against
leftist guerrillas over the past four decades caused ``bitter
divisions'' in the United States, Clinton said. But with every
nation in Central America now under democratic rule, he added, the
United States will try provide the financial and moral assistance
necessary to enhance their political and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to remember the past,'' the president said,
``but never repeat it.'' Clinton also promised to ``do everything I
possibly can'' to address the unequal treatment accorded some
illegal immigrants from the nations of Central America to the
United States. But even as he made the pledge, the administration
began steps to deport 5,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans who entered
the United States illegally in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch
last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must enforce our laws,'' Clinton said, referring to the
immigration issue that has angered governments in the region, ``but
we will do so with justice and with fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specifically vowed to try to change the rules under
which Salvadorans and Guatemalans who entered the United States in
the 1980s must prove that they face political retribution if they
are returned to their homes. Under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and
Central American Relief Act of 1997, Cubans and Nicaraguans who
entered the United States illegally fleeing left-wing governments
are granted a presumption of political hardship and given an
amnesty from deportation.
</P>
<P>
   But Salvadorans and Guatemalans, who fled authoritarian
governments, must overcome steep hurdles to avoid being returned to
their countries under the terms of the law, which Republicans
sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Salvadoran parliament on Wednesday that he
would try to enforce the law in a way that grants equal treatment
to all political refugees from the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should reflect what they suffered rather than who
caused the suffering,'' Clinton said. ``This is wrong and we should
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salvadoran Assembly, which now contains members from the
main guerrilla group that battled the government throughout the
1980s, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, applauded
Clinton's remark.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Duch Martinez, the president of the Salvadoran Assembly,
said in his introduction of Clinton that it was not longer war but
a lack of jobs that drove so many Central Americans to migrate to
the United States. Martinez said he hoped members of Congress
``will hear the requests of all of our brothers and sisters in
illegal immigrant status. This is supported by everyone in El
Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the region's ideological battlefields had been
transformed into a marketplace of competing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now, he said, is to move beyond the ``bitter
divide between left and right'' and begin to address the
``embittering divide between poverty and wealth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To that end, the administration is proposing a series of trade
liberalization laws to help the region recover from the devastation
of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, subject to congressional approval, would allow
duty-free treatment for textiles and apparel assembled in Central
America from fabric woven in the United States. The bill would also
lift all tariffs on handmade and folklore articles exported from
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would reduce tariffs on other goods
from Central America to conform with the duties charged on Mexican
products under the North American Free Trade Agreement.

 &HT;    At the forefront of integration as a student in the '60s,
longtime journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault now will chronicle
emerging Africa for CNN
 &HT;    W/BIO-BOX
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charlayne Hunter-Gault traded one South in transition
for another.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Atlanta in the '50s and a pioneer of integration at
the University of Georgia in the early '60s, the award-winning
journalist has spent the past two years based in Johannesburg,
South Africa, reporting on all of Africa for National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Come April 2, she'll move from NPR to CNN, becoming CNN's
Johannesburg bureau chief and the global network's most visible
face in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about anywhere you go in Africa, people are able to see
CNN,'' she says. ``Even in cases where people can't access CNN
because they don't have TVs or they don't have electricity, (CNN's)
stories get told.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter-Gault is back, briefly, in Atlanta to meet with
executives at CNN Center about her future with the network. Sitting
in the office of Eason Jordan, president of CNN International,
she's jet-lagged and fighting off yawns, having just flown in from
Africa. But even jet-lagged, she looks a good 15 years younger than
her 57 years, in her taupe jacket and black slacks and with her
tightly cornrowed hair and large hazel eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't made her main residence in Georgia since 1963 but
still considers it home, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pride in seeing Atlanta grow, but I feel some nostalgia
for the old days when there was a Davison's (now Macy's) and a
Rich's'' downtown, she says, even though when she was a teenager,
those stores' lunch counters were closed to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a black Southerner, you have to be careful when you talk
about gentility, because that conjures up all kinds of images that
aren't always positive. But there was, on the positive side, a
gentility in both blacks and whites that has dissipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, she says, has ``lost some of the charm that it had. I
still sort of cringe when I walk through the airport. I want to
hear a Southern voice. I don't want to hear a Muzak voice, a robot
voice. Its identity as a Southern city has been diluted.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey of Atlanta and the South in some ways parallels the
changes in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Africa has, in some respects, followed the path of the
American South. There are many points at which that story diverges,
but there are many points at which they are similar. That's why
it's captured America's attention: It's something they can relate
to.''
</P>
<P>
   And she sees the cosmopolitan growth of Atlanta mirrored in
cities all over the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa ... you go into places andyou see the charm of the
traditional being eroded by something you call progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hunter-Gault has known CNN chairman Tom Johnson for
almost 40 years _ he was editor of The Red &AMP; Black at UGA when she
was a journalism student _ it was Jordan, CNN's international
president, who recruited her to jump to the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knock on African coverage is it only brings you the
negative, although I don't think that's always fair,'' says Jordan.
``She does a lot of reporting that takes you behind the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ratchet up our coverage of Africa,'' Jordan adds.
``We're big believers in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter-Gault will continue to live in Johannesburg with her
mother Althea and her husband Ron Gault, managing director of J.P.
Morgan, an investment firm. But she'll roam the continent for her
reports, coordinating with CNN's bureaus in Nairobi and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage of Africa has usually been about who the bad guys
were,'' she says, ``or the end product of the action of the bad
guys. So you get starvation and massacres, you get Somaila. But I
think we have to look at even those stories in a different way. We
have to do the coverage of the breaking news and we also have an
opportunity, if not an obligation, to report those things that go
on between crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the brief is to cover the continent as holistically as
I can. You'll see more of the people on the ground, the people who
are impacted by the leaders, as well as the people who make the
policy. ''
</P>
<P>
   She won't have much competition on a day-to-day basis from the
broadcast networks' news divisions. ABC, CBS and NBC have no
permanent bureaus in Africa, relying on stringers and
correspondents who fly in and out to cover breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody since the end of the Cold War has been trying to
figure out what is news,'' she says. ``I don't think anybody's been
totally successful. You may not have the grand theme of good guys
vs. bad guys. But if you look to the people to tell the stories,
how people survive, people's aspirations, I think that's where the
new news is.''

   NAKANOJOMACHI, Japan _ Bulldozers and tall cranes are popping up
around the country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, raising
hopes that Japan may finally be close to lifting itself out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   No other country has ever poured as much money _ more than $830
billion the last 12 months alone _ into economic revival as has
Japan, and much of that money is now sloshing around the country
and creating a noticeable impact. Here in this village in central
Japan, as in much of the country, construction crews are again
busy, small companies are getting loans again and some people are
feeling a tad more confident.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese leaders have traditionally funneled money into
brick-and-mortar projects to stimulate the economy, so the signs of
life these days are interpreted by most experts as just a temporary
comeback, not a self-sustaining recovery. There have been many
false starts the last eight years, but the economy has always sunk
back, this time into the deepest recession since the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   To the pessimists, however, Japan is like a vehicle being towed
along the road by all that deficit spending: They doubt its engine
will start without an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for the movement, whatever the concerns for
the future, the passengers throughout Japan seem relieved that at
least the vehicle may be going forward again.
</P>
<P>
   Any progress in Japan would also be a major relief for the rest
of the world, since Japan is the second-largest economy after the
United States and by far the largest in Asia. Optimists believe
that Japan has finally bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst time has passed,'' Taichi Sakaiya, minister
of state at the Economic Planning Agency, said in a recent
interview in Tokyo. ``At least, there will be no further
deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   What is different this time, though, is that the government is
battling the recession on many fronts. It is borrowing more heavily
to finance its spending, and it is cleaning up the banking system
to alleviate the credit shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The next sign of Japan's progress comes on Friday, when the
government releases its report on the gross domestic product for
the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Some good news, at least, has been wending its way from the
trenches. Orders for new homes are up. Some companies are
refocusing their businesses, while others are selling off products
that had been piling up in warehouses. Banks, which had slashed
their lending under the burden of hundreds of billions of dollars
in bad debts, are beginning to ease up on credit. Small company
stocks are aggressively rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sakaiya, however, has moderated his view from late last
year, when he said he saw a ``quickening'' in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have growth this year,'' said Sakaiya, the author
of 50 books, including some on the reshaping of Japanese society.
``Otherwise, in the scheme of history Japan will be heading into a
dark age if negative growth continues.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stimulant has come from the government, which has
been pumping taxpayers' money into the construction of dams and
bridges and setting up lending programs throughout the country. In
a grand giveaway, the government is also passing out nearly $6
billion in shopping coupons, and there are some signs that the
coupons are encouraging consumers to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Fumio Takahashi, for one, is beaming heartily under his hard
hat. Takahashi, a stocky man in a black suit, runs a small
construction company in Nakanojomachi, and he now has several new
government contracts. Those contracts, in turn, have enabled him to
borrow $400,000 from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   One of his main projects is a 37.5-yard stretch of road that he
is rebuilding and widening, even though the road already provides
an adequately smooth car ride. There is also a project to build a
31-yard river embankment and another to build 81 yards of a new
road to a dam. Other construction companies have been assigned
other segments of the roads and the embankment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were no public works, this company would be gone _
bankrupt,'' Takahashi said as he stood on his dug-up road just a
few steps away from a patch of road that a competitor is repaving.
``This area is very rural, and there are very few factories, so
there are very few jobs. If there is no construction work, we can't
make our living.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is great news for Takahashi and his 20 employees. But
there are doubts about whether Japan really needs all the wider
roads and longer embankments. Takahashi relies on the government
for 85 percent of his business, and critics say the contracts are
simply pork barrel projects created by the dominant Liberal
Democratic Party to reward contributors in the construction
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, perhaps one reason Nakanojomachi is so flush is not just
that it is needy but also that it is the hometown of Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi. Home constituencies of prime ministers have always
received a disproportionate share of construction spending.
</P>
<P>
   Takahashi acknowledges he is in an industry scoffed at
frequently for its inefficiency, but he points out that at least
the town has advanced from farming to construction. In any case, he
knows his company will not last forever, not even to the next
generation. His son has already said that he will not take over the
business and hopes instead to find a salaried job at a big company.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of private economists in Tokyo sound a bit more
positive than they did a few months ago, but then again they could
scarcely have become more negative. Many describe the huge
government stimulus package as having stabilized the economy rather
than revived it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're bouncing along the bottom a little instead of
being in a free fall as we were last year,'' said Peter Morgan, an
economist with HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. ``Things are starting to
stabilize a bit, but it's not a clear soaring upward momentum. It's
like a gigantic Band-Aid being put around the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Few officials and politicians are as bold about their
pronouncements on the economy as Sakaiya, Japan's top economic
official. Ichizo Ohara, a Parliament member and occasional adviser
to Obuchi, the prime minister, argues that Japan needs far more
money flowing around if it is to strengthen the banks and revive
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought the economy had bottomed out, Ohara, a
former top Finance Ministry official, said it had. But then he
reversed himself, reflecting the uncertainty among many experts as
they read the mixed signs.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are still falling, signaling deflation. Corporate profits
for this fiscal year, which ends March 31, are expected to be
dismal _ down nearly 25 percent on average from the previous year.
Just last week, the index of leading economic indicators turned
down, after two months of pointing upward.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese politicians and economists agree that this year will be
critical for the economy, mainly because the leadership is running
out of options. The government is spending so much on the stimulus
that its budget deficit is running near 10 percent of total
economic output and the national debt burden will soon exceed the
size of the $4 trillion economy.
</P>
<P>
   Many municipalities are already broke, and the government's
enormous fund-raising plans have sent shudders through the markets
over the past several months and are threatening its previously
pristine sovereign credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, also has fewer
tricks left in its bag of policy tools, and bank officials
privately acknowledge that monetary policy will have limited
influence in the near future. Short-term interest rates already are
effectively zero.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly why some prominent advisers, foreign economists
and analysts are searching for solutions in a broad restructuring
of Japan Inc., and a move away from the traditional antidote of
paying for public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to create a society in which sound and creative
competition prevails,'' said Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of the
Economic Strategy Council, a high-level advisory group set up by
Obuchi. ``I think it will come earlier than expected because the
change in perceptions has already started.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy may hold promise, but it can be very threatening
to construction workers like Toshinobu Ichiba, a 37-year-old
foreman in Nakanojomachi, which has only 18,600 people. Ichiba has
been a cog in the construction industry of this picturesque
mountainous town, which has essentially been built up with
taxpayers' money. That money has paid for many of the roads and the
river banks, as well as a long cement tunnel through the mountains
and a suspension bridge that looks like a smaller version of the
Golden Gate Bridge spanning the entrance to San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun faded on his bridge project near a cliff on a recent
frosty day, Ichiba and his co-workers joked about how they had
nothing to do last spring. Now, Ichiba and his men are building a
bridge _ or rather, half of one. The government has only shelled
out the money for half of the bridge, so that is all they will
build for now. But they profess not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there will be work even if our company goes
bankrupt,'' Ichiba said.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this kind of outlook that has led some analysts
to call for a radical turnaround in the way companies are managed.
The problem, they say, is that people do not feel enough of a sense
of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, however measured, some change is beginning to surface in
the corporate world. A number of Japanese companies are selling
less profitable business lines, as well as assets like buildings,
resort clubs and land. While mass layoffs are still taboo,
companies are edging unproductive workers off the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Some hope that Japan may be able to engineer a ``jobless
recovery,'' in which the economy can improve as companies melt the
fat from their payrolls and reposition their businesses to compete
more effectively. Still, while restructuring may improve Japan's
economy in the long run, the initial result may be the opposite.
The first consequence will be an increase in the number of the
unemployed, now 3 million, and perhaps more of the sense of unease
that usually leads workers here to save rather than spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, people may be persuaded that the economy may
have hit the bottom, but the speed is slow,'' said Teizo Taya, an
economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research. ``How can you expect
a recovery of consumption when companies are busy restructuring
themselves?''

   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ President Clinton apologized on
Wednesday for U.S. support for right-wing governments in Guatemala
that killed tens of thousands of rebels and Mayan Indians in a
36-year civil war and promised American support for national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum with Guatemalan leaders, Clinton said, ``For the
United States, it is important that I state clearly that support
for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in
violence and widespread repression was wrong and the United States
must not repeat that mistake.'' He made the statement in his
opening remarks to an informal gathering of leaders from many
sectors of Guatemalan society, including prominent Indians, women,
government officials and representatives of a truth commission that
recently issued a report on the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A commission report, released late in February, concluded that
the United States gave money and training to Guatemalan forces that
committed acts of genocide against Mayans and other extreme human
rights abuses during the brutal conflict here, which began in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   CIA involvement in Guatemala's campaign of terror against Mayan
and leftist insurgents had long been an open secret, but the report
of the Historical Clarification Commission confirmed the CIA's
participation in a civil war that killed more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that American training of Guatemalan military
officers in counterinsurgency techniques played a significant role
in the torture, kidnapping and execution of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   American officials previously endorsed the findings of the
commission, but no president had directly confronted the U.S. role
in the war's atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday praised Guatemala as a society that is
coming to terms with its painful past and is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will no longer take part in campaigns of
repression, Clinton said. ``We must and will instead continue to
support the peace and reconciliation process in Guatemala,''
Clinton said on the third day of a four-day journey through Central
America. Earlier on Wednesday, in El Salvador, the president told
regional legislative leaders that it was time to put the bitter
ideological struggles of the past behind them and begin to address
their gaping social and economic inequalities.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on
Wednesday, Clinton obliquely acknowledged the U.S. role in the
civil wars that bloodied this region. But the president stopped
short in that speech of apologizing for American support for
murderous military regimes that perpetrated a decades-long reign of
repression throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   American backing for right-wing governments in Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua and covert actions against
leftist guerrillas over the past four decades caused ``bitter
divisions'' in the United States, Clinton said. But with every
nation in Central America now under democratic rule, he added, the
United States will try provide the financial and moral assistance
necessary to enhance their political and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to remember the past,'' the president said,
``but never repeat it.'' Clinton also promised to ``do everything I
possibly can'' to address the unequal treatment accorded some
illegal immigrants from the nations of Central America to the
United States. But even as he made the pledge, the administration
began steps to deport 5,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans who entered
the United States illegally in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch
last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must enforce our laws,'' Clinton said, referring to the
immigration issue that has angered governments in the region, ``but
we will do so with justice and with fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specifically vowed to try to change the rules under
which Salvadorans and Guatemalans who entered the United States in
the 1980s must prove that they face political retribution if they
are returned to their homes. Under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and
Central American Relief Act of 1997, Cubans and Nicaraguans who
entered the United States illegally fleeing left-wing governments
are granted a presumption of political hardship and given an
amnesty from deportation.
</P>
<P>
   But Salvadorans and Guatemalans, who fled authoritarian
governments, must overcome steep hurdles to avoid being returned to
their countries under the terms of the law, which Republicans
sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Salvadoran parliament on Wednesday that he
would try to enforce the law in a way that grants equal treatment
to all political refugees from the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law should reflect what they suffered rather than who
caused the suffering,'' Clinton said. ``This is wrong and we should
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salvadoran Assembly, which now contains members from the
main guerrilla group that battled the government throughout the
1980s, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, applauded
Clinton's remark.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Duch Martinez, the president of the Salvadoran Assembly,
said in his introduction of Clinton that it was not longer war but
a lack of jobs that drove so many Central Americans to migrate to
the United States. Martinez said he hoped members of Congress
``will hear the requests of all of our brothers and sisters in
illegal immigrant status. This is supported by everyone in El
Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the region's ideological battlefields had been
transformed into a marketplace of competing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now, he said, is to move beyond the ``bitter
divide between left and right'' and begin to address the
``embittering divide between poverty and wealth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To that end, the administration is proposing a series of trade
liberalization laws to help the region recover from the devastation
of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, subject to congressional approval, would allow
duty-free treatment for textiles and apparel assembled in Central
America from fabric woven in the United States. The bill would also
lift all tariffs on handmade and folklore articles exported from
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure would reduce tariffs on other goods
from Central America to conform with the duties charged on Mexican
products under the North American Free Trade Agreement.

for electrical utilities, has tweaked and tested its product.
Managers even plan to dispatch an employee to New Zealand on New

country close to the international date line. The company's
president, Alain Steven, says he is confident his software won't be

MUTANT GENE IN MOUSE HOLDS PROMISE FOR WEIGHT CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eat all the fat you want and still stay slender?
</P>
<P>
   A mutant mouse can do it, and scientists report they have
tracked down the gene that makes it possible, raising the prospect
of new treatments for human obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass. say that mice who harbor the mutant form of the gene they've
cloned don't become overweight even when they eat a high-fat diet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the mutant mice stayed at a healthy weight whether they
ate a spartan diet with only 9 percent fat, or pigged out on a
regimen larded with 42 percent fat. Genetically normal mice gained
plenty of weight on that diet.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Millennium hopes to make a drug with the same effect
as the mutation in the gene called mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   The mutant gene and the protein it makes are ``definitely an
inviting target'' for a drug the company hopes to develop as an
anti-obesity treatment, said Karen Moore, a Millennium researcher
who directed the research.
</P>
<P>
   However, she noted that it's too early to say whether this gene
provides a more promising path toward new weight-control treatments
than several other gene-based avenues the company is pursuing.
Other companies are also in hot pursuit of obesity-gene treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and her colleagues at Millennium describe the gene cloning
in an article in current Nature. In a companion article, scientists
from Stanford University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston report that they, too, have isolated the same gene _ but
show that it has a second, completely different function.
</P>
<P>
   John Duke-Cohan, a researcher in tumor immunology at
Dana-Farber, said that the mahogany gene's protein product, which
he and his collaborators call attractin, helps recruit defensive
molecules in the immune system to fight disease. He said it is
interesting but no longer terribly surprising that one gene and
protein can have very different roles. ``It's turning out now that
many proteins are multifunctional,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium team said that in normal mice with an intact
mahogany gene, consuming a high-fat diet leads to obesity, as one
would expect.
</P>
<P>
   But when the gene is mutant, or altered so that it produces an
abnormal protein, the mouse's mechanism of weight control gets
different signals, and the animal doesn't gain excess weight. How
this happens hasn't yet been determined, said Moore, but the
protein made by the mahogany gene serves as a signal-receiver on
cells that are involved in regulating the animal's weight.
</P>
<P>
   Humans also have the mahogany gene, but no one has found people
who have a mutation in that gene, as some mice do. Moore said it
should be possible to design a drug that would block the mahogany
signal-receiver in humans, mimicking the effect of the mahogany
mutation in mice, which keeps them lean.
</P>
<P>
   The isolation of the mahogany mutant comes five years after
scientists at Rockefeller University discovered a gene that causes
obesity in a certain strain of mice. Since then, universities and
biotech companies have been rapidly discovering other genes
involved in the complicated systems by which animals and humans
regulate weight and energy output.
</P>
<P>
   None of the discoveries has yet led to a novel weight-loss drug
approved for general use, though some are in early clinical trials.

MATADORS HAVE BIG-GAME EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Cal State Northridge women's basketball coach
Frozena Jerro wanted to, she could start five players with big-game
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's NCAA Tournament game at Colorado State (at 9 p.m.) will
be the first in school history, but it doesn't mean Northridge will
be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Amari, Natalia Jonas, Jamilah Jones, Viveca Lof and Neda
Milic have played in high-pressure games with plenty at stake,
ranging from high school state championships (Jones) to junior
college state finals (Amari, Jonas), to club national championships
(Milic).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big difference,'' Milic said. ``It's very exciting.
So much is at stake right now. We're gonna go there and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Advantage, CSUN? The Matadors have plenty to worry about when
facing Colorado State, which features All-American point guard
Becky Hammon (22.6 points, 51 percent from the field).
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the tapes reveal is a height advantage for CSUN.
Expect to see plenty of posting up by Amari, Milic, Lof, Leah Rice
and Keisha Harris. Because of the height disadvantage, Jerro
expects Colorado State to play some zone defense, meaning the
Matadors will have to hit their outside shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to take what they give us, especially
from 10 to 12 feet,'' Jerro said. ``We can't afford to shoot in the
low 30s/high 20s (field goal percentage).''
</P>
<P>
   If Monday's practice is any indication, there won't be any
trouble there. In 45 seconds, Amari sank 11 of 12 3-pointers,
Harris hit 13 of 18 baseline jumpers, including 10 in a row in one
stretch, and Lof hit 9 of 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hit them, no problem,'' said Harris, who never gets 18
shots in a game.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, Jerro said, Northridge must control the
tempo by doing the opposite of what Colorado State does.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is if we start to turn the ball over, they can
score a bunch in a hurry,'' Jerro said. ``If they do, it will be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Common opponents: Colorado State beat Weber State by seven
points. Northridge lost to Weber by 11 and won by 13.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State beat Portland State by 12 points. Northridge beat
the Vikings by 10, four and 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   __ On sale now: Tickets are available for the West Regional
March 20 and 22 at the Sports Arena. Three-game ticket packages are
available for $30 in the lower levels and $25 in the upper levels.
Youth packages are $12.
</P>
<P>
   The two semifinals will be March 20 at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. The
final is March 22 at 9 p.m. The winner advances to the Final Four
in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA or Cal State Northridge win their first two tournament
games, they will play at the Sports Arena.

U.S. CURBS LOW-FLIGHT TRAINING IN ITALY NEAR '98 SKI-LIFT DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American flight crews working temporarily at the
base in Aviano, Italy, are now prohibited from low-level training
flights like the one that hit a ski-gondola cable 13 months ago,
killing 20 people, the Pentagon said Wednesday in announcing plans
for a safety study in the wake of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes of each training flight are routinely reviewed by
outsiders to make sure rules are followed, a Pentagon spokesman
said, but the military will not discuss other details, like whether
the map used by the pilot last year, which did not show the cable,
has been updated.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has appointed Adm. Joseph W.
Prueher, the former commander in chief of the Pacific Command, to
review measures taken since the Marine Corps Prowler jet hit the
cable. The review is to take 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was acquitted by a military jury last Thursday, a day
before Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy visited the White
House. President Clinton promised the review after international
outrage over the verdict. The Italians are to appoint an officer to
work with Prueher (pronounced PREE-er).
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Michael W. Doubleday of the Navy,
said that since the accident, Italian air traffic controllers have
been briefing crews before each flight, and low-level training
flights by American crews not permanently based in Aviano have been
banned. The Marine squadron involved in the cable accident was on a
six-month tour.
</P>
<P>
   New rules also require crews flying low-level missions ``to
initial that they have read all of the appropriate directives and
appropriate briefing materials,'' Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth H. Bacon, another Pentagon spokesman, asked on
Friday about the chart the crew was using, which did not show the
lift cables, said, ``I'm not aware that a change has been made yet
in the map, but I really can't talk about that because that's the
subject of a different litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The court-martial disclosed other, deeper problems. For example,
the Marines were relying on an altimeter that may have been
disabled by the way they were flying the plane. Also, pilots fly
low-level missions so seldom that they cannot maintain proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps is planning to announce on Monday whether it
will also court-martial the Marine navigator, Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, on the homicide and manslaughter charges on which the
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine Forces in the Atlantic,
under whose authority Ashby was court-martialed, will also announce
how the Corps will proceed with obstruction of justice charges
against both officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby testified during his trial, at Camp Lejeune, N.C., that
Schweitzer had made a videotape on an early part of the flight and
that after the emergency landing at Aviano, Ashby had stuck the
tape in a pocket and removed it from the plane. He said he gave the
tape to Schweitzer, but it was not clear from the testimony what
happened to it.
</P>
<P>
   Pace could decide on court-martials for each officer on the
obstruction charge, or could call for a less formal hearing, as
defense lawyers have suggested. Pace conducted such a hearing last
year for the commander of the Marine squadron and three other
officers, eventually relieving the squadron commander of his job
and officially reprimanding the squadron safety officer,
effectively ending his career. To date, these are the only
punishments for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   If Pace decides on a court-martial on the manslaughter and
homicide charges, it would take place before a new jury, but those
jurors would know about the result of the first trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowler they were flying has a single set of controls, which
were handled by Ashby, but Schweitzer was in charge of planning the
flight, including a check of maps and flight rules.

YANKEES MANAGER TOREE HAS PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Joe Torre, 59-year-old manager of the world
champion New York Yankees, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer
and has left the team to begin treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The startling announcement was made at City of Palms Park
Wednesday, less than two hours before a split-squad Yankee team was
scheduled to play the Red Sox. In Bradenton, Fla., another squad of
Yankee players got the news as it prepared to play the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The team believes doctors caught the disease in its early
stages, and owner George Steinbrenner said he expects Torre back in
30 days _ which would be April 9, the day of the Yankees' home
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Torre learned of the diagnosis either Tuesday or early Wednesday
and did not travel with either team. He asked catcher Joe Girardi
to address the squad in Fort Myers and veteran outfielder Paul
O'Neill to tell the players in Bradenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine,'' Torre said in a prepared statement, ``and I am
looking forward to taking care of this problem and getting back to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who visited Torre at the manager's spring home in
Tampa and said he was in good spirits, said, ``Joe will handle this
situation with the same determination and courage that he has
always demonstrated. Our prayers are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how long he will be away from the
team, what his course of treatment will be, or where he will be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee players were shocked at the announcement, particularly
outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who Wednesday played his first game
since being diagnosed with colon cancer last October. Strawberry
was 1 for 4 against the Red Sox Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad day for all of us,'' said Strawberry. ``We're
devastated. We're definitely praying for him and his family. I pray
the whole process will go well for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a particularly difficult week for the New York
franchise. Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio died Monday and now the team
is without its beloved manager as it prepares for the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe treated me as well as a manager could,'' said Girardi.
``He's the reason I'm here from Day One. And Joe has kept me here.
He's meant a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no announcement regarding Torre's interim
replacement. Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss managed the team
that lost to the Red Sox, 6-1, Wednesday while former Yankees
manager Stump Merrill, now a special assistant to general manager
Brian Cashman, managed the other squad in Bradenton. Third base
coach Willie Randolph and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre also are
expected to be part of a rotation of managers in Torre's absence.
In addition, former Red Sox skipper Don Zimmer, who is recovering
from knee surgery, is Torre's trusted bench coach and could be a
candidate for the interim position.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is second only to lung cancer among cancer
killers of American men, taking about 40,000 lives annually. Most
prostate cancer happens sporadically; patients have no particular
family history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   There were an estimated 179,300 new cases of prostate cancer in
the United States last year. More than 75 percent of all cases are
diagnosed in men older than 65. In the past 20 years, the survival
rate for all prostate cases, regardless of stage, has increased
from 67 percent to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is the third prominent person in baseball to be diagnosed
with cancer this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga was diagnosed with a
cancerous tumor in his lower back and is undergoing chemotherapy.
He will miss the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Marlins third baseman Mike Lowell, a former Yankees
prospect, was diagnosed last month with testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Marv Levy, the former coach of the Buffalo Bills, underwent
surgery for prostate cancer during the 1995 NFL season and, at 70,
was back coaching within a month.
</P>

   The Torre family faced another medical crisis in 1996 when Joe's
brother Frank, also a former major leaguer, underwent a successful
heart transplant the night before Joe managed the Yankees in Game 6
of the World Series. Now the Yankee manager faces a battle of his
own.

BAD NEWS FOR TORRE SENDS YANKEES REELING 
</HEADLINE>

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry came off the field, got
himself a cup of water, and sat on the visitor's bench at City of
Palms Park. This was a big day for Straw, his first baseball game
since colon cancer ended his season during last October's American
League Division Series against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters gathered around Strawberry and asked questions about
his gallant bid to return to the majors. Suddenly, in front of the
dugout, a Yankee official said the club had an important statement.
None of the reporters around Strawberry moved. But then a sheet of
paper found its way to the Yankee bench and shocked reporters
started asking Strawberry about manager Joe Torre's bout with
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad day for all of us,'' said Strawberry. ``We're
devastated. We're definitely praying for him and his family. I pray
the whole process will go well for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer is democratic. It strikes rich and poor, large and small,
young and old, black and white. Sometimes it seems to find those
best able to spread the word on early detection. This is an
illogical and emotional theory _ one requiring faith in larger
forces _ but it's all we have when we try to explain how Joe Torre
could be diagnosed with cancer the same day Darryl Strawberry
begins a celebrated comeback from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are the best, fattest team in baseball. They won 125
games last year and Time magazine dubbed them the Greatest Team
Ever. They added future Hall of Famer Roger Clemens to the roster
this spring, which is like sending Cindy Crawford to work at the
Playboy Mansion. But now sorrow stalks the mighty Pinstripers
almost daily. Torre's news came just two days after the death of
Yankee Clipper Joe DiMaggio. Meanwhile, Yankee Hall of Famer
Catfish Hunter fights a battle with the degenerative disease named
after Yankee great Lou Gehrig. And Strawberry reminds himself to
stay out of the sun the day after his chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's legs are still weak. He's scheduled to have
treatments until May. The Yankees already have three left fielders
(Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee, and Shane Spencer), plus a regular
designated hitter in Chili Davis. They may not need Strawberry, but
team owner George Steinbrenner generously renewed his contract for
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry faced Pedro Martinez in the second inning Wednesday,
got a nice ovation from the sellout crowd, then fanned on four
pitches. In the fourth, again against Pedro, Strawberry grounded
sharply to first baseman Bob Hamelin. He hit a bloop single to left
off Kirk Bullinger in the seventh, and hit into a fielder's choice
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed to be able to play again,'' said Strawberry.
``I'm thankful things have worked out well, but there are no
guarantees that you are going to recover as well as you think you
may. With me, it's not about the comeback. It's about the fight
against cancer. Coming back to play baseball is very easy for me.
Coming back to fight cancer is very difficult. I've got to fight
and I've got to be strong about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly devastating when it happens. How much can you take?
How much can a person take? We should go out and dedicate this
season to Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Strawberry spoke, Yankees catcher Joe Girardi sat at the
other end of the dugout. Torre had sought Girardi early Wednesday
in the Yankee clubhouse in Tampa and asked him to address the split
squad in Fort Myers. Then Girardi sat in silence at the front of
the bus for 2 1/2 hours, thinking about how he would break the news
to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's the reason I'm here from Day One,'' said the catcher.
``Everyone loves Joe because Joe treats you the way you want to be
treated. He came to me and asked me to tell the guys on this trip
because we couldn't all be together.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Yankee squad played in Bradenton Wednesday against the
Pirates. Torre asked outfielder Paul O'Neill to speak to that
group.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's problem was discovered as part of routine physicals
given to all uniformed personnel each spring. Team officials said
he'd been unusually quiet in recent days, and senior advisor Arthur
Richman described Torre as ``lightheaded'' Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the club, Torre said, ``I feel fine and
I am looking forward to taking care of this problem and getting
back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said in a statement, ``Joe will handle this
situation with the same determination and courage that he has
always demonstrated. Our prayers are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the baseball world was gripped by the story of
Torre's brother, Frank Torre, who had a heart transplant prior to
Game 6 of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves. The Yankees
won the Series and the story of the Torre brothers, both former
major leaguers, was made into a television movie.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who will manage the Yankees while Torre
undergoes treatment. Hitting coach Chris Chambliss managed the
squad at Fort Myers while coach Stump Merrill (a former Yankee
manager) did the chore in Bradenton. Torre's bench coach, former
Red Sox manager Don Zimmer, is recovering from arthroscopic knee
surgery, but could be a candidate to take over in Torre's absence.
Zimmer has been in baseball for more than 50 years and managed the
Red Sox in the memorable one-game playoff against the Yankees in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the world champs are reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't ask why.'' said Strawberry. ``I don't think anyone
asks why this happened to me. You just have to fight it. It's a
battle. When you face cancer you don't know which way it's going to
go. I'm a survivor at this point, but there's no guarantee it won't
reoccur. So you just take life for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to see anyone else have to face this battle. But
every cancer patient and myself, we've got to have hope. Anybody
battling the disease, you want to applaud 'em. Joe's a good person.
He'll be able to help others. Joe's gonna be a real good spokesman
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman, a loyal Yankee employee who has been in baseball for
more than a half century, sat in the dugout and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw Joe this morning,'' said Richman. ``This is
terrible. It just shows you. They talked about how we were going to
have everyone back from last year. And now this happens. You never
know. You just never know.''

TWO NEW RELEASES LIVING OUT LOUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 12  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ Two underappreciated films hit the video racks
next Tuesday _ Warren Beatty's politcal satire ``Bulworth'' and
screenwriter Richard LaGravenese's directing debut, ``Living Out
Loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, some thought that ``Bulworth'' would be an Oscar
contender, but mixed critical reviews and so-so box office put an
end to that. The film did pick up a screenwriting nomination for
Beatty and Jeremy Pikser.
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer ambitions for ``Living Out Loud,'' although
LaGravenese has gotten an Oscar nomination for ``The Fisher King''
and has written a number of other high-profile films, including
``The Horse Whisperer'' and ``The Bridges of Madison County.''
</P>
<P>
   What the two films have in common is that they are both about
getting to the truth in unusual ways.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty plays liberal California Sen. Jay Bulworth, who is in a
tough re-election fight. His life has become a sham. After years of
campaigning, he has repeated the same lines over and over so that
he can't tell the bull from the worthwhile anymore. Compounding
this, he has just lost millions in investments. After making a deal
with a corrupt lobbyist for a lot of life insurance, he puts out a
contract on himself in order to leave his daughter financially
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking he has three days to live, Bulworth suddenly finds
himself liberated. On a campaign stop at an African-American church
in Los Angeles, he suddenly starts blurting out statements such as
that blacks will never have power within the establishment until
they've spent the money to buy it like whites do.
</P>
<P>
   That quickly gets him into hot water with his chief of staff
(Oliver Platt), but it picks him up some support from members of
the black community, including an attractive woman named Nina
(Halle Berry).
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, Bulworth is in Beverly Hills, insulting a
mostly Jewish audience of movie moguls and wondering why they
produce ``mostly crap'' and reasoning that it's the money. ``How
much money do you guys really need?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues ranges from the preposterous to the outrageous.
Beatty is almost as set as his alter ego on waking people up. But
the film probably came across as too risky for most people. Like
Bulworth's fictional audience, movie audiences weren't sure how to
react. Nevertheless, you rarely see filmmakers take chances like
Beatty did in this film, and it is a compliment to him that he
didn't play it safe. If you didn't see ``Bulworth'' in theaters,
take a chance on one of the most provocative films of 1998. If you
did see it and weren't sure about it, it's worth a second look.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Living Out Loud,'' Holly Hunter plays the newly dumped wife
of a high-powered and wealthy doctor, and Danny DeVito is the
elevator operator in her Manhattan high-rise apartment building.
They are an unlikely romantic couple, and LaGravenese uses
unconventional methods to unfold their story.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by the divorce after 16 years of marriage, Judith
(Hunter) can't cope with life. ``What am I supposed to do with all
this information?'' she worries as she watches the news. And she is
apt to fantasize about a situation rather than act upon it. It
takes an unexpected moment _ she is kissed outside a club by a man
who thinks she's another woman _ to shake her from her lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Pat (DeVito) has been thrown out by his wife after 25 years
because of his gambling debts, and his daughter, whom he adored,
has died. He refuses to work for a brother who owns a bar, clinging
to his independence, although all he has never followed through on
his grandiose plans.
</P>
<P>
   Before Judith and Pat can move on with their lives, they have to
find out the truth about who they are. And finding out is the joy
of this film.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito and Hunter turn in marvelous performances in
LaGravenese's cleverly plotted and delightful film. An added bonus
is Queen Latifah, who plays a singer in a nightclub Judith
frequents. She not only lights up the screen but does some classy
torch-song renditions.

   CHIC/``LIVE AT THE BUDOKAN'' (Sumthing Else)
</P>
<P>
   This was the final concert by disco-jazz outfit Chic to feature
founding bassist Bernard Edwards, who died in his Tokyo hotel room
after the 1996 gig. It was a star-studded send-off and highlights
of this live set include extended versions of glorious Chic hits
like ``Good Times,'' ``Chic Cheer'' and ``We Are Family''
(featuring vocal group Sister Sledge). The only misstep _ a cover
of Jimi Hendrix's ``Stone Free'' that spotlights Steve Winwood on
vocals and Slash on cliche-ridden lead guitar. The musicianship of
Chic guitarist-producer Nile Rodgers, Edwards and drummer Omar
Hakim throughout keep this album percolating. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
STAN GETZ AND CHET BAKER/``THE STOCKHOLM CONCERTS'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, troubled trumpeter Baker joined the Getz quartet for
what was supposed to be a 35-date European tour. The insecure Getz
never liked Baker, though, and dissolved the partnership halfway
across the continent. This three-disc album provides a fascinating
glimpse into the teaming with two complete concerts performed early
in the tour. The first disc features Getz's masterful tenor work
with his talented band: pianist Jim McNeely, bassist George Mraz
and drummer Victor Lewis. Baker arrives and, with his ravaged
voice, croaks through ``Just Friends'' and a poignant ``My Funny
Valentine,'' both of which are repeated during the second concert.
When the two perform together _ the swinging ``Sippin' at Bells''
and a plaintive ``Dear Old Stockholm'' among several others _ it's
fascinating to hear the distinct styles mesh and tangle. With 23
cuts and 16 different songs, this is a treasure for anyone who
loves these two jazz masters. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
JULIAN LENNON/``PHOTOGRAPH SMILE'' (Fuel 2000/Universal)
</P>
<P>
   Beatles offspring Lennon seems to have been out of the limelight
for half a lifetime since releasing his well-liked debut album,
``Valotte.'' Three albums followed; none made an impression. With
``Photograph Smile,'' Lennon successfully returns with 14 songs of
heartfelt, melodic pop that deal mostly with love won and lost.
(There is one environmental anthem.) If John's oldest son received
too much attention when he burst onto the scene 15 years ago, it's
also true that he deserves some airplay and acclaim for this taut,
tuneful and ultimately honest collection. Lennon has matured in his
craft, taking a sad song (or three) and making it better. 3 stars

TREASURY THEFT ACCUSED FAILED TO DISCLOSE FULL HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The former deputy treasurer who was charged this month
with stealing $2.4 million from a state fund failed to disclose in
government ethics filings his ownership of two pieces of real
estate, including a shopping mall in Ashland worth more than $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Foley of Lexington declared last year in divorce
papers that he owned three rental properties, but he listed only
one on the annual financial disclosure statements he has filed with
the state Ethics Commission since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Foley made no reference on the statements to owning, through a
real estate trust, two income-producing properties in Ashland: the
shopping center and a multiunit house, which together generated
more than $200,000 a year in profits for him, according to divorce
papers he filed at Middlesex Probate Court. He did list a rental
property in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators have asked for Ethics Commission records on
Foley. If he is found guilty of failing to report ``material''
information, he could face three years in prison and a fine of up
to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gary L. Meyers, Foley's attorney, declined comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office has charged Foley and three
others in connection with the theft of a total of $8.9 million from
the state's Unpaid Check Fund. On Tuesday, an investigator from the
office requested all of Foley's statements filed with the Ethics
Commission, as well as those of John F. Trischitta, another former
treasury employee charged in the thefts, and of Amelia Viscomi
Tamburrini, who worked with Foley at the treasury and is his
fiancee. She has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Heffron, spokesman for Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly,
declined comment on the request.
</P>
<P>
   In divorce documents he filed in 1997 and 1998, Foley said he
owned three pieces of income-producing property, including a house
each in Framingham and Ashland and the shopping mall in Ashland in
the name of VLAR Realty Trust, which listed him as the sole
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had purchased the mall, which has an assessed value
of $7.7 million, in 1989. In an income statement filed with the
divorce papers, Foley estimated he made a net profit of $315,692 in
1997 from the mall. In a separate document, his wife estimated
Foley's equity interest in the shopping mall at $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Foley also alleged in papers she filed in the divorce that
she believed that Robert Foley had made money from an interest in a
28-unit housing development in Holliston as well as from the sale
of a condominium in Quincy. Foley never made reference to owning
property in Holliston or Quincy in any of his government financial
disclosure statements.

 &HT;    Who can stop Duke?
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ For everyone billing the 1999 NCAA Basketball
Tournament as ``The Duke Invitational'' and labeling the No. 1 Blue
Devils (32-1) as unbeatable, coach Mike Krzyzewski and company have
a short response: UNLV, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Runnin' Rebels entered that tournament 34-0 and as the most
prohibitive favorites to win the national championship since the
end of the UCLA dynasty. The defending national champions had three
future NBA players _ Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon, and Greg Anthony
_ and an average margin of victory of 27.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 30, 1991, the seemingly invincible team of Jerry
Tarkanian was upset 79-77 at the Final Four semifinals in
Indianapolis. The giant-killer was Duke, which went on to win the
title.
</P>
<P>
   In March Madness, unlike the NBA playoffs, one bad game and
you're on the way home. Doesn't matter if you're Duke or Florida
A&AMP;M, who plays the Blue Devils in Friday's East Regional at the
Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to pop in a tape of that (1991) Final Four to remind
my teammates that a loss can happen, I will,'' junior Chris
Carrawell said. ``It could happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the cautionary tales. Here's the reality. Duke is
the most dominating college basketball team since that UNLV team,
and it would take a monumental collapse, a monumental performance
or both to keep the Blue Devils from cutting down the nets in St.
Petersburg on March 29. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Duke made a joke of the ACC's regular-season race, winning its
16 conference games by an average of 24.3 points. Then it ripped
through the ACC Tournament, winning by a record 25 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since an eight-point win at Georgia Tech, Duke won its past
nine games by an average of 28.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only three of 32 victories have been in single digits. Duke
has won 13 games by 30 or more.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge certainly is convinced. On
Feb. 28, the Blue Devils handed his Tar Heels their worst defeat _
81-61 _ in 177 home games in the Dean E. Smith Center. One week
later, with All-ACC guard Trajan Langdon out with a sprained foot,
Duke again pounded UNC 96-73. It was the third-most-lopsided
championship game in ACC Tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a team that's such an odds-on favorite to win
the national championship,'' Guthridge said. ``They are head and
shoulders above everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   This Duke team is so talented that it is the only ACC squad to
place all five starters on first-, second- or third-team
all-conference squads. And freshman Corey Maggette was the
second-leading vote-getter for ACC rookie of the year. The
foundation for the team that could be the best in Blue Devil
history goes back a year, when Kentucky denied the Blue Devils
(32-4) a Final Four appearance. Trailing by 17 points with under 10
minutes to play, the Wildcats rallied to beat Duke 86-84 in the
South Regional final and went on to win the national championship.
The Blue Devils blew their big lead in that game because they
couldn't handle Kentucky's quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski solved that problem. William Avery took over at point
guard, giving Duke a player to run with the fastest guards in the
game and score. Maggette gave the Blue Devils an even greater
degree of athleticism. Those two changes, combined with the talent
on hand, have made the Duke team of 1999 look more like UNLV of the
early '90s than the talented, but methodical, units of the
Christian Laettner era of 1989-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has a more athletic team now that can attack you
offensively at all five positions,'' ESPN's Dick Vitale said. ``It
looks like a very special team.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland has been in the top five just about all season and, by
all accounts, has enough talent to get to the Final Four. The Terps
lost by 18 in both games against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a reflection of their coach,'' Maryland's Gary
Williams said of the Blue Devils. ``Each time they walk on the
court, they try to earn the right to win each game. When you have
that kind of attitude with the talent level they have, it's really
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson hung tough at Duke for about 15 minutes on Feb. 20. Down
32-30, the Blue Devils went on a 26-0 run and eventually won 92-65.
``Duke has a way of making you fall apart,'' Clemson coach Larry
Shyatt said. ``They play with a great deal of freedom and
fearlessness. They can put it on you on both ends of the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to run off a string of points without warning is the
thing that scares opponents most about Duke. ``They have a great
deal of confidence and are playing very uninhibited,'' Wake Forest
coach Dave Odom said. ``They don't get down about anything. It's
like they enjoy teams taking fast shots. Over the course of 40
minutes, a fast pace will lend itself to a streak of points.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Duke appeared poised for a letdown. They traveled
to Chicago to play DePaul's young, but talented, team. The Blue
Devils had their biggest rival, North Carolina, coming up on
Saturday. No one would have been surprised had they come out flat.
Instead, Duke had one of its most impressive outings of the season,
placing five players in double figures and mauling the Blue Demons
96-64.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're much scarier up close and personal than any tape could
ever describe,'' said Pat Kennedy, the DePaul coach. ``There's no
one competing on their level right now, including the Connecticuts
and the Michigan States and those folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there teams in the tournament that can beat Duke? Of course,
but the Blue Devils would have to have an off shooting night and
the opponent would have to do just about everything right.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cincinnati (26-5), the only team to beat Duke this season,
when it went the length of the court in the final seconds to win
77-75 in the Alaska Shootout. The Bearcats have the athletes but
have struggled of late, losing to UNC-Charlotte in the Conference
USA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ The No. 3 seed in the South Regional, St. John's (25-8) took
the Blue Devils to overtime before losing 92-88 in Madison Square
Garden on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   _ The No. 1 seed in the West, UConn (28-2) occupied the No. 1
ranking in those few weeks Duke did not. The Huskies have the
guards to handle Duke's pressure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky (25-8), because the tournament-tough 'Cats will not
be intimidated by anybody.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan State (26-5), the No. 1 seed in the Midwest. The
Spartans lost to Duke 67-60 on Dec. 2 in Chicago.

<P>
   Krzyzewski has not backed away from the praise. He concedes that
his team is playing against its own potential and its place in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the position we're in, most people will tell us how good
we are,'' Krzyzewski said. ``If we listen to that, we're fools. We

 &HT;    Lewis holds no terror for Holyfield
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The two boxers obliged promoters Wednesday, standing
in their cliched poses for photographers, with obligatory stares
and clenched fists.
</P>
<P>
   The staging wasn't much different from four months ago, when the
heavyweight title unification between Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis was announced. The biggest difference then was that Holyfield
used the photo op as a communication op. He approached Lewis and
said, ``I'm going to put pressure on you from the time the bell
rings. I'm going to jump right on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield laughed when he thought about it now, saying, ``It
shocked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shock or not, Holyfield's camp has not been shy about divulging
its fight plan for Lewis, who is three years younger (33), 23
pounds heavier (243, pending the weigh-in) and four-and-a-half
inches taller (6 feet 7) with a 6 1/2-inch reach advantage (84).
</P>
<P>
   Pressure. Work inside. Stay clear of Lewis's right hand and
counter his shots to the body and head with hooks and uppercuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be easier than the (Mike) Tyson fights,''
Holyfield trainer Don Turner said. ``(Contender) Lou Savarese said
to me, `Evander wins in five rounds.' I said, `What's the other
four for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has shown little concern about Lewis. When he was
asked about comparisons between Lewis and Riddick Bowe, who beat
Holyfield twice, Holyfield said, ``Lennox doesn't fight like
Riddick Bowe. He's just a big guy. Kind of arrogant. He's what you
call proud. So proud. But I just know I'm gonna crush him. Clear as
day. And I'm not feeling bad about it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, dismissed the brash
projections, and welcomed the planned attack. ``As far as I'm
concerned, that helps Lennox,'' Steward said. ``Everybody says
they're going to get in close to Lennox, but it's not that easy.
Bowe didn't have the physical strength of Lennox.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward then took a shot at Turner, saying, ``I don't think much
of him. What kind of trainer tells his fighter, `The guy you're
fighting can't fight.' He's riding the coattails of Evander's
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward said he believes Holyfield's attack pledge. The result,
he said, will be determined by how Lewis reacts. Steward said he
wants him to throw stiff jabs, ``the kind of jabs that do some
damage, not that pawing jab that he throws too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' also plans to try to tie up Holyfield often, grabbing by
the arms, shoulders and even neck, trying to use his size
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lennox wants to, he can grab Evander and throw him around
the ring,'' Steward said. ``Evander has no idea how strong this man
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield acknowledged that pressing the attack against Lewis
leaves open the possibility of getting hit by a right hand, but he
said, ``I wouldn't be the person I am if I didn't take chances. I'd
still be in the ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who has watched six of Lewis' fights on tape, echoed
those remarks. ``To be a great fighter, you have to be a great
gambler. You can't sit back and wait for the guy to do something.
He has to work hard to counterpunch a bigger guy. In close, you can
smother punches and counterpunch. It's hard to do that on the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield will try to move in and out, similar to his fights
against Buster Douglas and Bowe II. Lewis has not handled
opponents' movement well in the past, Turner said, and poor balance
tends to offset his power. Turner also said that Lewis' perceived
lack of hand speed will make it easy for Holyfield to see the
punches coming, duck inside and counter with quick combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most big guys, their power is everything,'' Holyfield said.
``When they can't hurt you with that, they're ordinary. Then they
start panicking. They can't handle pressure. Guys try to hit me all
the time. I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has any concern for Lewis' right hand, Holyfield
said, ``All heavyweights have a right hand. You just don't want to
get hit by it. I've always had the ability to see it coming. It's
not like I'm going to hold my head right there and say, `OK, hit me
with that big right hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steward said that people overstate Lewis' reliance on his right
and that he thinks the left hook is his best punch. He said he
wants Lewis to throw left hooks, set up by the jab, but he
conceded, ``Lennox hasn't done that enough in past fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield smiled when asked about Steward's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emanuel Steward is not going to take responsibility for Lennox
Lewis losing,'' he said. ``His whole thing will be, `Go out there
and jump on him.' Then when Lewis starts breaking into pieces he'll
say Lewis didn't follow the plan. He's not going to take the blame:
`I'm too good a coach to take the blame.' Lennox is gonna jump on
me, and I'm gonna battle, and as the battle goes on, Lennox will
think, `I cannot go past this.' And then he's going to get hit as
hard as he's ever been hit in his whole entire life.

HIGH COURT URGED TO HIRE MORE MINORITY LAW CLERKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Supreme Court justices Wednesday acknowledged
the high court's poor record of hiring minorities to be law clerks.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Clarence Thomas and David H. Souter placed the
blame squarely on law schools and lower court judges for failing to
move qualified applicants up the judicial employment pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of minorities among the justices' law clerks came to
national attention last March when USA Today conducted a study that
found only 1.8 percent of the most recent 394 clerks were black, 1
percent were Hispanic and 4.5 percent were Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, was arrested and held briefly in
October for protesting _ on the steps of the Supreme Court _ the
justices' lack of minority clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before a House panel, Thomas and Souter said that they
and their colleagues would like to hire more minorities to be
clerks, the recently minted lawyers who help the justices decide
cases, but that the pool of applicants is limited. Justices seek
clerks who graduated near the top of their law school classes and
who have clerked for a federal judge, prerequisites not too many
minority lawyers have satisfied, Thomas and Souter told a House
Appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a person at the court who would not want to
change that'' low number of minority clerks, Thomas said. ``They
would love to see more minorities at the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Thomas, Souter said, ``There's no one on this Supreme
Court who does not want these numbers to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter and Thomas appeared before the Subcommittee on Commerce,
Justice, State and Judiciary to urge Cngress to appropriate $58.6
million for the high court in fiscal year 2000, which begins Oct.
1. But they were quickly called upon to defend the court's hiring
practices when Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif, a subcommittee member,
told the justices that they and their colleagues have not looked
hard enough for minority clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Souter responded with a defense of the justices' system of
hiring experienced clerks and said he is confident the high court's
employment record will improve soon as law schools continue to make
a strong effort to push their brightest minority students to seek
judicial clerkships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that shoving (by law schools) is going to take
place, and that it's going to show up in our hiring,'' Souter told
the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary. ``We're
going to see the fruit of some pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dixon said that perhaps an ``ol' boy network'' exists on the
court that discourages the hiring of minorities. Dixon added that
justices have chosen their clerks largely from Ivy League law
schools like Harvard and Yale and not from other highly respected
but less known universities with a greater number of minority
students.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Souter and Thomas conceded that the justices' law
clerks generally do come from top-flight schools. But the justices
said they and their colleagues look to the most respected
universities only because they must have confidence that their
clerks will be ready to perform well from their first day on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerks are not trainees,'' Souter said, noting their
important work in helping craft Supreme Court decisions. ``There is
no break-in period.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said justices ``can't take chances'' that the clerks they
choose will not be up to the intense research, concise writing and
vigorous legal debate that are the hallmarks of assisting a Supreme
Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (justices) all live with the fear that we will have a clerk
that doesn't work out,'' Thomas said. ``There is no start-up
period. They have to be up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dixon was not persuaded by the justices' defense, saying
that minority lawyers ``can hit the ground running'' at the Supreme
Court. Dixon urged the justices to ``look to alternative methods''
for choosing law clerks and not simply rely on elite schools and
lower court judges.

WOODWARD DEFENSE DOCTOR'S FEE IN DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Roiled by conflicting accounts of how much a key expert
was paid by the defense team, the tempest continued Wednesday over
Sunday night's ``60 Minutes'' report, which raised questions about
the cause of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen's death.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another twist in the case, ``60 Minutes'' reporter Mike
Wallace said that Dr. Marvin Nelson told him Wednesday he was paid
a total of $1,000 by the defense team rather than the $300 Nelson
initially acknowledged receiving. Nelson was one of two experts
whom the program relied upon for the theory that the infant had
died from strangulation, rather than from being violently shaken.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward's defense team disputed the new figure of $1,000,
insisting that Nelson was paid only $700. Nelson did not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scores of doctors released a strongly-worded
statement refuting the claims by Dr. Floyd Gilles and Nelson, both
of Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, that the infant had been
strangled up to 48 hours before he died. The letter, sent to CBS
and other media outlets, labeled the theory ``preposterous,'' and
called for both the network and the doctors to apologize to Deborah
and Sunil Eappen, the infant's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The network's reaction was far from contrite, however. Wallace
called the letter ``old hash.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued controversy exposed nerves never far from the
surface since Woodward's frantic 911 call two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997 a jury found Woodward guilty of second-degree
murder, agreeing with prosecutors' claims that she killed Matthew
Eappen by violently shaking him, and slamming his head against a
hard object. Woodward was set free after Judge Hiller B. Zobel
overrode the jury's decision, reducing her conviction to
manslaughter and sentencing her to the 279 days she had already
served.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' report raised questions even about that
conviction, suggesting that the baby could have died from a
strangulation that took place up to 48 hours before he died, but
which did not have any visible effect until the baby began seizing
under Woodward's care.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Nelson, one of the proponents of the
strangulation theory, had been paid more than originally thought
for his 1997 services to the defense team had Wallace rethinking
the presentation of the doctor on Sunday night's segment.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he now wishes he had mentioned the defense team's
payment to Nelson during the ``60 Minutes'' broadcast, though he
reiterated his belief that the payment did not influence the
doctor's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I known about it, I would have said something about a paid
consultant,'' said Wallace. ``However, I would have appended to
that the fact that both (Dr. Floyd) Gilles and Nelson disagreed
with the defense team's theory of the reasons for the death.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he learned of the higher sum when he called Nelson
Wednesday. According to Wallace, the doctor told him he was paid
$700 for a two-hour telephone consultation with defense attorney
Barry Scheck three weeks before Woodward's murder trial began in
September 1997. The payment also covered Nelson's examination of CT
scans and other medical records at the request of the defense.
(Though the defense team contacted him as a prospective expert
witness, Nelson did not testify in the trial.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wallace said, Nelson told him he was paid an
additional $300 from Elaine Whitfield-Sharp, then a member of the
defense team, after Sharp visited him at Children's Hospital in Los
Angeles to discuss the case in February 1998. But Sharp denied
making that additional payment of $300. Defense attorneys Harvey
Silverglate and Andrew Good said they did not make an additional
payment, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no knowledge of that (second) meeting, we have no
knowledge of a $300 payment,'' said Woodward defense lawyer Andrew
Good. ``Barry (Scheck) didn't pay anybody either. I don't think the
$300 happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``60 Minutes'' report prompted a censorious
letter Wednesday to CBS and other media outlets signed by 77 child
abuse, neuropathology, and forensic specialists from Massachusetts
to California condemning the strangulation claims. Many of the
doctors named in the letter had also signed a 1997 letter attacking
the defense's theory that Eappen had died of old injuries sustained
while he was not in Woodward's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory that (Matthew Eappen) sustained an injury that
would lead to his death and then appear normal for two days is
preposterous (and) not supported by the medical literature,'' the
letter said. The strangulation theory did not account for the
infant's severe head injuries, either, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people have very strong feelings about this case
because the family has suffered so much,'' said Dr. Carol Jenny,
professor of pediatrics at Brown University Medical School. ``We
felt it was only fair that we counter what we believe to be
misinformation in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter concluded by calling on CBS, and the doctors, to
apologize to the Eappens. ``Once again the Eappen family has been
revictimized by the media and by Louise Woodward,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Gilles refused comment on the letter Wednesday.
``Their view is that everybody is entitled to their opinions,''
said Children's Hospital spokesperson Steve Rutledge. ``As long as
it's an informed opinion based on examining the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace suggested the physicians had not seen enough of the
medical evidence to arrive at their conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not unexpected,'' he said. ``What are they going to
say, `We were wrong, we were wrong'? If someone will assemble a
dozen senior pediatric neuropathologists, get them to sit down with
the medical evidence and let them write a letter, then we'll begin
to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the new theory will be tested in a
courtoom. ``We want to investigate this as any responsible, ethical
lawyer would, with a view to seeing what the investigation shows,''
said Good. ``Then you decide what to do. What we want to do is get
to the facts. This may lead to the truth. At this point, going back
to court is hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-producer Katie Leishman, who originated the story for ``60
Minutes,'' sharply denied a Boston Herald report in which Dr.
Umberto De Girolami, a prosecution witness, asserted that she had
called him the day before the ``60 Minutes'' segment and asked for
a written endorsement of the strangulation theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' she said. ``I never asked Dr. De Girolami to
endorse anything.'' What she was seeking on Saturday, Leishman
said, was permission to use a De Girolami quote on a different
scientific matter.

MOUNTAINEER RAPPELS INTO CLIMBERS' PSYCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mountain climbers are a stoic lot. Reading their memoirs, it's
hard to escape the sense they're leaving too much out. What sort of
conflicts arise on Himalayan treks, and why risk life and limb for
airy visions of glory above the clouds?
</P>
<P>
   This makes Jim Wickwire's achievement all the more remarkable. A
world-class climber, Wickwire, with writer Dorothy Bullitt of
Seattle, has told the full epic story in ``Addicted to Danger: A
Memoir About Affirming Life in the Face of Death'' (Pocket Books;
$24). Included are not just the heroic parts but also passages that
reveal less-than-noble motives and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle attorney has seen more than his share of death. On a
climb via a risky, untried route on Mount McKinley, Wickwire's
climbing partner falls headfirst into a crevasse, along with their
sled with supplies. Wickwire hurts his shoulder in the accident and
is unable to rescue his buddy, who becomes delirious and sings
childhood hymns before dying. Wickwire then has to worry about his
own survival; with little food and water, he endures nearly two
weeks in the arctic wilderness alone before he's sighted by a
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Other friends die off one by one. A woman along on a training
climb on McKinley makes a mistake tying a rope around herself and
falls down a cliff. Other climbing partners die in avalanches and
hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Wickwire admits his obsession is much like an addiction and sees
in it a kind of arrested adolescence, and reflects on the effect on
his marriage _ which somehow survives _ and family. After his
epiphany on McKinley, he sees climbing as an affirmation of life,
not a death wish. Later he would start to scale down his climbs to
family treks rather than several-month affairs that consume spirit
as well as energy.
</P>
<P>
   More revelations follow in the 322 pages. Expeditions ``can
forge friendships, strengthen character and foster heroism,''
Wickwire notes. ``They can as easily sour relationships, expose
human weakness and humble the arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying photos are terrific, though it's a pity only
the cover shot is in color. Not so ironically, that photo _ of
Wickwire on Oregon's Mount Hood _ was shot by one of the author's
climbing partners who later died. Our rating:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __In every grab bag, there's usually a few goodies and some
items you wouldn't touch unless you were starving. It's an
appropriate analogy for ``The Outdoor Getaway Guide'' (Foghorn
Press; $14.95) by Santa Monica's Steve Hymon and Julie Sheer.
</P>
<P>
   This is really 340 pages of lists _ a few fascinating but many
more doomed by poor choices with data about as helpful as a down
jacket in Death Valley during the height of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Provided are some entertaining tidbits, such as a top-10
scenic-hike list, great-eight geology treks and best places to
watch the sunset. And any outdoor guidebook that goes to the
trouble of listing Newcomb's Ranch restaurant on Angeles Crest
Highway deserves some praise.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors are trying too hard. In amassing information
listed by activity and by area, they have neglected such matters as
maps (poor) and directions (skimpy; don't depend on them without a
good look at a real map). Our rating: {
</P>
<P>
   __ At first glance, ``Climbing California's Fourteeners'' (The
Mountaineers; $19.95) by Montana's Stephen F. Porcella and Cameron
M. Burns of Colorado seems like yet another of the triathloner-type
mountaineering books. But a closer look reveals the authors have
crammed more than just routes while stressing hazardous options.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they examine 183 routes _ which are smartly drawn on
photos to make them easy to follow _ they tell the climbing history
of each peak, profiling pathfinders such as Norman Clyde, John Muir
and Clarence King.
</P>
<P>
   Muir, for example, was caught in a storm while climbing Mount
Shasta in 1875. He wrote: ``The wind, rising to the highest pitch
of violence, boomed and surged amid the desolate crags; lightning
flashes in quick succession cut the gloomy darkness; and the
thunders, the most tremendously loud and appalling I ever heard,
made an almost continuous roar, stroke following stroke in quick,
passionate succession, as though the mountain were being rent to
its foundations and the fires of the old volcano were breaking
forth again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 272 pages are not aimed at the novice. Details on the
routes, complete with maps and mileage logs, are as exhaustive as
the climbs sound. Our rating: (zap){

DAIMLERCHRYSLER ABANDONS TALKS ABOUT BUYING CONTROL OF NISSAN
MOTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Japan, England, Switzerland)  (See also NISSAN-ASSESS) 
(DW) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ DaimlerChrysler AG abruptly broke off negotiations
Wednesday to acquire a controlling stake in Nissan Motor, Japan's
huge and deeply troubled auto manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which came after face-to-face negotiations in
Tokyo between the chairmen of the companies, is a big setback for
Nissan's increasingly desperate search for a partner that could
help it dig out from more than $20 billion in debt and six years of
losses.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether DaimlerChrysler's withdrawal signals a
victory for Renault SA, the French automobile manufacturer that is
the only other company still openly interested in buying a
significant stake in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, most industry executives had considered Renault
the underdog as Nissan carried on parallel negotiations with
Renault and Daimler.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the suddenness and apparent finality of DaimlerChrysler's
decision highlighted the serious risks for any potential partner.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, has said he wanted
to increase Daimler's revenue from Asia, which is minimal now, to
about 25 percent of its total sales. Yet Wednesday he made it clear
that Nissan was too risky a bet and that he was not simply holding
out for concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to accept that the opportunities that a close
relationship with Nissan offer are not achievable as quickly and
smoothly as initially expected,'' he said in a brief statement.
After what he called ``intensive negotiations'' with Nissan's
president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, Schrempp said the companies had
``finally decided not to pursue a participation.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said Nissan did not object to giving
up what would have been a controlling stake. Daimler executives
were worried about Nissan's suffocating debt load and what they
judged to be the absence of any real revamping plan. Hanging over
everything else was Japan's recession, which has crippled Nissan's
home market.
</P>
<P>
   For Nissan and for Japan, the stakes are huge. Nissan employs
more than 200,000 people and is one of Japan's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler apparently was close to making a formal offer
when Schrempp flew to Tokyo on Tuesday for talks. Nissan's debt
problems were a big topic. Nissan had, however, prepared a broad
plan to rework its debt in a way that would have reduced Daimler's
exposure, and one person close to the talks said that the debt
problem had not been insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives said that Daimler retained doubts about
Nissan's strategy for a revamping. Because Daimler is still in the
early stages of integrating its operations with those of Chrysler,
which it acquired a few months ago, company executives said they
became worried about the need to divert top managers away from
Chrysler and toward Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have emphasized that the integration of Daimler and
Chrysler has utmost priority in our current business activities,''
Schrempp said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Klein, a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, said his company
did not want to jump into additional acquisitions simply because
the opportunity had arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just in the megamerger business,'' Klein said.
``Size is one thing, but the other thing is to have profitable
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted calmly to the announcement, and
DaimlerChrysler stock moved little in early trading Wednesday.
Analysts generally were relieved that Schrempp had decided not to
go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nissan has heavy debts,'' said Klaus-Juergen Melzner,
automobile analyst at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ``In addition,
there are risks that you do not find on the balance sheet _ heavy
debts in the retailing system, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lawson, automobile analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
London, said Daimler's retreat was welcome. ``It's positive that
the company has not simply plowed straight ahead here with an
acquisition that might have been premature,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's abrupt announcement was a particularly
embarrassing setback for Nissan because it came the same day that
Nissan tried to remove one of the sticking points to a deal. Nissan
and its affiliate, Nissan Diesel, announced that they would
together pay 40 billion yen (about $330 million), to retire most of
the debts of their joint venture in truck marketing, Nissan Diesel
Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion over who was responsible for the debts of Nissan
Diesel Sales had been a point of contention between Nissan and
DaimlerChrysler. Scott Sprinzen, the managing director of auto
ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said that
the friction over Nissan Diesel Sales showed why DaimlerChrysler
was wary of investing in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly see why a company like DaimlerChrysler would be
very cautious in the way they would go about a potential
combination with a company like Nissan, given its various
obligations to affiliates, direct and indirect, visible and not so
visible,'' Sprinzen said.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Daimler's announcement surprised most of the
automobile executives attending the annual car show. Rumors have
been flying for weeks that Nissan was close to a deal with Daimler,
and the Japanese press has reported on at least one occasion that
they two had reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At Renault, executives greeted Wednesday's news with caution.
Louis Schweizer, Renault's chief executive, said he continued to be
in discussions with Nissan but emphasized that Renault had not yet
made a formal offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear view of the potential synergies, and we have a
clear view of the difficulties,'' Schweizer said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rush of recent automobile mergers and rampant
flirtation between many other companies, no other manufacturer is
expressing interest in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co., which still has a big cash reserve despite its
recent agreement to acquire the auto business of Volvo AB for $6.5
billion, already controls Mazda in Japan. Volkswagen AG of Germany,
which recently bought Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and is on the prowl
for other deals, is more interested in luxury brands like BMW AG of
Bavaria. The other big Japanese companies, Toyota Motor and Honda
Motor, do not want to be dragged down by Nissan's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives say Renault may have stronger
incentives than Daimler for teaming with Nissan. In contrast to
Schrempp, Schweizer has not been pushing for full management
control.
</P>
<P>
   Renault, which produces about two million cars a year, badly
needs to expand its geographic range and product offerings. After
losing about 5.5 billion francs, or about $1 billion in 1996,
Renault bounced back with vehicles like its Scenic minivan and
earned 8.8 billion francs last year.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts say Renault needs to be bigger to match the
economies of scale enjoyed by companies like DaimlerChrysler or
even Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Renault also remains overwhelmingly dependent on the European
market, particularly France, and is largely confined to midprice
and low-price vehicles, where price competition has been fierce.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance with Nissan, Japan's second-largest car company
after Toyota, could catapult Renault into both the Asian and U. S.
markets. Nissan also has a strong business in light trucks and
sport utility vehicles, areas where Renault is weak.

 &HT;    Lottery operator Powerhouse sold
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Powerhouse Technologies, the nation's second-largest lottery
operator, has reached a $280 million deal to be acquired by Anchor
Gaming of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Powerhouse, which is based near Perimeter Mall, makes software
and other equipment for online lotteries, video lotteries and
parimutuel systems in the U.S., Canada, Australia, South America,
Europe and the Caribbean. It owns and operates Sunland Racetrack
and Casino in New Mexico and also has manufacturing operations in
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us great access to capital,'' Powerhouse Chief
Financial Officer Susan Carstensen said. ``Combined, the company is
in a great position to compete in the gaming industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors liked the deal. Powerhouse shares rose $3.06 1/4 to
$17.87 1/2. Shares of Anchor Gaming closed at $38.37 1/2, up $3.81
1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Gaming said it will pay cash totaling $220 million, or
$19.50 a share. The offer is a 32 percent premium to Powerhouse's
closing price Monday. Anchor also will assume about $60 million of
Powerhouse debt.
</P>
<P>
   Todd D. Jordan, an analyst with Raymond James in New York, said
the deal was significant because it gives Anchor an entry into the
online lottery business and ``stable revenue streams from
businesses within the gaming industry.'' Powerhouse is No. 2 behind
Gtech Holdings Inc., the world's largest lottery operator.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor is a major player in the gaming equipment and service
businesses, which is a $1.5 billion to $2 billion industry. The
company operates and develops gaming machines and casinos.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended June 30, Anchor earned $68.4 million, or
$5.20 a share, on revenues of $231.9 million. For the year ended
Dec. 31, Powerhouse earned $4.6 million, or 42 cents a diluted
share, on revenues of $201.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical point to make is that Powerhouse has great
technology and has done well in terms of being efficient,'' Jordan
said. ``The issue is that they didn't have the capital to really be
aggressive in bidding on contracts. The larger states were out of
their reach.''
</P>
<P>
   With this deal, however, that changes.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Chief Executive Officer Michael Rumbolz said the new
company plans to bid on 10 state lottery contracts within the next
two years. The company will change its name to Anchor Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Powerhouse has about 1,600 employee, 20 of whom are
based in Atlanta. Anchor has about 1,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Powerhouse Chairman Richard Burt and Chief Executive Richard
Haddrill will join Anchor's board.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in July.

S.J. MICCICHE, GLOBE VETERAN, FILLED MANY NEWSROOM ROLES; AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Salvatore J. Micciche, a ``classic Boston
newspaperman'' who was a longtime reporter and later in-house
newsroom counsel at The Boston Globe, died Wednesday in his home in
Naples, Fla. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Micciche combined a keen sense of news, gleaned from years
as a local reporter on general assignment and in government halls
on Beacon Hill and Washington, with his law degree to give the
Globe an invaluable resource in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His office was in the newsroom, which made it easy for reporters
and editors, all of whom called him ``Sal,'' to drop by and consult
on breaking stories that needed a legal eye cast over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sal was a most gifted journalist who earned a law degree on
the side,'' said retired Globe editor Thomas Winship. ``His only
trouble was that he couldn't leave the newsroom, where he practiced
both skills in a most valuable way. He had about the best political
antennae in Boston. And Loyalty was his middle name.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Micciche was born in Everett. He graduated from Everett High
School in 1945 and Boston University in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He began his newspaper career at age 12 as a copy boy at the
Everett News Gazette. He later became that paper's city hall
reporter before joining the writing staff of Stars and Stripes
while serving in the Army during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the service, he reported for the Portsmouth (N.H.)
Herald, then came to the Globe in 1955. From 1956 to 1969 he
covered the Legislature. While at the State House he decided there
was more to learn about the legislative process. He studied nights
at Suffolk Law School, graduated in 1968 and passed the bar the
same year. He was 40.
</P>
<P>
   After a year writing on politics for the editorial pages, Mr.
Micciche was assigned to the Globe's Washington bureau, where he
covered Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House during the
dramatic days of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sal had a wonderful career as a reporter and editor,''
Benjamin B. Taylor, publisher of the Globe, said Wednesday, ``but
first and foremost he was a terrific reporter. His coverage of the
Supreme Court and the constitutional issues during Watergate was as
good as anyone's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Micciche returned to Boston in 1975, serving in a number of
key newsroom positions where his journalistic, administrative, and
legal enterprise made a difference because he was always there, at
the ready with advice and counsel. He retired a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a profile published in the March 1986 issue of Presstime, the
journal of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, wherein
he was dubbed a ``classic Boston newspaperman,'' Mr. Micciche said
he witnessed many changes during his career, the most important
being a change in attitudes about ethics. When he began, he said,
``ethics was simply a word to be applied to others. The story was
the thing and there wasn't too much concern over how you got it. I
think that's pretty much changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, William O. Taylor, retired publisher of the Globe,
eulogized him as ``one of the legendary figures who worked for the
Globe for many years, from Washington Street to Morrissey
Boulevard. His skill as an editor, his warm personality, and
wonderful sense of humor made him a role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Micciche leaves his wife, Theresa (Miraglia); a son,
Charles; two daughters, Marcia and Marlene; and two grandchildren.

CLINTON ACKNOWLEDGES PAST US ROLE IN GUATEMALA   CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ Acknowledging the US role in Guatemala's civil
war and in repression by military-backed governments, President
Clinton pledged Wednesday that Washington would never again engage
in such behavior toward this Central American nation.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks, which contrasted with routine denials during the
Reagan administration, came before community activists in his last
stop on a four-nation tour of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In ad-libbed opening comments, the president said US support of
right-wing governments in that Guatemala's 30-year civil war was
``wrong.'' In a report released last month, a UN-sponsored truth
commission blamed most of the 200,000 deaths and disappearances in
that conflict on the US-backed army and on the CIA, deeply involved
in Guatemala since fomenting an overthrow of the constitutional
government in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the United States, it is important that I state clearly
that support for miliitary forces or intelligence units which
engaged in violent and widespread repression of the kind described
in the report was wrong, and the United States must not repeat that
mistake,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must and we will, instead, continue to support the peace
and reconciliation process in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict ended when peace accords were signed in 1996 _ and
Clinton lauded the country for the progress it has made since the
end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   His comments concluded a day in which he promised to help the
region's fledgling democracies, fight for enhanced trade benefits
and restore fairness to immigration US laws for Central Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When asked later whether the president's statement was
tantamount to an apology, National Secirity Adviser Sandy Berger
said, ``I think the words speak for themselves. The president was
saying that some of America's activities during the war and that
period were wrong. . . . The words were pretty clear.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials traveling with Clinton said Washington provided
4,000 pages of information, some of it previously classified, to
the UN truth commission, and spent more than $1 million to help pay
for the group's work. Documents released Wednesday detail ties
between the CIA in equipping and training the Guatemalan security
forces that murdered thousands of civilians in the nation's bloody
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights officials say Clinton has the same responsibility
to unearth and acknowledge deep Cold War secrets as did the Soviet
Union when it disclosed its past. They gave some credit to Clinton
but said such disclosures of US ties to death squads were long
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reagan administration consistently denied that the
Guatemalan and El Salvadoran armies were behind the death squads,''
said Josh Rubenstein, northeast regional director, Amnesty
International USA. ``Everyone understands today that such a claim
was a deliberate lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the United States provided financial and documentary
support (to the UN commission), but I have no doubt that
considerably more documents in US archives substantiate the degree
of American complicity,'' Rubenstein said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged that Central Americans consider Washington ``a
partner, a friend.'' But in a reminder of the bitter past, 200-300
demonstrators stood outside Guatemala's presidential palace to
denounce US involvement in civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was mostly peaceful but a small group of students
was arrested when they set two American flags on fire. They were
removed before the president arrived in Guatemala from El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to former rightist and leftist combatants in El
Salvador _ now sitting together in the nation's 84-member
legislative assembly _ Clinton sounded the same theme of promise
following conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a region where battlefield ideology has been
transformed into a marketplace of ideas,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted El Salvador's own evolution from 12 years of
bloody civil war by aknowledging the country's own presidential
elections -- the third since the war ended in 1992 -- which were
held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been unthinkable that a United States president
would come to El Salvador after an election given the conflict that
we were involved in,'' said Francisco Flores, the president-elect
who met briefly with Clinton Wednesday and attended the speech.
``Democracy is here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated requests this week from Salvadoran officials
for special migratory status for their citizens in the United
States, Clinton defended US immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration, he said, ``punishes hard-working people who
play by the rules and who wait their turn to come to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   But because past political conflicts had influenced US policy
since the Cold War, Clinton pledged to work to develop more
balanced rules for all Central Americans. Aides said some changes
can be made without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our treatment of people from Central America should reflect
what they suffered rather than who caused the suffering,'' he
added. ``This is wrong and we should change it.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to requests for more free trade with the United
States, the president also said he would push for enhanced trade
benefits with the region to remove tariffs on textiles and apparel
products that are produced in El Salvador and sold in the United
States. US officials also signed a bilateral agreement Wednesday to
promote American exports in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Sorto, an economist with the Foundation for Salvadoran
Economic and Social Development, said both measures were important
for helping the country's economy, which has been hurt by
decreasing international aid and the destruction brought on by
natural disasters such as last fall's Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our exports are in clothing and textiles and sold in
the United States,'' Sorto said. ``This could only lead to a
stronger Salvadoran economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction of Clinton, Juan Duch Martinez, president of
the assembly, said that despite recent economic and political gains
seen in El Salvador, the country remained in the ``midst of
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also asked the president to impress upon congress that
Salvadorans are leaving the country to escape economic hardship and
the widespread destruction left by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take your presence here as a gesture from a friend,''
Martinez said to Clinton during the ceremony at the assembly's main
chamber, or Blue Room. ``We trust in your work.''

 &HT;    Winthrop revived by its Marshall plan
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The sweet ride began last April 2 in Rock Hill,
S.C. Just before his introductory news conference as the new head
basketball coach at Winthrop University, Gregg Marshall addressed
his new players thusly: ``Those of you who don't believe we can get
to the NCAA Tournament next spring, don't follow me into this press
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' point guard Tyson Waterman recalled, ``I thought
he was bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't this Winthrop? Hadn't the Eagles just ended 7-20, their
eighth losing season in a row? In the last 14 years, they never
even finished in the top half of the Big South Conference. Now this
35-year-old, a rookie head coach, was talking about the NCAAs?
</P>
<P>
   ``My first three years here, every loss hurt,'' said Heson
Groves, the senior forward from Powder Springs and Marietta High
who was in constant pain during a 26-54 migraine. ``I was ready to
try anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months after Marshall's ultimatum, this school, once a
women's college, is going bananas. While the sweet ride surely ends
here today, Winthrop is still the sweetest 16th seed in the NCAA
Tournament. The Eagles, 21-7 and the Big South regular-season and
tournament champs, play top-seeded Auburn in the first round of the
NCAA South Region. In Winthrop's first NCAA Tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't hit me,'' Waterman said. ``We haven't had time
to sit down and say, `Wow! We won the Big South, which has never
been done in Winthrop's history.' Hopefully,we can do something now
that's never been done on the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the NCAA field expanded to 64 teams in 1985, a 16th seed
never has beaten a No. 1. That 0-56 futility doesn't faze Marshall.
``We were picked dead last (in a preseason Big South poll),'' he
said. ``We finished first. We're here. This is reality, and we're
going to go out and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every team that is here has earned the right to be
here. They deserve that respect,'' said Cliff Ellis, who coached
Auburn to its first NCAA since 1988. Despite losing to Kentucky in
the SEC semifinals, the Tigers (27-3) are still a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what'll happen,'' Ellis said. ``I know Winthrop's
going to come out and play , and I'd hope our team will come out
and play with a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years as an aide to John Kresse at the College of
Charleston and two more at Marshall, Marshall got the Winthrop job
and set about assembling a team. He found 6-foot-6 center Eric
Fisher, a high school teammate of Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota
Timberwolves, in a pickup game on campus. Jeff Meyer, now
Marshall's assistant, first saw 6-foot-9 Eyo ``Bubbles'' Effiong
play in his native Nigeria in 1995; Meyer finally reconnected with
Bubbles last year via e-mail while Effiong was living with an uncle
in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman had played two years at Winthrop before he was
suspended in 1997 over academics and transferred to Winston-Salem
State. But Waterman pleaded with Marshall to take him back; he was
tutored by the coach's wife all summer to regain his eligibility
and, like Groves, made first-team All-Big South.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance jumped from last year's average of 793 to more than
1,300.
</P>
<P>
   Groves, Winthrop's top scorer (12.3) and rebounder (7.6), had 19
rebounds and Waterman had 25 points in an 86-74 win vs. Radford in
the Big South title game on Feb. 27, Marshall's 36th birthday. So
what if oddsmaker Danny Sheridan has made Winthrop 1 trillion-to-1
to win the NCAAs? So what if Auburn beat Winthrop 80-55 three
seasons ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to roll over, and I don't think my players
did,'' Marshall said. ``We came here to play as hard as possible.
If they didn't think this game was necessary, they'd give the No. 1
seeds a bye.

   WASHINGTON _ The battle over the nation's scarcest medical
resource, human organs, has moved from Washington to the states,
where a number of legislatures have begun passing laws that would
bar donated hearts, lungs, kidneys, livers and pancreases from
being shipped beyond their borders to sick people elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the laws have not had a large effect on the way organs
are distributed. Rather, they are intended to thwart an effort by
the Clinton administration to force organ recovery networks and
transplant centers around the nation to share their precious organs
more liberally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed the rule, so I introduced legislation,'' Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin explained in a telephone interview
Tuesday. ``In this state, we go out and aggressively encourage
people to be donors, with me doing public service announcements. If
I'm going to do that, I want those organs to stay in the state and
take care of the patients that need it in Wisconsin.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and
Florida _ have adopted laws similar to Wisconsin's. In Arizona,
lawmakers in both houses have approved similar bills, but the bills
contain differences that must be ironed out. Legislation was also
introduced in Texas last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 61,000 Americans are now waiting for organ
transplants, but only 20,000 or so transplants are performed each
year, and there are huge disparities in waiting times across the
country. Last spring, Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and
Human Services, announced her intention to even out those waiting
times by giving organs to those who need them most, regardless of
where they live. But the plan, issued in the form of a federal
regulation, engendered such a bitter fight between transplant
doctors, hospitals and patients that Congress delayed its effective
date until Oct. 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate will come to the fore in Washington on Thursday, when
the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences, starts its own examination of the organ allocation
system. The review is being conducted at the request of Congress;
the institute has appointed a panel of 16 experts, including
surgeons, ethicists, epidemiologists and a health care economist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an objective reviewer,'' said Louise Jacobbi,
executive director of the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency in
Metairie, La. In 1997, Ms. Jacobbi, aware that the federal
government was about to change its rules, was instrumental in
persuading her state to become the first to adopt a law putting its
own residents first. That law has since become a model for the
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, we have been rationing organs since the
beginning of transplantation,'' she said. ``We have always had
fewer organs than we have had patients. If we are going to change
the way we practice medicine, it needs to be based on good medical
data.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which hopes to finish its study by September,
will present its findings to Congress, which may decide to step in
and overhaul the allocation system on its own. But if Congress does
not act, the entire issue could wind up in court, with Wisconsin
and the other states suing the federal government in a state's
rights dispute over which provision _ the Clinton administration's
rule or state law _ takes precedence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Earl Fox, administrator of the Health Resources and
Services administration, which oversees the organ allocation
system, said in an interview that the new regulation supersedes
state law. But in a suit filed in Louisiana last spring, the
Louisiana Attorney General contended the opposite, saying that only
an Act of Congress, and not a bureaucratic regulation, could
override a state law.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That suit is being held in abeyance while the Federal rule is on
hold. But should the Clinton administration's plan go into effect,
Governor Thompson of Wisconsin warned, his state would probably
bring suit as well. ``This rule is unconstitutional,'' the governor
said. ``It pre-empts states' rights.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The current organ donation system is 15 years old; it flows out
of a 1984 law called the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Act,
which gives the Department of Health and Human Services authority
to regulate the national organ distribution system. The law
prohibited the buying and selling of organs and declared them a
national resource. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the system works this way: A private, nonprofit
organization, the United Network for Organ Sharing, contracts with
the health and human services agency to distribute donated organs.
UNOS, as the network is known, has divided the country into 11
regions. Within those regions, there are 63 local organ procurement
organizations, whose job it is to obtain and distribute organs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, organs are offered first within the
local area, then regionwide, then nationally. But the system is
incredibly Balkanized; Dallas and Fort Worth, for instance, share
an airport and are only 30 miles apart, yet they belong to
different organ procurement organizations and do not share organs.
If there are extra livers or kidneys in Fort Worth, they are
offered to patients in Houston, four hours away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said Dr. Goran B. Klintmalm, chief of
transplant surgery at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.
His solution: Baylor is about to set up a satellite transplant
center in Fort Worth, so that its Dallas patients will be eligible
for organs that otherwise would have gone to Houston. ``We don't
want to duplicate services,'' he said, ``but it's the only way we
can make organs stay in the metroplex.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With hospitals raiding other hospitals' organ pools, the Clinton
administration's rule ordered the organ-sharing network to come up
with a new system that would distribute organs more broadly. The
administration said that if network officials did not change the
system on their own, the Department of Health of Human Services
would change it for them. But the network, which is composed mostly
of representatives from the smaller transplant centers, balked at
the rule, saying its members preferred the current system.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the rule was announced, doctors at some of these
centers, along with officials of the local organ procurement
organizations, began pressing their state legislators to pass laws
that would keep organs within state boundaries. Most of the laws
include provisions stating that states can share organs, so long as
they have reciprocal arrangements with other states. Even so, they
have been criticized as provincial and jingoistic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma has been castigated,'' said Robert Turner, executive
director of the Oklahoma Organ Sharing Network. ``We have been
called narrow-minded, self-centered, not caring for others.
Actually, our law is pretty moderate. It says that we can't bypass
local patients unless we get a payback for the organ.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Hanto, a transplant surgeon at the University of
Cincinnati Medical Center, warned: ``If this rule goes through, you
will see more and more states passing laws. And it will be a huge
controversy. I don't think that Donna Shalala or Bill Clinton
really understands the degree of opposition to this rule.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, however, say the state laws are misguided.
``We know that, on average, about a third of all organ recipients
go outside their state of residence to get a transplant,'' Dr. Fox
said. ``We have a lot of sharing that is going on across state
lines. States, in my opinion, could be shooting themselves in the
foot by passing language that restricts that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the dispute is an economic turf war between
transplant centers, which are competing for their share of the
lucrative transplant business, in which an operation can cost
$250,000 or more. On one side are large hospitals, which tend to
have long waiting lists and would benefit from the new rule by
receiving additional organs. On the other side are small centers,
which fear Shalala's plan could put them out of business by
stripping them of their supply of organs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said Dr. John J. Fung, who directs the
transplant program at the University of Pittsburgh, one of the
largest in the nation, and is a staunch advocate of increased
sharing. ``Everybody is hunkering down and protecting their own
turf. It's only going to get nastier, and the sooner we get it
resolved the sooner the healing process will begin. All we are
doing now is making the wounds bigger and bigger.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Off base: Turner may face fine, sensitivity class
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is reviewing punitive
measures against Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner for insensitive
comments he made in a speech last month.
</P>
<P>
   While the punishment is not expected to include Turner's
suspension from baseball, he could face a fine and sensitivity
training.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said only that he has talked to Turner and is taking the
matter seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are Turner's remarks Feb. 16 to a National Family
Planning and Reproductive Association gathering. Turner urged that
Pope John Paul II ``get with it _ welcome to the 20th century'' and
suggested that adultery should be stricken from the Ten
Commandments. He also referred to his foot as a ``Polish mine
detector.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who also is vice chairman of Time Warner Inc., has
issued apologies to the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights and to the government of Poland. He is out of the country
and had no comment Wednesday, according to publicist Caroline
Harkleroad.
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic League accepted Turner's apology, a group
based in Cincinatti calling itself Christ or Chaos did not. Thomas
Droleskey, president of the organization that he says has about 500
members, staged a rally in Cincinatti and sent letters to the
baseball commissioner and various news media suggesting Turner get
the same one-year suspension used twice against Cincinnati Reds
owner Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Schott's slurs drew a one-year suspension, a $25,000
fine and the condition that she attend sensitivity training. In
1996, Schott admitted to keeping Nazi memorabilia in a drawer at
her home. Baseball's executive council issued another one-year
suspension and pressured her into selling controlling interest in
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Schott was incredulous that Turner escaped sanctions.
``I don't understand how Ted Turner can get away with what he
said,'' Schott said. ``I didn't say anything or do anything worse
than what he said.

TARNISHED GOLD: SALT LAKE CITY'S 30-YEAR DESIRE FOR OLYMPIC GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: a shorter version, about 2,800 words in 3 takes, has moved
as OLY-SALT-LAKE-ABRIDGED.) 
(bl) 
 This story is based on reporting by JO THOMAS, KIRK JOHNSON and
JERE LONGMAN. It was written by KIRK JOHNSON. 
 &HT;    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ David R. Johnson and Thomas K. Welch were
lionized in 1995 when, after three decades of trying, they
delivered to this city the right to stage the 2002 Winter Olympic
Games. But after that came a long, hard fall.
</P>
<P>
   An independent ethics panel investigating how the Salt Lake City
bid committee used cash payments and college scholarships to
influence Olympic officials has identified Johnson and Welch _ two
of the committee's senior officers _ as the central culprits.
Federal prosecutors are exploring criminal charges against them.
Their reputations are in jeopardy. And yet they have remained
surprisingly steadfast in their positions: they don't regret a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the bid committee's former vice president, said that if
he had one misgiving about how Salt Lake City won the Olympics, it
was that its officials were not more public and open about the
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have said, `of course we have scholarships,' '' he
said. ``It was a way of winning the bid, to increase our ways to
communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Welch, the former head of the Salt Lake City effort, said
his lack of regret in looking back matches exactly the lack of
guilt he felt when he was waging the campaign in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole atmosphere was, hey, you're paying homage to these
people,'' Welch said of the lavishments he and others bestowed on
the 114 members of the International Olympic Committee who decide
where to hold the Games. ``We don't like that, but that's the game.
That's the rush, if you want to join the fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City's long effort to join the Olympic fraternity _
sometimes brazen, sometimes comic, and all the while relying on
inside information provided by other Olympic cities _ comes to
detailed life in hundreds of pages of internal bid committee
documents obtained by The New York Times and in interviews with
numerous committee staff workers and volunteers. The documents, as
well as the first extensive interviews with Welch and Johnson, also
strongly suggest that many Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials
beyond the two former committee officers _ and within the Olympic
family in general _ had fully accepted the coarse financial facts
of what had to be done to become an Olympic city.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues regarding what happened here and who knew about it
are still unfolding. There are conflicting accounts by various
participants, witnesses who have yet to be questioned and
assertions of innocence or culpability that will not be resolved
until the various federal and state investigators complete their
work _ if then.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he told Anita DeFrantz, the senior IOC member from
the United States, ``everything,'' about scholarships and cash
payments; she said that is not true at all.
</P>
<P>
   An internal work paper from the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young
asserts that senior bid committee officials, including some leaders
of major Utah corporations, were fully briefed in 1995 about
questionable payments; they say no.
</P>
<P>
   Staff workers and volunteers who toiled in the bid committee's
dingy downtown offices say that everyone knew which IOC children
were on scholarship, who was coming in for their checks and when,
and who among the regular IOC visitors was the greediest or most
gracious; most of their bosses, excepting Welch and Johnson, say
they didn't know a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, about six months before the scandal broke, minutes and
handwritten notes taken during bid committee meetings in 1994 and
1995, including detailed discussions about the status of the
campaign in its final climactic months, were destroyed by the
committee's law firm. Officials with the firm have no explanation,
and characterize the destruction as ``strange.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all, in the end, may have been unnecessary. Salt Lake
City, which had pursued the Olympics for 30 years as part of a
broad economic development plan to build a winter tourism industry,
had actually pulled together a legitimate proposal that Olympic
officials across the globe concede was, on its merits, unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who led one of the
inquiries into Salt Lake City's effort, last week summed up what he
called the tragedy of the episode succinctly:
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials, he said, ``did not need to stoop to
the level of this improper and inappropriate conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW APPROACH: From Unsophisticated to Educated
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, when Salt Lake City was making its first run at the
Winter Games, for 1972, the bid committee commissioned a
translation into French of its promotional materials, including a
geographical description: Utah, the text said, is located in the
``Great Basin of the West.'' The translator hired by the committee
took the language a bit too literally, however, and used the
phrase, ``Grand Basin,'' which in French meant that Utah was in the
``Toilet of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was caught just in time when a professor at the
University of Utah was asked to look over the proofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you how unsophisticated we were,'' said Walker
Wallace, a retired businessman and former ski racer who was on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the city's longshot chances at landing the Games
were further made clear at a stuffy cocktail reception later in
1966, in Rome, when a salesman from Salt Lake City suddenly got it
into his head to approach one of the haughtier Olympic committee
members in the room, a European royalty figure. The salesman walked
up, put his arm around the IOC official and started talking up the
virtues of Wasatch Mountain powder snow.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace still recalls the rebuke that ended their conversation:
``Remove your arm from my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake's 1966 effort was more than unpolished; it was cheap.
The organizers scraped together $24,000 by selling Olympic pins for
$1 each, raised $5,000 more in donations, and created an
organization called Olympics for Utah Inc. that was designed to
appeal to French-tinged IOC with its acronym, OUI. The committee
even had $10,305 left over at the end, according to the two-page
audit that Wallace saved in his files.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, Salt Lake City became much more
serious about its Olympic ambitions. Once an isolated outpost in
the scenic West, the city was beginning to feel the need to make a
name for itself, local historians and civic experts say, and to
shed a bit of its insular history as the central city in the Mormon
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a powerful momentum from within the state
driving the Olympic efforts: economic development. The organizers
of the first bid in 1966 did more than simply start the Olympic
machine, economists and public policy experts say. They forged a
kind of symbiotic relationship that fed on itself. Going after the
Olympics created publicity for Utah tourism, and the growth of
tourism over the years in turn reinforced the rationale for going
after the Olympics and further enhanced the city's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Former Salt Lake City Mayor Palmer DePaulis said that people who
question the value of the Olympics now have forgotten how tough
things were _ the mining industry was sinking, while agriculture
and ranching were also struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics was looked at as something that would jump-start
the economy and help bring jobs and investment,'' DePaulis said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the three decades of trying, though, Salt Lake City
never quite shook the sense that it had some inadequacy or
provincialism to overcome, residents and former bid committee
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Welch recalled that as late as 1989, for example, Salt Lake City
bid officials showed up empty-handed at an IOC meeting in Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we arrived there, the Greeks were entertaining on their
yacht, with gorgeous hostesses,'' he said. ``Atlanta had rented a
mansion, shipped in furniture from Atlanta and called it the
Atlanta House. Toronto had set up a whole wing out by the pool and
were serving breakfasts, lunches and dinners to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was giving wonderful gifts _ I think there were
crystal vases and jewelry,'' Welch said. ``Bid cities each had
limousines. We showed up with nothing _ on a bus. We called home
and they went and got some letter openers for us and brought them
to us so we'd have something.''
</P>
<P>
   That insecurity was deepened by uncertainty over just how the
competitions were being conducted. In 1991, with a solid bid
package in place for the 1998 Games, Salt Lake City officials
received a letter from Patrick Hickey, the president of Ireland's
Olympic committee, who let drop that some IOC members had
contracted to sell their votes for a flat fee of $100,000 to the
city of Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of the vote for the 1998 Games, Welch said, he
was approached by Jean-Jacques Ganga, the son of the IOC member
from the Republic of Congo, who said he could help secure a handful
of votes for $35,000. Welch and others refused, in part because
they didn't have the money. Nagano won by four votes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1993, despite being the leading candidate for the 2002
Games, Salt Lake City officials were reminded that nothing was a
certainty. According to the minutes of a bid committee meeting, for
example, Ms. DeFrantz, the senior IOC representative in the United
States, cautioned against complacency.
</P>
<P>
   So the Salt Lake City rules evolved: Do no harm, take no chances
and say yes to just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we had was about getting the bid,'' Johnson said.
``All our money was to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGY: `We Had to Get the African Vote'
</P>
<P>
   Given how aggressively, and even excessively, Salt Lake City
came to pursue the 2002 Games, it is almost quaint to examine their
earlier records.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1991, for example, during the campaign for the 1998
Winter Games _ later won by Nagano _ Prince Albert of Monaco, a
bobsled racer and IOC member, arrived in Utah in jeans and flannel
shirt and with a disdain for protocol and limousines, former
staffers said. But committee records show that officials did manage
to buy him at least something. Johnson's reimbursement slip for the
visit records only a single stop, at a 7-11, for ``juice for Prince
Albert.'' Cost: $2.73.
</P>
<P>
   Others, it turned out in the years to come, demanded more. They
were not denied.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, working from 1991 to 1995 to at last secure the
Games, gave and gave _ at least $1.2 million to IOC members and
their families and much beyond that in time and attention and
personal favors.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Mary Alison Glen-Haig, a committee member from England, got
to play cards late into the night at the house of Salt Lake City
Mayor Deedee Corradini. The children of IOC members from Mali and
Cameroon wound up receiving more than $100,000 each in scholarships
and payments.
</P>
<P>
   It could all be quite matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   According to staffers at the committee, Sibo Sibandze, the son
of the IOC member from Swaziland, would with regularity turn up at
the second-floor offices at the corner of 200 East and 200 South,
open the door and ask, ``Where's my check?'' And the checks would
be cut: $250 one week, $590 the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew these guys, they came in weekly,'' said Jason
Christensen, a volunteer staffer. ``You saw them pick up their
checks. You took them places. You didn't have to be a brain surgeon
to know what was going on. It was always whispered, `Whose son is
he? How much of a scholarship is he getting? How does that work?
People freaked out the first time they heard about it. Then it
became second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   It could occasionally feel reckless, too.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1995, according to a list of bid committee
payments, money often was being spent with no support
documentation, including a $30,000 check for cash at First Security
bank for unknown purposes. Gifts to beneficiaries designated as
``various IOC members'' reached more than $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From February 1993 to February 1996, the bid committee paid
installments of $500 that totaled $14,500 to a Raouf Scally, who
was thought to be the relative of an IOC member. To this day, local
Olympic officials have no certain idea who Scally is or what North
African country he came from.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the operation run out of the charmless
downtown offices _ mismatched furniture, empty pizza boxes _ was
targeted and relentless.
</P>
<P>
   The bid's strategy, Johnson said, dictated that African
committee members be pursued, not necessarily because those members
had their hands out, but because they were the swing votes. Salt
Lake City's analysis showed that no city had ever been chosen to
host the Games without African member support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get the African vote,'' he said. ``We had to get
them early, get it done, maintain contact and maintain momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more than just a plan. Bid committee officials
also had detailed personal information on their IOC targets, from
the dossiers prepared by previous bid cities such as Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Of David Sibandze, the IOC member from Swaziland who resigned
under threat of expulsion in February, one dossier said, ``Always
made reference that he has a big mortgage to pay during visits to
1996 candidate cities. Bad reputation. Insincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Other files offered more innocent insights for gaining favor: of
Anton Geesink of the Netherlands, one dossier said, ``Loves to get
the opportunity for group sing-alongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, though, cut to the chase. ``Doesn't speak much English,''
a scouting report said of Sergio Santander Fantani of Chile,
another committee member who since has been expelled. ``But managed
to understand him to say, `Salt Lake must win.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City bid committee officials say they were just as
straightforward about their campaign when talking to people in the
Olympic family. Johnson, for instance, insists he kept Ms.
DeFrantz, the senior American IOC member, updated in detail. He
said she would frequently ask him which way the members were
leaning and what it had taken to gain their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1992 to 1995, every time we had an IOC member visit Salt
Lake, she either flew to Salt Lake or during their visit would talk
to them on the telephone,'' Johnson said, referring to Ms.
DeFrantz. ``She would call me and ask, `Was he good or was he bad?'
She wanted to know if someone had asked us to do something that
would put us in a difficult position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If an IOC member had asked or demanded favors, Johnson said that
Ms. DeFrantz's response was, ``That's not good,' or something like
that. She didn't say, `Don't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's charge is explosive. If Ms. DeFrantz knew of the
misconduct in Salt Lake City and did nothing to report or correct
it, her reputation as one of the most powerful and upright figures
in international sport could be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, Ms. DeFrantz emphatically refuted
Johnson's claims. She stated that Johnson was lying. She said she
did know that one or more children of IOC members were attending
schools in Utah on scholarship, but assumed they had been earned on
their merits and were not being underwritten by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never asked if it was okay, or if they should do
anything, or if it was a way to win the games,'' she said. ``Those
discussions never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   RELATIONSHIPS: Ties That Bind And Pull Apart
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to imagine a world where a scrappy, effusive attorney
from Ogden, Utah, named Tom Welch would live an entire life and
never meet a mercurial politician from the Congo Republic named
Jean-Claude Ganga. But given the logic and machinery of the Olympic
site selection process that existed in the 1990s, it may be hard to
imagine anything else.
</P>
<P>
   For the Salt Lake City bid committee, Welch was the preeminent
giver of gifts and cash, Ganga the preeminent taker. Of the $15
million that the bid committee spent in winning the 2002 Winter
Games, Ganga got more than anyone _ at least $250,000, according to
the board of ethics report in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch and Ganga _ and the relationship that bound them _
were also far more complex than the dry text of ledger sheets and
investigative reports have suggested. Indeed, they were much alike:
both men of large gestures and appetites, both capable, it seems,
of the grand impulse one moment and an outright improper one the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, 64, made his reputation in Africa as a fighter against
the apartheid system. He once stood on a makeshift athletic field,
watching with tears streaming down his face as a group of barefoot
boys tried to play soccer with a homemade ball of weeds and duct
tape, according to Welch, who was there.
</P>
<P>
   Within the bid committee, however, Ganga was known by staff
members as ``the human vacuum cleaner,'' for his ability to take in
whatever crossed his path. When he came to town, staffers, with an
effort at comic cynicism, called it ``Ganga time.'' He took
thousands of dollars of free medical care, from hepatitis treatment
for himself to a knee replacement for his mother-in-law. He was put
up in an apartment in Salt Lake City, and after the family
departed, the Gangas' appliances were handed out. One staff member
got a toaster, another a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, a 54-year-old former corporate lawyer who resigned from
the organizing committee in 1997, after a charge of spousal abuse,
was singled out by the Salt Lake City ethics panel for unethical
and improper behavior that ranged from handing out cash for IOC
votes to setting up an investment fund in which he and Ganga were
to share the benefit. Welch admits he was free with other people's
money. He once spent $30,000 on the street in a single night on
Utah Jazz playoff tickets for 30 guests, charging the committee for
``marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But like Ganga, he had another side, too: He spent 10 obsessive
years attempting to bring the Games to Salt Lake City, five of them
without taking any pay. And the same ethics report that condemned
his actions also conceded that he never attempted to enrich himself
through the Olympic process; the investment fund with Ganga existed
in name only.
</P>
<P>
   In the strange theater of the Olympics, each man had a role to
play. In the letters and faxes that Welch and Ganga exchanged, they
circle one another, sometimes like adversaries or hagglers,
sometimes like real friends.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1994 letter to Welch from his home in Brazzaville, for
example, Ganga wrote of the war that was tearing his country apart.
The city was blockaded. Food and medicines were in short supply and
Ganga asked only that Welch try to pressure the U.S. government
into a formal condemnation of the killings. Money was not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Another exchange of letters, in April 1992, was all about money.
Ganga complained that he couldn't afford to fly to Montreal to
attend a wedding, and then, after a $4,700 check was sent, wrote
back with effusive thanks. ``As the saying goes, a friend in need
is a friend indeed,'' Ganga wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the relationships that formed here were simply a
cover for the buying and selling of the Olympic Games, real lives
were touched, a very human fact that has got buried under the
avalanche of embarrassment and anger.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, for example, Bob Hunter, the director of
community affairs for the bid committee, took in the son of an IOC
member from Libya, Suhel Attarabulsi, who had come to the United
States to attend college at the Salt Lake City bid committee's
expense. Hunter said he made speeches all over the state talking
about Suhel and his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fell to me to look after him,'' Hunter said. ``Our family
became acquainted with him and fell in love with him. He became
like our adopted son. He spent Christmas and summer vacations _
we've got his baby picture sitting on the piano in our living room.
That's the story I've told all across the state of Utah. That's why
it shocks me for people to say we didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Welch and Ganga have defended themselves. Ganga said
through a spokesman, Ibrahim Soumare, that he received cash because
the banking system in Congo Republic was unreliable, and that the
money was sent to various Olympic committees in Africa. Welch says
he was trying to win the bid in the way he had been told it had to
be done, but that he was also trying to make a real contribution to
poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   Through the filter of money and hindsight, however, it's hard
tell what's real. Welch, who described Ganga as a man with ``a
heart as big as all outdoors,'' also admits he was thrilled when
the IOC courtship was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the exhilaration I felt when the last member
from the last visit was put on the plane,'' he said. ``I subjected
myself to more people's pompous outlooks.''
</P>
<P>
   UNRAVELING: Questions Are Asked, Notes Are Destroyed
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge of what the bid committee was doing in chasing its
Olympic bid flowed like a river with no predetermined course _ full
of switchbacks and dry washes and dead ends. Information would
bubble up from the ground, only to sink again without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   In late July 1995, for example, one month after Salt Lake City
had won the Games, even as people here were still basking in the
euphoria of their victory, auditors from Ernst &AMP; Young, who were
working on their annual report to close the bid committee's books,
came across some puzzling and poorly documented accounting entries.
They consequently drew up a list of those expenditures, which
totaled $271,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ernst &AMP; Young auditors had pinpointed the very names and
amounts that have since become the heart of the Olympic scandal:
The so-called National Olympic Committee program. There on their
worksheet were cash recipients, including Ganga and all the IOC
scholarship students.
</P>
<P>
   The work papers that the auditors produced as they explored the
disbursements also included their handwritten notes, which
apparently reflected the information that they were gathering as
they attempted to determine what the payments had been about. Those
notes, which have been given to federal investigators in the case,
indicate that members of both the bid committee's audit committee
as well as at least one of its three-member executive committee
leaders were informed of the payments and approved them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed the NOC program with management, the audit
committee, and certain members of the executive committee,'' one of
the auditors wrote. ``Each individual disbursement is reviewed and
approved by the management of the committee,'' the auditor
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The people mentioned in the auditors' papers as having been
specifically told about the scholarship program in 1995 say they
received no such warnings. G. Frank Joklik, the former chairman of
the board of trustees, has maintained he was not aware of
wrongdoing; James Beardall, the chairman of the bid committee's
audit committee, said he was never notified of any questionable
expenditures of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no recollection whatsoever of any details of this kind
being brought to my attention,'' Joklik said of the auditor's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that that cannot be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's being denied, we had a powerful committee,''
he said of his superiors. ``They have run major corporations. They
are good managers. They required information and justifications
about everything we did.''
</P>
<P>
   What the work papers clearly reveal, however, is that auditors
were satisfied at the time that those people knew, and thus, at
least from an accounting standpoint, no one was cutting
unauthorized checks.
</P>
<P>
   But still the story stayed locked within bid committee walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bullock, a member of the board of trustees, was the next one
to try and break it free. On several occasions beginning in 1995
through last year, he said he told the board of trustees and Utah
Gov. Michael Leavitt of his concerns about the bogus scholarship
program. Bullock said he also complained to the governor's top
aide, Vicki Varela, in 1998 about the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought I was a little `out there,' chasing ghosts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former City Council member who worked with
Bullock, recalled his distress at not being listened to, and how he
often returned from meetings with the board emotionally ``bruised
and bloodied.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who often participated in public functions with
the very people receiving the improper scholarships and other
inducements, has said no one came to him with suspicions, and that
he would have done something immediately if he had had any idea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And so there the story appeared to stall again, until June 3,
1997, when a Salt Lake City Councilwoman Deeda Seed asked a local
television reporter to meet for breakfast at Lamb's, a downtown
landmark restaurant. There she told the reporter, Rod Decker of
KUTV Channel 2, that she'd been told _ by Bullock among others _
that children and grandchildren of IOC members were getting college
educations paid for by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Decker, a newsman in Salt Lake City for 27 years, said he would
follow up. He said he went to the committee's spokesman, Mike
Korologos, and asked if the story was true. Korologos said he would
check it out. When he called back, Decker said Korologos told him
that Johnson, the committee vice president, had said there were no
scholarships. He said he was told that some young people, including
some related to IOC members, had taken a tour of the University of
Utah _ that was all.
</P>
<P>
   Decker decided there was no story and let it drop.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said this week that he has no memory of the conversation
with Korologos, and Korologos has declined repeated requests for an
interview or comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Decker's call was a knock at the door. The world was
beginning to ask questions, and, in retrospect, Korologos' answer
was a tacit acknowledgement that someone within the committee's
leadership felt there was something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, something strange happened in the offices
of Ray Quinney &AMP; Nebeker, a prominent law firm in Salt Lake City
that was the bid committee's legal counsel. Pages and pages of
documents _ the minutes of the bid committee's senior management
meetings and the handwritten notes of the lawyer who was the
committee's secretary for 1994 and 1995 _ were shredded or
otherwise destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm's computer records do not indicate who gave the
order to destroy the documents, who carried out the destruction or
even how it was done, according to James Jardine, the managing
director at the firm and the man who had for years served as the
bid committee's chief lawyer. But the set of documents _ detailing
the committee's actions over the final months of Salt Lake City's
quest for the Olympics _ are the only files in that office to have
been so destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've interviewed everyone who has worked on it, and their
secretaries _ nobody has any knowledge,'' Jardine said. ``It's
strange. It doesn't make sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jardine said the destroyed notes would not have added much to
the record of what happened here. But others believe strongly that
the notes might have helped make sense of one critical question
that has hung over this city and the multiple investigations into
the acquisition of the 2002 Games: who among senior management,
including some of the city's most prominent and powerful
businessmen, knew of the illicit campaign to buy votes?
</P>
<P>
   INVESTIGATION: An Anonymous Source Reveals Corruption
</P>
<P>
   Someone with access to the committee's files still wanted to get
the story out. In late November 1998, a different local television
station, KTVX Channel 4, received a copy of a letter from an
anonymous sender. The letter, stamped ``draft'' on its face, was
from Johnson to an IOC member's daughter, Sonia Essomba, informing
her that her next tuition payment would be the last. On Nov. 24,
1998, Channel 4 broke the story, and local newspapers followed up
with their own stories about the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials, in response, portrayed the scholarships as
humanitarian gestures, and raised questions about whether the
letter might be a forgery. And so with the letter's authenticity
uncertain, the story appeared to fizzle again.
</P>
<P>
   But then about a week later, in Lausanne, Switzerland, the No. 2
official in the IOC, Marc Hodler, said in an apparently offhand
remark at a news conference on another subject that he believed
Salt Lake City might have paid bribes in winning the 2002 Winter
Games. In an interview with National Public Radio a few days later
on Dec. 10, Hodler used the word ``bribes'' again in front of an
American audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment, instead of being perceived as an aberration,
it turned into a crisis,'' Ms. Seed said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the story, and the list of questions it has raised,
has continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are trying to determine if anyone broke any
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has brought in an outsider
with Utah roots, W. Mitt Romney, a Boston-based venture capitalist,
to head up the Olympic committee with new pledge of full
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   An independent board of ethics created by Leavitt has determined
that knowledge was strictly limited to Welch, Johnson, and a third
man, Craig Peterson, who the ethics board said acted secretly and
alone.
</P>
<P>
   And a lengthening list of people _ from Welch and Johnson to
other staffers on the committee to officials with the national
accounting firm that reviewed the committee's books to the people
who served on a panel set up by the U.S. Olympic Committee _ have
said they are not satisfied that the full truth has come out.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Christensen, the volunteer, said he found it almost
inconceivable that Joklik, who took over for Welch in 1997 to run
the daily operations of the committee, did not know of the various
mechanisms in place to influence votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine him claiming he had zero knowledge of what was
going on,'' Christensen said. He added, ``It was such commonplace
knowledge among the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the chairman of a special investigation into
the Salt Lake City scandal, said he also believes many of
statements of ignorance ``strain credulity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the principal individuals were not a secret,''
Mitchell said. ``They didn't maintain two sets of books. Everything
was available to anyone who inquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, bid committee officials, and perhaps the most senior
members of the IOC, apparently thought they might be able to
control the extent of the damage even as it billowed around them.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, Johnson, who was called to Switzerland
after Hodler's remarks, said he discussed the trouble with a small
handful of IOC executive committee members. He then met with IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Of Samaranch, Johnson said: ``He told me, `You have a problem;
we have a problem; we will get through this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps they will, but they haven't yet. And as for the
leaked letter that sparked the maelstrom, an ethics panel report
last month concluded that it was genuine, but the source still has
not been revealed.

HOLLANDSWORTH MIGHT BE A FIRST OPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAINES CITY, Fla. _ Before spring training began, Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson told outfielder Todd Hollandsworth he'd try
to be creative in getting him at-bats. Little did Hollandsworth
realize that could mean playing first base, which he did Wednesday
in an exhibition game against the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he can play all three outfield positions and play them
well,'' Johnson said. ``If Eric's (Karros) knee acts up some time
and I want to put a left-handed bat (in the lineup), maybe I can
put Hollandsworth at first. It gives me options.''
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson loves options. When he managed in Cincinnati, he
used Lenny Harris as a backup at first because it provided another
alternative late in games.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, trying not to get typecast as a fourth outfielder
at the age of 25, said it was the first time he played first base
at any level. He also said he didn't know quite what to make of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're trying to do,'' Hollandsworth said.
``If they want me to play the one-bag, I'll do it, but I'm much
better used in the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth didn't have many chances in the 5{ innings he
spent at first. He caught a pop-up and didn't have any grounders,
though he handled the few throws sent his way. He also didn't
complain about the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job,'' Hollandsworth said. ``If the manager wants me
to put on my glove and go play first, I have no problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, the National League Rookie of the Year in 1996,
is healthy after spending the last two seasons battling injuries.
Playing time, though, could be hard to find since the Dodgers
signed free-agent center fielder Devon White in the offseason to
complement Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hollandsworth) did a good job over there,'' Johnson said.
``It's the degree of comfort he gets over there. We'll do it some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Getting in the routine: Todd Hundley expects to feel
exhausted come late Sunday, the usual result of catching for the
first time in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel like a fish out of water your first time,''
said Hundley, who was the designated hitter Wednesday against
Kansas City. ``Every spring training, you feel like that the first
two or three times out. Physically, with catching, that's the tough
part. You're tired, your back is aching and your legs hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is slated to catch his first spring-training game Sunday
against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gaining confidence: Pitching coach Charlie Hough said
right-hander Mel Rojas' confidence is so shot that his hitless
inning of relief Wednesday could go a long way in his attempt to
regain his pre-Mets form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's had a tough year-and-a-half and he's looking for
anything good to happen,'' said Hough, who's been working with
Rojas on mechanics. ``When you're trying to make adjustments, I
think you have to feel good about not giving up a run.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Minor-leaguers reported to Dodgertown
on Wednesday, and included in the 167 scheduled for camp were
former big-leaguers Eric Anthony, Jim Bullinger and Shawn Boskie. .
. . Outfielder Hiram Bocachica, who bruised his ribs in a Monday
collision with Trenidad Hubbard, is ready to resume playing.
However, Hubbard's bruised right thumb remains swollen and it could
be a few more days before he can play.

 &HT;    Smoltz, Woods change games
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Braves camp played out like a fantasy
camp for golfer Tiger Woods on Wednesday. Woods, along with fellow
PGA Tour player Lee Janzen, took his friend John Smoltz up on an
offer to drop by for batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Smoltz played a round of golf with the 1997
Masters champion and Janzen, the '98 U.S. Open champion, at
Isleworth Country Club in Orlando. The result?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Woods) got a 67, not even trying,'' Smoltz said. ``I had a
76, grinding my absolute heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad played in the Negro leagues,'' Woods said. ``I always
wanted to be like him. I was a pitcher. I tore my rotator cuff and
there went that idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz met Woods at the opening of the All-Star Cafe in Atlanta.
He was happy to give Woods a chance to live out some childhood
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he's not allowed to have fun sometimes,''
Smoltz said. ``That comes with the amount of (fame) you receive,
kind of like Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The way it looked Wednesday, those golfers aren't as skilled in
baseball as some of the Braves are at golf.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Janzen both said they hadn't played baseball since
Little League.

TARNISHED GOLD: SALT LAKE CITY'S 30-YEAR DESIRE FOR OLYMPIC GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: a longer version, about 5,300 words in 5 takes, has also
moved.) 
(bl) 
 This story is based on reporting by JO THOMAS, KIRK JOHNSON and
JERE LONGMAN. It was written by KIRK JOHNSON.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ David R. Johnson and Thomas K. Welch were
lionized in 1995 when, after three decades of trying, they
delivered to this city the right to stage the 2002 Winter Olympic
Games. But after that came a long, hard fall.
</P>
<P>
   An independent ethics panel investigating how the Salt Lake City
bid committee used cash payments and college scholarships to
influence Olympic officials has identified Johnson and Welch _ two
of the committee's senior officers _ as the central culprits.
Federal prosecutors are exploring criminal charges against them.
Their reputations are in jeopardy. And yet they have remained
surprisingly steadfast in their positions: they don't regret a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the bid committee's former vice president, said that if
he had one misgiving about how Salt Lake City won the Olympics, it
was that its officials were not more public and open about the
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have said, `of course we have scholarships,' '' he
said. ``It was a way of winning the bid, to increase our ways to
communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Welch, the former head of the Salt Lake City effort, said
his lack of regret matches his lack of guilt feelings when he was
waging the campaign in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole atmosphere was, hey, you're paying homage to these
people,'' Welch said of the lavishments he and others bestowed on
the 114 members of the International Olympic Committee who decide
where to hold the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City's long effort to join the Olympic fraternity _
sometimes brazen, sometimes comic, and all the while relying on
inside information provided by other Olympic cities _ comes to
detailed life in hundreds of pages of internal bid committee
documents obtained by The New York Times and in interviews with
numerous committee staff workers and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, as well as the first extensive interviews with
Welch and Johnson, also strongly suggest that many Salt Lake
Organizing Committee officials beyond the two former committee
officers _ and within the Olympic family in general _ had fully
accepted the coarse financial facts of what had to be done to
become an Olympic city. (However, federal, state and independent
investigations are still underway and all the facts have not yet
been determined.)
</P>
<P>
   And it all, in the end, may have been unnecessary. Salt Lake
City, which had pursued the Olympics for 30 years as part of a
broad economic development plan to build a winter tourism industry,
had actually pulled together a legitimate proposal that Olympic
officials across the globe concede was, on its merits, unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Salt Lake City failed in an inexpensive,
unsophisticated and by many accounts inept effort to host the 1972
Winter Games. But over the next three decades, it became much more
serious about its Olympic ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   And there was also a powerful momentum from within the state
driving the Olympic efforts: economic development. The organizers
of the first bid in 1966 did more than simply start the Olympic
machine, economists and public policy experts say. They forged a
kind of symbiotic relationship that fed on itself. Going after the
Olympics created publicity for Utah tourism, and the growth of
tourism over the years in turn reinforced the rationale for going
after the Olympics and further enhanced the city's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the three decades of trying, though, Salt Lake City
never quite shook the sense that it had some inadequacy or
provincialism to overcome, residents and former bid committee
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That insecurity was deepened by uncertainty over just how the
competitions were being conducted. In 1991, with a solid bid
package in place for the 1998 Games, Salt Lake City officials
received a letter from Patrick Hickey, the president of Ireland's
Olympic committee, who let drop that some IOC members had
contracted to sell their votes for a flat fee of $100,000 to the
city of Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of the vote for the 1998 Games, Welch said, he
was approached by Jean-Jacques Ganga, the son of the IOC member
from the Republic of Congo, who said he could help secure a handful
of votes for $35,000. Welch and others refused, in part because
they didn't have the money. Nagano won by four votes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1993, despite being the leading candidate for the 2002
Games, Salt Lake City officials were reminded that nothing was a
certainty. So the Salt Lake City rules evolved: Do no harm, take no
chances and say yes to just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we had was about getting the bid,'' Johnson said.
``All our money was to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, working from 1991 to 1995 to at last secure the
Games, gave and gave _ at least $1.2 million to IOC members and
their families and much beyond that in time and attention and
personal favors.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Mary Alison Glen-Haig, a committee member from England, got
to play cards late into the night at the house of Salt Lake City
Mayor Deedee Corradini. The children of IOC members from Mali and
Cameroon wound up receiving more than $100,000 each in scholarships
and payments.
</P>
<P>
   It could all be quite matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   According to staffers at the committee, Sibo Sibandze, the son
of the IOC member from Swaziland, would with regularity turn up at
the second-floor offices at the corner of 200 East and 200 South,
open the door and ask, ``Where's my check?'' And the checks would
be cut: $250 one week, $590 the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew these guys, they came in weekly,'' said Jason
Christensen, a volunteer staffer. ``You saw them pick up their
checks. You took them places. You didn't have to be a brain surgeon
to know what was going on. It was always whispered, `Whose son is
he? How much of a scholarship is he getting? How does that work?
People freaked out the first time they heard about it. Then it
became second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By early 1995, according to a list of bid committee payments,
money often was being spent with no support documentation,
including a $30,000 check for cash at First Security bank for
unknown purposes. Gifts to beneficiaries designated as ``various
IOC members'' reached more than $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   From February 1993 to February 1996, the bid committee paid
installments of $500 that totaled $14,500 to a Raouf Scally, who
was thought to be the relative of an IOC member. To this day, local
Olympic officials are not certain who Scally was or what North
African country he came from.
</P>
<P>
   The bid's strategy, Johnson said, dictated that African
committee members be pursued, not necessarily because those members
had their hands out, but because they were the swing votes. Salt
Lake City's analysis showed that no city had had ever been chosen
to host the Games without African member support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get the African vote,'' he said. ``We had to get
them early, get it done, maintain contact and maintain momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Bid committee officials also had detailed personal information
on their IOC targets, from the dossiers prepared by previous bid
cities such as Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   bid committee officials say they were as straightforward about
their campaign when talking to people in the Olympic family.
Johnson, for instance, insists he kept Anita DeFrantz, the senior
American IOC member, updated in detail. He said she frequently
asked him which way members were leaning and what it had taken to
gain their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   If an IOC member had asked or demanded favors, Johnson said that
Ms. DeFrantz's response was, ``That's not good,' or something like
that. She didn't say, `Don't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's charge is explosive. If Ms. DeFrantz knew of the
misconduct in Salt Lake City and did nothing to report or correct
it, her reputation as one of the most powerful and upright figures
in international sport could be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Ms. DeFrantz emphatically refuted Johnson's
claims and said he was lying. She said she did know that one or
more children of IOC members were attending schools in Utah on
scholarship, but assumed they had been earned on their merits and
were not being underwritten by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to imagine a world where a scrappy, effusive attorney
from Ogden, Utah, named Tom Welch would live an entire life and
never meet a mercurial politician from the Congo Republic named
Jean-Claude Ganga. But given the logic and machinery of the Olympic
site selection process that existed in the 1990s, it may be hard to
imagine anything else.
</P>
<P>
   For the Salt Lake City bid committee, Welch was the preeminent
giver of gifts and cash, Ganga the preeminent taker. Of the $15
million that the bid committee spent in winning the 2002 Winter
Games, Ganga got more than anyone _ at least $250,000, according to
the board of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, 64, was known by bid committee staffers as ``the human
vacuum cleaner,'' for his ability to take in whatever crossed his
path. When he came to town, staffers called it ``Ganga time.'' He
took thousands of dollars of free medical care, from hepatitis
treatment for himself to a knee replacement for his mother-in-law.
He was put up in an apartment in Salt Lake City, and after the
family departed, the Gangas' appliances were handed out. One staff
member got a toaster, another a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, 54, a former corporate lawyer who resigned from the
organizing committee in 1997 after a charge of spousal abuse, was
singled out by the Salt Lake City ethics panel for unethical and
improper behavior that ranged from handing out cash for IOC votes
to setting up an investment fund in which he and Ganga were to
share the benefit. Welch admits he was free with other people's
money.
</P>
<P>
   But like Ganga, he had another side, too: He spent 10 obsessive
years attempting to bring the Games to Salt Lake City, five of them
without taking any pay. And the same ethics report that condemned
his actions also conceded that he never attempted to enrich himself
through the Olympic process; the investment fund with Ganga existed
in name only.
</P>
<P>
   Both Welch and Ganga have defended themselves. Ganga said
through a spokesman that he received cash because the banking
system in Congo Republic was unreliable, and that the money was
sent to various Olympic committees in Africa. Welch says he was
trying to win the bid in the way he had been told it had to be
done, but that he was also trying to make a real contribution to
poorer countries. again without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   In late July 1995, one month after Salt Lake City had won the
Games, even as people here were still basking in the euphoria of
their victory, auditors from Ernst &AMP; Young, who were working on
their annual report to close the bid committee's books, came across
some puzzling and poorly documented accounting entries. They drew
up a list of those expenditures, which totaled $271,000.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors had pinpointed the very names and amounts that have
since become the heart of the Olympic scandal: The so-called
National Olympic Committee program. There on their worksheet were
cash recipients, including Ganga and all the IOC scholarship
students.
</P>
<P>
   The work papers that the auditors produced as they explored the
disbursements also included their handwritten notes, which
apparently reflected the information that they were gathering as
they attempted to determine what the payments had been about. Those
notes, which have been given to federal investigators, indicate
that members of both the bid committee's audit panel as well as at
least one of its three-member executive committee leaders were
informed of the payments and approved them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The people mentioned in the auditors' papers as having been
specifically told about the scholarship program in 1995 say they
received no such warnings. G. Frank Joklik, the former chairman of
the board of trustees, has maintained he was not aware of
wrongdoing; James Beardall, the chairman of the bid committee's
audit committee, said he was never notified of any questionable
expenditures of money.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that that cannot be. He said of his superiors,
``They have run major corporations. They are good managers. They
required information and justifications about everything we did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the work papers clearly reveal that auditors were satisfied
at the time that those people knew, and thus, at least from an
accounting standpoint, no one was cutting unauthorized checks.
</P>
<P>
   But still the story stayed locked within bid committee walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bullock, a member of the board of trustees, was the next one
to try to break it free. On several occasions from 1995 through
1998. he said, he told the board of trustees and Utah Gov. Michael
Leavitt of his concerns about the bogus scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, 1997, Salt Lake City Councilwoman Deeda Seed told a
reporter, Rod Decker of KUTV, that she'd been told _ by Bullock
among others _ that children and grandchildren of IOC members were
getting college educations paid for by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Decker said he went to the committee's spokesman, Mike
Korologos, and asked if the story was true. Korologos said told him
that Johnson, the committee vice president, had said there were no
scholarships. He said he was told that some young people, including
some related to IOC members, had taken a tour of the University of
Utah _ that was all.
</P>
<P>
   Decker decided there was no story and let it drop. But his
tentative inquiry was a knock at the door. The world was beginning
to ask questions, and, in retrospect, Korologos' answer was a tacit
acknowledgement that someone within the committee's leadership felt
there was something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, something strange happened in at Ray
Quinney &AMP; Nebeker, a prominent law firm in Salt Lake City that was
the bid committee's legal counsel. Numerous documents _ the minutes
of the bid committee's senior management meetings and the
handwritten notes of the lawyer who was the committee's secretary
for 1994 and 1995 _ were shredded or otherwise destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's records do not indicate who gave the order to destroy
the documents, who carried out the destruction or even how it was
done, according to James Jardine, the managing director at the firm
and the man who had for years served as the bid committee's chief
lawyer. But the set of documents _ detailing the committee's
actions over the final months of Salt Lake City's quest for the
Olympics _ are the only files in that office that were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the destroyed documents might have helped make
sense of one critical question that has hung over this city and the
multiple investigations into the acquisition of the 2002 Games: who
among senior management, including some of the city's most
prominent and powerful businessmen, knew of the illicit campaign to
buy votes?
</P>
<P>
   Someone with access to the committee's files still wanted to get
the story out. In late November 1998, a different local television
station, KTVX, received a copy of a letter from an anonymous
sender. The letter, stamped ``draft'' on its face, was from Johnson
to an IOC member's daughter, Sonia Essomba, informing her that her
next tuition payment would be the last. On Nov. 24, 1998, KTVX
broke the story, and local newspapers followed up with their own
stories about the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials, in response, portrayed the scholarships as
humanitarian gestures, and raised questions about whether the
letter might be a forgery. And so with the letter's authenticity
uncertain, the story appeared to fizzle again.
</P>
<P>
   But then about a week later, in Lausanne, Switzerland, the No. 2
official in the IOC, Marc Hodler, said in an apparently offhand
remark at a news conference on another subject that he believed
Salt Lake City might have paid bribes in winning the 2002 Winter
Games. In an interview with National Public Radio a few days later
on Dec. 10, Hodler used the word ``bribes'' again in front of an
American audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment, instead of being perceived as an aberration,
it turned into a crisis,'' Ms. Seed said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the story, and the list of questions it has raised,
has continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are trying to determine if anyone broke any
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has brought in an outsider
with Utah roots, W. Mitt Romney, a Boston-based venture capitalist,
to head the Olympic committee with new pledge of full disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   An independent board of ethics created by Leavitt has determined
that knowledge was strictly limited to Welch, Johnson, and a third
man, Craig Peterson, who the ethics board said acted secretly and
alone.
</P>
<P>
   And a lengthening list of people _ from Welch and Johnson to
other staffers on the committee to officials with the national
accounting firm that reviewed the committee's books to the people
who served on a panel set up by the U.S. Olympic Committee _ have
said they are not satisfied that the full truth has come out.

BANKBOSTON GETS OK TO AUCTION PROPERTY OF MAN ACCUSED IN FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a decision that allows BankBoston Corp. to recover
more pride than money, a US District Court judge has ruled in favor
of a motion that seeks to auction off the personal assets of
Ricardo S. Carrasco, the former BankBoston private banker accused
of stealing $73 million from his employer last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which comes one year after the company first
disclosed the theft, means that Carrasco property valued at around
$300,000 will be sold to the public in coming months, with the
majority of the proceeds going to BankBoston, sources close to the
matter said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Southern District of New York on
Monday reinforced his March 4 and Feb. 26 judgments in favor of the
New York branch of the Federal Reserve system, which oversees the
New York office of BankBoston's private bank, where Carrasco
worked.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of motions and lawsuits filed last year, the New
York Fed froze Carrasco's assets and formally asked the Uruguayan
citizen to repay the stolen money.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's rulings, known as a default judgment, came after the
fugitive Carrasco failed to appear before authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said Wednesday that they were still
searching for Carrasco, who disappeared in February 1998 after
BankBoston uncovered his scheme. ``This is still an active
investigation,'' a source at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
New York office said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasco, a senior vice president of BankBoston's international
private bank and a 20-year veteran of the company, arranged a
string of phony loans to an Argentine businessman that resulted in
BankBoston writing off $66 million in the first quarter of 1998.
BankBoston has significant operations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud, one of the largest of its kind, led the company to
reorganize its private bank and fire a string of top executives.
Carrasco's assets include a 1990 Jaguar XJS, a part ownership in an
antiques store on Long Island, and a home near exclusive East
Hampton, variously assessed at $183,000 and $160,000, according to
investigators. Federal investigators describe the property as
rundown.
</P>
<P>
   The assets are pocket change for BankBoston, which so far has
been unable to use its insurance to recover money lost due to
Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fed, which now has physical possession of
Carrasco's property, plans to sell off the assets by June.

ECONOMIC SCENE: TRACKING JAPAN'S PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., Mass.)  (Eds: See also JAPAN-ECONOMY, DAIMLER-NISSAN, NISSAN-ASSESS,
RJR-NABISCO-JAPAN) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have Japanese officials _ finally _ turned economic policy
around?
</P>
<P>
   After a decade-long stagnation caused in part by inadequate
government measures of the past, there are some promising signs.
Monetary policy, for instance, at least seems to be heading in a
more expansionary direction, putting it in line with a more
stimulative fiscal policy as well. And over the past few weeks, key
bank and finance officials have issued oblique promises to follow
through on these moves.
</P>
<P>
   But even the American economists who follow the Japanese economy
are not sure how much policy has actually changed. And there is the
ominous possibility, expressed by one prominent expert, that even
if the Japanese do everything they now hint at, the economy may
still remain sick.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy had been the envy of the world throughout
the 1970s and 1980s, growing faster than other industrialized
economies with only a whiff of inflation. But the crash of its
securities and real estate markets in the late 1980s undermined the
solvency of many big banks, whose loans were tied to real estate.
Bank loans to credit-worthy borrowers shriveled. Last year the
economy sank into recession, shrinking by about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, deflation has set in. Wholesale prices
have been falling for years and now consumer prices appear to be
falling. By creating the expectation that prices will continue to
fall, deflation gives consumers and companies perverse incentives
to postpone purchases. That can trigger a downward spiral of
falling spending, production, income and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The West has accused the Japanese of tolerating a decade of
stagnation with barely a whimper. But professor Allan Meltzer of
Carnegie Mellon University, who serves, along with Stanford
University professor John Taylor, as an ``honorary adviser'' to the
Bank of Japan, provides a plausible explanation. ``The Japanese saw
no reason to panic for most of the decade, confident that their
vaunted economy would recover in a matter of months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But months turned into years. ``It was not until Korea collapsed
in the fall of 1997,'' Meltzer continued, ``that the Japanese
realized that the problem would not go away. So while the West
thinks the Japanese have been dawdling for 10 years, the Japanese
think they've been wrestling with the problem for only about 15
months.''
</P>
<P>
   And over those 15 months, he says, Tokyo has done ``a surprising
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Posen of the Institute for International Economics, the
author of a recent book on the Japanese economy, agrees. Japan is
running a huge budget deficit _ 10 percent of national output and
rising. (At its most recent peak in 1983, the U.S. federal deficit
reached 6.1 percent of annual output.) Though Posen would like to
see even larger tax cuts, it can no longer be said that Japanese
fiscal stimulus is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have also moved decisively in recent months to
clean up their banks. The government is paying off depositors at
failed banks, nationalizing insolvent banks that the government
decides to keep open, and pumping public money into shaky but
solvent banks in exchange for stock. The three-pronged reform aims
to give insolvent borrowers a fresh start and to build up banks'
capital reserves so that they can resume lending.
</P>
<P>
   But few economists think that fiscal stimulus and bank reform
alone are enough. The outside advisers have called on the Japanese
central bank to pump enough new money into the economy to stop
prices from falling.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Japan delayed? Apart from an ideological fear of doing
anything that hints of inflation, one big reason is that Tokyo
might fear retaliation from the United States. Once the central
bank prints more yen, they will leak into the foreign exchange
market and drive down the value of the yen against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   That will make Japan's goods cheaper to buy in America and
America's goods more expensive to buy in Japan _ worsening an
already huge trade imbalance and possibly igniting protectionist
measures in Congress. Officials also worry that a falling yen will
spread to other currencies in Asia, creating a contagion of
currency depreciations in already fragile financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the Japanese, driven by the greater needs of their own
economy at the moment, are overcoming their reluctance to offend
Uncle Sam. Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister of finance and Japan's
most outspoken advocate of a strong yen, has reversed course and
stated that it would be OK if the Japanese currency fell in value.
And the central bank has driven down short-term interest rates
within a few tenths of a percentage point of zero. And, as
predicted, the exchange rate has fallen, so that it now takes about
120 yen to buy a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater
Associates, cautions against overinterpreting these recent straws
in the wind. The central bank's monetary policy may be more
lenient, but the change is not dramatic, he says. And the Bank of
Japan's public pronouncements continue to focus on interest rates,
not flooding the economy with more money.
</P>
<P>
   American economists point out that policy does not need to rely
on driving interest rates lower _ they already are near zero anyway
_ to pump up spending. The central bank can print new yen in order
to buy lots of assets, from commercial paper to foreign exchange.
Eventually, the extra yen should boost consumer spending. A recent
statement by a board member of the Bank of Japan suggests that some
of his colleagues are thinking about targeting inflation rather
than interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has provocatively called on the central
bank to go further, much further. He argues that consumers and
companies will not start spending as long as they believe that
prices will keep falling.
</P>
<P>
   So Krugman has urged the government to ``credibly promise to be
irresponsible.'' That may not be the most diplomatic way to
encourage the ever cautious Japanese. But it does drive home the
point that nothing short of expanding the money supply to build in
the expectation that prices will start rising for the indefinite
future will prod the Japanese into deciding to spend now rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take the tantalizing hints out of the finance ministry and
central bank at face value. Fiscal and monetary policies will ease
more and bank reform will proceed. Mission accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, say Ronald McKinnon of Stanford and Kenichi Ohno of
Saitama University in Japan. They reject their colleagues'
optimism. Bank reform and monetary and fiscal easing are necessary,
they agree. But these moves are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   They trace Japan's problem to decades of pressure by Washington
to raise the value of the yen in a losing effort to eliminate the
United States trade deficit with Japan. In fact, the yen rose, in
dollar terms, by four percent a year from the 1970s to the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon points out that investors who expect the yen to rise
will accept lower interest payments on bonds denominated in yen
compared with bonds denominated in dollars. It is no accident,
then, that interest rates are generally about 4 percentage points
lower in Japan than in the United States. But since interest rates
have dropped in the United States, they have been pushed down to
near zero in Japan. At that rate, banks cannot make any profit on
loans and the economy cannot, therefore, recover.
</P>
<P>
   The way out of this bind, says McKinnon, is to raise interest
rates in Japan. That requires ``wiping out the expectation that the
yen will rise.'' He proposes that the United States and Japan agree
to stabilize the value of the yen at about 130 to the dollar, the
rate at which a dollar buys about as many hamburgers and computers
in Japan as it does in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation that the yen would continue to rise was not
created solely by Japan, and cannot be solved solely by Japan,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If McKinnon is correct, then recovery in Japan depends on an
accord that no official in either country appears prepared to
adopt. So a more plausible course, for now, is for the Japanese to
print money galore _ and cross their fingers that the weaker yen
that would be a consequence of such a policy will not trigger
protectionism in the United States or worsen the financial
situation across the rest of Asia.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an age that celebrates victimhood, Monica
Lewinsky has earned the title of Supervictim.
</P>
<P>
   First, she is portrayed in book and television, and soon in
mythic song and legend, as having been callously used by the
president of the U.S. She was a 22-year-old intern whose insecure
``sexuality'' was exploited by a predatory boss, who then cast her
aside in a fit of guilty self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   Next to victimize her was a faithless friend, Linda Tripp, who _
unlike 10 other friends to whom she confided the details of her
affair _ tape-recorded her streaming consciousness and turned the
evidence over to the feds.
</P>
<P>
   Then she fell victim to a family lawyer, William Ginsburg, who
went gaga over the seduction of publicity and, she thinks,
represented her poorly before the next victimizer _
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, who terrorized her into confessing that
she had prepared a false affidavit and made her young life a living
hell for a whole year, because it half-exposed her to _
</P>
<P>
   The victim-hungry meanie media, who treated her throughout her
travail as a chubby, ditzy, spoiled and irresponsible slut.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was Monica's privacy plundered five ways, the way she tells
it through her agents, new lawyers, biographer, interviewers and
hairdresser. Never in the course of human history has one
vulnerable young woman been so shabbily treated by so many
powerful, world-class manipulators.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do we aficionados of Great Cons clasp her to our
bosoms? Because this uncandid Cunegonde is now so good at what she
does. We who respect disciplined professionalism in the concoction
of images salute this sob-solipsister.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of her masterly self-awareness in this role is her
reaction to questions about Sidney Blumenthal's testimony. He swore
that Bill Clinton told him, before the DNA evidence made denial
implausible, that Monica was a stalker, threatening the innocent
president with blackmail unless he succumbed to her demands.
</P>
<P>
   That version would have made Clinton the victim. That was the
one technique that would have usurped her hard-earned victimhood.
No wonder she responded with fury, revulsion and alacrity; it takes
an avid seeker of Supervictim status to know an impressively
pitiable competitor when one appears.
</P>
<P>
   Give credit where it's due. That woman understands that the
ultimate purpose of victimhood is not sympathy but a caring
identification with a social and generational cohort, not to
mention money and all the happiness it can buy.
</P>
<P>
   She seems confident she can hold fast to her lack of self-esteem
despite her world fame. Monica, one of the few with whom the world
is on a first-name basis, knows that if she can institutionalize
her victimhood, she can underdoggedly attract other underdogs who
buy books and magazines about the celebrated ill used.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the poor souls made to appear as her victimizers?
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr, who tried to get a cover-up conspirator to testify
against high-level lawbreakers, gets clobbered in public opinion
every time Monica pretends to be fearful of going to jail for
mentioning his name.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ginsburg, who conceived the ultimately successful strategy
of appeasing Starr with evidence of Clinton's perjury but not
offending Clinton with evidence of his obstruction of justice, is
reviled for being an ultra-available publicity hound by Monica and
media ``getters'' who pursued him so avidly for their shows.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, to whom Monica blabbed the most intimate details of
her affair, properly suffers for taping secretly and bears Monica's
abuse for not adopting her talking points to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The meanie media, having made a fortune responding to public
fascination with the case, now lacerate themselves for prurient
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton? The incurable romantic, according to his victim's
report, fearfully envisions a time when she is still vibrantly fair
and he is afflicted with embarrassing urgencies.
</P>
<P>
   You and I, though irritated by a waste of time, are not victims.
Thanks to the fine journalism of Barbara Walters, Monica brought
the nation together to share an experience. That counts for
something.

 &HT;    Pulling the plug on video poker
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMMOND, La. _ Orlin ``Shorty'' Rogers' small kingdom off
Interstate 55 is a homage to the financial potential of video
poker.
</P>
<P>
   In a busy strip of fast food shops and gas stations about an
hour from the Mississippi state line, Rogers has a hotel, a
convenience store, a barbecue restaurant, a full-service truck stop
and the Cypress Lounge, a mini-casino that keeps everything else in
business. The windowless room with 50 video poker machines, dark
carpeting and a sign that says ``Be a $500 winner: Royal Flush'' is
open 24 hours a day to truckers, travelers and locals. Without
their wagers, Rogers says, the whole operation would sink.
</P>
<P>
   And sink it will, come June 30. That's when video poker will be
outlawed in Tangipahoa Parish and in more than half the state,
seven years after the Legislature legalized it.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 local-option election allowed parishes to vote on video
poker and riverboat casinos, and while every parish that has
riverboats voted to keep them, 33 of 64 parishes tossed out video
poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible,'' said Rogers. ``I did everything the state
required me to do to be in business, and I went in debt to do it,
and they went and had an election. If I knew they were going to
come and pull the plug, I wouldn't have done this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline draws near, Rogers isn't the only one
complaining. Officials in several parishes and cities are concerned
both for local businesses and for government coffers, which have
benefited from taxes on the machines. At least four parishes,
including Tangipahoa, have passed resolutions asking the
Legislature to authorize a new vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bobby Gill of Kentwood, a Tangipahoa Parish town four
miles from the Mississippi line, said his town will suffer from the
loss of poker tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town gets about $25,000 a month from video poker, and you
can imagine what that means to a town of 2,700 people,'' he said.
``I'd like to see the Legislature allow each municipality to vote
on it again.''
</P>
<P>
   While about half of Louisiana is dealing out video poker, some
Alabama legislators want their state to deal it in. They advocate
putting the machines at the state's four dog tracks to help bolster
a parimutuel industry dragged down by lotteries and casinos in
neighboring states. They say their bill would keep casinos out of
Alabama while raising $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, David Beasley lost his re-election bid for
governor in large part because he challenged video poker, calling
it a ``cancer.'' Poker-friendly political action committees threw
their support to Jim Hodges, who won.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, who is pushing for a statewide lottery, has since agreed
to a referendum on whether to abolish video poker, and the
Legislature is weighing ways to better regulate the $2.3 billion
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Those calling for a revote on video poker in Louisiana are
arguing that the first vote wasn't fair because the Legislature
barred the gambling industry from pooling its resources to
campaign. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that law
unconstitutional two weeks before the 1996 vote _ too late,
gambling proponents say, for the industry to mount a real effort to
keep video poker. The industry filed a lawsuit to overturn the
elections; a trial is scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
   Political pollster Bernie Pinsonat said he doubts the
Legislature will allow a revote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election year, and why would you want, as an
incumbent, to create an issue for an opponent?'' he said.
``Gambling is a volatile issue _ there's no telling who would be in
your face in a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature does not convene until later this month.
Meanwhile, truck stops and other poker outlets are closing or
pulling up stakes and relocating to legal parishes. A truck stop in
Kentwood has moved to neighboring St. Helena Parish, Gill said. St.
Helena, which voted to keep video poker, is surrounded by parishes
that voted it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to gamble anyway,'' Gill said. ``They'll just
go to St. Helena now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Jackson, a home health care nurse who was gambling at the
Cypress Lodge last week, said she'll start going to St. Helena when
the Tangipahoa poker outlets close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that this will close, but I'll just go to the next
place,'' she said.

HOUSE TO VOTE ON SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO) 
(sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After weeks of growing unease over U.S. policy in
Kosovo, the issue of sending American troops to enforce a peace
settlement in a foreign civil war is being pushed to the House
floor, despite appeals by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert insisted on Wednesday that the
House would vote Thursday on whether to endorse sending American as
peacekeepers to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo if a settlement is
reached there.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton has the power to authorize the mission
without congressional approval, congressional votes against it
could ultimately undermine the funding of the mission. More
immediately, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright argued on
Wednesday, it could harm negotiations and ``be taken by both sides
as a green light to resume fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   With international negotiations set to resume on Monday, she
asked Congress to hold off any debate or vote ``at this critical
time in our negotiations and in our attempts to secure a
settlement.``
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert replied later in the day that ``no one should fear
the free expression of ideas.'' He said his resolution would be on
the floor for debate and votes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts about Kosovo are not confined to Republicans. Members
of Congress from both parties are openly suspicious about the
proposed NATO peacekeeping mission to end the fighting in Kosovo
between rebel ethnic Albanians and the Serbian government. Some say
they fear the mission is so flawed that it could turn into a
nightmare along the lines of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dr. Henry Kissinger, national security adviser to
President Richard Nixon during the Vietnam War, raised that specter
in testimony on Wednesday before the House Committee on
International Relations when he questioned the wisdom of forcing
the sovereign nation of Yugoslavia, under the threat of bombing, to
sign an agreement to allow foreign troops to intervene in a civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under what circumstances should American military forces be
used to pursue national objectives, and what should these
objectives be?'' Kissinger asked, saying he was ``especially
sensitive'' to this question since he had to negotiate the American
withdrawal from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces were placed there with great unanimity at the time,
and wound up dividing the country,'' Kissinger said. ``So this is a
special concern I have.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan doubts are reflected in support for another
resolution against sending troops, this one proposed by Rep. Tillie
Fowler, R-Fla. Backers of that resolution include Reps. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., and John Kasich, R- Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There was little disagreement at the hearing Wednesday about the
brutality of Serbian oppression of the Albanian majority of Kosovo.
But the central issue was whether the United States has sufficient
direct national security concerns to break with precedent and
support a NATO mission to intervene in a civil war in southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that this use of force against a sovereign in their own
territory, which has not attacked us, is unprecedented, are the
circumstances of genocide present here?'' asked Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Calif. ``I have received briefings, as all the members have, and
what I have been led to believe is that we have a bloody civil war;
we do not have a systematic attempt by the government in Serbia to
exterminate the Albanian population.``
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hastert admitted in a letter to his colleagues that
he has ``reservations regarding the wisdom of deploying additional
U.S. troops to the former Yugoslavia.'' However, the resolution he
has set for debate on Thursday simply declares that ``the President
is authorized to deploy United States Armed Forces personnel to
Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping operation implementing a
Kosovo peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are themselves divided over whether to support
sending 4,000 U.S. troops as part of the proposed 28,000-member
NATO mission. One of the staunchest supporters of the
administration is Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and head of the
influential Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of experts arguing the pros and cons of the issue on
Wednesday was entirely Republican. Opposing Kissinger and
supporting the Clinton administration were Jeanne A. Kirkpatrick,
former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and former Sen. Bob
Dole, who recently flew to Macedonia to intercede with the Kosovo
Albanians on behalf of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony on Wednesday, Albright promised that the
administration would continue consulting Congress and that ``we
will not make a decision on sending U.S. troops until we have an
agreement in hand and can evaluate whether it meets the conditions
President Clinton outlined.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she warned that ``there is no chance that the
Kosovar Albanians will sign on to this deal if the U.S. does not
participate in its implementation.''  &QL;

REVOKING TEENS' DRIVER'S LICENSES HAS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WANTING
TO REBEL

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. _ For 10 years now, the teen-age driver's
license _ that sacred piece of plastic that confers mobility on the
restless _ has been the bull's &UR;  &LR; eye of every state legislature in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Drop out of high school and 18 states, 12 of them in the South,
will revoke a license. Many of those states will also take it away
for poor grades or poor behavior. The laws have proved immensely
popular with voters and politicians, who are convinced that they
have found the trigger mechanism, the ultimate motivator of the
American teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But among the people who actually teach students and run
schools, the license laws are increasingly seen as a waste of time
and money, particularly because the time and money are usually
theirs, not the state's.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Cumberland County, the school board was already swimming
in paperwork, busily revoking the licenses of students with poor
attendance and grades, when news recently came that Lt. Gov. Dennis
Wicker had proposed revoking the licenses of disruptive students as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with the state's good intentions, the board voted to
oppose the proposal. Using words like ``unfunded mandate'' and
``big government,'' school officials say they have had enough of
the state's helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the intent of what they're trying to do, but
they don't realize the effect these laws have,'' said William C.
Harrison, superintendent of the county's school district, the
fourth-largest in the state, with about 50,000 students. ``With all
the issues we have on our plate, to overload us now with this kind
of paperwork, asking us to do the work of social institutions and
the family, well, it's a hard sell around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many educators say parents and the legal system should determine
who drives, not school officials, who often have to divert teachers
or clerks from educational duties to enforce the law. Louisiana
dropped its license-revocation law in 1997 after finding it too
expensive. Florida let its law lapse in 1996, but legislators
revived it the next year over the objections of school officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally thought it would change the dropout rate, but it
did not,'' said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida
School Boards' Association. ``We found it extremely burdensome, and
the paperwork that each principal and guidance counselor had to do
was tremendous, and it did not slow down the dropout rate.''
</P>
<P>
   But such concerns are not slowing the momentum of the laws.
Wicker's proposal recently passed the state Senate unanimously and
appears likely to be enacted. Wicker said there was plenty of
anecdotal evidence that the laws work, so the eventual outcome
would be worth the administrative burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver's license is a very powerful motivator among young
people, particularly in the South where we don't have much mass
transit,'' he said. ``To young people, the license means
everything. It's their freedom, it's a means of being able to move
around and be mobile, which is very important to the life of a
young person. They will do all they can possibly can to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no concrete proof that any of the laws have kept
students in school or motivated them to work harder. The school
dropout rates in many states did not change significantly after the
laws were passed, and in other states, economic or educational
changes were credited with improving school attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who tells you they know these laws work isn't telling
the truth, because no one has done a study,'' said Kathy Christie,
policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States, a
nonprofit organization based in Denver that compiles data on state
education policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, these laws have been unpopular only with students,
so no one has really put the money in to research it. It's
politically easy to do, and it doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are of mixed opinion, depending on their academic
standing. Stephen Smith, a sophomore at South View High School
here, said a license-revocation law would not bother him because he
was on the honor roll, though he added that some of his friends
were worried.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Davis, a junior at Cape Fear High School, said the law was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no good at math,'' he said. ``So why should that mean I
can't drive?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, one of four states to make academic
performance a criterion for keeping a license, the first group of
students to lose their licenses, estimated at 25,000 to 30,000, is
just being notified that their grades last semester were below the
legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   That number is expected to double in the next two years. Under
the law, students under 18 lose their license if they drop out, or
if they fail to pass 70 percent of their classes.
</P>
<P>
   The law is particularly popular in small towns, where the
administrative burden is less and the loss of a car can be a
devastating blow to teen-age freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not to love about it?'' said Carol Weaver, principal of
the small Cape Hatteras High School in the Atlantic coast town of
Buxton ``When you're trying to change kids' behavior you've got to
find something they want, and we use it every day in our
disciplinary conferences. I ask them, `Do you want to drive before
you're an old man with a cane?' And they do want to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   But in larger districts around the state, school officials are
less convinced. Edwin Dunlap, executive director of the North
Carolina School Boards' Association, said many districts were
concerned about such disciplinary tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds wonderful,'' Dunlap said, ``but the devil is in the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Barnes Jr., principal of South View High School, is
hardly a role model of political dissent in his Tigers school tie
and positive-thinking cheerfulness. But Barnes gets angry when he
talks about the secretaries diverted from scholarship searches to
handle the paperwork involved in the law and the growing tension
the law is causing between students and his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's placed us in a very adversarial position with kids, which
we don't need,'' he said, estimating that about 50 of the school's
2,400 students will lose their licenses when letters go out this
month. ``It's real hard to talk to kids about how can we help them
improve when we just told them, `Give me your driver's license.'
The two don't exactly go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools must check the grades and attendance of students seeking
a license or a learning permit; check the license status of
students failing one or more courses and send out warning letters
to parents; notify the motor vehicles department on revocations,
and hear the appeals of students who might be eligible to keep
their license because of work.
</P>
<P>
   The job requires half the time of the secretary to the guidance
counselors, Barnes said, meaning she has less time to perform
scholarship searches or send transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Inveighing against the bill, The Morning Star of Wilmington
suggested in a recent editorial that perhaps legislators should
forfeit their driver's licenses if they did not stop legislating
after a reasonable period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance,'' it said, ``a few school principals
would be willing to do the paperwork.''

 &HT;    Paxson stock rises even after $137.9 million loss in '98
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paxson Communications Corp. Wednesday
said it lost $137.9 million in 1998 _ the year it launched the
family friendly PAX TV network.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, which equals $2.29 a share, was a 173 percent drop
from Paxson's profit of $188.4 million, or $3.50 a share, in 1997.
The loss surpassed Wall Street's estimate of a $2.13 a share loss,
according to Zacks research service.
</P>
<P>
   The network loss would have been greater if not for a $51.6
million pre-tax gain on the sale of television station assets
during the year.
</P>
<P>
   But traders brushed off the higher-than-expected loss, pushing
the stock (AMEX: PAX) up 19 cents to $8.31 in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury at this date and time is still out,'' said broadcast
analyst Leland Westerfield of PaineWebber in New York. ``The PAX
network has seen robust improvement in ratings off of a relatively
small base. The goal is to increase the reach of the network across
the nation and to attract national and local advertisers to the
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sagansky said, ``PAX TV's
coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic has grown 52 percent from
the network's launch through the first week of February.''
</P>
<P>
   The rating for weekday prime time, measured by Nielsen Media
Research, was 0.6 the first week after the Aug. 31 launch of PAX TV
and rose to a 1 rating by the first week of the February sweeps,
Sagansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts will get a better feel for network advertisers'
interest in PAX TV in May, when the networks present their fall
lineup in New York to potential advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings, revenue and advertiser support has improved each month
since the PAX network's debut, Sagansky said. Advertising revenue
was $134.2 million for the year, 52 percent higher than $88.4
million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Company expenses increased 144 percent to $269.7 million from
$110.4 million in 1997. Sales and administrative expenses were the
bulk of the increase, rising to $135.5 million from $44.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky also said the company has taken steps to minimize
holdings that aren't at the core of the PAX TV business, including
selling a Bridgeport, Conn., TV station for $21 million and
Paxson's interest in the Travel Channel for $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $76.4 million,
compared with a profit of $174 million in the fourth quarter of
1997, which included a $185.1 million after-tax gain on the sale of
discontinued operations.

TEXAS SENATE PANEL PASSES ABORTION BILL PACKAGE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislation giving parents more say when minors
seek abortions and imposing a three-day waiting period on all women
requesting the procedure won narrow approval from a Senate
committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour debate brought those affected on both sides to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one night since Feb. 20 has passed that there has not been
a nightmare or 2:30 a.m. scream from my daughter,'' said Veronica
Moore of Houston, speaking in favor of parental involvement bills
in the wake of her 15-year-old's recent abortion without her
consent.
</P>
<P>
   But a University of Texas student, who said she was raped and
impregnated by a co-worker last fall, suspects the abortion bill
package is designed to place roadblocks in the paths of all women
seeking abortions. She took special aim at an ``informed consent''
bill that would impose a 72-hour waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use crafty representation as an emotional scare tactic and
to assume I am not educated enough is both evil and patronizing on
the part of the state,'' said Katie Hatziavramidis, 20.
</P>
<P>
   The three bills, backed by anti-abortion activists, passed the
Senate Human Services Committee in a 3-2 vote and now head to the
full Senate. Gov. George W. Bush has said he supports parental
notification and consent bills.
</P>
<P>
   SB 30, by Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, requires that parents
be notified before daughters 17 and under can get abortions. It is
widely considered to have the best chance of becoming law. A
similar bill two years ago reportedly had ample votes to win but
was killed on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   SB 27, by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, is similar but
tougher, requiring written consent of parents. Another Nelson
proposal, Senate Bill 65, mandates ``informed consent'' for all
women seeking abortions and requires a waiting period unless an
immediate abortion is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters of parental involvement bills say 73 percent of
Texans polled favor the proposed changes, opponents point out that
75 percent of minor girls nationally voluntarily inform their
parents already. Those who don't, they argue, fear harm.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing sides _ each represented by lawyers, clergy and those
directly affected _ also argued whether parental involvement
protects or imperils the health and safety of teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Without help from their parents, young girls can bleed to death
from post-abortion complications, suffer emotional harm, early
breast cancer or fertility problems, the bills' supporters said.
Opponents warned of such dangers as illegal abortions, pointing to
high death rates in neighboring Mexico, suicide risks and harm
inflicted by parents who are abusive or incestuous.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's testimony visibly shook up the indignant Houston
mother and UT student. Both left the witness stand tearful and
trembling. They were embraced and comforted by respective forces
fighting against abortion access or for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Moore told reporters how she tried to stop her daughter when the
confronted teen-ager admitted she was en route to an abortion
clinic with her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the doctor and asked, could it be stopped? They
refused me any information,'' the mother said. ``They told me I
could not be in there with her. It was her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said her daughter has since been shattered by the
experience, breaking down when she sees mothers with babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's real delicate,'' the mother said. ``This abortion was
not her idea. It was his idea, because she has never believed in
anything dying.''
</P>
<P>
   UT student Hatziavramis was indignant as she implored the Senate
panel to consider what her fate would have been if Nelson's
``informed consent'' law was in effect.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that her disabled mother had worked around a tight
schedule of doctor's visits, pain medications and child care
arrangements to take her daughter to an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had there been a 72-hour or even 24-hour waiting period, I
would not have had access to this procedure because my mother was
the only person who supported me,'' she told the senators. ``That
is exactly what the legislation is intended to prevent _ safe and
effective access to abortion. This bill is about biased
information, not informed consent.''
</P>
<P>
   The parental involvement bills allow what Nelson calls the
``safety valve'' of a judicial bypass in which a court can waive
the requirement that a parent be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Berenson, D-Beaumont, said he plans to offer an
amendment when the bills reach the Senate floor that would allow
others, such as counselors, doctors or social workers, to waive any
requirement notifying parents.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson and fellow Democrat Mario Gallegos of Galena Park voted
against all three bills. They were outnumbered by Republican Sens.
John Carona of Dallas and Chris Harris of Arlington, joined by
Democratic Sen. Judith Zaffirini, the committee chair who declares
herself ``pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaffirini said when she polled the 31 senators last January, 21
favored parental notification and 17 were for parental consent.
While it takes a simple majority to pass a bill, it takes 21 votes
to bring a bill to the floor for debate.

SENATE REACHES CONSENSUS ON `ED FLEX' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans may, in the end, get their way in the
current education debate. They may even head into the 2000 election
cycle with education solidly on their platform, thanks in part to
legislation pending in both the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   But by Wednesday it was clear: They won't win without having
fought a bitter fight.
</P>
<P>
   After five days of intense wrangling, the Senate finally reached
a deal on how to proceed with the bill known as ``Ed Flex,'' which
would give states greater flexibility in how they spend federal
education money. The program, already being tested in 12 states,
has support in both parties, as well as the backing of 50 governors
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Wednesday, on the eve of a final vote, it still faced a
formidable opponent in Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has
maneuvered to force a debate on the topic for a week, confounding
his Republican opponents as he demanded additional initiatives he
said were ``very, very important'' to the state of education.
</P>
<P>
   The chief stumbling block has been an amendment co-sponsored by
Kennedy and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, which would force
the authorization of federal funding of 100,000 new elementary
school teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the initiative is crucial to shrinking massive
classes in overcrowded schools, and Republicans say they back the
ultimate goal. But the GOP is reluctant to confront the issue now _
and potentially cede important political ground to Democrats _
saying they had hoped to address the question later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is all meant, personally, to get someone to make
a vote against a program that could be used in a 30-second
television spot,'' said Senator George Voinovich, a Republican from
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans questioned Democratic motives, and some
accused the Democratic leaders of not wanting to give a political
success to Republicans so soon after impeachment _ at the expense
of students nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask whether the Democrats really want to give
states autonomy,'' said Joe Karpinski, a spokesman for the Senate
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which sent the
bill to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fired back. Accusing Republicans of being the ones to
cause the delay, Kennedy took to the Senate floor Wednesday
afternoon, using the debate to attack Republicans for refusing to
``meet our seven-year commitment to reduce class size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While Republicans continue to block action on critical
education issues for the sixth day in a row, communities struggle
to make decisions about their school budgets,'' Kennedy said.
``They need and expect our help.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House _ where the majority cannot be waylayed so easily
by the stubborness of a few voices _ advocates of the Ed-Flex bill
faced a far easier battle, thanks largely to the rules governing
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Senate, where it took a deal to determine the number
of amendments that will be considered, the House rules limited the
number of amendments and set a five-hour time limit on debate.
Wednesday, after two amendments were defeated, the bill was poised
to head to a final vote, which is scheduled to take place in the
House Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Diskey, director of communications for the House Education
and Workforce Committee, said the House leadership ``wants this
thing finished,'' and criticized Democrats for loading up the bill
with amendments that diminish the overall effectiveness of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about greater accountability, which means nothing
more than adding more paperwork into a bill that's supposed to
eliminate paperwork,'' Diskey said. ``Ed-Flex is a bill designed to
set up a system of waivers of reform. Every mention you hear of
accountability is to load back into the system more reporting
criteria. We are very concerned about accountability, but we feel
the governors can handle that.''

CLARK RUNS ROAD TO RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seeking instant gratification left Phillip Clark
homeless and addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He found one of his biggest aids to rehabilitation in the
grueling training for a marathon. A week after graduating from his
recovery program, Clark will participate in the L.A. Marathon on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely helping him work toward goals,'' said Carl
Williams, assistant athletic director at the Union Rescue Mission
in Los Angeles, where Clark enrolled last year. ``Losing weight,
that took a long period of time. Training, like anything else, it
takes time and this helps him realize you need to keep going to
reach your goals. Things don't just happen overnight and you can't
give up on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most definitely he'll finish. He's got that never-quit
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark familiarized himself with long-term commitments when he
began training six months ago and shed more than 60 pounds from his
once 300-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get myself back together,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the mission a year ago. Prior to his year and half on
the streets, Clark, 37, served time in a Nevada prison. He grew up
in a foster home in Cincinnati and became involved with drugs after
moving to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came and gave myself to the Lord,'' Clark said of his
decision to turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided to run, it was my way to clear my mind and keep
me focused on my goal. I like to run because it eases my mind. I
talk to the Lord when I run and it helps me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been clean for more than 10 months. He said he was
drug-free for a three-year period before but vows this time is for
good. He serves in the mission's maintenance department and hopes
to enter the facility's apprenticeship program that would put him
on track for a job in the plumbing or electrical field.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mission's employees noticed Clark's running and
started working out with him. The idea of running a marathon came
up when Williams, a marathon veteran, mentioned he was
participating in the L.A. Marathon. He encouraged Clark to join
him.
</P>
<P>
   All involved realize the significance of the race is about more
than the course's 26.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another accomplishment for him,'' said maintenance
supervisor Noah Harrison, who also trains with Clark. ``He needs
something like that. This is one of the monuments in his life that
he can look back on and say, `I did this.' It's an accomplishment
that substantiates he does have the tools to make it off the
streets and do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the gumption to do it. That's what I see in him now.
He won't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the program's other members are also participating in
the marathon, but Williams said Clark is by far the most dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most consistent person here,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's daily workout regimen includes getting up at 4 a.m. to
run seven miles and lift weights. He also rides a stationary bike
and runs another 12-13 miles in the afternoon. Clark surprised even
Williams when he was able to run for more than four hours straight
last weekend. The pair covered approximately 18 miles as they ran
from the mission to Beverly Hills and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited,'' Clark said. ``I've never done anything
like this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I was crazy, the people that first
heard about it and saw how big I was. I may finish walking, but I'm
going to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to complete the course in 4{-5 hours but admits time
isn't his top priority. Those who know him believe Clark is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you really know how tough it is until you
actually get there,'' Williams said. ``When you get to the halfway
point, the three-quarter mark, that's when your body starts giving
up on you and it becomes mental. You have to tell yourself, `If I
have to crawl across the line, I'll finish.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that mental toughness. He will definitely make it.''

FTC TO EXAMINE EXXON, MOBIL REFINERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission will take a close look
at refinery operations of Mobil and Exxon on the Texas Gulf Coast
as it considers whether to approve an $80 billion merger of the two
oil giants, a top agency official told Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, director of the FTC Bureau of Competition, also
said that the agency will look at the effect.MDNM/ of the merger _
the largest ever _ on competition at the pump in the Gulf Coast
area, California and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``vitally important for nearly all of this country east of
the Mississippi to maintain a competitive Gulf Coast refining
market,'' Baer told a House panel that is examining the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation's principal refining market, the Gulf Coast, not
only supplies that immediate area, but also sends substantial
amounts of gasoline by pipeline to the Southeast, the Northeast and
the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer made his comments during the first of two days of hearings
conducted by the House Commerce Committee's energy and power
subcommittee, headed by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   The merger requires .MDBR/the .MDNM/approval of the Federal
Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
regulators in Europe, where there are also concerns about the two
companies' share of refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon agreed in December to acquire Mobil, combining the two
biggest U.S. oil companies and reuniting two of the largest pieces
left from the 1911 government breakup of John D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil empire.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that the combined company would have
to sell .MDBU/service .MDNM/stations and divest refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil's refinery at Beaumont, with 1,200 employees, is its
biggest domestic refiner, processing 315,000 barrels .MDBR/of oil
.MDNM/a day. At .MDNM/Baytown, Exxon's refinery, with 4,200
employees, processes 427,000 barrels a.MDNM/ day.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the companies would have about 18 percent of Gulf
Coast refining capacity. Antitrust experts say that market share
may not be high enough to require the FTC to order Mobil or Exxon
to sell a refinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two companies that combined to have 18 percent of the market
is not enough to worry about,'' said Tyler Baker, an antitrust
expert at the Dallas law firm Carrington, Coleman, Sloman &AMP;
Blumenthal. ``The FTC would have to come up with some other
explanation. They may be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hakes, an administrator at the Energy Information
Administration, told the panel that Mobil-Exxon's Gulf Coast
capacity would be comparable to that of BP-Amoco in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the combined production capacity would be
dwarfed by that of state-owned oil companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, state-owned oil companies represented the world's top
six producers,'' Barton said. ``Exxon ranked No. 7 and Mobil was
down to No. 18.''
</P>
<P>
   But prices at the pump are at the heart of consumer concerns,
and the FTC will also examine its effect.MDNM/ there, Baer said. He
said that the commission forced the sale of gasoline stations in
past oil industry mergers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre joins more than 179,000 men in the United
States who will be found to have prostate cancer this year,
according to estimates by the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   New cases of prostate cancer have risen dramatically in recent
years with the widespread use of a test to detect prostate-specific
antigen. The test, first introduced in 1985, is recommended
annually for men over 50 and measures the level of this substance
in the blood and may indicate the presence of a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has swirled around the use of the prostate-specific
antigen test because in some men prostate cancer is not an
aggressive disease and would never become a clinical problem before
they die. But in many others the test has proved to be a lifesaver
that picked up potentially deadly cancers before they caused
symptoms and while they could still be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates from prostate cancer have been declining
significantly, at a rate of 1.6 percent a year in the early 1990s.
This year an estimated 37,000 men will die from the disease, making
it the second-leading cause of cancer death in men.
</P>
<P>
   The leading cause, lung cancer, will claim about 90,000 lives
among American men this year.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-fourths of men who have prostate cancer are over
65. The risk is highest among American blacks and those with a
family history of the disease. Suspected risk factors include
cigarette smoking and a diet high in fat. Recent studies have
singled out lycopene, a substance in cooked tomatoes, as a possible
protector against this disease.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective treatment for prostate cancer depends on the
stage of the disease and how aggressive the cancer is believed to
be. The three leading treatments are radical surgery to remove the
prostate and surrounding tissue (which can cause impotence and
incontinence), external radiation therapy and implantation of
radioactive seeds. Men are also often treated with hormone therapy
in conjunction with other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 1,872 men with localized prostate cancer published
last September in the Journal of the American Medical Association
showed that those with cancers rated a high risk for spreading
beyond the prostate did best if treated with radical surgery. Their
survival rate exceeded that of those who got radioactive implants,
even if the implant group also got hormone therapy.
</P>
<P>
   For those at intermediate risk, radioactive implants plus
hormone therapy proved as effective as radical surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A second study published in the same journal suggested that a
conservative approach to treatment may be appropriate in some
cases. Of 767 men with localized prostate cancer, those with
cancers considered a low risk faced only a 4 percent to 7 percent
chance of dying from their disease within the next 15 years when
either no treatment was given or only hormonal therapy was used.
However, those with high-risk disease faced as much as a 60 percent
to 87 percent chance of dying when similarly treated.
</P>
<P>
   But experts warn against acting on these findings since
definitive results of studies that are weighing radical surgery
against such ``watchful waiting'' are still years off.  &QL;

against such ``watchful waiting'' are still years off.  &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Predicting the fishing success of the opening day
of salmon season in Southern California is a difficult prospect,
and this year is no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' said Bruce Williams, proprietor of Port Hueneme
Sportfishing, ``we'll know by Saturday whether or not they're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for anglers trying to get an edge on the
competition, that's not much help; Saturday IS opening day.
</P>
<P>
   At least the water temperatures are more favorable than last
year for catching the cold-water-loving denizens. The Santa Barbara
Channel is registering 58 degrees; salmon prefer temperatures in
the low to middle 50s. During last year's salmon opener, the same
waters were as high as 61 or 62 _ 3 to 4 degrees higher than normal
for late winter due to residual effects of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Since salmon are swimming from the north, it's advantageous to
fish upcoast. And if you don't already have a reservation on a
charter out of Avila Beach or Morro Bay, a landing in Santa Barbara
and Ventura county might be your next best bet.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of landings with charters targeting salmon on
Saturday:

ALEXANDER BACK IN THE PRESIDENTIAL FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ Emphasizing his commitment to fix public
education, Lamar Alexander kicked off his Granite State campaign
for president Wednesday at the Derry Village School, promising to
send Washington bureaucrats home and direct money to the states and
the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of what a child needs to succeed in this world
he or she learns best in a strong family and a good school,'' said
Alexander, the former Secretary of Education under President Bush.
``That is why I will be a president on the side of parents raising
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Alexander's second official day on the campaign
trail was overshadowed by Elizabeth Dole's announcement in Iowa
that she is setting up a presidential exploratory committee. Both
Dole, the former head of the American Red Cross, and Texas Governor
George W. Bush, who has also set up a committee, have encroached on
Alexander's moderate Republican turf in recent weeks with their
moves into the presidential arena.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander said he has an advantage over the large Republican
field. ``I have the most experience on the most important issue _
education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he said he would not cede the race to anybody,
regardless of their last name. The recent attention to Bush and
Dole, he said, is simply the Republican Party and the country
reaching for the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, nominations can't be inherited and they can't
be bought,'' Alexander said. ``They must be earned, and that is
what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander also said he had learned a few things since his run
for president in 1996. Back then, Bob Dole peppered him with attack
ads in the final days of the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get hammered again, I'm going to defend myself,'' he
vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander spoke to about a hundred people in the gymnasium of
the public elementary school with a massive American flag at his
back and patriotic marching music setting the mood.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Alexander said he would lead a movement to
transform the public schools by paying good teachers more money and
by ending teacher tenure ``so no child is made to be in a classroom
with an incompetent teacher.'' He also touted scholarships to help
families pay to send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad accompanied Alexander
Wednesday night and recalled the days when they both served in the
National Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first governor of all the governors to focus on
improving education,'' said Branstad, who is Alexander's campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Besides improving education, Alexander said he wants to increase
family incomes by lowering taxes and maintaining Social Security,
and he said he wants to strengthen the national defense.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his criticism of President Clinton, Alexander said
the nation needs a president ``who talks straight _ and listens.''
The strong economy, he said, masks serious problems, including a
high school graduation rate that is lower than 12 other countries,
higher taxes, more federal regulations and a weaker national
defense.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought to
defend U.S. policy toward China on Tuesday in the face of concerted
Republican attacks on the Clinton administration's handling of
suspicions that China stole nuclear technology from the Los Alamos
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, testifying before a House panel less than a week after
visiting China, said that China's theft of nuclear secrets from the
lab was a ``very serious issue'' that the CIA was assessing. But
she argued that it should not dominate efforts to remain engaged
with Beijing on a variety of issues from human rights to trade
policy, which the administration is trying to negotiate separately.
</P>
<P>
   Leading congressional Republicans were unswayed by that
argument, as they have been from the start, and instead went on the
attack, accusing the administration of not taking the theft
seriously enough at first and then of not adequately briefing
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Trent Lott of Mississippi,
the majority leader, demanded better explanations from Congress.
The uproar, inevitably, bled into the political arena, with two
presidential hopefuls, Patrick Buchanan and Steve Forbes, each
accusing President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, of ``dereliction of duty,'' and demanding that he resign
for failing to keep Congress adequately informed about the theft.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says it briefed lawmakers beginning in 1996
on suspicions that China had acquired important nuclear
bomb-building technology from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied stealing nuclear secrets from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, traveling with the President in Guatemala City Tuesday,
defended his actions. ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he
said. ``The actions that we took as a government when we learned of
this alleged espionage which took place in the 80's I believe were
appropriate, I believe were in the national interest, and I believe
we acted swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lugar, one of the most influential Senate Republicans on
foreign policy, urged Clinton ``to give the American people a
damage assessment'' and to review the administration's China policy
before the Chinese prime minister visits here next month, when he
is expected to push for entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar sought to add the espionage case to the growing list of
Republican complaints about Clinton's China policy, which include
charges that the administration had been too soft on Chinese human
rights violations, had allowed American aerospace companies to
transfer missile technology to Beijing and had accepted improper
campaign contibutions from Chinese donors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration already had dug a very deep hole
for itself on Capitol Hill with respect to China,'' Lugar wrote in
an Op-Ed article on Wednesday in the Washington Post. ``That hole
just got deeper and wider.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., proposed an amendment to an emergency
aid bill for Central American storm victims that would require
Congress to take a direct vote on whether the United States should
approve China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Currently,
that is the prerogative of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress will indirectly be voting on any effort to get
China into the trade organization. Its entry would require an
amendment of the law that enables Congress to vote each year on
granting China what is commonly known as most-favored-nation
trading status.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization, established in 1995 and with 132
members, governs international trade and mediates disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And Lott endorsed a plan for the Armed Services Committee to
hear testimony from the Republican and Democratic authors of a
classified bipartisan House report that concluded China obtained
some of the most sensitive American military technology. The two
lawmakers are Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers and the White House cannot agree on how much of
the report to make public and in what form. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against this angry backdrop, Albright and two other Cabinet
members, Commerce Secretary William Daley and Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, mounted a coordinated defense Tuesday of the
administration's handling of the case.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under sharp questioning from the House Appropriations
subcommittee that controls the State Department's funding, Albright
stressed the importance to the United States of engaging China,
even in light of the spy charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important for us to engage with a country of 1.3
billion people that has a huge land mass, and that has an influence
within its region, and that is also a permanent member of the
Security Council,'' Albright said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better off talking with them, dealing with them,''
Albright continued. ``We have made some progress in terms of their
cooperation on nuclear proliferation on rogue countries. They're
not supplying things to unsafeguarded facilities.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright also noted that China was important to the
administration as it tries to ``sort out what's going on in North
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   And she noted that during the Cold War, Washington continued to
engage with countries, like the Soviet Union, that spied on the
United States.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter moment that underscored China's importance as a
vast consumer of American products, Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa,
reminded Albright that China was important to Midwestern farmers
because ``they can also use a lot of Iowa corn and soybeans.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I, in fact, talked about that when I was there,'' the
secretary said, drawing laughs from the panel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans were not in the bantering mood about China.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lugar, in his Op-Ed piece and in a separate interview, said that
the disclosure that China had made an important leap in
miniaturizing its long-range nuclear weapons with the help of
stolen American technology, should force the administration and
Congress to reassess whether rogue states armed with nuclear
weapons posed a greater threat to national security than long-time
nuclear powers such as Russia and China.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to express concern about what I think may be a
change in the strategic danger to the United States,'' Lugar said
in an interview.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smelling political blood, the two Republican presidential
candidates who depend on the party's hard-line conservatives for
support excoriated the administration. ``The allegations
surrounding the transfer of atomic secrets to a potential enemy are
the most serious since the Rosenbergs went to the electric chair in
1953,'' Buchanan told a news conference in Sioux City, Iowa. Forbes
said in a statement, ``No amount of Clinton-Gore spin can cover up
the disaster of our relationship with China, a relationship based
on drift, dithering and abject appeasement.''  &QL;

FOUNDATION TO BANKROLL REBEL'S PICTURE BOOK DROPPED BY NEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ohio)  (js) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A foundation said Wednesday that it would provide
the money to replace a federal grant that was canceled when the
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts learned that it was
for a children's book written by a Mexican guerrilla leader.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the foundation, J. Patrick Lannan Jr., said it
would give $15,000 to subsidize the printing of an English
translation of a Spanish book by the rebel leader, Subcomandante
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the arts endowment, William Ivey, canceled the
grant on Tuesday when told of it by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he was worried that some of the endowment money might
find its way to the Zapatista guerrillas in Chiapas. Marcos is
their political mastermind and military strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, the Cinco Puntos Press of El Paso, said it would
not receive any of the money. A co-owner, Bobby Byrd, said Marcos
had declared that he did not believe in copyright and had formally
waived his rights to income from the book.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the foundation, named for a late Chicago executive, J.
Patrick Lannan, gave $35,000 to the Washington Project for the Arts
so that it could exhibit homoerotic photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe in a show that the Corcoran Museum of Art in
Washington had canceled. Like the Marcos book, the Corcoran
exhibition had received some of its money from the arts endowment.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, ``The Story of Color,'' has nothing to do with the
Chiapas rebellion. It is a folk tale about Mexican gods who took a
gray world and filled it with brilliant color.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the endowment, Cherie Simon, said Wednesday
that the rejection was the only one in Ivey's first year as
chairman and that he had approved 1,500 others.
</P>
<P>
   One panelist who approved the grant for the book, Winter
Prosapio, defended the panel's decision. ``When we publish works
that are translations, we are going to have dissident voices,
voices that are not politically correct,'' Ms. Prosapio said from
her office near Austin, Texas ``Clearly, we felt that it was
worthwhile. None of us had any notion that by doing this that we
were supporting armed rebellion. It's still my view, perhaps even
more so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prosapio said she understood Ivey's cancellation, because
``the NEA has come under criticism for this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But she stood with the panel's decision. ``I think our
kindergartens are safe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who has defended the endowment from
attempts by other Republicans to kill it, said Ivey had done
``exactly the right thing in stopping the grant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That book isn't appropriate for American children,'' Regula
said.
</P>
<P>
   He heads the House subcommittee that approves spending for the
arts endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the endowment should finance things that people
would find offensive,'' Regula said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those people, he said, were congressional opponents of the
agency, and he said, ``There's no use putting your finger in
people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has piqued interest in the book. Cinco Puntos said
it received so many inquiries Wednesday that it told its
distributor to send out the 5,000 copies that had been printed
instead of waiting for the publication date in May. The books on
sale bear the logo of the arts endowment.

KC STAR SERIES ABOUT FEDERAL JUDGES WINS POLK AWARD FOR LEGAL
REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Joe Stephens of The Kansas City Star has won
the 1998 George Polk award for legal reporting for ``On their
honor,'' a series of stories about conflicts of interest among
federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which ran in April 1998, showed that some federal
judges _ two-thirds of the judges in Kansas City courthouses alone
_ had presided over cases in which they owned an interest in one of
the litigants. The series led to congressional hearings and broad
reform by the federal judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, 39, will accept the award in April in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second Polk for Stephens, who won the 1994 political
reporting award for stories about riverboat casinos, political
connections and the role played by then-Missouri Speaker of the
House Bob Griffin in obtaining state gaming licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The judges series also recently won the Burton W. Marvin Kansas
News Enterprise Award, named for the first dean of the William
Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Communications at the
University of Kansas. Stephens accepted the award last month at KU.
</P>
<P>
   The Polk awards were established in 1949 to honor a CBS reporter
who was killed while covering the Greek civil war. They are
conferred by Long Island University and are considered among the
most prestigious honors in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Other 1998 Polk winners:
</P>
<P>
   Economic reporting _ Mary Jordan, Keith Richburg and Kevin
Sullivan of The Washington Post for ``Shattered Lives,'' a series
about the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental reporting _ Gardiner Harris and R.G. Dunlop of the
Louisville Courier-Journal for stories about the deaths of 1,500
coal miners each year from black lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reporting _ Tracy Wilkinson, Los Angeles Times, for
dispatches about ethnic Albanians' armed struggle for independence
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   International reporting _ Alix M. Freedman, The Wall Street
Journal, for ``Population Bomb,'' which led to the ban of a
carcinogenic sterility drug manufactured in the United States and
distributed in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Local reporting _ Clifford J. Levy, The New York Times, for
documenting instances of unethical political contributions in
stories that sparked federal criminal investigations of state
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Medical reporting _ Robert Whitaker and Dolores Kong, The Boston
Globe, for ``Doing Harm: Research on the Mentally Ill,'' which
exposed harmful experiments conducted on mental patients.
</P>
<P>
   National reporting _ Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, Time
magazine, for reports showing that taxpayer incentives to
corporations rarely pay off.
</P>
<P>

Tomorrow We Will be Killed with Our Families: Stories from
Rwanda,'' an account of genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Career award _ Russell Baker, author and retired New York Times
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Commentary _ Juan Gonzalez, New York Daily News, for columns
challenging myths about people of color and describing the effects
of unequal distribution of wealth in urban America.
</P>
<P>
   Radio reporting _ Amy Goodman and Jeremy Scahill, Democracy
Now//Pacifica Radio, for ``Drilling and Killing: Chevron and
Nigeria's Oil Dictatorship,'' which reported that the company's use
of the military to protect its interests led to the death of two
environmental activists.

PRAECIS GETS AMGEN FUNDS FOR WORK ON PROSTATE DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Praecis Pharmaceuticals Inc. has received a $100 million
commitment to complete development of a drug to treat prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The funding for the Cambridge, Mass. company will come from
Amgen Inc., the world's biggest biotechnology firm, which is
anxious to develop the drug, called Abarelix, and bring it to
market in the next several years. The injectable medication is now
being tested nationwide in a pivotal 500-patient Phase III clinical
trial, according to Malcolm Gefter, president and founder of
Praecis.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is the largest development deal for a
Massachusetts biotech company with a single drug in more than 15
months. It comes amid growing concerns that some young biotech
companies are running out of cash at a time when venture capital
and Wall Street are investing in more lucrative areas such as
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, biotech funding comes at the early stages of a drug's
development. The Abarelix deal stands out because Amgen is
providing extensive financial backing in the final stage of the
testing required for US Food and Drug Administration approval.
Gefter said he expects Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and
Praecis will seek FDA permission to market the drug in about 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Amgen will market Abarelix in North America
and Asia. More than two years ago, Praecis sold many of the foreign
rights to Abarelix for $80 million to Synthelabo SA, France's
third-largest pharmaceutical company, which will market it in
Europe, South America, and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to a group of companies who were interested in
Abarelix, but it became clear to us very quickly that Amgen was
culturally the best fit because of their aggressive pursuit and
commitment to develop meaningful drugs,'' said Gefter, a former
professor of immunology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Gefter left MIT to form ImmunoGen before starting
Praecis nearly five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Abarelix would compete with Zeneca PLC's Zoladex
and Lupron, a treatment marketed by TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. _ a
joint venture of Abbott Laboratories and Takeda Chemical
Industries. Those two products had 1998 US sales of $950 million,
according to Hambrecht &AMP; Quist analyst Alex Zisson.

   Prostate cancer affects nearly 180,000 men annually and is
expected to cause 37,000 deaths this year. A major portion of the
diagnosed cases are in late stages, which often require surgery and
result in sterility. The slow-growing cancer is stimulated by
testosterone, and Abarelix is designed to reduce testosterone
levels without requiring surgery, Gefter said.
</P>
<P>
   Praecis, a 90-person company that has raised $90 million in
venture capital and private investment, has recently begun testing
Abarelix on women with endometriosis, a painful condition resulting
from abnormal growth of the lining of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abarelix represents an exciting opportunity for Amgen to
leverage our success with Neupogen (which stimulates white blood
cell growth) in the oncology area and to establish a strong
presence in urology and gynecology,'' Gordon Binder, Amgen chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal follows a failed partnership between Praecis
and New Jersey-based Hoffman-LaRoche that ended last year over
Abarelix, said Gefter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, which has climbed steadily since the
completion of a stock split last month, closed Wednesday at 70 1/2,
up 3 1/16.

COMPANY BEGINS INQUIRY INTO DEFECTIVE PARTS FOR WATER HEATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perfection Corp., the company that produced defective ``dip
tube'' plastic pipes for water heaters, has launched an in-house
investigation into how widespread the problem may be and whether
more should be done to publicize it.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection said it was reviewing its earlier estimate that only
about 15,000 water heaters made from 1993 to 1996 were affected by
dip tubes that failed prematurely _ a problem that can make the
heaters ineffective and clog other plumbing with plastic chips from
the deteriorated tubes.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, 24 million water heaters were sold, and more
than 90 percent had Perfection's dip tubes, which are designed to
funnel cold water to the bottom of the water heater's tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're intensely investigating the situation,'' said William
Mertens, an attorney for a Washington law firm that is representing
Perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company is looking at whether more should be
done to publicize the defect. Critics have said the lack of a
recall or notification program has played down the extent of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it took several months for Randy Nicola of Olathe,
Kan., to get his water heater problem fixed. He was told by the
water heater manufacturer that his problem was sediment in the
heater's tank. He paid for four visits by a plumber trying to fix
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nicola read a story in January in The Kansas City Star
about the dip-tube problem. He called the maker of his heater and
eventually got a new dip tube, and the manufacturer agreed to pay
for some of the installation costs and for flushing the plumbing to
get rid of plastic chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of a waiting game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection's in-house inquiry comes as legal maneuvers continue
to unfold against Perfection and the water-heater companies. Two
class-action suits in Missouri and Kansas, filed in January and
naming Perfection and two water-heater companies, have been
expanded to include all the leading water-heater companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Phalen, an attorney for the Independence, Mo., law firm
that filed the lawsuits, said another class-action suit would be
filed this week in Michigan, and another was planned to be filed in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is progressing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate move, a Birmingham, Mich., law firm filed a
class-action lawsuit last week in a Michigan state court naming
Perfection and several water-heater companies as defendants, said
Tim Arnold, an attorney for the law firm Ishbia &AMP; Gagleard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Michigan attorney general's office is looking
into whether it should launch a formal investigation. Among the
issues is whether state consumer protection laws might have been
broken because those responsible for fixing the problem reduced
their exposure by doing little to publicize it, said John
Szczubelek, a Michigan assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at it,'' he said. ``There are a lot of people
out there having a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Missouri attorney general's office said no
investigation was being contemplated at this time. At least one
Missouri resident, Steve Miller of Belton, said he had tried to
file a state complaint but was told it was a national problem.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Kansas attorney general's office said the
state would look into the issue but was waiting on paperwork from
one consumer who allegedly had a defective water heater.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection and the water-heater companies said they were intent
on fixing the problem. Perfection has been reimbursing the
water-heater companies for repairs. Its analysis of the magnitude
of the problem has been based in part on the number of repairs that
have been reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, say critics, is that more consumers would have
complained had they known about the defect. Joe Gagnon, the host of
a weekend radio program in Detroit about appliances and their
repair, said the low-key approach had hidden the dip-tube problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since publicizing the problem in January, Gagnon said, he has
received more than 700 calls and letters from people who say they
have water heaters with defective dip tubes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, plumbers reported receiving hundreds of
calls after The Star's story appeared. Nationally, manufacturers
such as Bradford White said they were seeing increases in calls
from consumers who believe they have the problem.

NEWS ANALYSIS: WITH DAIMLER TALKS OFF, NISSAN HAS TO LOOK ELSEWHERE
FOR RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Germany, France, Japan)  (See also DAIMLER-NISSAN) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Once again, the future of Japan's second-largest car
maker, Nissan Motor Co., is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday by DaimlerChrysler AG that it was
walking away from negotiations about acquiring a controlling stake
in Nissan and in its equally troubled truck-making affiliate,
Nissan Diesel, ended one topic of speculation and debate only to
renew another: What will happen to Nissan?
</P>
<P>
   With known debts of more than $20 billion, declining sales in
two of its three main markets, a cost structure that is high even
by Japanese standards and uncertain plans for fixing its problems,
the outlook is grim.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan had little comment Wednesday night. ``It's true, our
negotiations about a tie-up with DaimlerChrysler have ended,'' said
Masataka Saito, a spokesman. ``Other negotiations about potential
tie-ups are continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault SA, the French car company, has said it was talking with
Nissan, but those discussions were believed to be far less advanced
than the ones with DaimlerChrysler had been. Analysts consider a
deal between Nissan and Renault a long shot because of Renault's
relatively small size and its balance sheet, which, while much
improved, still bears a high level of debt.
</P>
<P>
   At the Geneva Motor Show, Renault's chairman, Louis Schweitzer,
said the company was proceeding with an in-depth study of its
options related to Nissan, although he cautioned that the hurdles
were high.
</P>
<P>
   Those hurdles _ Nissan's debts and its very traditional Japanese
management _ are what are believed to have stymied a deal with
DaimlerChrysler. ``I'm telling my clients that this deal broke down
because it could not get over the hurdles posed by the debt and by
the issue of control,'' said Peter Boardman, an auto analyst at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Boardman said, however, that DaimlerChrysler's exit did not
throw Nissan into any more of a crisis than it already faced.
``Nissan has many good qualities _ its engineering, its assets _
and it has positive cash flow, so it's not facing a crunch,'' he
said. Nissan already has established a $4.1 billion standby line of
credit with a group of 10 banks to help survive hard times.
</P>
<P>
   But many, including two former company executives, say that
Nissan is in a financial squeeze. Its banks, led by the Industrial
Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, are not sound enough themselves to
lend it more money, and so it has kept itself alive by issuing
large sums of short-term commercial paper, which is bought by the
Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effectively,'' one analyst at an investment company said,
``it's moot to talk about a government bailout of Nissan because
the government is already bailing it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also has provided about $7 billion in credit to
Nissan through the Japan Development Bank, whose traditional role
has been lending for capital investment. That generosity has been
compared to the United States government's 1979 bailout of the
Chrysler Corp., which consisted of loan guarantees that gave the
company access to the money it needed to turn itself around.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan does have a revamping plan in place that pledges it to
slice 1 trillion yen of its 4.3 trillion yen in debt, including
liabilities related to auto financing, by next year. The company
has been selling assets, including its Ginza headquarters, a piece
of its textile machinery business and stakes in an advertising
agency and a printing company, but that is bringing in money at a
very slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently hired J.P. Morgan to advise it on
revamping, and the pace seems to be picking up. The Japanese press
reported Wednesday that Nissan was likely to sell its stakes in
nine cellular telephone companies, which could bring in several
billion yen, and it wrote off a small portion of its investment in
Nissan Diesel Sales Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Asset sales are necessary, analysts say, but Nissan has not
really tackled its cost structure. ``The end of the discussions
with DaimlerChrysler means they have got to get serious about
restructuring and that means cutting their costs,'' said
Christopher Redl, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting costs, however, inevitably will involve cutting jobs,
which is more of a taboo at Nissan, perhaps, than at other Japanese
companies these days. Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, and
many members of his board came up the ranks through the personnel
and human resources departments and are likely to be less disposed
to reducing the work force than their counterparts at other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The government, too, is concerned about Nissan's headcount, but
for other reasons than the investment community is. Including its
suppliers and affiliates and other related entities, most of which
are beholden to the parent company, Nissan employs nearly 200,000
people. Were the company to go under, some economists estimate that
Japan's unemployment rate, already at record levels, would jump by
one-tenth of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   One subtle prop the government might consider is encouraging
Nissan's banks, which are trying to clean up their balance sheets
at the government's behest, to forgo some portion of the car
company's debts in exchange for promises that they would be made
whole later or that such an action would not impede their own
revampings.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the government is constrained in what it can do.
Nissan's woes have received more coverage than the problems of
other corporate giants here, but there are Nissans in just about
every capital-intensive, labor-laden industry _ shipbuilding,
steel, chemicals _ in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Were the government to ``save'' Nissan, it might set a precedent
it would regret.

CHARGES OF MEDICARE FRAUD DISMISSED AGAINST TWO LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Eliciting cheers and tears from relatives
and associates, a federal judge on Tuesday acquitted two lawyers of
charges in a major Medicare fraud case.
</P>
<P>
   The case is of particular interest to the legal and health-care
community because Ruth Lehr and Mark R. Thompson, both specialists
in health-care law, were the first lawyers in the country to have
been charged in a Medicare fraud case as a result of their legal
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
government...no reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable
doubt that defendants Lehr and Thompson willfully committed any of
the criminal acts charged,'' U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum
ruled at the close of the government's evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge discharged the lawyers, Thompson grasped Lehr's
hand and exclaimed, ``Ruth, we got what we deserved _ finally!''
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a round of hugging, involving the defendants,
their attorneys, and friends and relatives. The jury was not in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Lungstrum said that during a period of changing federal law and
regulations, Lehr and Thompson attempted to properly advise
executives of Baptist Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo., on the
do's and don'ts of legal relationships with physician brothers
Robert LaHue and Ronald LaHue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with three former Baptist executives and the two lawyers,
the LaHues were charged with conspiring between 1984 and 1995 to
solicit and receive more than $2 million in kickbacks in return for
the LaHues' referral of Medicare patients. The government contends
that the defendants attempted to disguise the payments as
consulting fees, and that Thompson and Lehr knowingly drew up sham
consulting agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The case also has generated national attention because it is
among the earliest trials brought about by the federal government's
attempts to attack medical fraud. Because of that crackdown, legal
experts say, the defense of doctors and administrators in fraud
cases nationwide has become one of the fastest-growing aspects of
the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Lungstrum stripped away some counts against the
hospital executives _ Dan Anderson, former Baptist president;
Ronald Keel, former Baptist vice president; and Dennis McClatchey,
a senior vice president on paid leave from Health Midwest,
Baptist's parent. The dismissed counts alleged that the three
executives had conspired to solicit payments from other hospitals
besides Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Charges involving other hospitals stand only against the LaHues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trial, Lungstrum severed two other counts from
the current trial, which began Jan. 25. One count alleged that the
LaHues had filed Medicare reimbursement claims for services not
provided. The other charged Robert LaHue with witness-tampering.
The LaHues are to be tried later on those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr and Thompson and their attorneys said Tuesday that they
would not have any public comment until the jury returned its
verdicts at the close of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. attorney Tanya Treadway, the lead prosecutor,
also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the jubilant observers were Thompson's parents, Clyde and
Nan Thompson of Denver, who have attended the trial regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Thompson, an oil and gas lawyer, said it had come as a
``shock'' when his son was indicted. The elder Thompson said his
son ``never should have been in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of the defendants' case was delayed until this morning
because a juror had a family emergency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. German, who represents McClatchey, said the acquittal
of Lehr and Thompson could bolster the hospital executives'
defense. The executives contend they were following their
attorneys' advice when they signed consulting and other agreements
with the LaHues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert LaHue owned Blue Valley Medical Group and operated it
with Ronald LaHue, a former Leawood, Kan., councilman. Blue Valley
provided medical services to about 7,000 patients in 200 nursing
homes in Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that $150,000 a year that Baptist paid
the LaHues in consulting fees amounted to nothing more than illegal
payments for the LaHues' referral of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively little of the government's case related to Lehr, a
solo practitioner, and Thompson, a partner in the Kansas City, Mo.,
firm of Seigfreid, Bingham, Levy, Selzer &AMP; Gee.
</P>
<P>
   The defense contended that the lawyers' advice was based on the
information they were given and that they were not responsible for
monitoring how that advice was used.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence generally indicated that the lawyers repeatedly
warned Baptist that it must receive fair market value in any
dealings with the LaHues and Blue Valley; otherwise, the hospital
would leave itself open to charges of Medicare fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also warned that any consulting services that the
LaHues provided needed to be documented.

CMGI SEEKING HIGHER BIDS FOR LYCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lycos Inc.'s largest shareholder said it has begun
talks with companies that could potentially outbid USA Networks
Inc. for control of the Waltham Internet search engine firm.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative merger deal for Lycos could be announced ``within
several days,'' said Bill White, marketing manager of CMGI Inc. of
Andover, the venture capital firm that owns about 20 percent of
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Lycos announced plans to merge with major operations
of USA Networks, a New York television and electronic commerce
company. However, after Lycos shares plunged because of investor
dissatisfaction with the terms of the deal, CMGI openly turned
against the deal earlier this week and said it would pursue other
suitors for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, CMGI's maneuvering helped boost Lycos shares 14
percent as investors hoped the company would either renegotiate the
terms with USA Networks or attract another bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, CMGI might make an offer itself for the roughly
80 percent of Lycos it doesn't already own, said White.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., which was hired by CMGI
recently to pursue options for Lycos, is now looking for other
merger partners for Lycos and could have an alternative deal in
place within days, said White.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI declined to name the companies with whom it is holding
talks, but White said they include firms with which Lycos
previously met to discuss mergers.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry watchers, that list includes Time Warner
Inc., CBS Corp., General Electric Co.'s NBC broadcast unit, and
Bertelsmann, a German media firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shares rose 13 3/4 to close at 110.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was announced Feb. 9, Lycos shares reached 137,
but fell to as low as 83 7/8 on Monday as traders expressed concern
the combination values Lycos far more cheaply than other Internet
companies involved in recent mergers.
</P>
<P>
   As a Lycos board member and one of its earliest investors, CMGI
chief executive David Wetherell initially supported the proposal
but backed away after the shares plunged. On Tuesday, he resigned
from Lycos' board, a move he said freed him to work with investment
bankers to assemble a more attractive offer for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   However, some Wall Street analysts say the proposed combination
with USA Networks does have long-term strategic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' plan is to merge with USA Networks' units, including the
Home Shopping Network television network; its related Internet
Shopping Network; Ticketmaster, which sells tickets to public
events; and Ticketmaster Online-City Search.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the merger say it would combine USA Networks'
established commercial services with Lycos' electronic commerce
potential.
</P>
<P>
   To them, CMGI's statements against the deal seemed
self-fulfilling, aimed at boosting Lycos's shares closer to their
original levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a practical standpoint, the degree to which he
(Wetherell) gets the stock to go up means whatever else he does is
moot,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson
Stephens who supports the planned merger.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber Inc. analyst Jim Preissler described Wetherell's
actions as ``jawboning.'' ``Even if nothing really happens, he's
been effective,'' Preissler said.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Lycos said the company would consider any
counteroffer CMGI might arrange. But these people also think it
unlikely CMGI would be able to assemble an offer more attractive
than the one from USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Others said CMGI might still rally enough other disaffected
investors to prevent Lycos from obtaining shareholder approval of
the deal. CS First Boston analyst Lise Buyer wrote earlier this
week that she believes the odds of the deal being completed on its
original terms ``are now well less than 50/50.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusually public disagreement between CMGI's Wetherell and
Lycos chief executive Bob Davis over the proposed merger centers on
their differing views of how to harvest the potential from an
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Davis said he remains committed to
the terms of the agreement with USA Networks and said that the pact
prohibits him from pursuing other merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a separate agreement announced by Lycos Wednesday to
deliver health care information through its joint venture with USA
Networks only reinforces the benefits of the proposed merger, Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the latest agreement, Lycos will receive $52 million over
three years from WebMD, a closely-held provider of health care
information based in Atlanta. Lycos will distribute WebMD's
information both on line and through its partnership with USA
Networks, and Davis said the payments are among the highest fees
ever received by an Internet firm for content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do these types of transactions because, with the USA
agreement, we can provide a cross-media platform that no other
media company can,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in CMGI fell 2 3/4 to close at 191 11/16 in Nasdaq
trading.

NABISCO NOW SEEN AS A HOT TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also RJR-NABISCO-JAPAN) 
(mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The breakup of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. that was announced on
Tuesday may have satisfied a good many shareholders who had lobbied
for such a change for years. But more fireworks may be in store for
the separate companies that will be created by RJR's decision to
abandon its 14-year effort to run food and tobacco operations under
the same corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts and industry experts think a contest could
erupt over Nabisco, the cookie-and-cracker giant that is mostly
held by RJR and is now renamed Nabisco Group Holdings. Many expect
Philip Morris Cos. to make a run at Nabisco, and some also mention
Pepsico, which made its first foray outside the soft-drink and
snack aisles in July when it spent $3.3 billion to acquire
Tropicana.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think that Philip Morris, which bought General
Foods in 1985 _ the same year that R.J. Reynolds Industries bought
Nabisco Brands Inc. _ and Kraft Foods in 1988, needs to expand its
portfolio of food products. Those now range from Jell-O to frozen
pizza to shredded wheat, a product that was acquired from Nabisco a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In both tobacco and food, Philip Morris has enjoyed more success
than RJR, dominating the domestic and international cigarette
markets. Though both RJR and Philip Morris face expensive
settlements stemming from lawsuits filed by smokers and state
attorneys general, Philip Morris has continued a healthy cash flow
and enjoyed a more manageable debt load than RJR, which labored
mightily to reduce the $30 billion in debt it inherited after a
hotly contested leveraged buyout in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But Philip Morris has gaps in food. Although its Kraft unit
sells chocolate and other confectionery products abroad, for
example, it does not have a niche in the United States in snack
food, cookies or crackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft is very large, but it is conspicuously absent from that
very important biscuit category,'' said Jaine Mehring, an analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney. Kraft's sales are about $27 billion,
compared with $8 billion for Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco recently won new affection from Wall Street as sales
rose for the first time in many months. And the spinoff of RJR's
domestic tobacco business, combined with the sale of its
international tobacco operations, leaves Nabisco essentially alone
and, some say, an attractive target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't speculate on what will happen in the future, but
clearly, this new structure makes a sale a possibility,'' said Nomi
Ghez, a food analyst for Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The president and chief executive of Nabisco, James Kilts, who
joined the company a little more than a year ago, used to run
Kraft. ``I'm sure his dream transaction would be to see a union
between his old love and his current love,'' Ms. Mehring said.
``And by the way, maybe he'd get to run the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Where such a deal becomes complicated, Ms. Mehring added, is in
the way it would be handled. An all-cash deal is possible, she
said. Nabisco's valuation is thought to be $17 billion. But if
Philip Morris did a stock swap, some might object because Nabisco
would then be back inside a tobacco company. One way around that
might be to spin off Kraft and then use shares of Kraft instead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If you ask Jim Kilts why he left Kraft, it's not that he
didn't like the organization,'' Ms. Mehring said. ``He said he
wanted to be the CEO of a publicly traded company. If you believe
that, then in going to Nabisco he must have thought, in his heart
of hearts, that there was a chance that Nabisco offered some bigger
potential for him ultimately.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Philip Morris said the company would not comment
on speculation about any takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, the other possible suitor for Nabisco, might also
benefit from expanding its snack-food line to include the brands in
Nabisco's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a perfect marriage of sweet and salty snacks,''
Ms. Mehring said. And the two parties might be compatible in terms
of their business systems, too, she added. ``The only company with
a bigger direct-store delivery system than Nabisco's is Pepsi,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's rationale for the Tropicana purchase might apply to
Nabisco, too, although a spokesman for Pepsico refused to comment
Wednesday. Pepsico's chairman, Roger Enrico, said at the time that
Tropicana was a great brand that Pepsi could put to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fits in with what we want to be, a company of big brands
staying within the beverage and snack business,'' Enrico said at
the time.

THANKS FOR 20 GREAT YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On the eve of the 20th anniversary of my
column's debut in this corner of the newspaper, today's effort is
offered as an expression of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 11, 1979, when the first column appeared. This one
is the 3,425th.
</P>
<P>
   Its origins were in the mid-1970s at a newspaper in Dayton,
Ohio, but this is where the column evolved into a career calling.
Kansas City became home not only because the welcome was warm, but
also because The Kansas City Star was the culmination of a nearly
20-year quest to make it to the big leagues of newspaper
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of newsies are lucky enough to make the bigs early in
their careers. Not me. It took 18-plus years of seasoning in the
minors before the big break finally came. For a guy who never
wanted to be anything other than a newspaperman, the wait was worth
every single day of it. The Star was hallowed newspaper ground, and
this was a town so rich in history that songs celebrated its very
being.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 1979 was the worst and best of times to start
a new job as a business journalist in a storied city. If you're old
enough to remember, you may recall '79 as the final year of a
dreadful decade.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't know it then, but the worst was yet to come. Events
were converging that would result in a three-year national
nightmare of hyperinflation, stratospheric interest rates and the
most wretched economy since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The critical development of 1979 was both the source of most of
the country's subsequent pain and its ultimate economic salvation.
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker dropped a bombshell in early
October by announcing a radical monetary policy change. Instead of
trying to keep interest rates stable, the Fed would henceforth
concentrate on controlling money supply growth while allowing
interest rates to go wherever the market took them.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it was one of the most momentous policy decisions
in U.S. history. The medicine was akin to giving a cancer patient a
near-fatal dose of chemotherapy because risking death to destroy
the malignancy offered the best chance to save the patient. Before
this struggle to wring hyperinflation out of the system ended, the
interest banks charged their most creditworthy borrowers topped 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were occasions, though, when quoted rates were meaningless
because loans were unavailable at any price. The misery began to
subside in late 1982, about the time many Americans had despaired
of things ever getting better.
</P>
<P>
   An economic miracle then sprang from the wreckage. Since 1983
only one shallow recession in 1990-91 has marred an unprecedented
expansion. Tens of millions of new jobs have been created,
inflation appears tamed, and rising incomes and technological
progress have combined to boost the U.S. standard of living to
unprecedented heights. Meanwhile, the Kansas City area has shared
fully in this era of national prosperity and appears positioned to
reap the bounty of more good times to come.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't part of my plan to make Kansas City home back in '79,
but this has since become the longest stop in this life's journey.
So, thanks again for the good times, Kansas City. You're the
greatest.

 &HT;    Lawmakers: Bad service by airlines doesn't fly
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like angry passengers crowded around the ticket
counter during a delay, politicians are giving airlines a piece of
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration on Wednesday unveiled a plan to
ensure fair customer treatment and raise penalties for bad service,
adding to ``passenger rights'' bills in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the measures are driven by sensational but
rare anecdotes that obscure its good overall record.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) called the White
House plan a ``one-way ticket to higher airfares.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal doubles the cap on required compensation for lost
baggage to $2,500. It also doubles maximum compensation for
involuntary ``bumping'' to $800.
</P>
<P>
   The plan subjects airlines to fines if they fail to notify
passengers of flight delays as soon as possible. It requires them
to provide food and restroom facilities during lengthy delays and
disclose more detailed service policies.
</P>
<P>
   It's intended to ``put passengers first and make airline travel
a much more pleasurable experience for everyone consistently,''
Vice President Al Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced the measure on the same day the House
Transportation Committee opened hearings on a bill by Chairman Bud
Shuster (R-Pa.). It requires compensation for runway delays of more
than two hours _ a byproduct of the much-publicized snowstorm
fiasco in which packed Northwest Airlines planes sat for hours on
runways in Detroit, with no food or working toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a Senate committee begins hearings on a bill by John
McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to make all tickets
refundable for 48 hours after purchase. It also stops airlines from
penalizing fliers who use ticketing loopholes to save money, and it
requires more disclosure about frequent flier award redeemability.
</P>
<P>
   The bills come after years of rising passenger loads and crowded
airports, which have restored airline profits but strained the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been building for a few years,'' said travel expert
Ed Perkins, a consultant to the American Society of Travel Agents.
``A few recent incidents have pushed it over the top and now we're
hearing the 'I'm mad as hell and not going to take it any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins predicted that not all changes will be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, among other carriers, has
wrestled with service problems but contends most have been solved.
A spokesman declined to comment Wednesday, referring questions to
the Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
   An ATA spokesman noted U.S. airlines carried 611 million
passengers last year and only 7,994 filed complaints with the
government, although that doesn't include complaints made directly
to airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Travel Coalition, which includes some corporations,
said government action should be aimed at boosting competition
rather than policing service.

UCLA POINT GUARD ALMOST ALL BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When UCLA's Erica Gomez signs autographs, she
never looks at the seeker.
</P>
<P>
   When she's inbounding the ball and young girls shout her name,
she doesn't look at them, causing her to be labeled arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   She often leaves Pauley Pavilion via a back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Arizona game (last week), I came out,'' she said.
``People said, `I've been waiting for you since your first home
game.' I feel kind of bad, but at the moment, I want to go home and
take a shower and be by myself. All that attention can be
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even teammates say when one first meets her, her body language
says to stay away. They say Gomez's face is expressionless, like
she's ``numb to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the game, I'd rather be more focused on the game than
what's going on around me,'' she said. ``You have to be an athlete
to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez has led the Bruins to their second straight NCAA
Tournament berth _ they host Wisconsin-Green Bay Saturday at 9 p.m.
_ and their first Pac-10 women's basketball title.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez had to deal with attention early. In high school in New
Jersey, young girls wrote her letters seeking autographs and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``She found it fun,'' said her father Larry. ``She would answer
every single one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She found it difficult, though, when crowds stuck papers in her
face for her to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Her public, basketball life is well chronicled. Gomez was a high
school preseason Parade All-American, and one scouting service
listed her among the country's top 35 players. She led three St.
John Vianney High teams to New Jersey state titles.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, Gomez was Pac-10 Freshman of the Year and a Basketball
Times freshman All-American. After redshirting her second year
because of a knee injury, she returned last season and led the
Bruins to second place in the Pac-10, which earned her Women's
Basketball News Service's Comeback Player of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Gomez broke Ann Meyers' 20-year-old career assist
record. She has 555, 11 more than Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the key to our success,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier
said. ``For her to break the assist record in three years tells you
how important she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gomez is rarely seen at campus events. Most of her teammates
live in apartments that are walking distance from school. She lives
alone near the marina and prefers to stay at home, relaxing,
studying, spending time with her boyfriend or cooking Puerto Rican
food.
</P>
<P>
   When she makes an appearance, as she did for the men's game
against Syracuse, it's big news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `Oh my God, you're here. We never see you
around,' '' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates know of a different side to her, however. Once
Gomez warms up _ and she says it doesn't take long _ ``Once I start
talking, I'll talk forever'' _ she becomes the team's big
instigator.
</P>
<P>
   Example: During the Bruins' trip to Washington in late February,
Gomez set up team wrestling matches, pitting the 6-foot-4 Janae
Hubbard against the 5-9 Michelle Greco.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the Don King,'' teammate Marie Philman said. ``Erica was
the first one to say, `In my room, 7 o'clock!' She wants to make
sure we're all wrestling. She'll push you into someone to start
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was chanting. I was ranting, `Fight! Fight! Fight!' '' Gomez
said. ``I even did the part when the guy goes, `Ladies and
gentlemen! In this corner . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez says she strives for balance in her life, which explains
the tattoo on her ankle _ the Chinese dualistic symbols yin and
yang.

FREE AGENTS   IN CELTICS' FUTURE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You will love the Celtics of tomorrow. The 21st
century/Y2K version of the team in shamrocked shorts will defend.
It will be mature. It will be one of the top squads in the Eastern
Conference. It will not inspire its head coach to curse when he is
asked, ``How's your team doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make the playoffs next season,'' Celtics coach Rick
Pitino said Wednesday. ``Come July 1, I'm going to make the changes
_ the right changes _ it takes for us to be a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA fans know July 1 marks the beginning of the free agency
period. They also know that when a coach starts talking about the
year ahead, that usually means there isn't much joy with the year
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Charlotte game was probably the low point for me in 25
years of coaching,'' Pitino said of his team's 105-87 loss to the
battered Hornets Tuesday night. ``Our team is not doing well at
all. We can't guard the low post. We don't guard screens well. We
have five different players who can't guard anyone. You should see
the way we're grading out for these games. I have never had a team
grade out so low. We were in the 70s for the Miami game (a 108-101
win). Lately, we've been in the 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   So, to be clear, fans probably shouldn't plan to see any Celtics
playoff games at the FleetCenter in May?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly optimistic about the playoffs this year,''
Pitino said after a 90-minute practice at Georgia Tech. ``I'm not
overly pessimistic, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was asked if his team's problems are correctable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but we're going to need weeks and weeks and weeks of
practice to correct them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Celtics don't have weeks of practice in this
50-game season. Based on their open dates the rest of the season,
they could have a maximum of 22 practices. But that number is
deceiving, because it doesn't account for any days off between now
and May 5. There are also two open dates following
three-games-in-three-nights stretches in April. The players
couldn't possibly practice after a schedule like that. So Pitino
knows that he has somewhere between 12 and 15 practices remaining.
He also knows some changes will have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   One change can be with the personnel he has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could turn it around if guys went out on the floor every
night and put their lives on the line defensively,'' he said. ``But
I don't see that; there's a lot of living going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bowen put some critical body parts on the line during the
Hornets game. He looked like a wide receiver being tackled on the
sideline when he chased after a loose ball, was upended by David
Wesley, and wound up spread-eagled against press row. Many people
were amazed to see the 6-foot-7-inch forward get up and continue
playing. Bowen is not the only one playing good defense. Pitino
knows that guard Greg Minor wouldn't mind being traded but, ``I
like the way he's playing right now. He's doing his job under tough
circumstances for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the loss to the Hornets, some players talked of having a
players-only meeting. Walter McCarty said Wednesday that the
meeting didn't happen, mostly because the team realized that it
would be better off playing than talking. But there was some
talking going on Wednesday, on two levels.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Pitino chatting with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that I'm old fashioned,'' he said. ``What do they
say now, old school? I'm old school. I believe in defense and
moving the ball. Two things young players struggle with are defense
and shot selection. That's one reason Pat Riley has a phobia of
players 26 and under.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Pitino and Chris Wallace talking to personnel men
around the NBA. Thursday is the trading deadline. It was pointed
out to Pitino that, given his team's chemistry problems, a trade
would seem to be the last thing the Celtics needed. Bring in a new
player with no time to practice and you're asking for additional
problems, aren't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``But any trade we made would be for next year, not this one,''
he said. Pitino said he is not actively seeking to make a trade,
but it is the Celtics' obligation to listen to other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to stay on an even keel,'' he said. ``If we need to
make changes, we'll make them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about July 1, not March 11.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce, who sprained his right ankle against Charlotte,
said that he probably will not play Thursday night against the
Hawks. ``But at least I'm walking,'' he said. He may not play
Friday against the Pistons, either . . . Chuck Person basically
called Antoine Walker a selfish player after Tuesday's game, saying
he had a ``bad'' 32 points. Pitino was asked about that. ``In
Antoine's mind, he probably thinks he has to take a lot of shots
for us to win. And he's probably right,'' Pitino said. ``I don't
have a problem with that, as long as they are the right shots. He
shoots his highest percentage when he goes to the basket or when he
posts up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Joe Girardi sat silently at the front of a
New York Yankees' team bus this morning, an island among teammates
who cheerfully anticipated the return of Darryl Strawberry in a
spring training game Wednesday afternoon against the Red Sox. This
was supposed to be a good day.
</P>
<P>
   But Girardi wondered how he would tell teammates the words Joe
Torre had just asked him to relay _ that Torre, who managed the
Yankees to World Series championships twice in his first three
seasons with the team, has been given a diagnosis of prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Torre told others in the organization Wednesday that his doctors
believed they had detected the cancer in its early stages, and he
underwent further diagnostic tests Wednesday that will help
determine the course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees announced that Torre will leave the team for an
unspecified period _ perhaps only a week or two if moderate
treatment is required, perhaps three to four weeks or more if
surgery is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine,'' the 58-year-old Torre said in a statement
released by the Yankees Wednesday, ``and am looking forward to
taking care of this problem and getting back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, told
reporters this afternoon that Wednesday's test results were
encouraging. ``We might see Joe in the next two to three weeks,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Torre will come out of this like a champion,'' he said as
he waited at the team's complex in Tampa for Yankees players to
return from their two out-of-town exhibition games Wednesday so he
could speak to them about their manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not named a temporary replacement for Torre,
and officials within the organization are hopeful he can continue
as manager this season. His coaching staff will collaborate on the
day-to-day workings of spring training. But if Torre is forced to
miss days or weeks of the regular season, Don Zimmer, the Yankees'
bench coach, now in his 51st year in the game, is expected to take
over.
</P>
<P>
   So as Strawberry went 1 for 4 in his first game since the
discovery last October that he has colon cancer, the mortality of
mankind once again was apparent in the Yankees' family.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's brother, Frank, required a heart transplant during the
1996 World Series. A week ago, Hall of Fame pitcher Jim (Catfish)
Hunter, stricken with the terminal illness named after former
Yankees star Lou Gehrig, arrived here to be with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the legendary Joe DiMaggio passed away at age 84
after a fight against lung cancer and pneumonia. And Torre learned
late Tuesday night that a biopsy confirmed he has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is second only to skin cancer as the most common
type of cancer found in American men, according to the American
Cancer Society. Cancer of the prostate, a male sex gland located
just below the bladder and in front of the rectum, is found most
often in men older than 50, and 8 out of its 10 cancer patients are
older than 65. The three leading treatments are surgery, external
radiation therapy and implantation of radioactive seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was tested for prostate abnormalities during spring
training in 1998 and apparently was given a clean bill of health;
Torre did not require follow-up tests through last season. He had
another prostate-specific antigen test last month, as part of the
club's annual spring training physical examination, and the results
alarmed doctors. At some point, Torre had a biopsy, and for about a
week he waited for word from the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The father of four children, including 3-year-old Andrea Rae,
Torre left exhibition games in the middle innings on Monday and
Tuesday. He told reporters he felt sick and was suffering from
flu-like symptoms, and suggested that maybe he had caught a bug
from his mother-in-law. In fact, he was distracted, worried about
the impending biopsy results, others in the organization say.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the cancer Tuesday night, Torre told
Steinbrenner, and at some point called Bob Watson, the team's
former general manager. Watson had surgery for prostate cancer in
1994, before joining the Yankees and sharing in the 1996 title. Now
we have something else in common, Torre said to Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Players had noticed a change in Torre's demeanor in recent days:
Usually upbeat, Torre had become quiet and reserved, and they all
learned why this morning. Torre informed his coaches of the
diagnosis at the Yankees' complex before two squads of players
departed for exhibitions here and in Bradenton against the Pirates.
He asked Girardi and the outfielder Paul O'Neill into his office
separately, and requested they tell the players of his condition
once they reached their respective destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi said he told Torre, ``Joe, our prayers are going to be
with you and we're going to do everything we can to be right
alongside you, and you tell me what you need and we're here for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had no indication of it whatsoever,'' O'Neill said,
expressing hope that that meant the cancer had been caught at an
early stage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Girardi told the players once they arrived here; O'Neill told
the other players when they reached Bradenton. His teammates were
quiet, sad, Girardi said, almost too accustomed to these sort of
meetings now. ``After what happened to Straw,'' said Tino Martinez,
``you're ready for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chambliss, who managed the Yankees' squad here Wednesday,
spoke to reporters after Girardi did and mentioned that although
any form of cancer is bad for the body, prostate cancer is one of
the more treatable forms. The players seemed to hang on these
words. ``From what I understand, he's going to be all right,''
Derek Jeter said, three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee players are so intense and dedicated that for a few
days or weeks, they could probably manage themselves. But it was
clear Wednesday how much they would miss Torre if he couldn't
manage for a substantial period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a tremendous leader for us,'' said Girardi. ``He's
just really in tune with what this club needs and when it needs it
and why it needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just as big as any player on this team,'' said Martinez.
``We need him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre became manager of the Yankees prior to the 1996 season,
and as Steinbrenner is fond of pointing out to reporters, he was
not, at first, a popular choice in the media or among fans. But the
Yankees responded to Torre's leadership _ in tense situations, he
seems to become more calm, and his team played this way _ and they
won the American League East and then came back from two games down
to beat Atlanta in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, a native of Brooklyn, was New York's favorite son, and he
somehow managed to forge a strong relationship with Steinbrenner,
calling the owner whenever he sensed Steinbrenner was angry about
something. The Yankees suffered a disappointing loss to Cleveland
in the 1997 playoffs, but set an all-time record with 125 victories
in 1998, with a team known for its togetherness. They all came
together like family after Strawberry was diagnosed with colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Torre did not expect Strawberry to play until the final days of
spring training, and the manager's speculation to that effect
seemed to spur Strawberry: His personal trainer flew in from
California to join Strawberry, and the slugger accelerated his
workouts. On Monday, Strawberry met with Torre and suggested he
felt good enough to serve as designated hitter, and Torre _ masking
fears of his own at the time _ said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry batted four times Wednesday, striking out on a
breaking ball from Boston's Pedro Martinez in his first at-bat,
grounding to first in his second at-bat, blooping a single over
third base and then popping up in the eighth inning. He swung
ferociously, and did not move well; he needs to strengthen his
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Playing again was fun, Strawberry said afterward. ``I feel like
I'm a part of it again,'' he said. ``I can't tell exactly where my
swing is yet, until I start playing a few games.''
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry's joy was sapped by the words Girardi relayed to
the roomful of Yankees here this morning. ``It's a very sad day,''
said Strawberry. ``I really knew I couldn't be as motivated as I
wanted to, knowing Joe's situation. It touches your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As it touched others. ``He's a guy who played the game,'' said
Jeter. ``He knows what it's like to succeed, what it's like to
fail. He's a players' manager and everybody loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves Joe,'' said Girardi, ``because Joe treats us
the way we want to be treated.'' &QL;

MARKET PLACE: A HALF-STEP FOR DUPONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paving the way for possible future acquisitions,
DuPont Corp. is taking a half-step to separate its giant chemical
business from its pharmaceutical, agricultural chemicals and other
so-called life sciences products.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spin off life sciences as a stand-alone company,
DuPont said Wednesday that it planned to issue a new stock that
would track the performance of that fast-growing business, which
accounted for $4.3 billion of DuPont's $24.8 billion in total sales
last year. The company also confirmed reports that it is seeking an
alliance with a drug concern, but did not identify which one.
</P>
<P>
   A tracking stock _ also called lettered stock or targeted stock
_ allows investors to bet on the performance of one part of a
company. But ownership of a tracking stock does not represent
ownership of the underlying assets, as common stock does.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont will continue to run the life sciences company, own all
its assets, be responsible for its debt _ and, of course, share in
its growth. It is simply creating a company with two income
statements and one balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tracking stock will trade separately from that of
DuPont, shareholders _ and potential merger partners _ will be able
to tie their futures more directly to the ups and downs of the
turbulent but fast-growing life sciences market. And they will
benefit from DuPont's deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets life sciences benefit from the exceptional credit
strength of one strong company,'' said Peter Vermylen, an
investment banker at Salomon Smith Barney, which along with Credit
Suisse First Boston advised DuPont on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but is it good for shareholders? Or does it lull them into
thinking that they are investing in life sciences when, in fact, a
big, bureaucratic chemical company is still making the decisions?
Do they realize they have little recourse _ since they don't own
the assets _ if the company falls into financial trouble?
</P>
<P>
   And if tracking stocks are such a great idea, why don't more
companies do them? General Motors, US West, USX,
Tele-Communications Inc. and a few other big companies have tried
them, to mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   A tracking stock did not help USX realize much value out of its
Delphi pipeline. AT&AMP;T backed off a plan to create a tracking stock
for its consumer business in January after determining that its
businesses were too closely entwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tracking stock is simply a way to rip off future
investors,'' said Bruce Greenwald, a finance professor at Columbia
University. ``DuPont knows this market is putting crazy valuations
on tech stocks, and this tracking stock is just a way for it to get
dumb investors to overpay for part of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, which has long expressed interest in expanding in life
sciences, is not rushing matters. The company said it would
register the new stock offering late this year, and seek
shareholder approval after that to issue the new shares as a
dividend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By then, many potential merger partners that it intends to court
with its new ``life sciences stock'' may have already found mates.
``The band is playing, everyone's on the dance floor, they'd better
hurry up if they don't want to be left out of deals,'' said Jeffrey
Cianci, a portfolio manager at Jesup Capital, which owns DuPont
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Clinton administration's proposed budget for 2000
includes a provision to tax the issuance of tracking stock as
though it were a sale of assets. It is by no means guaranteed to
pass, but if it did, the tax implications could be horrendous. In
fact, tax liabilities that would be caused by a spinoff are often
cited by companies opting to create a tracking stock instead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DuPont's announcement garnered more kudos than pans. Its
shares soared $3.8125 Wednesday, closing at $57.375.
</P>
<P>
   ``DuPont is a textbook case of how tracking stocks can be used
in a positive way,'' said Robert Willens, a tax analyst at Lehman
Brothers who helped design USX's tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Ravitz, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, noted that if
DuPont shareholders did not like the tracking stock, ``they can
sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont's move may at least ease some shareholder pressure for
the company to split in two. DuPont has long insisted that its
chemical and life sciences business feed off each other's
technology and that the life sciences business needs access to the
cash and credit rating of the less exciting but more stable
chemical operations.
</P>
<P>
   But DuPont was a chemical company long before it was a life
sciences company, and old images die hard on Wall Street. Its stock
generally trades at about 18 times earnings; life sciences
companies, many of which have been growing 30 percent a year, trade
at 30 to 50 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That has made it hard for DuPont, which has been on the
acquisition trail, to persuade life sciences companies to hook
their stock up with its own. ``The tracking stock makes it a lot
easier for them to use their equity as currency in deals,'' said
Frank Mitsch, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, DuPont is said to be deep in talks with Monsanto Co.
about a possible merger, and DuPont reiterated Wednesday that it
seeks an alliance with a pharmaceuticals company. Many European
drug analysts say that Zeneca Inc. of Britain is looking to spin
off its agricultural business and that DuPont would be a logical
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the alliances that DuPont chooses are the real
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracking stocks merely track the underlying business,'' said
Jeffrey Sechrest, a principal at Evercore Partners, a merchant
banking firm. ``They can't make it better or worse.''

<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Sitting in the front row directly
across from President Clinton as he addressed the National Assembly
of El Salvador on Wednesday was Nidia Diaz, a former guerrilla
commander who is still barred from the United States for her role
in an attack that killed four American Marines here in 1985, during
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the same row, a few seats to her right, sat Schafik Handal,
who led the El Salvadoran Communist Party and one of the five
factions of the former guerrilla movement. Interspersed in the
audience of legislators were scores of other former leftist rebels
whom the United States tried to crush in the 1980s through its
support of the El Salvadoran armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they stood in business suits to give an American
president a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, reacting after Clinton's address with remarks devoid of
rancor, the legislative leadership of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, now the largest opposition party, seemed to hold
just one grudge, that the United States has not invested in the
peace the billions of dollars that it put into the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States gave $400 million one year, an average of
more than $1 million a day, to crush the guerrillas,'' said Gerson
Martinez, a former guerrilla leader who is now first vice president
of the Assembly and on Wednesday shook Clinton's hand. ``If today's
investment were equivalent to that of the war, El Salvador would be
the most developed country in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   El Salvador, a poor country of 5.8 million people that became a
Cold War battleground where 70,000 people died, was an American
foreign policy obsession until 1992, when peace accords ended the
12-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, on the third stop of a four-day trip to survey the
damage to the region caused by Hurricane Mitch in October, Clinton
noted that the ideological battlefield had been transformed into
``a marketplace of ideas'' and acknowledged the election Sunday of
Francisco Flores of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena,
as president. Flores was at the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But side by side with the right-wing Arena deputies were 27
legislators from the leftist FMNL, which controls the second
largest bloc in the 84-member unicameral legislature and a large
number of mayoral posts, including the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to both sides, Clinton recognized that the American
role in the Salvadoran war had caused ``deep divisions'' in the
United States, too, and said the past should be remembered so that
it is not repeated. ``I hope the people of Central America see the
United States in a new way, as a partner, a friend,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were targets of American intervention and who
fault the United States for helping prolong the war, the friendship
was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we, as a legal political party, say, `I'm
resentful`?'' asked Dr. Violeta Menjivar, 47, a physician who said
she had joined the guerrillas after the National Guard had killed
an older brother and who lost six nephews in the war. ``It hurts me
to think of my dead, and I'll never forget them, but that doesn't
paralyze me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diaz, the former rebel commander who still goes by her nom
de guerre, said Clinton represented ``a new administration that is
part of the historic justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of the front said they regarded the United States
as much a part of the problem as of the solution, for eventually
seeing the need for a negotiated settlement and supporting the
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Diaz, 46, vice-presidential candidate of the front, can
enter the United States only with special permits for specific
events. She said she was blamed for having ``psychologically
motivated'' the attack, but insisted that she had nothing to do
with it, noting that she had been imprisoned before the attack
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't harbor any hate,'' she said. ``Many Americans
supported me when I was wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The cordiality is understandable, said Martinez, whose
decorations in his office include what he said were framed
scribbles from President John F. Kennedy given to him as a gift.
The 42-year-old legislator, who had joined the rebellion at 14,
said there were always mixed feelings about Americans in the
revolutionary ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go to Chalatenango and see FMLN combatants listening
to rock or blues on the radio,'' Martinez said. ``There was never
xenophobia or chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be indifferent if a third part of the country lives
in the United States, if Central America needs help after the war
and Hurricane Mitch, if we're all interested in a new age of
commercial relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The single most widespread preoccupation for Salvadorans today
is the precarious status of Salvadorans who live illegally in the
United States and send money back to their families here. As
American aid dropped, now at $34 million a year, so-called
remittances grew, to $1.2 billion a year, becoming the largest
source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to do ``anything I can possibly can'' to end
inequalities in deporting Central Americans.

Gore unveils plan to help airline passengers 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to complaints from air travelers, Vice
President Al Gore unveiled a passengers' bill of rights Wednesday
that would require airlines to be more responsive to customers on
everything from ticketing to lost baggage and flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater announced new
rules and proposed legislation designed to give passengers more
timely flight information even as a House panel heard testimony
about airline ``horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are launching a brand new initiative to put passengers
first and make airline traveling a much more pleasant experience
for everyone consistently,'' Gore said at the White House event.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 2000, is seizing on a popular issue of making
carriers accountable, just as legislation pushed by GOP lawmakers
gains momentum.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, criticized the Gore
plan as costly and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new regulations represent a one-way ticket to higher air
fares,'' Armey said. ``Low air fares are giving more people than
ever access to affordable travel. ... The last time I checked,
federal bureaucrats aren't experts at finding lost bags or speeding
up flight delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton administration's proposed legislation,
airlines would have to disclose their flight cancellation policies,
return lost baggage within 24 hours and give passengers 48 hours
after making a reservation to purchase a ticket, rather than
requiring instant payment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also double to $800 the amount of
compensation offered to ``bumped'' passengers and double to $2,500
the payment for mishandled baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Transportation Department regulation that took effect
Wednesday, airlines must tell travelers what carrier they will be
flying under ``code-sharing'' arrangements that enable an airline
to sell a ticket on one of its partner carriers. The innovative
arrangements expanded travel options but also confused travelers,
federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department also required carriers Wednesday
to tell passengers if they will have to change planes on a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The administration package follows on the heels of efforts in
the House and Senate to respond with legislation that grew out of
outrage over the treatment of passengers in Detroit during an early
January snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, members of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee's aviation subcommittee heard from some of
those passengers, many of whom were trapped on runways for eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struck a raw nerve here,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster,
R-Pa., chairman of the House committee who introduced his own
passenger bill of rights legislation Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce and
Transportation Committee, has also introduced similar legislation
and will hold a hearing Thursday about the rights of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled airline industry responded through its trade
association, the Air Transport Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the frustrations passengers experience from time
to time with weather and other factors,'' ATA President Carol
Hallett said in testimony she is to give before the Senate panel
Thursday. ``The airlines share some of those same frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallett said carriers would voluntarily provide more information
to the public and emphasized that ``satisfied customers are the
heart of our industry.''

<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Movie theater owners need to treat their theater
lobbies as if they were ``a one-hour vacation (spot),'' theater
consultants said Wednesday at the owners' annual convention, even
if that means bringing in bookstores and coffeehouses that might
compete with the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you capture time, you capture market share. People spend
money where they spend their time,'' consultant Kevin Roche said.
``Essentially, you're not in the industry of film distribution, but
of capturing shares of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche was one of several movie theater developers and planners
who spoke at a panel discussion Wednesday on the future of movie
theaters during the ShoWest convention in Las Vegas. The weeklong
event attracts thousands of theater owners and officials, plus
companies, including movie studio honchos and stars, trying to sell
their products to theater owners.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and other panelists stressed that the most formidable
rival to theaters has become a multifaceted destination like a
Borders bookstore with an in-store Starbucks coffeehouse. ``The
bookstore-restaurant has become a family destination for Friday
evenings and they stay open until midnight,'' Roche said. ``Malls
don't get it but Starbucks does.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Poulous, an architect with the firm that designed
Universal City's CityWalk, said theater owners need to encapsulate
their movie houses in centers that have a variety of entertainment
options. ``What people need is a sense of discovery as they move,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The message to theater owners did not meet universal approval,
given that the idea of combining with other retailers is far more
complicated than simply opening a stand-alone complex. But
panelists agreed that the competition for their customers'
attention makes it essential for operators to find new ways to
attract patrons.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the latest attention-getter, an executive with
Sony Corp.'s Loews Cineplex described the massive Metreon
entertainment complex opening in San Francisco this June. The
complex will include a 15-screen megaplex, an Imax theater, the
world's first Microsoft store, a Discovery Channel store and three
theme park-like attractions. ``We see people coming for six to
eight hours of entertainment per visit,'' said Ted Shugrue,
president of Loews Cineplex International.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's theaters that drive the business because they bring in
the right type of people,'' Shugrue said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Voelker, an AMC Entertainment executive vice president,
said his company hopes its Times Square project will ``become the
icon of Hollywood on the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The complex, to be built on seven floors of the 90-year-old
Empire Theater, will include a 450-room hotel, two rooftop
terraces, restaurants, bars and retail stores, and 25 theaters.

 Column: Boom in Online Media Stocks Raises All Kinds of
Ethical  Questions  By Dan Fost  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When the media mixes with money, funny things can happen.
</P>
<P>
   That's why most news organizations prohibit reporters and
editors from owning stock in companies they cover.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when journalists own stock in the company they
work for? And that stock represents a huge part of their current or
future fortune? And their stock's performance depends not so much
on earnings, but on market hype?
</P>
<P>
   The boom in online media stocks, which has turned many underpaid
journalists into paper millionaires, has raised all kinds of
ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were debated at a conference on online
journalism at the University of California at Berkeley Graduate
School of Journalism yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a roomful of millionaire reporters whose stake
is linked to the stock market, how can they cover the stock market?
How can they cover Internet stocks?'' asked Kara Swisher, who
covers the Internet for the Wall Street Journal. ``Newsrooms are
getting giddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Swisher said online writers are ``not the best journalists'' but
instead are ``linkalists,'' whose stories are basically links to
other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lewis, who writes for the New York Times Magazine and
the New Republic, noted his own blown opportunity to get in on the
ground floor of TheStreet.com. In 1996, founders Martin Peretz and
James Cramer offered him a 2.5 percent stake in TheStreet.com, with
an option to buy another 2.5 percent, in exchange for a weekly
column. He turned it down, choosing the Times instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the Times paid $15 million for a 7.5 percent stake in
TheStreet.com, Lewis said ``that implied a $5 (million) to $10
million value'' for the stock he turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of earning a ``modest sum'' from the Times, a
publication with 4 million readers, Lewis said he could be worth
millions of dollars working for a publication with 30,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   A few people in the crowd stood up to defend TheStreet.com,
including one reporter for the site. He said TheStreet does not
allow its reporters to own stocks. However, co-founder and star
columnist Cramer runs an investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA11 (90036 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The reporter said the New York Times business coverage is not as
good as the rest of its coverage and that TheStreet could give it a
leg up.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, who didn't give his name, then said he shouldn't
even be talking because TheStreet is in a ``quiet period'' before
an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' response: ``I'm trying to get my mind around the idea of
a journalist in a quiet period.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MULTIMEDIA: &LR;  CBS MarketWatch doesn't have a print version, but
the financial news service exists in just about every other medium.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the San Francisco company, which already has a Web
site and reports for CBS television news, inked a deal to broadcast
short daily radio spots in 27 markets. Most of them are in smaller
cities, except for one big fish: 1010 WINS, the New York City
all-news station.
</P>
<P>
   ``WINS is the one we really wanted,'' MarketWatch chief
executive Larry Kramer said. Three WINS financial reporters at the
New York Stock Exchange will now report for all of MarketWatch's
various outlets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer still hasn't wiped the smile off his face since
MarketWatch.com raised $47.5 million in an initial public offering
in January. And why should he?
</P>
<P>
   That money has not only bought him a glass-top desk for his
corner office in the KPIX-TV building at Battery Street and
Broadway. It's also allowed him to expand his staff from 60 to 80
this year and expand bureaus in Los Angeles, Washington, New York
and London. Plans are in the works for a Tokyo bureau.
</P>
<P>
   With $800 million in market value, the company's stock is
valuable currency to make acquisitions. He's already in
negotiations with smaller content providers.
</P>
<P>
   How does he view his East Coast rival TheStreet.com? They've got
``half our revenue, and (almost) twice our losses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POURNELLE BYTES BACK: &LR;  After more than 20 years writing reviews
in Byte magazine, Jerry Pournelle was left without much of a
platform when Byte folded last year.
</P>
<P>
   CMP Media, &UR;  &LR; which bought the venerable computer trade
publication from McGraw-Hill, kept it going as a Web site only.
Pournelle kept writing his columns for foreign-language Byte sites
in Turkey, Bulgaria and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MEDIA11 (90036 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  This week, Byte rehired its legendary writer to put his column _
in English _ on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Pournelle, who lives in Studio City (Los Angeles County), is in
his late 60s. He refers to himself as ``Doctor'' after earning _
but never using _ a Ph.D in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was the first person to write a book using a
computer. He said the computer now resides in the Smithsonian, but
he can't recall the name of the sci-fi novel.
</P>
<P>
   Pournelle explained his writing: &UR;  &LR; ``You could subtitle my
column, `I do all these stupid things so my readers don't have to.'
I have probably run more bad software and more bad hardware than
any other human being on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRESSING DEADLINES: &LR;  Get ready for the stealth Web site.
</P>
<P>
   New York high tech PR man Don Middleberg, in town this week for
the Alley to the Valley conference, said many companies still
haven't realized how important the Web is in communicating with the
press, particularly in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Middleberg has helped one Midwestern pharmaceutical firm set up
a ``stealth'' Web site. ``It's not launched, but it can be ... if
and when there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The company already has a Web site, but if a disaster strikes,
the company would activate the second site, which would have more
detailed information about the company, its products, photos and
media contacts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``When big news breaks, consumers go to CNN; journalists go to
Web sites,'' he said.

 Citigroup Fans the Flames of Credit Card War  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A marketing war heated up in the credit card industry yesterday
when MasterCard named a Citigroup official to its board _ a month
after two representatives of the largest U.S. bank quit the board
of Visa.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard International said it had nominated Citigroup
consumer lending chief Robert Willumstad as a director. Citigroup
hadn't been represented on MasterCard's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard said it is also shrinking its board from 31 to 17
members to make it easier to govern.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination follows a dispute between Citigroup and Visa over
the credit card association's far-reaching marketing activities.
Citigroup has complained that Visa's aggressive advertising
competes with the bank's efforts to forge a separate brand
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Early in February, Citigroup co-Chairman John Reed and a second
executive of the bank left the boards of Visa USA and its
international parent after talks on the branding issue broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials later said they were willing to accept the
bank's demand to move the Visa name from the front to the back of
the card but balked at the bank's insistance that it be exempted
from paying for some of Visa's marketing activities.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, currently the second-largest issuer of Visa credit
cards, confirmed yesterday that Willumstad's nomination to the
MasterCard board was part of the bank's broader switch of
allegiance from Visa to its rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they are more aligned with our strategic
thinking,'' said Citigroup spokeswoman Susan Weeks. ``Over time, we
expect to increase the proportion of business we do with
MasterCard.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  While no longer represented on Visa's boards, the bank will
remain an association member and continue issuing Visa cards, Weeks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Visa, based in Foster City, and MasterCard are associations
comprised of thousands of members which actually issue credit
cards. The associations handle advertising, process transactions
and manage relations with merchants who accept cards.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CITI11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Neither Citigroup nor MasterCard would comment on the nature of
any agreement between them.
</P>
<P>
   Visa officials have said they expect Citigroup will pressure
MasterCard to soft-pedal brand promotion, letting its members take
the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, MasterCard insisted that it would continue to
market aggressively. ``Our relationship with Citigroup does nothing
to undermine the strong MasterCard brand,'' spokeswoman Sharon
Gamsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gamsin hinted that MasterCard is relaxing its rules in
ways that might let members choose how much they want to take
advantage of the association's marketing activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which services members buy from us and how they want to use
the brand will vary widely,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Visa International spokesman David Brancoli declined to comment
on Citigroup's move to join the MasterCard board. He said Visa is
also considering proposals to let members choose from a menu of
services, though he said he didn't know whether paying for
marketing would be optional.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card specialists said the growth of giant financial
institutions with widely recognized brand names makes banks less
dependent on the associations, fundamentally shifting the
industry's balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially hard on Visa, which has a stronger brand name
than MasterCard. ``It's got to be very unsettling to Visa,'' said
Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, which monitors the
credit card industry.
</P>
<P>
   An executive appointment announced yesterday underscored Visa's
anxiety about keeping its biggest members happy.
</P>
<P>
   Visa USA said it hired IBM executive Bond Isaacson for a newly
created position overseeing relations with members and merchants
nationwide. Instead of working at headquarters, Isaacson will be
based in Charlotte, N.C. That's the home of BankAmerica, the
fifth-largest Visa issuer and one of the most vocal advocates of
change in Visa's marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of CITI11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A Visa spokesman described the location as a coincidence, noting
that Isaacson already lives in Charlotte and that most of the
bank's members are in the East.

 E-Trade Moves Ad Account to S.F.'s Goodby  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
E-Trade of Palo Alto has tapped San Francisco ad agency Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners, creator of the ``Got Milk'' campaign and
Budweiser frogs, to come up with strong branding advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Goodby &LR;   &LR; succeeds New York's Gotham Inc. on the account, which
is worth $33 million to $42 million and represents one-third of
E-Trade's $100 million to $125 million annual advertising and
marketing budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole message of our advertising until now has been trying
to get the public to come to the Web site,'' said E-Trade
spokeswoman Lisa Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the market is becoming increasingly competitive and
very fast-paced, it made sense for us now to focus on extending our
brand leadership,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   The account is also a milestone for Goodby. ``This is our first
toe in the water of e-business,'' said Rich Silverstein,
co-chairman and co-creative director of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein said the tide of e-commerce advertising is heading
toward ``creative'' agencies like his that are known for building a
strong brand image for their clients. The agency is currently in
discussions with other potential e-commerce accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade is one of many Web companies that are shifting their
focus to brand-building, said Drew Ianni, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``When you're in customer-acquisition
mode, you have to go to the media that give you most bang for
buck,'' often online advertising, said Ianni.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're really just trying to build mass awareness, you
need to get out there in the mass media,'' said Ianni. ``I think
it's a great move to go after Goodby.''
</P>
<P>
   Ianni believes the focus will shift back to the Web in a few
years as Web businesses begin to concentrate on customer retention.
``Then you'll see more relationship-building through customized
programs (on the sites) and through online advertising,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Modem Media-Poppe Tyson is E-Trade's interactive agency of
record and Pickholz Tweedy &AMP; Co. handles its direct marketing.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sought to
defend U.S. policy toward China on Wednesday in the face of
concerted Republican attacks on the Clinton administration's
handling of suspicions that China stole nuclear technology from the
Los Alamos laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, testifying before a House panel less than a week after
visiting China, said that China's theft of nuclear secrets from the
lab was a ``very serious issue'' that the CIA was assessing. But
she argued that it should not dominate efforts to remain engaged
with Beijing on a variety of issues from human rights to trade
policy, which the administration is trying to negotiate separately.
</P>
<P>
   Leading congressional Republicans were unswayed by that
argument, as they have been from the start, and instead went on the
attack, accusing the administration of not taking the theft
seriously enough at first and then of not adequately briefing
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Trent Lott of Mississippi,
the majority leader, demanded better explanations from Congress.
The uproar, inevitably, bled into the political arena, with two
presidential hopefuls, Patrick Buchanan and Steve Forbes, each
accusing President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, of ``dereliction of duty,'' and demanding that he resign
for failing to keep Congress adequately informed about the theft.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says it briefed lawmakers beginning in 1996
on suspicions that China had acquired important nuclear
bomb-building technology from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied stealing nuclear secrets from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, traveling with the President in Guatemala City on
Wednesday, defended his actions. ``I have no intention of
resigning,'' he said. ``The actions that we took as a government
when we learned of this alleged espionage which took place in the
'80s I believe were appropriate, I believe were in the national
interest, and I believe we acted swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lugar, one of the most influential Senate Republicans on
foreign policy, urged Clinton ``to give the American people a
damage assessment'' and to review the administration's China policy
before the Chinese prime minister visits here next month, when he
is expected to push for entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar sought to add the espionage case to the growing list of
Republican complaints about Clinton's China policy, which include
charges that the administration had been too soft on Chinese human
rights violations, had allowed American aerospace companies to
transfer missile technology to Beijing and had accepted improper
campaign contributions from Chinese donors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration already had dug a very deep hole
for itself on Capitol Hill with respect to China,'' Lugar wrote in
an Op-Ed article on Wednesday in the Washington Post. ``That hole
just got deeper and wider.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., proposed an amendment to an emergency
aid bill for Central American storm victims that would require
Congress to take a direct vote on whether the United States should
approve China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Currently,
that is the prerogative of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress will indirectly be voting on any effort to get
China into the trade organization. Its entry would require an
amendment of the law that enables Congress to vote each year on
granting China what is commonly known as most-favored-nation
trading status.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization, established in 1995 and with 132
members, governs international trade and mediates disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And Lott endorsed a plan for the Armed Services Committee to
hear testimony from the Republican and Democratic authors of a
classified bipartisan House report that concluded China obtained
some of the most sensitive American military technology. The two
lawmakers are Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers and the White House cannot agree on how much of
the report to make public and in what form. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against this angry backdrop, Albright and two other Cabinet
members, Commerce Secretary William Daley and Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, mounted a coordinated defense Wednesday of the
administration's handling of the case.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under sharp questioning from the House Appropriations
subcommittee that controls the State Department's funding, Albright
stressed the importance to the United States of engaging China,
even in light of the spy charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important for us to engage with a country of 1.3
billion people that has a huge land mass, and that has an influence
within its region, and that is also a permanent member of the
Security Council,'' Albright said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better off talking with them, dealing with them,''
Albright continued. ``We have made some progress in terms of their
cooperation on nuclear proliferation on rogue countries. They're
not supplying things to unsafeguarded facilities.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright also noted that China was important to the
administration as it tries to ``sort out what's going on in North
Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   And she noted that during the Cold War, Washington continued to
engage with countries, like the Soviet Union, that spied on the
United States.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter moment that underscored China's importance as a
vast consumer of American products, Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa,
reminded Albright that China was important to Midwestern farmers
because ``they can also use a lot of Iowa corn and soybeans.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I, in fact, talked about that when I was there,'' the
secretary said, drawing laughs from the panel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans were not in the bantering mood about China.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lugar, in his Op-Ed piece and in a separate interview, said that
the disclosure that China had made an important leap in
miniaturizing its long-range nuclear weapons with the help of
stolen American technology, should force the administration and
Congress to reassess whether rogue states armed with nuclear
weapons posed a greater threat to national security than long-time
nuclear powers such as Russia and China.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to express concern about what I think may be a
change in the strategic danger to the United States,'' Lugar said
in an interview.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smelling political blood, the two Republican presidential
candidates who depend on the party's hard-line conservatives for
support excoriated the administration. ``The allegations
surrounding the transfer of atomic secrets to a potential enemy are
the most serious since the Rosenbergs went to the electric chair in
1953,'' Buchanan told a news conference in Sioux City, Iowa. Forbes
said in a statement, ``No amount of Clinton-Gore spin can cover up
the disaster of our relationship with China, a relationship based
on drift, dithering and abject appeasement.''  &QL;

 The Great Computer Giveaway  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The personal computer, once a big-ticket item costing thousands of
dollars, has become just another home appliance, with prices
starting at under $500.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think that's cheap, just wait. It's only a matter of
time, industry observers say, until cable and telephone companies,
other Internet service providers and even computer-makers
themselves start providing PCs, or PC-like devices, for little or
no money.
</P>
<P>
   To get them, however, customers may have to sign long-term
Internet service contracts, agree to purchase thousands of dollars
in merchandise online or suffer a constant barrage of advertising
on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several companies have taken the first steps toward
turning the PC into a come-on. Connect Plus, a Massachusetts
supplier of cellular phones and other telecommunications equipment,
has started giving away eMachines PCs to anyone willing to sign up
for three years of Internet access at $29.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC.com of Pasadena plans to give away 10,000 Compaq PCs to
folks who agree to being bombarded with nonstop onscreen
advertising for two years.
</P>
<P>
   And a New York company, One Stop Communications, will give you
an Apple iMac if you agree to buy at least $100 of products each
month from affiliated retailers off its Web site for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The real push for free PCs, however, probably won't begin until
cable modems and/or DSL bring high-speed access within reach of
millions of potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   With such ``broadband'' access in place, consumers will have
access to a wealth of new content and services, including movies on
demand and live concerts that rival home theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and phone companies looking to entice new customers for
high-speed services could subsidize much or all of a new PC in
return for a multiyear commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Other, even less-expensive devices such as Internet-only
appliances and set-top boxes a la WebTV also could wind up being
given away. Those now sell for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet-only device could take a  &LR; many forms, from a set-top
box to an Internet phone companion, said Michael Feibus, an analyst
for Mercury Research. Such devices would cost less than a PC and
therefore be easier to subsidize.
</P>
<P>
   Many free-PC programs probably will mimic the successful
approach taken by cellular telephone companies, which give away
phones or sell them cheaply in return for a customer's commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a computer and we get a customer,'' said Tom Johnson,
a vice president of Connect Plus, which has patterned its PC
giveaway on the cell-phone model. He admitted that ``It's not a
very profitable deal for us,'' but said it has been invaluable in
attracting new customers who either had very old PCs or weren't on
the Internet. ``So far, the response has exceeded our
expectations,'' said Johnson, whose company has set a target of
10,000 free PCs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of FREEPCS1 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Far less promising than the cell-phone strategy, say analysts,
are the approaches being taken by Free-PC.com and One Stop
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Free-PC.com is counting on advertising revenue to offset the
cost of the PC giveaway, but that's an uncertain prospect because,
while the amount of Internet advertising is going up, the cost per
ad is going down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to sustain a model based only on Internet
ad revenues,'' said David Stremba, a PC analyst with Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   One Stop's strategy provides more ways for the company giving
away the PC to make money. Each month the company requires you to
spend at least $25 per shop in four of the stores in its online
mall &LR;  (www.shopss.com).  &LR; And each purchase includes a sizable
shipping charge.
</P>
<P>
   The One Stop approach, however, has a couple of big drawbacks
for the consumer. First, the customer has to be willing to cough up
$3,600 in online purchases just to get a computer that sells for
one-third that amount. And second, the company's online stores must
have items people want and offer prices that are competitive with
other online shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very difficult to see how that can happen at this
stage of Internet commerce,'' said Stremba. ``The average Joe isn't
spending $100 a month online.''
</P>
<P>
   If free PCs take off, it could mean bad news for PC retailers,
who might find it hard to sell computers when there are ads in the
newspaper giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   PC-makers, however, could wind up with a whole new channel of
distribution. Eckhard Pfeiffer, the chief executive of Compaq
Computer Corp., hinted last week that the world's No.1 PC-maker
could start giving away low-end computers as part of its effort to
become an Internet powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq could recoup the cost of the PCs through onscreen
advertising over the AltaVista Web site, which it is developing
into a major Internet portal.

 Column: Old Files Are Never Forgotten  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have a Windows 95 computer that I am thinking about
donating. But before I do, I want to make sure that my hard drive
is completely erased. I've heard that files deleted in the usual
way can still be recovered. What can I do to ensure that all the
files have been purged?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You heard right. Files can often be recovered even
after you've sent them to the recycle bin and emptied it. In order
to completely expunge data from a disk, you should overwrite it
multiple times with other information. Fortunately, there are some
free downloads that can do that for you. Two popular ones are
BCWipe from Jetico and Eraser from Sami Tolvanen. (There's also a
good $30 shareware program from East Technologies called Eraser.)
All of these programs are at  &LR; www.hotfiles.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Blame the Batteries
</P>
<P>
   Q: The clock in my PC has been slowing down lately. I suspect
it's a battery problem and would appreciate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep, your system's battery is probably the culprit. You
should replace it now, because if it fails altogether, you might
not even be able to start your computer. That's because the battery
makes it possible for the computer to retain critical system
information even when it is turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is contact the company that made the PC and
find out what kind of battery it has and whether or not you can
replace it yourself. If not, you'll have to take it to the service
center in a computer store.
</P>
<P>
   Fight the Power
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are so many types of surge protectors available, rated
at various levels of protection. What is the minimum necessary to
protect my computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get this question a lot during winter, when lightning
storms tend to knock out power lines. A basic surge protector just
prevents a sudden surge in power from reaching your computer
system. A typical unit is a specially rigged strip of outlets that
lets you plug in four or six devices, and costs less than $20.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using your PC when the lights go out, however, a surge
protector won't prevent the loss of documents you're working on.
For that, you need an uninterruptible power supply, or UPS. This
device uses a battery to keep your system alive long enough for you
to save any in-progress work and shut down your PC and any
peripherals properly. More-expensive ones can even let you continue
to work for a half hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   UPS units cost from less than $100 up to several hundred
dollars. American Power Conversion, a leading maker of UPS devices,
has a feature on its Web site  &LR; (www.apcc.com)  &LR; that helps you
determine what level of protection you need.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Twain
</P>
<P>
   Q: My publishing software refers to my scanner as a Twain
device. What in the heck does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COMPUTE1 (78543 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: Twain stands for Technology Without an Interesting Name.
Honest. It also stands for an interesting American writer. In the
computer world, Twain is a technology standard that allows many
different types of scanners and digital cameras to work with
software such as programs for publishing and managing digital
images.
</P>
<P>
   If you're able to use your scanner with your software, then
don't worry about Twain. All it means is that you've got a good
thing going.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ICON UPDATE &LR; : It turns out that Quicken 99 does let you get rid
of the icon that it puts in the Windows system tray. Open Quicken,
select Options from the Edit menu, then choose Internet
connections. In the dialog box that appears, go to the section
labeled Background Downloading and change the option from ``Enable
for shorter, faster Internet sessions'' to ``Don't use background
downloading.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Most stores won't let you return software for a refund once it's
been opened. So it helps if you know what you're getting before you
commit any cash. Many software companies let you download demo
versions that you can try before you buy. To see if a demo version
is available for a particular program or game, check out the
software maker's Web site, or search for the title in an online
software library such as &LR;  www.hotfiles.com  &LR; or  &LR; www.download.com. &LR;

TREASURIES SAG AS OTHER DEBT MARKETS SWELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities fell in price under the sheer
weight of corporate and municipal supply Wednesday, as big
companies including Lucent Technologies and Freddie Mac sold debt
to the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond fell 11/32 to a price of 95 20/32; the yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.55 percent, from
5.53 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac sold $3 billion of 10-year notes, and Lucent sold
about $1.4 billion of 30-year global bonds. Often, securities firms
handling such offerings sell Treasury securities as a hedge against
losses should interest rates increase before the corporate sales
find their way into the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac, which is second only to Fannie Mae in mortgage
financing, priced the 10-year notes to yield 5.81 percent, or about
five-eighths of a percentage point more than Treasury notes with a
similar maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae also said it planned to exchange 71 outstanding debt
issues with a reopened 5.125 percent five-year benchmark note due
in February 2004. It is the largest exchange offer Fannie Mae has
ever made to holders of its debt securities.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, the telephone equipment maker, increased the size of its
30-year bond offering through joint lead managers Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. by 36 percent, to $1.36 billion,
selling the issue at a price to yield 6.49 percent. That is about
89 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than a
similar Treasury issue.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects of more corporate debt offerings in the next few weeks
are rising as higher-quality issuers line up to take advantage of a
strong economy, little inflation and low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. plans to sell $5 billion to $6 billion of bonds in
three parts as early as next week to help pay for recent
acquisitions. It would be the second- largest corporate sale ever
after the $6.1 billion MCI WorldCom sale last year.
</P>
<P>
   Market perceptions have changed, according to Robert Pugliese,
senior vice president and director of the fixed income department
at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla. Expectations
that the Federal Reserve would tighten interest rates havce
dissipated following recent data indicating that inflation is still
benign, so the market has now shifted from fundamentals to
technicals, and is trading on prices. ``This market remains in
decent shape,'' Pugliese said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for municipal bonds trailed Treasuries Wednesday, as
borrowers sold almost half the $5.4 billion of debt expected this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading issues was a $700 million general obligation
bond deal by the City of New York through underwriters led by
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. That issue was initially priced to yield a
maximum 5.26 percent for a bond due in 2029.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority sold $801.8 million of
metropolitan highway system revenue bonds through underwriters led
by Paine Webber, initially priced to yield a maximum of 5.27
percent for a 40-year bond due in 2039.

FEW IN JAPAN SEE BARGAIN IN PRICE OF TOBACCO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RJR-NABISCO-BREAKUP) 
(sw) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Investors, analysts and business people gasped on
Wednesday at the $8 billion price that Japan Tobacco Inc., the
former cigarette monopoly here, paid for the international tobacco
business of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That price was about $1.5 billion more than RJR had expected to
get for the business, leaving many here grumbling that Japanese
companies had failed to learn any lessons from their last spending
spree, when they were notorious for overpaying for overseas assets
like the golf course at Pebble Beach in California and Rockefeller
Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders registered their disapproval on Wednesday by
pushing Japan Tobacco's share price down 4.7 percent in unusually
heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is the price,'' said Keiko Sasaki, an analyst
who follows Japan Tobacco at ING Barings in Tokyo. ``Even after
attending their analysts' meeting today, I'm still not sure whether
they can really justify the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that the purchase was a defensive one. If one of
the world's two tobacco giants, Philip Morris or British American
Tobacco, had acquired the business, Japan Tobacco would have faced
a grim future.
</P>
<P>
   But the purchase still leaves Japan Tobacco a distant third in
the global tobacco market, excluding cigarette manufacturers
controlled by the Chinese government. The acquisition will bring
Japan Tobacco's sales to 460 billion cigarettes this year, but
Philip Morris sold 945 billion last year while British American
Tobacco sold 929 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco's domestic business has matured, and given Japan's
aging population, the market is likely to shrink in coming years.
The company's market share has slipped to 70 percent since the
government privatized the business in 1985, and while the company
has made inroads into South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian markets,
it has had trouble breaking into Western markets.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which created a tobacco monopoly near the turn
of the century to finance wars with China and then Russia, still
owns a substantial majority of Japan Tobacco, although it has plans
to sell more of its shares later this year. The company remains a
fount of cash for the government, providing billions of dollars in
taxes every year.
</P>
<P>
   The RJR purchase brings access to Western Europe, where RJR
controls 6 percent of the market; Eastern Europe, where it has a 12
percent share, and Canada, where it has 13 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, Japan Tobacco also gets a larger share of the
lucrative ``American blend'' cigarette market. The company will
become the second-largest global manufacturer of such cigarettes,
which use different types of tobacco and flavors and are consumed
in the United States and most of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And while the company has tried to diversify in recent years,
moving into pharmaceuticals and other areas, 98 percent of its
revenue still comes from tobacco sales. ``Tobacco is clearly Japan
Tobacco's core business, and the company has been trying to enter
the overseas market and finding it takes a long time to establish
brand names and sales and production networks,'' said Yoko Fujii, a
tobacco analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Fujii said she thought Japan Tobacco had paid too
much, she said the purchase was probably a good one in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Japan Tobacco, like most cigarette companies, was
cash rich. ``They will also have to dispose of some of their
securities portfolio, and that's a good thing because they're not
making much money on those holdings,'' Ms. Fujii said.

MRS. DOLE, THE CANDIDATE, NOW MUST ANSWER SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related DOLE-2000)  
(nk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During her husband's 1996 presidential campaign,
Elizabeth Hanford Dole showed up, right on time, to tape a
commercial for him. She read the spot through once, off the
prompter. Then she thanked everybody and got up to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Even professional actors can go through a dozen takes at such a
taping, just getting warmed up. But when Mrs. Dole was called back
and asked to try once more, she seemed at first not to understand
the request, then took umbrage at the implication that her
presentation had been other than perfect the first time. Before a
third try, according to a sympathetic witness, she cleared the room
and proclaimed herself thoroughly humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   A long career in Washington has produced many such anecdotes
about Mrs. Dole: Ever professional and widely admired for what one
friend calls her ``superhuman discipline,'' she prepares so
thoroughly for public appearances that she even requires aides to
count the number of steps she must take to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Though roughly as fragile as Margaret Thatcher, she is also
famously thin-skinned, and has been known to burst into tears over
unflattering press. Even friends who think Americans might
appreciate a president with an extra measure of self-control after
the Clinton years wonder why she would subject herself to the
ordeal of running for the office.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview this evening, Mrs. Dole said, ``I've long
ago learned to deal with the slings and arrows of politics.'' And
if she does run, she said, ``It will be to make a positive
contribution to people's lives (and) to bring civility back to
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, when Mrs. Dole announced her intention to formally
consider a presidential run, in what would be her first bid for
public office, she appeared ready to become the country's first
serious female presidential candidate and a serious contender,
period. As a two-time Cabinet secretary, a former head of the
American Red Cross and an immensely popular campaigner for her
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas (Remember all the talk
about how the wrong Dole was running?), she has stirred enormous
interest among Republicans, and has consistently done well in early
polls, usually placing just behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But now she will also have to answer two major questions: What
does she stand for? And can she stand the messy, uncontrolled,
often out-of-control political process that will decide who becomes
the next president? After decades in the public eye, she is hardly
an unknown quantity. But some in her party continue to wonder about
her politics _ and whether she is suited to the political life.
</P>
<P>
   Is she a centrist in the style of, say, her husband? Or do her
beliefs as a committed Christian put her politics more in line with
the religious right? Now 62, she became a Republican just before
she became Mrs. Dole, at age 39. And although she has repeatedly
thrown herself into her husband's campaigns, her politics have
remained ambiguous, if only because she has never run for office
herself.
</P>
<P>
   She said she defines herself politically as a mainstream
conservative and laughs at the suggestion that she is too much of a
perfectionist to handle a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been so overplayed,'' she said. ``I said in a speech
in 1987 that I considered myself a perfectionist, but I've really
tempered that extensively and there's no way I could have taken on
the issues I have if I had not tempered that.''
</P>
<P>
   And thin-skinned? Another laugh. ``I have to disagree with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she is running out of a real sense of calling, an
almost missionary zeal, and the theory of her campaign is this:
``Elizabeth has an opportunity to put together a new version of the
Reagan coalition,'' appealing to conservative Democrats and
independents, said Mari Maseng Will, another old friend and
longtime adviser. ``She's not forbidding in the way many
Republicans are, not seen as a threat to others' views and not
intolerant. A lot of women would be drawn to her in a way they
haven't been drawn to the Republicans in a long time _ and young
professionals, and eventually, the social conservatives.'`
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge will be filling in the blanks in that general
portrait of her: ``She's a tough lady; she's as hard as her
hairdo,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant who has
worked for Bob Dole. ``And she'll be one of the serious contenders.
But until America learns where she would lead, she won't pass the
threshold test. There's always a place at the table for a female
candidate. But for it to become more than that, she has to have a
message beyond `I am woman, hear me roar.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Dole is an active Christian who schedules time for
daily prayer and who, friends say, is largely motivated by the
dictates of her faith, she has never been a particular favorite
among her party's base. Her husband was never eager to join the
abortion debate and seemed to put his foot in his mouth whenever he
did broach the issue, and Mrs. Dole's stated position that she is
pro-life but respects other viewpoints seems similarly wishy-washy
to some conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   She says her position is wholly unambiguous: `It's pretty clear.
I'm pro-life, with exceptions for the rape, incest and the life of
the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But even her pollster, Linda DiVall, suggests that her position
is a little more complex, saying, ``I don't know that she wants to
overturn the law of the land,'' referring to the Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And one religious conservative leader, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, recalls that every time Mrs. Dole has
spoken to his group, she has routinely excised references to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put the line in, it would come back taken out. I'd put it
back in, it would come back taken out. I'd say `Hey, this is not
the Chamber of Commerce.' But she never came through with the
applause lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Republican consultants say they worry even more
about Mrs. Dole's flexibility than her politics, whatever they may
be, and wonder whether she's gaited for the free-for-all of a
national campaign.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In ``Unlimited Partners,'' the book the Doles wrote together in
1988, Mrs. Dole described herself as a perfectionist from the
earliest age: ``I was a serious child, and eager to please. When my
second-grade teacher sent me home to fetch a forgotten book, I
considered myself such a total failure that I cried all the way
down South Fulton Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Idle moments were frowned on by her family, particularly her
father, John Hanford, a flower wholesaler in the small town of
Salisbury, N.C., who ``liked work and plenty of it'' and did not
much appreciate leisure.
</P>
<P>
   While writing with great respect for her father and her mother,
Mary Hanford, who at age 98 is still her daughter's best friend,
Mrs. Dole nonetheless drops a hint or two about where her
unforgiving standards come from. In her family, she wrote,
``Self-improvement was a measure of personal growth. It was also a
way to satisfy my goal-oriented parents. Piano lessons stretched
into 10 years ... My dance career was comparatively short-lived. As
the curtain fell on one performance, Dad turned to Mother and said,
`Mary, why in the world did you encourage her to take ballet? She
doesn't have a single curve!' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Duke University, she was so organized that some classmates
referred to her as ``Miss 3-by-5 Index Card.''

<P>
   At Harvard, where she was among a tiny minority of women law
students, former Democratic congresswoman Patricia Schroeder said
Mrs. Dole was even more concerned than other women with the
question, ``Can you be a lady and a lawyer?'' Apparently, she
answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   Working for President Nixon's Office of Consumer Affairs under
Virginia Knauer, her boss found her trying to memorize reference
books to cram for her first press interview. Mrs. Knauer remembers:
``I told her, `You can't know everything, but the important thing
is, never try to fake it. Just smile and say, ``Great question.
I'll get back to you.'' ' And that's what she's always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Knauer, who at 83 is perfectly sharp until the
questions turn personal, most of Mrs. Dole's close friends are
protective, careful and a little bit worshipful. One compares her
to Princess Diana, another says the country has never seen the
likes of Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But how to define her politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excellent question,'' says her friend and adviser,
Bob Davis. `I want to defer on that.''
</P>
<P>
   If her political record is a blank slate, her record of public
service is ample, but mixed. As transportation secretary under
President Reagan, she was given credit for improving highway safety
with the ``Dole light,'' the brake light mounted in a car's rear
window. But she was strongly criticized for agreeing that there was
no need to re-hire the air traffic controllers fired by Reagan
after a 1981 strike.
</P>
<P>
   As labor secretary for 22 months under President George Bush,
she made friends with labor leaders but was also seen by some as
more interested in image than substance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Red Cross, where she served for nearly eight years, she
got high marks for raising money and vastly improving quality
control and oversight for their blood collection system _ after the
Food and Drug Administration pushed her into compliance by filing a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she has critics who see her tenure as a
disaster in the fight against the spread of HIV, because, as they
see it, she pandered to the religious right by taking the power to
make decisions about prevention policy away from Red Cross staff
and turning it over to the charity's board, with the result that
educational materials put more emphasis on abstinence than on safe
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her own religious faith, friends mention another
major motivator in Mrs. Dole's life. They say that Mrs. Dole, who
married at 39 and usually says she would have welcomed children but
was not unhappy that she never had any, was in fact quite
disappointed, and resolved to channel the energy that might have
gone into child-rearing into public service instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She resolved that, OK, that isn't going to happen, so she
substituted from the personal to the macro,'' said one friend.
``The children in Africa have become a meaningful substitute for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that she has ever been accused of failing
to give her work her all; but she seems never to have learned to
suffer imperfections in others, either. Those who have worked for
her say no one would dare fail to prepare for a meeting. Show up
twice without full command of the facts, and you don't get a third
opportunity to waste her time.
</P>
<P>
   A recent rebroadcast of a 1996 interview with Leslie Stahl on
the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' showed Mrs. Dole shooting her
interviewer a downright scary look after Ms. Stahl slipped and
called her by her childhood nickname, Liddy.
</P>
<P>
   Why does she hate that name so much? Another question to be
answered in the weeks ahead.

   SUSSEX, Va. _ In this quiet corner of southeastern Virginia,
sturdy farmhouses command vast fields of peanuts, soybeans and
cotton. Slender loblolly pines poke through the flat, wet terrain,
like celery stalks wedged into a marshy bog. It seems like a Robert
Penn Warren poem sprung to life.
</P>
<P>
   But if this county is rich in beauty, it is also poor in
opportunities. For years, the courthouse had no indoor plumbing,
and so little space that defendants occasionally had to wait
outside before their arraignment. No new schools have been built in
30 years, and teachers had to make do with antiquated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Sussex County discovered garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the county embarked on a risky, controversial
path that many people believed would improve their struggling
economy, even though it would jeopardize their beloved environs: a
private, state-of-the-art landfill that would import thousands of
tons of garbage a day, much of it from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A result, so far, is that the landfill, while still far from
beloved, now generates one-third of all annual local revenues,
enabling the county to hold taxes steady, build a new courthouse
and waste water plant, and break ground on a $600 million high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Sussex has found itself in the middle of a
multistate battle over trash that has once again prompted many
people here to try to reconcile their economic needs and
environmental concerns, pragmatism and principles.
</P>
<P>
   Trash has become a hot topic in an election year, with
politicians deploring Virginia's status as the second-biggest
importer of out-of-state trash. Egged on by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's insouciant suggestion that Virginia should accept New
York's trash in return for the city's cultural and financial
contributions, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation
last month limiting garbage imports. And last week, Sens. Charles
Robb, a Democrat, and John Warner, a Republican, reached across
party lines to co-sponsor a bill that would also restrict the flow
of garbage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most Virginians have applauded such antitrash, anti-New York
reflexes. But here in Sussex, one of several places in Virginia,
Pennsylvania and Ohio that import garbage, the reaction has been
more ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather not have it, but we're caught between a rock and a
hard place, because the county is in bad shape and we need the
money,'' said Bill Jenkins, 40, a peanut farmer who was eating
breakfast at the Virginia Diner in Wakefield. He initially opposed
the landfill; now he tolerates it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can we do?'' Jenkins continued, as the diner's
owners, Bill and Mary Ann Galloway, nodded. ``If we don't have this
dump, the next thing they're going to do is raise taxes on the
land. I don't see another solution.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, several of Virginia's rural landfills _ including the
Atlantic Waste Disposal landfill in Sussex _ faced no limits on
importing garbage.
</P>
<P>
   But under the State Senate proposals, Virginia would be able to
limit a landfill's intake, ban garbage barges on major rivers and
regulate waste more rigorously. That bill would become law on July
1 if signed by Gov. James Gilmore, who is squarely in the
anti-trash camp. The Robb-Warner bill, meanwhile, would restrict
the interstate commerce of garbage as well, and allow states to
collect fees on imported trash.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex officials worry that any reduction in trash revenues may
hamper an economy already sapped by declines in agriculture and
manufacturing, said Mary E. Jones, the county administrator.

 VA-NY-TRASH-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT  
 SUSSEX, Va.: county administrator. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Situated 45 miles southeast of Richmond, this county of 10,000
has long struggled to get by. One-fifth of the county's residents
live in poverty, almost double the state average. The school system
perennially ranks near the bottom. The teen-age pregnancy rate is
triple the state average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workforce is not that great, and you have a small working
pool to grow from,'' said Thomas Rose, 57, a lawyer who was having
lunch at the Thornton General Store in the village of Sussex.
``We're not going to get anything high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, Sussex has absorbed industries that more
prosperous areas would avoid: two state prisons, hog farms and, in
1994, the landfill in the county's northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to build the landfill sharply divided
the community, and in no discernible pattern; certainly not along
traditional lines of race (Sussex is 60 percent black) or politics
(Sussex usually votes Democratic). The final vote by the Board of
Supervisors was 4 to 3.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still smarting from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sussex counts on the money, but sometimes you've got to think
above money,'' said Rhonda Powell, postmistress of the tiny post
office in the village of Yale. ``People are tired of getting all
these things to get money, instead of getting something more
acceptable. You don't want to be thought as, `All we can get is the
dregs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others, meanwhile, have grumbled that the county has received
less money than originally promised. But Ms. Jones said that
without the landfill, which has generated more than $12.3 million
total so far in taxes and fees, the county might have had to double
or triple the tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Now owned by Waste Management Inc., the landfill covers 1,315
acres, or roughly the size of Central and Prospect Parks combined.
Up to 50 percent of its 4,200 daily tons of trash comes from New
York City; the rest is from Maryland, northern Virginia and
Washington. About three-fourths of the trash comes by truck; the
rest by rail, said Jerry Johnson, the site's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the dump itself, New York garbage is easy to spot: an ``I
Love New York'' bag here, a mustard-colored bag from a Chinatown
noodle shop there, New York newspapers all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the dump, it is easy to find Sussex residents who feel
queasy about the landfill's odors, the trucks lumbering down Route
460 or just the idea of the highest hill in Sussex (450 feet)
rising in their backyard.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was only a couple of weeks ago that a Sussex-bound
truck carrying New York City garbage overturned on Interstate 295.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stinking up the place,'' said Floyd Edward Hardy 3rd, a
Bronx native who moved to the town of Waverly almost a decade ago
and now works at a Hardee's restaurant. ``I think that every state
should take care of their own trash.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain perspective, New Yorkers should put themselves in
Sussex's shoes, said Tom Raines, the county registrar and a farmer
whose family can trace its Virginia roots to the 1600's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell New Yorkers that we like this landfill as much as they
would if it sat in the middle of Central Park,'' said Raines, who
was among the lunchgoers at the Thornton General Store.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable to see why some Sussex residents are
prickly about New York. A couple of years ago, the New York Post
annoyed many people here when it described the county as a
``dirt-poor, dirt-filled'' place with a ``warren of tar-paper
shacks'' and potbellied residents who couldn't get enough of New
York's refuse.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bit unfair. Most people work hard to scrape by,
occupying small but well-groomed bungalows or mobile homes. They
take pride in their surroundings. They pray at the county's 60
some-odd churches, most of them Baptist. They also make this the
kind of friendly, leisurely place where a cup of coffee with a
stranger turns into a few cups, then some biscuits, then maybe a
full meal.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever the conversation veers from hometown pride, to
local affairs, to environmental fears, the same nagging conundrum
remains: Has the landfill been worth it?
</P>
<P>
   According to interviews with more than three dozen people over a
few days, the answer is a resounding ``Not Sure.'' On the streets
of Waverly, for instance, Thelma W. Wyatt, a former English teacher
who now teaches at one of the state prisons, initially voiced solid
opposition, then paused to consider the other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand the smell; we're supposed to have clean fresh
air in the rural area here,'' said Mrs. Wyatt, 54, who supports the
proposed curbs on garbage intake. ``But I think people have
accepted it, because they definitely needed a school, and they felt
that they didn't have much of a choice but to go with this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the peanut fields of Stony Creek, Marvin Wachsman, a farmer
who harvests timber, peanuts and soybeans, straddled the issue as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got enough sense to know that we've got no other choice,
but we're a little afraid about what's going to happen to the
environment in the future,'' said Wachsman, 55, who was nuzzling
twin newborn calves under threatening skies. ``There are no easy
answers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEPU, China _ In a typical Chinese town like this one, the local
Communist Party chief rules with the authority of an old-time
mobster.
</P>
<P>
   Using the local police as enforcers, a party chief often cruises
around his territory in a black limousine, demanding a cut from the
most prosperous local businesses. When a day's business is done, a
chief may hold court at the town's best hotel, where a restaurant
and a massage parlor serve the town's top officials free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   He Jianlin, until recently the party chief of Hepu in Guangxi
Province in southern China, acted that way. And like his
counterparts in thousands of similar towns all over the country, He
organized a system of selling appointments to official jobs in his
government so openly that his prices were common knowledge all over
town: $10,000 to become a deputy party chief, $2,750 to be a bureau
chief, $2,500 to run a small neighboring town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying and selling official positions,'' as the practice is
known, is now a common phrase in the Chinese lexicon. In a town
where a family earning $100 a month is considered affluent, several
thousand dollars is a small fortune to pay for an official job, and
the prices roughly correspond with how much an official can make in
bribes in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   China's authorities like to portray corruption as the fault of a
few immoral individuals, rather than a symptom of deeper trouble
within the nation's stubbornly old-fashioned one-party system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet corruption is now virtually built into the middle levels of
China's vast authoritarian apparatus, under an ideology that has
become a hollow shell while the new market economy swells around
it.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners often decry human rights conditions in China, citing
political restrictions on writers and intellectuals in the large
cities. But for hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese who live
in towns and villages, it is the unrestrained authority of a local
party chief that is usually most oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   Without institutional checks or balances to hinder improper
behavior, a local party chief can essentially rule the way he _
leading officials are overwhelmingly men _ sees fit. The growing
prevalence of buying and selling official positions points to how
extensively corruption has spread across rural China.
</P>
<P>
   ``An official job is like a piece of fruit,'' said a local
businessman in Hepu. ``You pay the money and it's yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Chinese are nostalgic for the days, only a
generation ago, when Communist ideology and enforced poverty
prevented anyone from getting rich. Public opinion surveys
regularly find that corruption is overwhelmingly the No. 1 concern.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese people disagree over the degree to which corruption
exists at the very top of the Communist Party. President Jiang
Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, for instance, appear to be
personally upright officials who are alarmed by the extent of
corruption, though they are unwilling to change the system that
perpetuates it.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, buying and selling official positions has become so
rampant, and such a cause of public discontent, that even Beijing's
top leaders are publicly denouncing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible that official positions are openly labeled with
a price?'' Prime Minister Zhu asked at a meeting addressing the
issue in January. ``This problem must be given serious attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Zhu visited this region along China's southern
coast, long known for uncontrolled smuggling of cars, oil and
cigarettes, often undertaken by local leaders like He with
cooperation from the police or the military.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zhu could do little more than exhort officials to more
honesty and integrity, since genuine political reform is still
unacceptable to Communist Party leaders, who fear that it would
inevitably threaten their own rule.
</P>
<P>
   He, 45, amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling more
than 60 positions, businessmen in Hepu say. A short, taciturn man
with a plodding, cautious nature, He tried to hide his growing
fortune in real estate and in a number of separate bank accounts,
many of them in the names of his mistresses.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the illicit money taken by He and his cronies is
evident on a street at the edge of town that is lined by opulent
townhouses with ornate doorways and fancy patios, all homes of
local officials. Townspeople call it ``corruption street.''
</P>
<P>
   An official report on He, whose downfall came only after leaders
in Beijing decided to make an example of him, cataloged a few of
the cases in which officials paid him cash in exchange for job
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the report said, an official named Xu Lifa from a
village near Hepu called on He and left a shopping bag with two
cartons of imported cigarettes and several bricks of cash, totaling
30,000 yuan, worth about $2,750, beside He's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Xu was soon appointed to head Hepu's finance bureau, even though
he had no experience in finance and the incumbent had no plans to
move. When the incumbent official opposed the appointment, he was
transferred to a lesser position in a nearby county.
</P>
<P>
   In February, He was found guilty of selling official positions
and taking other bribes worth more than $50,000. He was sentenced
to eight years in prison. Three other officials were also convicted
of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   What He said in his own defense, if anything, remains secret. He
is now in jail in the provincial capital, Nanning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years is a pretty light sentence for his crimes, so his
connections must still be pretty good,'' another local businessman
said. ``They did not confiscate his property, or go after his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   He often deputized his wife, Zhang Siyi, to collect his bribes,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called her `cash bag Siyi', '' the businessman said. ``She
was very unpleasant.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An obvious question is whether He shared his illicit earnings
with any of his superiors in Nanning, where he moved in 1997 when
he was promoted to a new position. Another question is how He got
away with his antics for so long, so openly, and why he finally
came under suspicion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The official report said complaints ``from the masses'' had led
to an investigation. But local businessmen said his actions were
pretty typical for a county chief, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Only when He hired an attractive 18-year-old prostitute as his
``secretary,'' frequently taking her on trips out of town, did
townspeople start to think he had gone too far. Someone, perhaps a
rival, reported his actions to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   When an investigation team from the central government's
discipline inspection committee arrived in Hepu last year, it was
clear to many people here that his days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   But his case was hardly unique. Dozens of other cases of buying
and selling official positions have been reported in China's
official media in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated that his young escort was apparently his undoing, He
complained to friends that he had spent more than $40,000 on her to
keep her happy.

   STAND-ALONE-FILM (Paris) _ After seeing ``I Stand Alone,'' after
meeting its director, Gaspar Noe, 35, one couldn't help but ask:
How could a pleasant young man with a positive view of life make a
film as dark and desperate as this one? Well, Noe might of course
have confessed that he was a secret nihilist, that ``I Stand
Alone'' (``Seul Contre Tous'') was a public form of psychotherapy.
Reassuringly, his answer was more straightforward. ``I can make a
film like this because I feel at ease with myself,'' he said. By

   ROMANCE-FILM (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) _ If you can't dazzle

1989 film ``36 Fillette'' declares, with a glance at her own daring
decollete. Could that be the French director's motto? Ms. Breillat,
who is 50, is no stranger to scandal. From her first novel, written
when she was 17, to her most recent film, ``Romance,'' her candid
dissections of human sexuality have ignited debate at home and
abroad. ``Romance'' enjoyed a noisy premiere last month at the
International Film Festival here alongside a retrospective of Ms.
Breillat's six previous films. (``Romance'' is being shown as part

he left behind the monolith from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' as the
single most salient image of his career. This (who could forget?)
was the dark, austere object that arrived in the midst of primitive
ape-men. It drove them into a state of high anxiety as they rallied
around the thing, touched it, recoiled, tried to fathom it, sensed
its intense power without quite grasping what that power might
mean. The arrival of each new mind-blowing Kubrick film was much
the same. By Janet Maslin. (Moved).

   DLUGOSZEWSKI-DANCE (New York) _ It's not often that someone
starts making dances after turning 60. Lucia Dlugoszewski, who
makes her choreographic debut on March 23 at Playhouse 91, is not a
total neophyte, though. A seasoned composer and musician, she
carried on a creative partnership, and marriage, with the
choreographer Erick Hawkins for more than 40 years. After Hawkins
died, Ms. Dlugoszewski set about staging three pieces outlined in a
notebook he kept at his deathbed. Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak
Dance Project performed the first of these posthumous works,
``Journey of a Poet,'' to mixed reviews at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music in 1997. The Hawkins company will present the two others
during its one-week run at Playhouse 91, which wraps up the 92d

Arthur Mitchell. In the coming months, he will be celebrating his
50th year in dance, the 30th anniversary of The Dance Theater of
Harlem and his 65th birthday. Dressed in a black silk shirt, black
jacket and black slacks, he makes as striking an impression now as
he did as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet in the
1950s and 60s. On his bookcase in his office are photographs of
himself with Balanchine, another with Jacqueline Kennedy at the

madness, has been interpreted, with various degrees of Freudian and
feminist shadings, by Eva Le Gallienne, Geraldine Page, Maggie
Smith, Glenda Jackson, Jane Alexander and Dianne Wiest, among
others. ``What Hamlet is to men, Hedda is, in some ways, to
women,'' said Annette Bening, the latest Hedda, who has found the

satire at the Royal Court. It has been a defiantly undemonstrative,
unpretentiously devastating piece called ``The Color of Justice''
that opened in January in the little Tricycle Theater in the

ADVERTISING: MAKING KHAKIS SEXY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a khakis counterattack, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is responding to
inroads made by competitors by portraying its Dockers line of
casual pants for men in a far more sensual and youthful manner.
</P>
<P>
   The retailoring of the image for Dockers, which have been
rebranded as Dockers Khakis to capitalize on the craze for cotton
slacks, intensifies this week with a campaign by the San Francisco
office of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding. The budget for mass media
advertising is being increased 12 percent from the estimated $20
million to $30 million spent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the makeover is a pair of television
commercials that focus on romance between beefy boys and tasty
ladies in the offbeat locales of a seedy carnival and a funky
nightclub. The sex-drenched spots suggest that Dockers Khakis are
the millennial version of Brylcreem in that just as ``a little
dab'' of hair dressing once attracted hordes of willing women, now
it takes the right pants.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is indicative of the Herculean efforts that Levi
Strauss is taking to alter perceptions of its products and imbue
them with qualities that would appeal to teen-agers and men in
their 20s and 30s. Those consumers have been bypassing Levi Strauss
brands for labels like Gap, Fubu, Banana Republic, Tommy Hilfiger
and JNCO.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul includes new advertising for the flagship Levi's
denim jeans; new offerings like Dockers K-1 Khakis, with retro-chic
styling billed as ``cut from the original cloth''; sponsorship of
concerts and musicians; product placement in movies and television
series, and promotions aimed at niche markets like women, blacks,
fans of independent films and gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dockers Khakis campaign ``reflects the challenge at
hand,'' said Vince Tarani, marketing director for Dockers Khakis
USA at Levi Strauss in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great franchise with men 35-plus, who we must
keep,'' he added, ``and at the same time be more relevant to the
25- to 34-year-old'' as well as ``a secondary market of 18 to 24.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still the leader in the khakis category,'' he added,
``but of course ever since it got hot, a lot of people are coming
into it, and that increases the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are purposely different from previous Dockers
pitches that carried pleasant themes, like ``Nice pants,'' that
were intended to appeal to men by presenting average-looking models
_ the buff need not apply _ in identifiable situations, like
playing golf or traveling for business. The goal now, though, is to
make the spots slick and provocative enough to have viewers believe
they may be eavesdropping on the exploits of the older brothers of
the Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch catalog crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to do it right,'' said Chris Shipman, senior vice
president and group creative director at Foote, Cone San Francisco,
which is part of True North Communications. ``A brand trying to be
cool and failing is worse than an uncool brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Dockers Khakis were being perceived as ``your father's
pants,'' he added, ``we needed to push the sexiness a little
overboard'' in the commercials to ``open the doors to a lot of guys
who never thought Dockers would be appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the carnival spot, when a model strips to his khakis to
try the dunk tank, there are lingering shots of the clinging wet
pants and his chiseled torso; one could, it seems, bounce a quarter
off his abdominal muscles and get a dime back in change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've left the golf course on this one,'' Tarani said, adding
that though the model ``is not a regular guy in the street, he's
quite credible for the brand.'' (The women in the spot are no
slouches in the hubba-hubba department, either, in displaying their
sultry charms.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sensuality is even more pronounced in the nightclub spot, in
which a hip-hop hunk is so besieged by beautiful women that he has
to spend the night dancing with all his fans. Come the dawn, he
emerges from the club and steps into a taxicab, only to hear the
same song he has danced to all night and see a gorgeous driver with
a come-hither look in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Shipman said, the nightclub spot will run only after 9
p.m. because of a shot of one dancer's leg wrapped around
another's.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign represents an abrupt shift from a more traditional
approach in one that the agency created last year. One commercial
from that campaign, for instance, was centered on a man rescuing
his girlfriend from a mouse. The 1998 campaign was suddenly cut
short and replaced with a playfully sexy spot created by another
Levi Strauss agency, Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London. That spot
showed buff swimmers who doffed their Dockers to surf and then used
their surfboards to iron their pants.
</P>
<P>
   Shipman, who will soon leave Foote, Cone San Francisco to work
on freelance projects in advertising and perhaps entertainment,
described the new campaign as ``the end of a couple years' work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've positioned Dockers to be ready for this,'' he added.
``The spots have a fantasy appeal, but also a universal aspect you
can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarani agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get it right, and we will, we'll have the brand set up
for the next three to five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that is predicated, however, on the success of the makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to the brand that the image shifts,'' Shipman
said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that would be to rename the brand Dockers
Khakis San Francisco. Imagine how alluring the ``DKSF'' label would
be.

   The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's

about technology-company earnings crimped gains in the Nasdaq
composite index. The Dow climbed 79.08 points, to 9,772.84,

is up 6.44 percent for the year. The S&AMP;P 500 set its second record

RCA DOME IS HOUSE OF DREAMS FOR DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The RCA Dome, as the sight of its 1996
first-round loss to Princeton, holds horrific memories for UCLA.
But for sophomore guard Baron Davis, it's the most treasured
building in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was an unknown 5-foot-8 high school junior-to-be when he
arrived at the Nike Camp here in the summer of 1995. He left a week
later as one of the most coveted players in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most defining point in my career,'' Davis said.
``It was the first opportunity I had to show the nation and the
college coaches that I could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, no one had ever seen me play. Nobody was
recruiting me. I was at Crossroads (a small school in Santa
Monica), and I was small. But when I got out of there, everyone was
sending me letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis wasn't considered good enough for the West team _ which
included Kenny Brunner, Mike Bibby and Chris Burgess, Jason and
Jarron Collins and Eric Chenowith _ so he played for the Southeast.
Despite nerves, he performed well enough in his first game (against
Brunner and Bibby) to attract attention from recruiters. At week's
end, he was selected for the prestigious underclass game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That week is still my most vivid memory,'' he said. ``I walked
in and saw the lights and it was everything I dreamed about Nike
Camp. The lights, the huge dome, the college coaches and all the
players you read about. I was hungry. I wanted to prove I could
play, that I belonged in at least the top 200 players.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Health report: Davis will wear a metal plate in his right
shoe to protect his sprained middle toe. Otherwise, he's ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' he said. ``It's tournament time. It's no time for
excuses or being babies. Even though it's aching, I've got to be a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Ray Young will play despite lingering soreness
from a hip pointer suffered last week at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I'm not playing is if somebody tries to
assassinate me,'' said Young, whose presence is critical to UCLA's
pressure defense. ``The most painful thing is the first step when I
cut. But it's nothing that will affect my game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Late night: The Bruins practiced at home Tuesday morning and
did not arrive in Indianapolis until 11:30 p.m. It was one of the
smartest moves UCLA has made all season.
</P>
<P>
   By flying late, they avoided the delays, cancellations and
airport closures caused by a massive winter storm that dumped a
foot of snow in some parts of the Midwest. They connected in Denver
and landed here on time.
</P>
<P>
   But the late arrival, combined with the time change, meant
several players were awake until 5 or 6 a.m. Matt Barnes and Baron
Davis played video games, while JaRon Rush watched two movies _
``American History X'' and ``Face Off,'' which he now has seen five
times.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready for action: Reserve shooting guard Brandon Loyd has
sufficiently recovered from the bruised right (shooting) hand that
kept him out of the Arizona game. He and reserve Ryan Bailey are
preparing for extended minutes tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bailey because of his experience and Brandon because he's hit
big shots for us,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``Those two could
end up being critical. I may start Bailey because he played in the
Big Ten (for Penn State in 1996-97), and he could help us deal with
the pressure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sensing widespread support for programs to preserve
open spaces, lawmakers from both parties have offered competing
proposals that exceed even the Clinton administration's record $1.1
billion request to protect open land from development.
</P>
<P>
   But while many liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans
alike say they want to conserve land, their proposals are starkly
different, complicating negotiations on what may become the biggest
environmental spending program to emerge this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers favor spending most of the money in coastal
states, where offshore drilling for oil and gas produce the federal
revenue to pay for land conservation. Some would put large sums
into fish and wildlife programs that benefit hunters, or in
habitats for endangered species. Some would emphasize buying lands
in the eastern states, where the federal government owns relatively
little land.
</P>
<P>
   And the proposals differ in how much power they delegate to the
states, even allowing some of the money to be spent on development
rather than conservation.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences serve mainly to underscore the political
popularity of spending more on conservation, demonstrated by the
success across the country of ballot measures to buy open space and
preserve it for the public good.
</P>
<P>
   However the pending proposals are designed, they all would
commit the federal government to spending billions of dollars on
land purchases for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few lonely dissenters, mostly advocates for the rights of
property owners, are complaining that there is already too much
land in public hands. Environmental groups are generally
enthusiastic as long as the programs are not designed to encourage
more offshore drilling, which they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   And at hearings that began on Tuesday, Rep. Don Young, the House
Resources Committee chairman, who usually sides against
environmentalists and with property owners, said bluntly, ``We do
not need a quid pro quo from these groups to validate our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the committee plunged into the wheeling and dealing
over how much to spend, and how to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Federal land conservation programs are paid for by royalties
collected by the government from offshore leases for oil and gas
drilling. For years, the government has collected far more from
these leases than it has spent on conservation, using the rest of
the revenue to reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the deficit is gone, the Clinton administration and
Congress both seem ready to spend more of the oil revenue on
conservation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed to more than double conservation
spending next year. The $1.1 billion he would spend is a record
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., and Frank H. Murkowski, R-Ala.,
have introduced a bill in the Senate to spend $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Young, R-Alaska, and Representative John D.
Dingell, D-Mich, want to spend $1.7 billion. And two California
Democrats, Rep. George Miller and Sen. Barbara Boxer, have proposed
spending $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the House hearing, Young, the committee chairman, and Miller,
the ranking minority member _ who have fought many battles over
their environmental views _ committed themselves to working
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not allow this debate to descend into sniping at each
other's bills or motives,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, Clinton also promised to work with
Congress to create a guaranteed fund for protecting land.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The main conduit for the proposals is the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, a trust fund that pays for public purchases of
land. In the past, it has spent little more than $300 million a
year, far less than what is collected in royalties from drilling.
And it shared almost nothing with state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed spending $642 million from the conservation
fund in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, two-thirds of it in
direct federal purchases and one-third in federal contributions to
states that would buy land themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Young's bill would spend $540 million, half of it by the federal
government and the rest by the states. His bill would require that
one-third of the direct federal land purchases be in Eastern
states; Young believes that too much of the West, especially his
home state of Alaska, is already in federal hands.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's bill would spend $900 million, half in direct federal
land purchases and half in money to the states.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other significant differences, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Young's bill, like the Senate bill, would provide huge amounts
to coastal states for a wide variety of programs that he says they
need to compensate for the effects of offshore drilling. That might
include projects for water quality, fish and wildlife habitat or
other natural resources. But it might also help pay for public
works projects that assist the drilling industry or the communities
that support it.

AMGEN TO FIGHT PROSTATE CANCER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Biotechnology drug maker Amgen Inc.
said Wednesday it will spend $100 million to co-develop and market
a drug to treat prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced after the close of U.S. stock markets, is
with privately held Praecis Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge,
Mass. Praecis created the drug abarelix and has ushered it through
two of the three stages of testing necessary for the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to consider it for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Abarelix fights prostate tumors by reducing to virtually zero
the amount of the sex hormone testosterone, which has been linked
to the growth of prostate cancer cells in a man's body. Two
existing drugs made by Zeneca Inc. and Tap Pharmaceuticals do
essentially the same thing, but Amgen spokesman David Kaye said
abarelix works faster and has fewer side effects than those
products.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said abarelix is also in early testing for treatment of
endometriosis, a painful condition in women resulting from abnormal
growth of the lining of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts greeted Wednesday's announcement coolly. ``What's the
edge? I just don't get it,'' said AmeriCal Securities analyst
Charles Engelberg, who is himself an oncologist. ``This is the
third in a class of drugs that has some application in prostate
cancer, but by no means is it a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg noted that Amgen's most recent drug to market, the
hepatitis C treatment Infergen, likewise was a product entering a
niche already occupied by well-entrenched competition. Engelberg
added that the patent for at least one of the current testosterone
inhibitors will expire in the next few years, presenting abarelix
with a potential host of generic competitors in what is now an $800
million-per-year market.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said generics would be largely irrelevant to the product's
success. ``If abarelix were a me-too drug, that would be true, but
it's far from that. There is clearly benefit from working more
quickly. It truly is an improvement on currently available drugs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the blockbuster success of Amgen's first two drugs,
Epogen and Neupogen, each of which generate more than $1 billion in
sales annually, the company has sought new products to launch.
While Amgen's pipeline is considered full in the long-term, it has
few new drugs currently slated for release in the coming three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares gained $3.0625 Wednesday to close at $70.50.

2 FRENCH BANKS REBUFF $37 BILLION TAKEOVER OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Michel Pebereau thought he would crash the wedding, but
the happy couple told him three was a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, two of France's biggest banks, Paribas SA
and Societe Generale SA, said that an offer on Tuesday by their big
French rival, Pebereau's Banque Nationale de Paris, was a
``hazardous venture'' and that the offer ``cannot therefore be
considered as a friendly takeover bid.''
</P>
<P>
   The takeover effort was announced on Tuesday night as Pebereau,
Banque Nationale's chairman, offered $37 billion for the two
rivals, which had agreed to merge last month.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Paris Wednesday morning, Pebereau argued
that the new European single currency had accelerated consolidation
of banking and that the proposed alliance ``will allow us to
confront the competition on a European level.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the alliance would yield a bank whose assets, totaling
$1 trillion, would push it past UBS of Switzerland as the world's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is capable of dominating this sector on a global
scale,'' said Pebereau, 57, playing the nationalist card. He called
banking ``a sector in which France has historically excelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the hostile bid, Paribas and Societe Generale promised
to study the proposal and then convene their boards. Paribas hired
the investment bank Rothschild &AMP; Co. to study ways to repel the
bid, and Societe Generale said it, too, would hire advisers.
Trading in the shares of all three banks was suspended in Paris but
was expected to resume on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the two target banks, the bid threatens the well-laid plans
for Societe Generale to acquire Paribas for $18 billion in stock.
Investors have been skeptical of the plan, arguing that there was
little overlap at the two banks and that there was scant room for
cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   For Banque Nationale de Paris, the bid holds great potential. It
has been cut out of most French banking deals, and Pebereau is
desperate for a partner. Societe Generale is a well-run bank with a
good profit record, and Paribas is a respected name with a strong
consumer banking unit, Cetelem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the move poses great risks. The bid effectively puts all
three banks into play, and if Banque Nationale fails, it could fall
prey to a takeover. Moreover, it could face resistance from labor
unions and the French government. The bank employees union
denounced the plan Wednesday as ``adventurous and very serious for
jobs.'' For the French government _ which is preparing a sale of
Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank that has returned to profit
after losing billions _ the proposed combination would create a
retail banking giant that would alter the terms of any
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   And the bid could face resistance from Jewish organizations. In
New York, Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish
Congress, said that if the banks applied for a merger in the United
States, a ``great deal of sentiment'' existed in the leadership of
Congress to oppose it until French banks showed a more conciliatory
attitude in talks to settle issues related to the accounts of
Holocaust victims or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The banking alliance that Pebereau proposed involves keeping all
three banks' brand names and includes no sweeping layoffs. Banque
Nationale de Paris intends to retain the investment banking
activities of Paribas while combining its own banking units with
those of Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create a bank with 4,700 branches in France,
giving it 18 percent of the retail market and making it the No. 2
retail bank behind Credit Agricole. The bank said it expected
annual savings, before taxes, of $1.3 billion, or 8 percent of
combined costs, by 2002.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elie Cohen, an economist at the National Center for Scientific
Research, said: ``It's crazy, but Pebereau had no other choice. For
him it was a matter of survival.'' If the bid fails, Cohen said,
Banque Nationale de Paris could find itself the target of a bid
from a Dutch or German bank. ``If he succeeds, he will be No. 1,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale's bid is the latest in a series of giant-scale
transactions that are reshaping European banks as they struggle for
position in a market gaining cohesion with the euro. And there is
no sign of the pace slackening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bold, aggressive step,'' said John Leonard, banking
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. He said Banque Nationale
wanted to ally itself with Societe Generale, a goal it set last
year but failed to achieve when Societe Generale refused an
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the real winner, if the deal succeeds, would
be Claude Bebear, chairman of the AXA insurance group. AXA is the
largest shareholder in both Paribas and Banque Nationale de Paris
and would emerge as a controlling shareholder in a combined bank.
And Bebear, 63, a kingmaker in French finance, is said to want the
deal done.

-- Trash from New York City fills a land fill in rural Virginia.
Five years ago, Sussex County embarked on a controversial path that
many people believed would improve their struggling economy while
jeopardizing their beloved environs: accepting a private,
state-of-the-art landfill that would import thousands of tons of
garbage a day, much of it from New York City. (Andrea Mohin/New

implement a road widening project in Nakanojomachi. Japanese
leaders have traditionally funneled money into such
brick-and-mortar projects to stimulate the economy, so the signs of
life these days are interpreted by most experts as just a temporary
comeback, not a self-sustaining recovery. (Stuart Isett/New York

MILITARY-VACCINES, 3-10 -- Jeffrey Betendorf talks about his
reasons for refusing the Air Force's orders to receive an anthrax
vaccine in the backyard of his home on Wednesday. After threatening
him with court martial, the Air Force discharged him under ``other
than honorable conditions.'' Sixteen months after the Pentagon
announced that all 2.4 million military personnel, whether on
active duty or in the reserves or national guard, would be
vaccinated, the military is facing a rebellion from a small, but
growing legion of those who have refused. (Thor Swift/New York

explored. Landscape is the metaphor she uses to explore aging in
her new book, ``Another Country: The Emotional Terrain of Our
Elders,'' which will be published next week. As in ``Reviving
Ophelia,'' which is as much a social critique as it is a
psychological treatise, Dr. Pipher, 51, views aging through the
lens of the anthropologist she set out to be in college. (Kent

at Brock High School in tiny Brock, Texas, died of injuries
suffered in a Dec. 19 head-on collision with a pickup. They had
gone out for dinner and to rent Christmas videos on what had seemed
a carefree Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup driver, Rickey Carter of Fort Worth, survived.
Officials said Carter's blood-alcohol level measured .16, and he is
awaiting trial on charges of intoxicated manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Doug McWhorter said the deaths of his daughter and her friends
should make it clear to the Legislature that the blood-alcohol
level to define intoxication should be lowered from .10 to .08
percent and that penalties for drunken driving should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Criminal Justice Committee took the first step
Wednesday toward obliging the request by unanimously approving
legislation by Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, that would lower the
blood alcohol limit. The action on Senate Bill 114 came after
nearly two hours of sometimes tearful testimony from the girls'
families and friends in a packed committee room.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the room wore buttons with photos of the girls who were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the needless deaths of our daughters could have
been avoided if the laws governing drinking and driving were
tougher.'' McWhorter said in a solemn but steady voice. ``A person
must know that their actions have consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission today is to ask the lawmakers of Texas to pass
strict DWI laws so families like ours may not have to endure the
grief that we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax Welch, the mother of Whitney Welch, told the committee
members, ``If this law passes, and it saves one life _ and it saves
one parent, one brother, one sister, one grandparent from what
we've been through _ then it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also heard testimony from officials of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving and the Department of Public Safety, who said that
Texas routinely leads the nation in the number of fatal traffic
accidents in which alcohol is a factor. In 1997, the most recent
year for which figures are available, 1,748 people died in
alcohol-related wrecks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, legislation to establish .08 as the limit for DWI
was killed in a parliamentary maneuver by Sen. Eddie Lucio,
D-Brownsville. Lucio said Wednesday that he ``will probably vote
for .08'' this year. The bill has the strong support of Gov. George
W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which could reach the Senate floor for a vote as
early as next week, drew opposition from the American Beverage
Institute and some defense lawyers. The groups expressed concern
that social drinking could be criminalized and that
breath-measuring devices that detect alcohol might be inaccurate
when measuring amounts as small as .08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos said Texas stands to receive as much as $26 million in
extra federal highway funds under recent legislation that
encourages states to set the blood-alcohol limit for DWI at .08.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those who addressed the committee said stricter
drunken-driving laws are needed to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   The girls killed in the wreck were remembered as athletes and
cheerleaders in the community about 35 miles west of Fort Worth.
Two of their friends told the criminal justice panel that the
accident devastated Brock and left an irreplaceable void in the
lives of many of its young residents.
</P>
<P>
   Candice Sanders, 18, who was McWhorter's best friend, said she
was in another car only a few hundred yards from the four girls'
vehicle when the accident occurred. She said she remains haunted by
the vision of the swerving pickup and the fatal crash, which she
said might have been prevented if Texas laws were tougher on
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to wake up every morning, and all I have are pictures
and memories,'' Sanders said, ``because that's all that's left.''

FDA ORDERS CLEARER LABELS ON OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration is about to order
the drug industry to revamp the labeling on over-the-counter
medications, a move that will do away with dense fine print on
medicines from aspirin to cough syrup, replacing it with simple,
and bigger, text that is similar to the nutrition labels on food
packages.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which are outlined in a new regulation, are
scheduled to be announced by Vice President Al Gore at a White
House ceremony on Thursday, an administration official said. The
official said the new ``Drug Facts'' labels would start appearing
early next year and would be phased in over two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that this will occur very rapidly, with the
backing of both the pharmacists and the manufacturers,'' the
official said, citing experience with the ``Nutrition Facts''
labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this gets out into the marketplace, many of the producers
will start doing this for all their products because consumers
become very comfortable with it and, in some cases, will think that
if it doesn't have a new label the product will be old.''
</P>
<P>
   Current labeling varies considerably from product to product, is
often laced with legalistic prose and is difficult to read,
particularly for the elderly. And while over-the-counter drugs are
generally safe, their misuse causes more than 170,000
hospitalizations each year, costing the health care system an
estimated $750,000, the administration says.
</P>
<P>
   The new labels will take a standard format. They will list the
active ingredient in each drug, what the medicine is used for and
explain which ingredients are used to treat which symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The labels will tell consumers with questions to ``ask your
doctor or pharmacist,'' _ a nod to the growing role pharmacists
play in health care _ as opposed to the less specific advice,
common on current labels, to consult a ``health professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The warnings are to be written in plain, clear English. The
familiar phrase ``may cause drowsiness'' will be replaced with the
more direct ``you may get drowsy.'' And the common warning to
``avoid alcoholic beverages'' will now read ``avoid alcoholic
drinks.'' Gore, a stickler for eliminating bureaucratic language in
government business, plans to give the food and drug agency one of
his ``plain language'' awards.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers of America,
which represents over-the-counter drug makers, were unavailable for
comment on the new rule. But pharmacist groups praised the
administration's action, saying it is an important step toward
improving drug safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a standardized label is very important,'' said Susan
Winckler, director of policy and legislation at the American
Pharmaceutical Association, which represents more than 53,000
individual pharmacists. ``Over-the-counter drugs are safe when they
are used correctly, but there was a good amount of confusion among
consumers and health care professionals about over-the-counter
medications. Part of that confusion came from the fact that the
labels weren't clear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency's next step may be to tackle labeling on prescription
drugs, a far thornier issue that has already attracted the
attention of Congress. In 1995, lawmakers passed legislation
barring the food and drug agency from overhauling prescription drug
labels until at least the year 2000, and even then it is required
to conduct a study before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is, however, free to order labeling changes for
prescription drugs with serious side effects, and it recently
proposed a regulation addressing that problem. Even so, at least
one critic, Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's Health Research Group,
said the changes are not coming quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very dangerous double standard between what they
are doing on information for patients on over-the-counter drugs and
what they are not doing on prescription drugs,'' Wolfe said.

DUKE AGAINST 63 POOR DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In their search for hope, in their desperate
attempt to beat Duke, teams across the nation have turned to the
Blue Devils themselves, 1991 version.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Nevada-Las Vegas was the mightiest team in the land,
the unbeaten, defending national champion with a Hall of Fame coach
and a slew of future pros. Considered invincible, the Rebels lost
to Duke 79-77 in the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, that game stands as the beacon for those who
cross the Blue Devils' path. If Duke beat UNLV in 1991, they
reason, then Duke can be beaten today.
</P>
<P>
   They are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After facing enormous pressure and expectations all season _
would UNLV be the first unbeaten team since Indiana in 1976? _ the
Runnin' Rebels were exhausted when they reached the 1991 Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   They were weeks removed from their best game, a dominating
victory at No. 2 Arkansas, and had encountered unexpected
resistance from Georgetown and Seton Hall in the second round and
Elite Eight, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And although it wasn't apparent at the time, it is now: The
Rebels were a better team in 1990, when they thrashed Duke by 30
points for the title. In '91, they were without their frontcourt
enforcer, Moses Scurry; they were overly dependent on point guard
Greg Anthony, whose phantom fourth foul early in the second half
changed the game; and they did not have the hunger they possessed
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the small matter of opposition. The Duke team that
stunned UNLV had Christian Laettner, the nation's best player in
1992, Grant Hill, the nation's best player in 1994, and Bobby
Hurley, the nation's best point guard in 1993-94. All three were
NBA lottery picks.
</P>
<P>
   No team playing today has that type of talent. In other words,
there is no Duke '91 to beat Duke '99.
</P>
<P>
   So, are the Blue Devils invincible? ``Remember Tonya Harding?''
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Short of clubbing, it'll take an unlikely combination of factors
to beat them. Duke has a Hall of Fame coach, seven McDonald's
All-Americans and two more who should have been, point guard
William Avery and versatile forward Chris Carrawell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are head and shoulders right now above anybody I've
seen,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson said. ``When you have that many
talented kids and an outstanding coach like Mike (Krzyzewski), for
them to go down, it'll take a huge upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Trajan Langdon is hurting, if they aren't hitting from
outside, if somebody's hurt or sick or has an off game, they
replace him with another All-American. To put it in perspective, in
my 16 years, we've had seven McDonald's All-Americans, and they
have (seven) on one team.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does it take? Which teams possess the ingredients to
conquer the Devils? The equation seems tougher to solve than
Fermat's Last Theorem, but here's a basic blueprint:
</P>
<P>
   __ Offense, offense, offense: Sure, defense wins in the NCAA
Tournament, except when the opponent is Duke. No one's going to
stop the Blue Devils from scoring. No one's going to beat them
65-60. Won't happen. They have too many weapons and too many ways
to score, which explains their 93 points per game, tops in the
nation. If not center Elton Brand inside or Langdon and Avery from
3-point range, then it's Shane Battier and Corey Maggette slashing
to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   That means someone must score 85 or 90 points against the
Devils' stifling pressure defense, match their relentless attack
basket for basket for 40 minutes. That eliminates a
defensive-minded team like Miami, which is seeded No. 2 in the East
but cannot score at Duke's level.
</P>
<P>
   __ A proven point: The Blue Devils play fabulous halfcourt
defense. They deny passing lanes to the perimeter. They rotate to
snuff penetration. They're quick enough to double-team in the post
and recover on 3-point shooters. The rules that govern standard
halfcourt offense will not work; there are no seams to puncture.
Stanford's precision attack, for instance, would have no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems incongruous, the way to beat Duke's defense is
with chaos _ and that starts with a point guard who can dominate
with the dribble and create shots when all else fails. Duke thrives
on the surges spawned by its defense. Limit turnovers and you limit
the surges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to control the ball offensively, because
they're so good on defense,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a task for excellent point guards, like Michigan
State's Mateen Cleaves, Kentucky's Wayne Turner or Connecticut's
Khalid El-Amin. Duke would tear them up. No, this is a job for the
best of the best: Utah's Andre Miller, Arizona's Jason Terry and
UCLA's Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   __ Size at center: Containing Duke's attack starts with
containing Brand (18 ppg). Why? There's a better chance Langdon and
Avery will miss from 20 feet than Brand will miss from two feet.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy. Brand is 6-foot-8 and very strong. He creates
contact in the post and uses his strength to pin, seal and
overpower defenders. If he has a weakness, it's his face-up game.
He's not a great shooter from 8-10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's 7-foot center, Brendan Haywood, provided a
blueprint in the first of three losses to Duke. Haywood bodied
Brand until Brand caught the ball in the post. Then Haywood backed
off a step and played sound defense, moving his feet to keep Brand
from penetrating. When Brand readied for a short jumper, Haywood
extended his arms and forced Brand to shoot over him. The ploy
worked, although Duke pulled away in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, there aren't many Haywoods around. (He's a future
lottery pick.) A few centers who would stand a chance are Arizona's
A.J. Bramlett, Washington's Todd MacCulloch and perhaps Utah's Nate
Althoff.
</P>
<P>
   __ A master tactician: Talent is not enough; there must be s
special plan, an unexpected wrinkle, that disrupts Duke's rhythm
ever so slightly _ like the triangle-and-two Utah used to
discombobulate Arizona last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you need an elite point guard, so you need an elite
coach. Michigan State's Tom Izzo, Auburn's Cliff Ellis, Maryland's
Gary Williams, Connecticut's Jim Calhoun and Miami's Leonard
Hamilton won't cut it. This is a job for Rick Majerus, Lute Olson
or Tubby Smith.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally: Luck.

AS REBELLION GROWS, AIRMAN IS DISCHARGED FOR REFUSAL TO TAKE

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Calif. _ The short, happy military career of Jeffrey
A. Bettendorf ended abruptly this week. After threatening him with
court-martial, the Air Force discharged Airman lst Class Bettendorf
under ``other than honorable conditions'' because he refused to
take a vaccine that the Pentagon says could save his life one day.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is meant to protect against an attack with anthrax,
one of the deadliest biological agents ever turned into a weapon.
But Bettendorf, once a senior airman with an untarnished record,
came to believe that the Pentagon had never proved the vaccine's
safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after signing the papers that ended his service after
nearly seven years, Bettendorf said there were other jobs ``where
people aren't all over you, saying what you can and can't do with
your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettendorf is not alone in his defiance. Sixteen months after
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen announced that all 2.4
million military personnel, whether on active duty or in the
reserves or national guard, would be vaccinated, the Pentagon is
facing a rebellion from a small, but growing number of those who
have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Only 100 or so of the 218,000 military personnel who have
started receiving the first of six shots that are required have
resisted and subsequently been punished. So the Pentagon dismisses
the resistance as insignificant, although officials stopped
counting how many refuse the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of furious efforts by the Pentagon to tamp down
what it considers insidious misinformation about the vaccine, the
resistance continues. Efforts have included senior officers taking
the vaccine in public and an unusual memorandum to all marines from
the Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Charles C. Krulak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it speaks to the undercurrent of distrust of the
government and the military,'' said Lt. Gen. Ronald R. Blanck, the
surgeon general of the Army, the service that oversees the
vaccination program. ``Agent Orange. Nuclear tests in the '50s.
People say, `How can you say this is safe?' Clearly, we have a
credibility problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon requires a variety of basic vaccinations. While the
Pentagon previously has vaccinated soldiers against biological
agents, including 150,000 vaccinated against anthrax in the Persian
Gulf War, it has never before tried to inoculate the entire
military to counter a threat from a biological or chemical weapon.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that any army has ever used anthrax in
combat, but the Pentagon has grown increasingly concerned by the
threat of biological or chemical attack. Anthrax, a naturally
occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals, can with relative
ease be produced as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death
within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   A vaccine was developed in the 1950s and approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for general use in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The refusals began with troops in the Pacific and the Persian
Gulf, who were the first to receive the vaccination because of
their proximity to North Korea and Iraq, countries believed to have
biological weapons. The number of refusals is expected to grow as
the vaccination program moves to bases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To refuse the vaccination is to disobey an order. Each of the
services is responsible for its own discipline, but because
commanders cannot force the shots on subordinates, most cases have
ended with discharges, some general, some bad conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, in particular, has been hit hard. More than
two dozen marines in Okinawa have refused. At the sprawling desert
base at Twentynine Palms, Calif., another 10 have. Last Thursday,
one of them, Pvt. 1st Class Rafal Zelek, pleaded guilty in a
court-martial and was sentenced to 30 days in the brig and demoted.
After his release, he will leave the corps with a bad conduct
discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The resisters cite a plethora of reasons. They note that there
is no way to test the vaccine on the form of anthrax used in
weapons and they criticize the dearth of follow-up research on
those who did receive it in the gulf war. They also point to two
FDA reports critical of the vaccine's manufacturer, the Michigan
Biologic Products Institute, a state agency sold last September to
a private company, the Bioport Corp. of Lansing, Mich., which a
month later received a $29 million contract from the pentagon to
produce the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon insists the program is safe and effective, saying
the criticism of the manufacturer had no effect on the vaccine. But
the reassurances are not enough for people like Lance Cpl. Jason B.
Austin of the Marines, who refused to take the vaccination in
January with four other members of an antitank missile platoon at
Twentynine Palms. He said he read on the Internet that the vaccine
could cause sterility. A Navy doctor tried to convince him
otherwise, but Cpl. Austin remained defiant. He now faces a
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are small, the resisters can upset the
readiness of their units, particularly with National Guard and
reserve units, whose members can resign more easily than their
counterparts on active duty. In January, nine A-10 pilots with the
Connecticut Air National Guard _ a quarter of their squadron _ quit
rather than take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   At Travis Air Force Base, where Bettendorf last served, 11 of 40
reserve pilots in the 79th Air Refueling Squadron have refused to
take the vaccination, leaving the unit woefully shorthanded only
weeks before heading to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Bettendorf, 25, joined the Air Force after high school in
Arizona, expecting to make a career of it. But when he heard he
would have to take the vaccine, he began scouring the Internet and
the base library for information, compiling notes in two three-ring
binders.
</P>
<P>
   When he refused to take the vaccine the first time, he was
demoted to airman first class, fined and ordered to pull extra
duty. When he refused again, the Air Force began court-martial
proceedings. Mostly, he said, he worried about the vaccine's effect
on his health. He dismissed as publicity-stunts efforts by Cohen
and other senior officials to demonstrate the vaccine's safety by
taking their shots in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know what will happen to them in 20 years?'' he
said.

STABBING VICTIM'S NEIGHBORHOOD CONSIDERED SAFE BY NEW YORK
STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)  (rk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ To understand the yin and yang of gentrification in
the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn, consider two very
different types of recent visitors to the Park Place brownstone of
William Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   About eight months ago, Bullock said, two men pushed him inside
his home, taped his hands behind his back and robbed him. Then
there are his other frequent visitors _ the young, affluent-looking
people who pull up in cars almost every week and ask him whether
any houses on the block are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In the 27 years that he has lived in Prospect Heights, Bullock,
72, said he has watched his neighborhood rise and fall and now rise
again, each trend dictated by the prosperity of the city and the
ebb and flow of crime. Today, Prospect Heights is one of the many
neighborhoods in New York that real estate agents often describe as
``up and coming,'' attracting middle-class professionals from
Manhattan or nearby Park Slope who are in search of affordable
homes and apartments in a safe, convenient area.
</P>
<P>
   But the slaying Monday night on Park Place of Amy Watkins, a
26-year-old graduate student from Kansas who had come to New York
to become a social worker, has shaken the sense of security held by
many residents, particularly newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   People interviewed in Prospect Heights were both saddened by the
killing and stunned that the apparently random attack happened on a
block considered among the neighborhood's safest.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the slaying illuminated the odd paradox of
living in a neighborhood like Prospect Heights: even as rents rise
dramatically and apartments and brownstones sell for record prices,
residents also described boundaries separating nice blocks from
those that are considered less safe.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the police precinct that includes Prospect Heights
has reported dramatic two-year reductions in robberies and
homicides, Bullock said he was robbed four times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, citing the improved crime statistics,
said Wednesday that ``people in that community are safer than in
just about any urban area in America.'' But the mayor, referring to
Ms. Watkins' slaying, conceded that ``until they locate the person
who did it, no matter what I say, people will be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins was walking home from the subway at 9:45 p.m. Monday
when she was stabbed in the back with a kitchen knife in an
apparent robbery. The police said there were no witnesses, and
investigators had no suspects Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack horrified residents. ``I just pray they find him,''
said Catherine Jackson, 36, who lives across the street from Ms.
Watkins' apartment on the 400 block of Park Place. ``I want them to
find whoever did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins moved to Prospect Heights last September, joining
other newcomers, many of them young and white, who have arrived in
recent years in what had been a mostly minority neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper rent, bigger apartment, quieter neighborhood,'' said
Josh Feierman, 31, explaining why he moved to Prospect Heights from
the Upper West Side of Manhattan eight months ago. ``It feels
mostly like a safe and comfortable neighborhood. There are not a
lot of people out at night, so it can feel deserted.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of newcomers, many of them more affluent than
longtime residents, has happened without hostility, according to
many residents. Anthony Katchuba, 34, said he and his wife moved
about a year ago from Brooklyn Heights to Prospect lace, a block
north of where Ms. Watkins was killed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he always meets his wife at the subway when she returns
late at night from acting classes, but he also described the
neighborhood as mostly safe. ``There are a lot of nice blocks, and
then one block away there are blocks that aren't too nice,'' he
said.

   Inside Muddy Waters, a coffee shop on Vanderbilt Avenue that
opened about three years ago, the owner, Ntozake Lundy, 27, said
Ms. Watkins often stopped by for coffee. Unlike most people
interviewed, Ms. Lundy said the slaying did not surprise her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not safe,'' she said, noting that a close
friend who lives nearby was stabbed nine times last year by a man
who attacked her in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lundy said that the recent gentrification has improved
Prospect Heights, and that it has also helped her business, but she
said that newcomers are oblivious to what she called obvious
warning signs of trouble. She said that as prime blocks of Sterling
Place and Park Place have become fully occupied, the boundaries of
the neighborhood have expanded into more marginal blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young, and they don't intend to have roots here, so
that makes a difference,'' Ms. Lundy said of the new arrivals.
``They just don't want to know. They just want to get in their
apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   George Benson, 65, who lives on Park Place a half block from the
site of the attack, said the neighborhood was violent when he
purchased his brownstone in 1982. Once, he said, he was held up at
gunpoint outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said neighbors created a watch system in which at least
one resident would sit outside at night to keep an eye on people
coming from and going to the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Benson said the neighborhood is far more tranquil but not
without problems. The watch system has been abandoned, he said,
because people feel safer, or because newcomers have not shown
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Garstein, president of Warren Lewis Realty, a Park Slope
real estate agency with listings in Prospect Heights, estimated
that home values have appreciated 30 percent in the past two years.
He said he recently sold two brownstones, each for more than
$635,000, a hefty price but far less than the $900,000 that he said
such homes could bring in Park Slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as relative safety, it's New York City,'' Garstein said
of Prospect Heights. ``If you are walking down a dark street in New
York City and even if you are very cautious, something can happen
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, many people in Prospect Heights are simply grieving.
James Caldwell, president of the area's citizens liaison group to
the police, said residents will hold a candlelight vigil Friday
night, marching from the Seventh Avenue subway stop where Ms.
Watkins got off the D train, down Park Place past the spot where
she was killed, then to her apartment about another block away.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, Brigitta Krueger, 54, who has lived in
an apartment building on Park Place at Vanderbilt Avenue since
1985, walked by the site of the slaying. Flowers and two candles
had been placed on a nearby stoop.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was shocked and deeply saddened by the killing. But
she also said Prospect Heights had improved so much in recent years
because people like Ms. Watkins had moved there. ``I've noticed a
lot of young people moving here,'' Ms. Krueger said. ``It's nice. I
hope they are not scared off.''

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ David R. Johnson and Thomas K. Welch were
lionized in 1995 when, after three decades of trying, they
delivered to this city the right to stage the 2002 Winter Olympic
Games. But after that came a long, hard fall.
</P>
<P>
   An independent ethics panel investigating how the Salt Lake City
bid committee used cash payments and college scholarships to
influence Olympic officials has identified Johnson and Welch _ two
of the committee's senior officers _ as the central culprits.
Federal prosecutors are exploring criminal charges against them.
Their reputations are in jeopardy. And yet they have remained
surprisingly steadfast in their positions: they don't regret a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the bid committee's former vice president, said that if
he had one misgiving about how Salt Lake City won the Olympics, it
was that its officials were not more public and open about the
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have said, `of course we have scholarships,' '' he
said. ``It was a way of winning the bid, to increase our ways to
communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Welch, the former head of the Salt Lake City effort, said
his lack of regret in looking back matches exactly the lack of
guilt he felt when he was waging the campaign in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole atmosphere was, hey, you're paying homage to these
people,'' Welch said of the lavishments he and others bestowed on
the 114 members of the International Olympic Committee who decide
where to hold the Games. ``We don't like that, but that's the game.
That's the rush, if you want to join the fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City's long effort to join the Olympic fraternity _
sometimes brazen, sometimes comic, and all the while relying on
inside information provided by other Olympic cities _ comes to
detailed life in hundreds of pages of internal bid committee
documents obtained by The New York Times and in interviews with
numerous committee staff workers and volunteers. The documents, as
well as the first extensive interviews with Welch and Johnson, also
strongly suggest that many Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials
beyond the two former committee officers _ and within the Olympic
family in general _ had fully accepted the coarse financial facts
of what had to be done to become an Olympic city.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues regarding what happened here and who knew about it
are still unfolding. There are conflicting accounts by various
participants, witnesses who have yet to be questioned and
assertions of innocence or culpability that will not be resolved
until the various federal and state investigators complete their
work _ if then.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he told Anita DeFrantz, the senior IOC member from
the United States, ``everything,'' about scholarships and cash
payments; she said that is not true at all.
</P>
<P>
   An internal work paper from the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young
asserts that senior bid committee officials, including some leaders
of major Utah corporations, were fully briefed in 1995 about
questionable payments; they say no.
</P>
<P>
   Staff workers and volunteers who toiled in the bid committee's
dingy downtown offices say that everyone knew which IOC children
were on scholarship, who was coming in for their checks and when,
and who among the regular IOC visitors was the greediest or most
gracious; most of their bosses, excepting Welch and Johnson, say
they didn't know a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, about six months before the scandal broke, minutes and
handwritten notes taken during bid committee meetings in 1994 and
1995, including detailed discussions about the status of the
campaign in its final climactic months, were destroyed by the
committee's law firm. Officials with the firm have no explanation,
and characterize the destruction as ``strange.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all, in the end, may have been unnecessary. Salt Lake
City, which had pursued the Olympics for 30 years as part of a
broad economic development plan to build a winter tourism industry,
had actually pulled together a legitimate proposal that Olympic
officials across the globe concede was, on its merits, unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who led one of the
inquiries into Salt Lake City's effort, last week summed up what he
called the tragedy of the episode succinctly:
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials, he said, ``did not need to stoop to
the level of this improper and inappropriate conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW APPROACH: From Unsophisticated to Educated
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, when Salt Lake City was making its first run at the
Winter Games, for 1972, the bid committee commissioned a
translation into French of its promotional materials, including a
geographical description: Utah, the text said, is located in the
``Great Basin of the West.'' The translator hired by the committee
took the language a bit too literally, however, and used the
phrase, ``Grand Basin,'' which in French meant that Utah was in the
``Toilet of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was caught just in time when a professor at the
University of Utah was asked to look over the proofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you how unsophisticated we were,'' said Walker
Wallace, a retired businessman and former ski racer who was on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the city's longshot chances at landing the Games
were further made clear at a stuffy cocktail reception later in
1966, in Rome, when a salesman from Salt Lake City suddenly got it
into his head to approach one of the haughtier Olympic committee
members in the room, a European royalty figure. The salesman walked
up, put his arm around the IOC official and started talking up the
virtues of Wasatch Mountain powder snow.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace still recalls the rebuke that ended their conversation:
``Remove your arm from my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake's 1966 effort was more than unpolished; it was cheap.
The organizers scraped together $24,000 by selling Olympic pins for
$1 each, raised $5,000 more in donations, and created an
organization called Olympics for Utah Inc. that was designed to
appeal to French-tinged IOC with its acronym, OUI. The committee
even had $10,305 left over at the end, according to the two-page
audit that Wallace saved in his files.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, Salt Lake City became much more
serious about its Olympic ambitions. Once an isolated outpost in
the scenic West, the city was beginning to feel the need to make a
name for itself, local historians and civic experts say, and to
shed a bit of its insular history as the central city in the Mormon
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a powerful momentum from within the state
driving the Olympic efforts: economic development. The organizers
of the first bid in 1966 did more than simply start the Olympic
machine, economists and public policy experts say. They forged a
kind of symbiotic relationship that fed on itself. Going after the
Olympics created publicity for Utah tourism, and the growth of
tourism over the years in turn reinforced the rationale for going
after the Olympics and further enhanced the city's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Former Salt Lake City Mayor Palmer DePaulis said that people who
question the value of the Olympics now have forgotten how tough
things were _ the mining industry was sinking, while agriculture
and ranching were also struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics was looked at as something that would jump-start
the economy and help bring jobs and investment,'' DePaulis said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the three decades of trying, though, Salt Lake City
never quite shook the sense that it had some inadequacy or
provincialism to overcome, residents and former bid committee
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Welch recalled that as late as 1989, for example, Salt Lake City
bid officials showed up empty-handed at an IOC meeting in Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we arrived there, the Greeks were entertaining on their
yacht, with gorgeous hostesses,'' he said. ``Atlanta had rented a
mansion, shipped in furniture from Atlanta and called it the
Atlanta House. Toronto had set up a whole wing out by the pool and
were serving breakfasts, lunches and dinners to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was giving wonderful gifts _ I think there were
crystal vases and jewelry,'' Welch said. ``Bid cities each had
limousines. We showed up with nothing _ on a bus. We called home
and they went and got some letter openers for us and brought them
to us so we'd have something.''
</P>
<P>
   That insecurity was deepened by uncertainty over just how the
competitions were being conducted. In 1991, with a solid bid
package in place for the 1998 Games, Salt Lake City officials
received a letter from Patrick Hickey, the president of Ireland's
Olympic committee, who let drop that some IOC members had
contracted to sell their votes for a flat fee of $100,000 to the
city of Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of the vote for the 1998 Games, Welch said, he
was approached by Jean-Jacques Ganga, the son of the IOC member
from the Republic of Congo, who said he could help secure a handful
of votes for $35,000. Welch and others refused, in part because
they didn't have the money. Nagano won by four votes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in 1993, despite being the leading candidate for the 2002
Games, Salt Lake City officials were reminded that nothing was a
certainty. According to the minutes of a bid committee meeting, for
example, Ms. DeFrantz, the senior IOC representative in the United
States, cautioned against complacency.
</P>
<P>
   So the Salt Lake City rules evolved: Do no harm, take no chances
and say yes to just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we had was about getting the bid,'' Johnson said.
``All our money was to get votes.''
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGY: `We Had to Get the African Vote'
</P>
<P>
   Given how aggressively, and even excessively, Salt Lake City
came to pursue the 2002 Games, it is almost quaint to examine their
earlier records.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1991, for example, during the campaign for the 1998
Winter Games _ later won by Nagano _ Prince Albert of Monaco, a
bobsled racer and IOC member, arrived in Utah in jeans and flannel
shirt and with a disdain for protocol and limousines, former
staffers said. But committee records show that officials did manage
to buy him at least something. Johnson's reimbursement slip for the
visit records only a single stop, at a 7-11, for ``juice for Prince
Albert.'' Cost: $2.73.
</P>
<P>
   Others, it turned out in the years to come, demanded more. They
were not denied.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City, working from 1991 to 1995 to at last secure the
Games, gave and gave _ at least $1.2 million to IOC members and
their families and much beyond that in time and attention and
personal favors.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Mary Alison Glen-Haig, a committee member from England, got
to play cards late into the night at the house of Salt Lake City
Mayor Deedee Corradini. The children of IOC members from Mali and
Cameroon wound up receiving more than $100,000 each in scholarships
and payments.
</P>
<P>
   It could all be quite matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   According to staffers at the committee, Sibo Sibandze, the son
of the IOC member from Swaziland, would with regularity turn up at
the second-floor offices at the corner of 200 East and 200 South,
open the door and ask, ``Where's my check?'' And the checks would
be cut: $250 one week, $590 the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew these guys, they came in weekly,'' said Jason
Christensen, a volunteer staffer. ``You saw them pick up their
checks. You took them places. You didn't have to be a brain surgeon
to know what was going on. It was always whispered, `Whose son is
he? How much of a scholarship is he getting? How does that work?
People freaked out the first time they heard about it. Then it
became second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   It could occasionally feel reckless, too.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1995, according to a list of bid committee
payments, money often was being spent with no support
documentation, including a $30,000 check for cash at First Security
bank for unknown purposes. Gifts to beneficiaries designated as
``various IOC members'' reached more than $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From February 1993 to February 1996, the bid committee paid
installments of $500 that totaled $14,500 to a Raouf Scally, who
was thought to be the relative of an IOC member. To this day, local
Olympic officials have no certain idea who Scally is or what North
African country he came from.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the operation run out of the charmless
downtown offices _ mismatched furniture, empty pizza boxes _ was
targeted and relentless.
</P>
<P>
   The bid's strategy, Johnson said, dictated that African
committee members be pursued, not necessarily because those members
had their hands out, but because they were the swing votes. Salt
Lake City's analysis showed that no city had ever been chosen to
host the Games without African member support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get the African vote,'' he said. ``We had to get
them early, get it done, maintain contact and maintain momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more than just a plan. Bid committee officials
also had detailed personal information on their IOC targets, from
the dossiers prepared by previous bid cities such as Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Of David Sibandze, the IOC member from Swaziland who resigned
under threat of expulsion in February, one dossier said, ``Always
made reference that he has a big mortgage to pay during visits to
1996 candidate cities. Bad reputation. Insincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Other files offered more innocent insights for gaining favor: of
Anton Geesink of the Netherlands, one dossier said, ``Loves to get
the opportunity for group sing-alongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, though, cut to the chase. ``Doesn't speak much English,''
a scouting report said of Sergio Santander Fantani of Chile,
another committee member who since has been expelled. ``But managed
to understand him to say, `Salt Lake must win.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City bid committee officials say they were just as
straightforward about their campaign when talking to people in the
Olympic family. Johnson, for instance, insists he kept Ms.
DeFrantz, the senior American IOC member, updated in detail. He
said she would frequently ask him which way the members were
leaning and what it had taken to gain their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1992 to 1995, every time we had an IOC member visit Salt
Lake, she either flew to Salt Lake or during their visit would talk
to them on the telephone,'' Johnson said, referring to Ms.
DeFrantz. ``She would call me and ask, `Was he good or was he bad?'
She wanted to know if someone had asked us to do something that
would put us in a difficult position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If an IOC member had asked or demanded favors, Johnson said that
Ms. DeFrantz's response was, ``That's not good,' or something like
that. She didn't say, `Don't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's charge is explosive. If Ms. DeFrantz knew of the
misconduct in Salt Lake City and did nothing to report or correct
it, her reputation as one of the most powerful and upright figures
in international sport could be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, Ms. DeFrantz emphatically refuted
Johnson's claims. She stated that Johnson was lying. She said she
did know that one or more children of IOC members were attending
schools in Utah on scholarship, but assumed they had been earned on
their merits and were not being underwritten by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never asked if it was okay, or if they should do
anything, or if it was a way to win the games,'' she said. ``Those
discussions never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   RELATIONSHIPS: Ties That Bind And Pull Apart
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to imagine a world where a scrappy, effusive attorney
from Ogden, Utah, named Tom Welch would live an entire life and
never meet a mercurial politician from the Congo Republic named
Jean-Claude Ganga. But given the logic and machinery of the Olympic
site selection process that existed in the 1990s, it may be hard to
imagine anything else.
</P>
<P>
   For the Salt Lake City bid committee, Welch was the preeminent
giver of gifts and cash, Ganga the preeminent taker. Of the $15
million that the bid committee spent in winning the 2002 Winter
Games, Ganga got more than anyone _ at least $250,000, according to
the board of ethics report in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch and Ganga _ and the relationship that bound them _
were also far more complex than the dry text of ledger sheets and
investigative reports have suggested. Indeed, they were much alike:
both men of large gestures and appetites, both capable, it seems,
of the grand impulse one moment and an outright improper one the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, 64, made his reputation in Africa as a fighter against
the apartheid system. He once stood on a makeshift athletic field,
watching with tears streaming down his face as a group of barefoot
boys tried to play soccer with a homemade ball of weeds and duct
tape, according to Welch, who was there.
</P>
<P>
   Within the bid committee, however, Ganga was known by staff
members as ``the human vacuum cleaner,'' for his ability to take in
whatever crossed his path. When he came to town, staffers, with an
effort at comic cynicism, called it ``Ganga time.'' He took
thousands of dollars of free medical care, from hepatitis treatment
for himself to a knee replacement for his mother-in-law. He was put
up in an apartment in Salt Lake City, and after the family
departed, the Gangas' appliances were handed out. One staff member
got a toaster, another a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, a 54-year-old former corporate lawyer who resigned from
the organizing committee in 1997, after a charge of spousal abuse,
was singled out by the Salt Lake City ethics panel for unethical
and improper behavior that ranged from handing out cash for IOC
votes to setting up an investment fund in which he and Ganga were
to share the benefit. Welch admits he was free with other people's
money. He once spent $30,000 on the street in a single night on
Utah Jazz playoff tickets for 30 guests, charging the committee for
``marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But like Ganga, he had another side, too: He spent 10 obsessive
years attempting to bring the Games to Salt Lake City, five of them
without taking any pay. And the same ethics report that condemned
his actions also conceded that he never attempted to enrich himself
through the Olympic process; the investment fund with Ganga existed
in name only.
</P>
<P>
   In the strange theater of the Olympics, each man had a role to
play. In the letters and faxes that Welch and Ganga exchanged, they
circle one another, sometimes like adversaries or hagglers,
sometimes like real friends.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1994 letter to Welch from his home in Brazzaville, for
example, Ganga wrote of the war that was tearing his country apart.
The city was blockaded. Food and medicines were in short supply and
Ganga asked only that Welch try to pressure the U.S. government
into a formal condemnation of the killings. Money was not
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Another exchange of letters, in April 1992, was all about money.
Ganga complained that he couldn't afford to fly to Montreal to
attend a wedding, and then, after a $4,700 check was sent, wrote
back with effusive thanks. ``As the saying goes, a friend in need
is a friend indeed,'' Ganga wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the relationships that formed here were simply a
cover for the buying and selling of the Olympic Games, real lives
were touched, a very human fact that has got buried under the
avalanche of embarrassment and anger.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, for example, Bob Hunter, the director of
community affairs for the bid committee, took in the son of an IOC
member from Libya, Suhel Attarabulsi, who had come to the United
States to attend college at the Salt Lake City bid committee's
expense. Hunter said he made speeches all over the state talking
about Suhel and his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fell to me to look after him,'' Hunter said. ``Our family
became acquainted with him and fell in love with him. He became
like our adopted son. He spent Christmas and summer vacations _
we've got his baby picture sitting on the piano in our living room.
That's the story I've told all across the state of Utah. That's why
it shocks me for people to say we didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Welch and Ganga have defended themselves. Ganga said
through a spokesman, Ibrahim Soumare, that he received cash because
the banking system in Congo Republic was unreliable, and that the
money was sent to various Olympic committees in Africa. Welch says
he was trying to win the bid in the way he had been told it had to
be done, but that he was also trying to make a real contribution to
poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   Through the filter of money and hindsight, however, it's hard
tell what's real. Welch, who described Ganga as a man with ``a
heart as big as all outdoors,'' also admits he was thrilled when
the IOC courtship was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the exhilaration I felt when the last member
from the last visit was put on the plane,'' he said. ``I subjected
myself to more people's pompous outlooks.''
</P>
<P>
   UNRAVELING: Questions Are Asked, Notes Are Destroyed
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge of what the bid committee was doing in chasing its
Olympic bid flowed like a river with no predetermined course _ full
of switchbacks and dry washes and dead ends. Information would
bubble up from the ground, only to sink again without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   In late July 1995, for example, one month after Salt Lake City
had won the Games, even as people here were still basking in the
euphoria of their victory, auditors from Ernst &AMP; Young, who were
working on their annual report to close the bid committee's books,
came across some puzzling and poorly documented accounting entries.
They consequently drew up a list of those expenditures, which
totaled $271,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ernst &AMP; Young auditors had pinpointed the very names and
amounts that have since become the heart of the Olympic scandal:
The so-called National Olympic Committee program. There on their
worksheet were cash recipients, including Ganga and all the IOC
scholarship students.
</P>
<P>
   The work papers that the auditors produced as they explored the
disbursements also included their handwritten notes, which
apparently reflected the information that they were gathering as
they attempted to determine what the payments had been about. Those
notes, which have been given to federal investigators in the case,
indicate that members of both the bid committee's audit committee
as well as at least one of its three-member executive committee
leaders were informed of the payments and approved them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed the NOC program with management, the audit
committee, and certain members of the executive committee,'' one of
the auditors wrote. ``Each individual disbursement is reviewed and
approved by the management of the committee,'' the auditor
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The people mentioned in the auditors' papers as having been
specifically told about the scholarship program in 1995 say they
received no such warnings. G. Frank Joklik, the former chairman of
the board of trustees, has maintained he was not aware of
wrongdoing; James Beardall, the chairman of the bid committee's
audit committee, said he was never notified of any questionable
expenditures of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no recollection whatsoever of any details of this kind
being brought to my attention,'' Joklik said of the auditor's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that that cannot be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's being denied, we had a powerful committee,''
he said of his superiors. ``They have run major corporations. They
are good managers. They required information and justifications
about everything we did.''
</P>
<P>
   What the work papers clearly reveal, however, is that auditors
were satisfied at the time that those people knew, and thus, at
least from an accounting standpoint, no one was cutting
unauthorized checks.
</P>
<P>
   But still the story stayed locked within bid committee walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bullock, a member of the board of trustees, was the next one
to try and break it free. On several occasions beginning in 1995
through last year, he said he told the board of trustees and Utah
Gov. Michael Leavitt of his concerns about the bogus scholarship
program. Bullock said he also complained to the governor's top
aide, Vicki Varela, in 1998 about the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought I was a little `out there,' chasing ghosts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former City Council member who worked with
Bullock, recalled his distress at not being listened to, and how he
often returned from meetings with the board emotionally ``bruised
and bloodied.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who often participated in public functions with
the very people receiving the improper scholarships and other
inducements, has said no one came to him with suspicions, and that
he would have done something immediately if he had had any idea.

IS UCLA DESTINED FOR EARLY EXIT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The most popular upset pick in the NCAA
Tournament involves the team in blue and gold. The Bruins know it,
they've heard it and they don't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just hate us, basically, because we're UCLA,'' guard
Baron Davis said, grinning. ``We're young and we're all good
looking. For some reason, people don't like us.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the oddsmakers, who have installed No. 5-seed UCLA
as a 2{-point favorite tonight against No. 12 Detroit _ a small
school (enrollment: 7,000) from a small conference (Midwestern
Collegiate) with a tiny tournament history and a one-eyed ex-coach
(Dick Vitale).
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, however, there are plenty of reasons to
believe the Bruins won't survive the night. At least, that's what
their coach claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have your head in the sand not to know Detroit's
the most dangerous team in the tournament,'' Steve Lavin said. ``We
feel like the underdog this year even though we are the No. 5 seed.
This is an unusual feeling for us, but we are a very young team,
youngest in the field of 64, and Detroit on the the other hand is
very experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Why even bother?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Bruins have no chance. They have nothing in their
favor except speed, size, depth and talent. They've faced tougher
opposition than Detroit and beaten better teams. They have the best
player on the court (Davis), the best big man (Jerome Moiso) and
the deeper bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the reverse psychology,'' Titans forward Bacari
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   But eliminate the posturing and postulating, and what remains is
a contrast in philosophy and a test of style. UCLA has the superior
athletes and wants to run. It wants to play a frantic, ragged pace.
Detroit has the toughness and discipline. It wants to play at a
crawl and make each possession essential.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever team imposes its plan on the other will have an
enormous advantage. And history says the Bruins are in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After a 17-point season-ending loss at Arizona, they have more
questions than they did two months ago _ about their health and
their heads, their halfcourt offense, their defense, their
rebounding, their free-throw shooting and their experience.
</P>
<P>
   They rarely play well in this position, as a mid-level seed.
Since the field expanded to 64 teams, the Bruins have been lower
than a No. 2 seed eight times, and they've survived the first
weekend twice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they often struggle against tempo teams in the
tournament. Detroit doesn't run Princeton's hypnotic weave, but its
approach will be similar: work the clock, limit possessions,
smother the Bruins with defense and don't give them any easy
baskets. Make UCLA's halfcourt offense win the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same plan Miami used against the Bruins last year in a
65-62 first-round loss, and Detroit is better than Miami. The
Titans have four of their top five scorers back from a team that
upset St. John's in the first round last year. They beat Gonzaga
and they almost won at Iowa. They won't be intimidated and they
won't get flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to play smart and show some maturity,'' UCLA
freshman Ray Young said. ``We have to be crisper with our passes
and cuts against their defense, but we're not afraid of how they
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a little fear would help. Against Princeton and Miami,
the Bruins were guilty of lethargy, of not taking their opponent
seriously. A repeat effort tonight and they'll be home for lunch
Friday.

 SALT LAKE CITY: any idea.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so there the story appeared to stall again, until June 3,
1997, when a Salt Lake City Councilwoman Deeda Seed asked a local
television reporter to meet for breakfast at Lamb's, a downtown
landmark restaurant. There she told the reporter, Rod Decker of
KUTV Channel 2, that she'd been told _ by Bullock among others _
that children and grandchildren of IOC members were getting college
educations paid for by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Decker, a newsman in Salt Lake City for 27 years, said he would
follow up. He said he went to the committee's spokesman, Mike
Korologos, and asked if the story was true. Korologos said he would
check it out. When he called back, Decker said Korologos told him
that Johnson, the committee vice president, had said there were no
scholarships. He said he was told that some young people, including
some related to IOC members, had taken a tour of the University of
Utah _ that was all.
</P>
<P>
   Decker decided there was no story and let it drop.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said this week that he has no memory of the conversation
with Korologos, and Korologos has declined repeated requests for an
interview or comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Decker's call was a knock at the door. The world was
beginning to ask questions, and, in retrospect, Korologos' answer
was a tacit acknowledgement that someone within the committee's
leadership felt there was something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, something strange happened in the offices
of Ray Quinney &AMP; Nebeker, a prominent law firm in Salt Lake City
that was the bid committee's legal counsel. Pages and pages of
documents _ the minutes of the bid committee's senior management
meetings and the handwritten notes of the lawyer who was the
committee's secretary for 1994 and 1995 _ were shredded or
otherwise destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm's computer records do not indicate who gave the
order to destroy the documents, who carried out the destruction or
even how it was done, according to James Jardine, the managing
director at the firm and the man who had for years served as the
bid committee's chief lawyer. But the set of documents _ detailing
the committee's actions over the final months of Salt Lake City's
quest for the Olympics _ are the only files in that office to have
been so destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've interviewed everyone who has worked on it, and their
secretaries _ nobody has any knowledge,'' Jardine said. ``It's
strange. It doesn't make sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jardine said the destroyed notes would not have added much to
the record of what happened here. But others believe strongly that
the notes might have helped make sense of one critical question
that has hung over this city and the multiple investigations into
the acquisition of the 2002 Games: who among senior management,
including some of the city's most prominent and powerful
businessmen, knew of the illicit campaign to buy votes?
</P>
<P>
   INVESTIGATION: An Anonymous Source Reveals Corruption
</P>
<P>
   Someone with access to the committee's files still wanted to get
the story out. In late November 1998, a different local television
station, KTVX Channel 4, received a copy of a letter from an
anonymous sender. The letter, stamped ``draft'' on its face, was
from Johnson to an IOC member's daughter, Sonia Essomba, informing
her that her next tuition payment would be the last. On Nov. 24,
1998, Channel 4 broke the story, and local newspapers followed up
with their own stories about the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials, in response, portrayed the scholarships as
humanitarian gestures, and raised questions about whether the
letter might be a forgery. And so with the letter's authenticity
uncertain, the story appeared to fizzle again.
</P>
<P>
   But then about a week later, in Lausanne, Switzerland, the No. 2
official in the IOC, Marc Hodler, said in an apparently offhand
remark at a news conference on another subject that he believed
Salt Lake City might have paid bribes in winning the 2002 Winter
Games. In an interview with National Public Radio a few days later
on Dec. 10, Hodler used the word ``bribes'' again in front of an
American audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment, instead of being perceived as an aberration,
it turned into a crisis,'' Ms. Seed said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the story, and the list of questions it has raised,
has continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are trying to determine if anyone broke any
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has brought in an outsider
with Utah roots, W. Mitt Romney, a Boston-based venture capitalist,
to head up the Olympic committee with new pledge of full
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   An independent board of ethics created by Leavitt has determined
that knowledge was strictly limited to Welch, Johnson, and a third
man, Craig Peterson, who the ethics board said acted secretly and
alone.
</P>
<P>
   And a lengthening list of people _ from Welch and Johnson to
other staffers on the committee to officials with the national
accounting firm that reviewed the committee's books to the people
who served on a panel set up by the U.S. Olympic Committee _ have
said they are not satisfied that the full truth has come out.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Christensen, the volunteer, said he found it almost
inconceivable that Joklik, who took over for Welch in 1997 to run
the daily operations of the committee, did not know of the various
mechanisms in place to influence votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine him claiming he had zero knowledge of what was
going on,'' Christensen said. He added, ``It was such commonplace
knowledge among the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the chairman of a special investigation into
the Salt Lake City scandal, said he also believes many of
statements of ignorance ``strain credulity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the principal individuals were not a secret,''
Mitchell said. ``They didn't maintain two sets of books. Everything
was available to anyone who inquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, bid committee officials, and perhaps the most senior
members of the IOC, apparently thought they might be able to
control the extent of the damage even as it billowed around them.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, Johnson, who was called to Switzerland
after Hodler's remarks, said he discussed the trouble with a small
handful of IOC executive committee members. He then met with IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Of Samaranch, Johnson said: ``He told me, `You have a problem;
we have a problem; we will get through this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps they will, but they haven't yet. And as for the
leaked letter that sparked the maelstrom, an ethics panel report
last month concluded that it was genuine, but the source still has
not been revealed.

BANK CHIEF VOWS TO CURB BRAZILIAN DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The new president of Brazil's central bank
promised ``a frontal attack'' Wednesday on the swelling public debt
brought on by the financial crisis here, and he predicted that
Brazil would return to the capital markets in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting here with a group of foreign reporters, the central
banker, Arminio Fraga, said the worst of the ``recent turbulence''
had passed, and he pointed to a firming of exchange rates and other
encouraging signs in recent days. Fraga spoke hours before he and
other top Brazilian officials embarked on a trip to New York and
other financial capitals to explain Brazil's latest round of
austerity measures and seek a reopening of credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   A previous road show, led by Finance Minister Pedro Malan after
Brazil initially signed a $41.5 billion rescue package with the
International Monetary Fund in November, was not successful.
Investors and lenders remained edgy, convinced that the Brazilian
currency, the real, remained overvalued, and in mid-January the
government abandoned a fixed exchange rate against the dollar,
which has led the value of the real to drop nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that sharp decline, public debt, much of which is
calculated in dollars, has jumped to 53 percent of the gross
domestic product, Fraga acknowledged. A revised agreement with the
IMF, announced on Monday, requires that to drop to 44.3 percent by
2002. Fraga said a combination of increased revenue from the
privatization of state companies and declining interest rates
should enable Brazil to fulfill those obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our financial system is healthy and well financed,'' he said.
``That will, with the passage of time, produce lower interest
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised agreement with the IMF foresees an inflation rate of
nearly 17 percent for 1999. It also projects that the Brazilian
economy will contract as much as 4 percent this year. But Fraga
shrugged off that forecast as unduly pessimistic, saying, ``I think
we will perform better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Brazil should be able to meet an increased
budget-surplus target contained in the revised IMF agreement, the
equivalent of 3.1 percent of the gross domestic product, without
having to make additional spending cuts. ``Inflation helps a bit,''
he said, in compensating for the decrease in tax revenue expected
as a result of the nation's recession.
</P>
<P>
   Once the IMF releases the second installment of $9 billion from
the loan package, which is expected early next month, Brazil plans
to return to foreign capital markets, said Fraga, a former aide to
the financier George Soros. He predicted a favorable response,
saying that foreign creditors had already expressed renewed
confidence. ``Many have decided to maintain credit lines,'' he
said. ``None has told me lines would be reduced, and a few said
they planned to increase credit lines to Brazil in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian stocks rose in trading Wednesday, with the benchmark
index up 3.1 percent. The real settled in New York at 1.865 to the
dollar, improved from 1.93 late Tuesday.

TELECOM ITALIA BOARD MEETS ON STRATEGY TO THWART OLIVETTI BID 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Honing its weapons in the fight to fend off a $60 billion
hostile bid, the board of Telecom Italia, Italy's biggest phone
company, met Wednesday night to discuss strategies intended to push
the cost of a takeover beyond the reach of its pursuer, Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would release a statement on its
deliberations Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia's proposed moves _ which included a swap of its
common stock for shares in its mobile phone ally, Telecom Italia
Mobile, the conversion of nonvoting shares into common stock with
voting rights, a share buyback, and a sale of noncore assets _ were
laid out before company directors in Rome by its chief executive,
Franco Bernabe.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the measures, Telecom Italia was proposing to raise
at least 10 billion euros, or almost $11 billion, on the capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were intended to increase the cost of a takeover to
beyond the price that Olivetti, Italy's No. 2 phone company, is
willing or able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The measures must be put to a vote at a shareholders' meeting,
which could be called as early as April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti, the computer maker-turned-phone provider that began
its attempt last month, has argued that under new government
takeover rules, Telecom Italia is blocked from adopting
conventional defensive measures _ including a poison pill _ against
the hostile bid. But Bernabe was expected to propose the measures
to the board as part of the company's normal course of business, to
increase profitability and augment the return on equity to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's stock market regulator, Consob, would have to rule on
Olivetti's objections and the legality of any steps that Telecom
Italia might vote to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   Investors anticipating the company's moves drove the share price
up almost 2 percent Wednesday, to 9.915 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's bid, the largest hostile bid ever in Europe, remains
in its early stages, as investment bankers and advisers for both
sides work to assemble the necessary financing. Olivetti plans
shareholder meetings early in April to discuss capital increases
and bond issues. In addition to raising $25 billion in syndicated
loans, Olivetti must find as much as $15 billion by selling bonds
and more than $8 billion by selling its phone business to its phone
partner, Mannesmann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Bernabe's proposed measures, people close to the
process said, are plans for Telecom Italia to acquire all of the
mobile phone company's outstanding shares and a buyback of up to 10
percent of its own equity at a maximum price of 15 euros a share.
Telecom Italia owns just over 60 percent of the mobile phone
provider, and a combination of the companies would add to the
pressure on Olivetti to lift its bid of 10 euros a share. Moreover,
Telecom Italia's proposal is to pay shareholders cash, while
Olivetti's bid is 60 percent cash, and the remainder in stock and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe was expected to propose that his company, within a year,
divest itself of most of its real estate holdings and sell several
noncore manufacturing units and an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, major American and British investment funds have
thrown their weight behind Telecom Italia's efforts to repulse the
Olivetti bid, arguing that the price is too low, and that the shape
of the bid relies on objectionable practices, including burdening
the takeover target with immense debt, the continuance of nonvoting
shares and the use of cascading holding companies as a means of
corporate control.

 SPORTS COMMENTARY: JOE DiMAGGIO'S RINGS, BATS AND TEE SHOTS 
 (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Before he was to throw out the first ball at
Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium last July, the silver-haired Joe
DiMaggio suddenly arrived in the shadowy corridor behind the Yankee
dugout. He was wearing what he often wore: a blue blazer over a
white shirt with a burgundy tie, sharply creased gray slacks and
shiny black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look great,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't see how I feel,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He was 83 and he had pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   He soon recovered. When I visited him in Florida a few weeks
later for a five-hour interview, I noticed the gold
diamond-encrusted ring glistening on the third finger of his left
hand _ his 1936 World Series ring, his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My other World Series rings were stolen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While on a business trip in the early '60s, he explained, his
eight other World Series rings, along with some cuff links and tie
clasps, were stolen from his Lexington Hotel suite. But when he was
honored on ``Joe DiMaggio Day'' late last season, he was presented
with replicas of those stolen World Series rings, a gift from
George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``George read what you wrote about Joe's rings,'' DiMaggio's
lawyer, Morris Engelberg, told me that day. ``Joe was really
surprised, really thrilled.'' After the ceremony at what would be
the Yankee Clipper's last appearance at Yankee Stadium, he returned
to that shadowy corridor behind the dugout, sat down, opened the
box with the World Series rings and stared at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they beautiful?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Oct. 12, weak from the return of pneumonia, he entered
Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. Two days later, he underwent
lung-cancer surgery. He never recovered. Early Monday morning, he
died at his Hollywood home. Thursday, he will be buried in San
Francisco, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw him play baseball remembers his swing with that
long, flowing follow-through and how he moved across center field
so gracefully. As a teen-ager, I saw him play for the Yankees every
so often, and in 1981 I saw him play the way his Yankee teammates
did. As his teammate, in a golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He was 66 years old then, strong and solid. We were in the same
fivesome at the Super Bowl XV golf tournament at the Chateau
Country Club outside New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   We were playing well in the scramble format, but on the 17th
hole, a par 4 of 310 yards with a pond to the left of the fairway,
I splashed my tee shot. So did our three other teammates. We now
needed the great DiMaggio, as Ernest Hemingway wrote of him in
``The Old Man and the Sea'' to be great.
</P>
<P>
   He was, drilling his tee shot long and straight into the
fairway. Then he spun a wedge to within 10 feet. Birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that birdie, we finished second in the tournament. His
Yankee teammates will always remember his hits in his 56-game
streak, or in his 1949 comeback at Fenway Park, or in the World
Series, but I'll always remember that tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   I also remember how, before we teed off that day, several
youngsters surrounded him for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   With each one, he asked, ``What's your name?'' One of the boys
was named Bobby. More than two hours later, we were near the
clubhouse on our way to the 10th tee when that same youngster
suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Bobby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Super Bowl XXII golf tournament outside San Diego, the
great DiMaggio, then 72, signed autographs after hitting his tee
shot at each of the first dozen holes. Now, as we moved down the
14th fairway, a middle-aged man holding a white-ash Louisville
Slugger bat emerged from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   `` DiMaggio,'' the man asked, ``will you please sign this bat?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said, turning toward the man. ``I don't sign
bats.''
</P>
<P>
   He did sign bats, of course, but only at memorabilia shows,
which by then were his primary source of income. He commanded as
much as $250,000 a show to sign bats and other baseball items.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's your bat,'' the man said. ``It's got your name on it.
It's your model.'' He asked to see the bat and when the man handed
it to him, he glanced at the ``Joe DiMaggio'' signature burned into
the barrel, then he gripped the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got my name on it,'' he said. ``It's not my model.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned the bat. As we moved on, I mentioned that as a
youngster, I had a ``Joe DiMaggio'' bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right,'' I said. ``That man's bat had a thick handle.
The bat I had, the handle was very thin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And whenever I got a shipment of new bats,'' he said, ``I
sand-papered the handles even thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   But now my favorite memory of Joe DiMaggio is my last memory:
his sitting in that shadowy corridor behind the Yankee dugout on
the last day of last season, wearing his 1936 World Series ring and
staring at the shiny replicas of his eight World Series rings that
had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they beautiful?'' he said. &QL;

WASHINGTON MAYOR WINS POLITICAL POINTS FOR SNOW REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the biggest winter storm of the year dropped
as much as 10 inches of snow in some parts of the District of
Columbia, local residents woke up Wednesday morning to find _ could
it be? _ that streets were plowed.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to the last big storm in the capital, a 1996
blizzard that dumped almost two feet of snow, major streets this
time were virtually clear by the morning rush hour, and work crews
were swarming neighborhoods to open up side streets.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal? Here, it is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the district was so broke that only 50 trucks
were available to salt and plow, and many of them broke down,
leaving some streets covered for days. Private contractors refused
to work because the city still owed them money from earlier storms.
The mayor at the time, Marion Barry Jr., toured the city by
helicopter and pronounced streets passable, prompting many
residents to wonder what city he had been inspecting.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since then. Washington has a new mayor,
Anthony Williams, and its fortunes have turned around. When snow
began falling Tuesday morning, city officials had as many as 130
trucks and crews worked continuously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no comparison,'' Williams said of the efforts then and
now, speaking to reporters after giving a speech about the district
at the National Press Club. ``Back then, there was no real
mobilization, no real plans, and even if there were real plans,
there was nothing to mobilize. I think we have come a long way, but
we still have far to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics said snow trucks could have reached
neighborhoods earlier, the big sweep was a major political victory
for Williams. This is a city, after all, that has long grown
accustomed to poor services and whose day-to-day operations
Congress turned over to a financial control board in 1995. Williams
ran for election last fall vowing to improve city services, so to
many district workers and residents, snow clearing was an early
measure of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least having the main thoroughfares open is progress.
That's a step up,'' said Stanley Sloan, a senior specialist in
international security policy for the Congressional Research
Service, offering an assessment echoed around the city Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is not the first city in which snow removal has had a
political impact on the mayor. In Detroit, Mayor Dennis Archer
faces a recall effort, in part because of the city's lax efforts in
clearing streets this year. Mayor Michael Bilandic lost a
re-election in Chicago in 1979 after the city was slow to remove
snow from a blizzard. And Mayor John Lindsay of New York had
trouble winning re-election in 1969 after streets in Queens were
not plowed quickly following a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the city's former chief financial officer, has made
``restoring faith and confidence in the government,'' as he said in
his speech, a major thrust of his administration. In addition to
focusing on the big-ticket problems that mayors confront, like
substandard schools, inadequate housing and health-care for the
poor, he has also vowed to fix the kinds of annoyances _ like
irregular garbage pickups and uninterested city employees _ that
reduce the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Williams offered his grand image of the
district government as a well-oiled corporation in which workers
are held accountable for their production.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people really want to hear is how this government is
performing,'' he said. ``But if our government is fundamentally
broken, this vision will not become a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said improvements would make district residents
less likely to view issues through a prism of race.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a white city administrator resigned after complaints
that he used the word ``niggardly'' in a conversation with a black
colleague who said he heard a racial epithet that sounds similar.
After Williams accepted the resignation, he learned that the
administrator had not used the epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that incidents like that deflect public attention
from the district's larger mission, to improve services and hasten
the day when local residents might win true representation in
Congress. Now, they have only a delegate to the House, who has no
vote. The district is suing to attain full voting representation in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The city's success with snow removal may help in some small way,
and Williams offered it as a solid example of a city on the mend.
And he said the snow was good news for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps with rats,'' he said. ``A good snow and a good freeze
kills them because they don't have a house to live in. The only bad
news is, we'll probably have more potholes.''

BRAZIL RIGHTS GROUP HOPES TO BAR DOCTORS LINKED TO TORTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian medical associations have
begun hearings to strip the right to practice medicine from doctors
who took part in the torture of political prisoners during the
military dictatorship, which ended in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Based on government records and more than a decade of
investigations, the groups are seeking sanctions against 26
physicians who worked in military prisons between 1964 and 1985.
They are accused of violations ranging from the supervision of
torture to the signing of autopsies that listed false causes of
death for political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian rights advocates and news accounts describe the
proceedings as the largest effort to punish physicians accused of
such abuses since doctors who worked in Nazi concentration camps
were put on trial after World War II. Rights groups abroad have
enthusiastically endorsed the effort to revoke medical licenses,
which they call an important advance in holding violators
accountable for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolutely remarkable and historic development,
something I thought would never be possible,'' Jose Miguel Vivanco,
director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said in a
telephone interview from the group's headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, Brazil, like Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and
Uruguay, was ruled by a right-wing military dictatorship. Some 400
Brazilian political prisoners, about half of whom ``disappeared,''
died in custody, and surviving political prisoners filed about
8,000 formal complaints of torture.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was much higher in Argentina and Chile, where
efforts to punish doctors who aided the torture of political
prisoners have been largely unsuccessful. Brazil has also gone
further than other countries in acknowledging state responsibility
for rights abuses committed under military rule; in 1995, for
example, the government authorized payment of $158,000 to relatives
of each of the ``disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other South American countries, however, an amnesty
decreed here 20 years ago prevents the survivors of torture or the
relatives of those who died while in military hands from filing
criminal charges against their accused tormentors. But Vivanco said
the new proceedings ``send a clear message which could help to
discourage medical doctors'' from violating their Hippocratic oath
in countries where such practices are said to continue, like Cuba
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary proceedings, which began March 3 and are
expected to continue through the year, are a result of a 13-year
effort by the Brazilian human rights organization Torture Never
Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been resistance every step of the way, with the
accused and their allies trying to destroy proof and cover up their
involvement,'' said Edila Pires, president of the group's Sao Paulo
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information from former political prisoners, in 1990
the group asked the medical associations here and in Sao Paulo,
Brazil's largest city, to revoke the licenses of 110 doctors
implicated in violations. Since then several of the accused have
died, others have retired, some went to court to prevent any action
from being taken against them and a few have filed harassment suits
against the group.
</P>
<P>
   But the first of the cases heard, that of Dr. Jose Lino
Coutinho, a gynecologist who now operates a clinic here, ended with
revocation of his license. Coutinho, 58, was accused of overseeing
the torture of 11 political prisoners in 1969.

SPORTS COLUMN: TWO MEN WITH MUCH IN COMMON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Bob Watson was home in Houston early Wednesday
morning, when his phone rang. Joe Torre was on the line. Watson was
pleased and surprised to hear from his old friend, his good friend.
He had hired Torre to manage the Yankees in 1995 when Watson was
the team's general manager and Torre was looking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   They were friends as players and when Torre was a manager in
Atlanta and Watson was a player, Torre encouraged him to become a
manager and to move into the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was my idol as a player,'' Watson said. ``When George
Steinbrenner asked me who to consider for the job, I had a short
list, and Joe was at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   But this call wasn't a baseball call. Torre, not one for
chitchat, cut to the chafe. ``He said, `Hey, looks like we've got
more in common than you know,''' Watson recalled. ``He said, `I got
my biopsy back; I have prostate cancer.' There was a moment of
silence on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson's reaction was repeated throughout the baseball world
Wednesday. Even though Joe DiMaggio had died early Monday, the team
was primed for Darryl Strawberry's debut on Wednesday. After a
six-month bout with colon cancer, Strawberry's appearance was
expected to be an inspirational symbol of the Yankees new
imprimatur: tough, resilient, enduring.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry's moment was upstaged and dwarfed by Wednesday's
jarring news that Torre, the only manager with the temperament,
tolerance and perspective to manage the Yankees this well, was
suffering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a team regarded as invincible. Now, in the span of a
few days, with DiMaggio's death and Catfish Hunter's illness, young
and old players were reminded that life outside the lines is
fragile in an unpredictable way that neither uniform nor legacy can
protect.
</P>
<P>
   `` I'm not surprised by anything anymore,'' Watson said. ``I
guess I was surprised by this. Joe's on top of the world now. He
manages the best team in the history of the game. He just signed a
new contract. He has a new wife, they have a new baby.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Torre called Watson; he knew that he'd been there.
Watson was on top of the world in 1993 when he was named general
manager of the Houston Astros, the first African-American to be
appointed GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the top of my game,'' Watson said. In the spring of
1994, it was determined that Watson had prostate cancer and his
world was turned around. ``I got in touch with my spiritual side, I
looked at the way I spent time with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after his surgery, Watson returned to work two times
per week. Torre's diagnosis is too new to even discuss the various
treatments or the prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depends on what it is and where it is,'' Watson said. ``Right
now there's still too many questions. What you want to hear is that
it's still in a gland and hasn't spread. He was going to get a bone
scan Thursday to find out how aggressive it is, or if it's
aggressive. The biggest thing now is to try to cope mentally more
than physically, knowing he has this thing growing in his body.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be easier said that done. Even Watson admitted there
wasn't a time that he didn't think about his condition. ``I always
think about it,'' Watson said. ``You got that scar, you know it's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the great Yankee triumphs and great Yankee lore, the
franchise has always walked a pathos-tinged hero's path. No
franchise better exemplifies the mortality of the sports hero than
the Yankees. Babe Ruth frail with cancer, hoarse saying farewell at
Yankee Stadium; Lou Gehrig cut down in his 30s by a disease that is
commonly known by his name, saying farewell at Yankee Stadium;
Billy Martin's drinking and death in an auto accident; Thurman
Munson, killed in an airplane crash, and Strawberry receiving a
diagnosis of cancer last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former Yankees star pitcher Catfish Hunter appeared
at the Yankees camp, too weak to shake hands because of Lou
Gehrig's Disease. Thursday in San Francisco, the world pays final
tribute to DiMaggio _ the defining Yankee. Now Torre is faced with
the challenge of survival.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre feels as Watson felt in 1994, batting orders, lineups
and world championships are the last thing on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you this,'' Watson said. ``Baseball will be way
down on the totem pole while he goes through this. ``I just want to
be very supportive. This will be a difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he hung up Wednesday and got on with his day, Watson said
he told Torre that was determined to see him become a living
legend. ``I told him that we can beat this thing,'' Watson said.
``I'm living proof.''

A MIND FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ UCLA freshman forward Jerome Moiso and assistant
coach Jim Saia discussed many things during Moiso's long
recruitment last season, but the subject invariably returned to
Moiso. To his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Saia,'' Moiso would say, ``I can be good, but there's
something I'm missing, and that's the mental stuff. That's what I'm
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Saia knew it. He knew the 6-foot-10 Moiso, with his long arms
and soft touch, had NBA talent and high school insecurity. He knew
the Bruins would have to counsel Moiso more than coach him. He knew
that if the Bruins could combine American confidence with Moiso's
sharp European skills, they'd have an All-American.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it would be an enormous challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jerome had a lackadaisical attitude and somewhat of a
European (ie: finesse) game,'' Saia said. ``All his people told me
he needed to be more aggressive. I've thought about taking him to a
sports psychologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Bruins prepare for tonight's NCAA Tournament
first-round game against Detroit, the difference between success
and failure sits atop Moiso's shoulders. With center Dan Gadzuric
on crutches, Moiso is their only big man, their best shot blocker
and their best interior scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis cannot carry them through March Madness alone. He
needs help. He needs Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely important to what we do,'' Davis said. ``He has
to be a force inside, be our defensive stopper. I have a feeling
the tournament will bring out the best in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso isn't so sure. Then again, he never is. When he plays his
best _ Kentucky, Arizona (first game), USC and Louisville _ the
Bruins usually follow. But when February arrived, his body broke
down. He developed tendinitis in his right foot, near the arch, and
it spread to his left. He played in pain and lost all confidence,
bottoming with a 1-of-12 performance at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the Cal and USC games, then discovered the wonders of
a sports cream. The heat soothed his tender arches, and his timing
and conditioning returned. Last week, at Arizona State, Moiso
scored eight points, grabbed 10 rebounds and dominated the lane in
the second half. He was back to his pre-injury form _ or so
everyone thought. Two days later, at Arizona, Moiso was
ineffective, struggling with confidence and foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Which Moiso appears tonight?
</P>
<P>
   Prepare for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling right now,'' he said. ``I don't feel the same
way I did at the beginning. I'm looking for that. We need me
(tonight), and for the rest of the way. I need to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``it'' is, no one knows for sure. Perhaps it's
aggressiveness. Perhaps it's confidence. Most likely, it's a
combination of the two. But this much is certain: Moiso, born on
the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe and educated in France, is not
the first European player to lack these qualities. No one has ever
accused Toni Kukoc or Vlade Divac of playing rough.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Moiso is a product of his culture. European
teen-agers don't view basketball as a means to the good life. They
lack the determination of their American counterparts. Where soccer
is king, basketball is considered back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system creates that mentality because the sport is not a
social issue in Europe,'' said Christophe Douchand, a French
television journalist who interviewed Moiso two weeks ago at UCLA
for a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance.
American athletes go as far as you can without crossing the line.
That is not the case in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, the kids say, `I'm good.' In Europe, they say,
`I'm good, but maybe I'm not.' Jerome is as confident as an average
European player. But put him next to JaRon Rush or Baron Davis, and
his attitude is not as aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Saia and Moiso have developed what they call an
aggression scale. At various times during practices and games, Saia
will ask, ``Jerome, where are you?'' If Moiso is feeling confident,
he'll say six or seven. If not, he'll say two or three. Then Saia
proffers his evaluation and it usually includes the line: ``We
can't win with that _ we need you at a seven or eight.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about the best the Bruins can hope for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never be a nine,'' Saia said. ``That's just not him. But
that's all we talk about. We don't talk about moves or shots. All
we talk about is him being aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   If Moiso is going to regain his lost confidence, the time is
now. Detroit's center, 6-11 sophomore Walter Craft, is no match for
Moiso's skills. No doubt, the Bruins will try to establish Moiso
early _ something they did not do at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I cannot say that I'm ready to be the man,'' Moiso
said. ``I'm struggling for it. But I know I need to be that
person.''

BEING CAPTAIN MEANS NEVER HAVING TO APOLOGIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Aboard The Gift, leadership is hardwired into
the circuitry like the oil-pressure gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs are delegated right down to who cleans the topsides and who
wipes the trim when the Ventura family's 25-foot cruiser is at dock
after an outing to Anacapa Island or Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of life aboard The Gift is the by-the-numbers
approach. Bill Maxon, his wife, Dawn, and their sons, Devin, 13,
and Chad, 9, have completed the U.S. Power Squadron's Boating
Safety Course, and everyone logs time at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the power of the skipper, Bill Maxon, is
absolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the agreement,'' he said. ``You can't have 15 people
deciding what to do next. There can only be one skipper.''
</P>
<P>
   The power may be impressive, but there is a trade-off: The buck
also stops with the skipper. At the end of the day, it's the
captain who answers for the boat running aground on a well-marked
sandbar because the helmsman was unfamiliar with the waters.
</P>
<P>
   So who is best to skipper and who is right for crew? Is
skipperhood an inherent right of boat ownership? Should the captain
and crew's roles ever be rotated? Must the seniormost sailor always
be the skipper?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions being posed in a kinder, gentler
nautical atmosphere that is rethinking leadership. And the answers
appear clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   First off, the positions of skipper and crew should be assigned
to those with the right disposition and abilities for the jobs.
Seamanship and experience will determine the best captain; being
the boat's owner or of the male gender or the oldest person aboard
is of little consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skipper and the owner are often two different people,''
said Roy Garrabrant, rear commodore of the Coast Guard Auxiliary in
San Pedro. ``But the skipper bears ultimate responsibility for the
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need to look at the role of skipper and crew as
one of boss and underling. Instead, look at the relationship as one
between pitcher and catcher, conductor and musician, director and
stage manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders are people who do the right thing; managers are people
who do things right,'' said Warren Bennis, author of ``Why Leaders
Can't Lead,'' a book that speaks to the pitfalls of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper may determine that growing winds require a mainsail
to be reefed, but unless the managers (read: the crew) can reduce
sail properly the job will not be done. Or worse, it will be done
incorrectly or unsafely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one absolute to being a good skipper, I would say
it's that I never ask my crew to do anything I wouldn't do
myself,'' said federally licensed ship's master Frank Ursitti,
whose 60-foot Oxnard-based charter vessel, the Coral Sea, serves as
an education and research platform.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a good leader is someone willing to take a few
lousy orders and perform a few unpleasant tasks himself. The
corollary is that crew members must be counted upon to step up to a
leadership role when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Garrabrant and Ursitti share the belief that when it's due,
praise should not be handed out sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the situation, but you have to recognize
accomplishments,'' said Garrabrant.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning sailor Sharon Clark, a Thousand Oaks bank executive
who lectures on leadership, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've thought on your own and done something right, you
need to get the affirmation,'' she said. ``The leader also needs to
be clear when something's done wrong. But the old style of
leadership through fear has gone. Good leaders do it out of love
and true conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   With his military background, sailing neophyte Mike Williams of
Clearwater, Minn., had seen both sides of the leadership coin
before signing on as crew for a three-day charter to the Channel
Islands several years ago. Williams took a lot of verbal abuse,
especially when his inexperience during a watch at the helm off
Santa Cruz Island resulted in a potentially dangerous jibe in 25
knot winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I corrected the boat, the skipper came up from below, irate
and yelling. I held the helm steady to allow him to calm down and
stayed calm myself. If I would have gotten angry, it would have
ruined the trip and it would've questioned his authority, something
I knew I shouldn't be doing. For me, staying calm under fire is key
to good leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario brings up another question. Should a skipper ever
apologize to his crew over a bad decision or for having lost his
temper?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you apologize you come across as if you're
second-guessing yourself, creating doubt,'' said Clark. ``Just a
little bit of fear has been introduced. Even if you're scared
witless, you want to come across unshakable in what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   When giant slabs of green water are breaking at the bow and a
sail rips in 20-knot winds because you made a bad call, there's no
time for self-reproach, only sound corrections. Sometimes
leadership means never having to say you're sorry. &QL;

 &HT;    UT staff stage virtual walkout over pay
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jennifer Gill wore black, chanted loudly and
hoisted a sign that said ``Show Us the Money'' at a University of
Texas rally Wednesday to keep a spotlight on low staff pay.
</P>
<P>
   In her 11 years at UT, Gill, 46, has climbed the do-it-yourself
career ladder that many staff members follow: moving from one
department to the next to gain bit-by-bit improvements in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gill has reached an all-time high of $25,428 a year as an
administrative associate in the School of Music where she processes
applications, coordinates auditions and serves as the information
contact for undergraduate admissions. But a history of low wages
has left her struggling financially in a city where the cost of
living has risen dramatically this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just me,'' Gill said. ``It's many, many people. . .
.There are plenty of people at UT with master's degrees making less
than $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   She was among the non-teaching staff members at UT taking part
in a ``virtual walkout'' Wednesday to protest below-market pay.
Recent pay surveys showed that the vast majority of UT staff,
including custodians, secretaries, library aides and student
advisers are paid below average for the Austin market.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual walkout participants stayed on their jobs but posted
signs in their work areas stating what they contribute to the
university. Several hundred _ most of them clad in black _ also
joined a noon rally despite a steady drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you and look at the collective power we have,''
said Peg Kramer, president of the University Staff Association,
which organized the group's fifth demonstration this year.
</P>
<P>
   Staff are not alone in their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Several at the rally noted they came with the blessings of their
supervisors and support from faculty, administrators and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potentially great university would be lost without the
staff,'' said Mia Carter, an associate professor of English who
spoke at the rally. ``Every single degree granted by this
university has the imprint of many hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Smith, a graduate student in social work, said an increase
in staff salaries would mean ``boosting the quality of education on
this campus.''
</P>
<P>
   UT President Larry Faulkner has raised the lowest salaries from
$11,220 to $14,004 a year. He has said that increasing pay remains
one of his highest priorities, even if it means sharply limiting
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders have said UT should not expect a big boost
in state aid. Several local delegates, however, sent statements of
support that were read at the rally, including Austin Democratic
Reps. Sherri Greenberg, Glen Maxey and Elliott Naishtat. Dawnna
Dukes, another Austin Democrat, sent an aide.
</P>
<P>
   Several staff speakers said they enjoy their jobs but wonder how
long they can hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Mallory, 23, a library assistant who makes $16,400 a year
and has a bachelor's degree in psychology, said she wonders why she
earns so little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay because I love my job,'' she said later.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, a pianist, said she stays because she likes the academic
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be out in the cut-throat business world,'' she
said. ``I could probably make more money, but I wouldn't enjoy it
so much. Here, I'm surrounded by art and music.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a price.
</P>
<P>
   Gill has a child at UT and another at Austin Community College
but she can't afford to help pay their tuition. She also is trying
to dig herself out of credit card and medical debt. She copes by
working a second job at at a bookstore, sharing rent with a
housemate and avoiding purchases that are not essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pared my life down,'' she said. ``I make my own skirts,
I shop for bargains and I buy the cheapest gas I can. I don't buy
things. I don't rent videos, I don't buy CDs, even though I love
music, and I don't buy books or newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill's take home pay from UT is $1,659 a month; she takes home
another $425 a month from the bookstore, for a total of $2,084. But
her expenses each month average $1,904, including rent of $575, a
car payment of $222, a $300 minimum credit card payment and a $165
payment to her dentist for a bill that exceeds $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   She has almost no cushion for emergencies and no savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of sad,'' she said, ``that we run up these
bills just to get by because we work at the university.''

 &HT;    Why did she leave Haiti?
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Edner Doirin sat expressionless at the
Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office Wednesday, looking at a
Polaroid of a woman's face.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes were closed, her hair disheveled.
</P>
<P>
   He looked again and again, comparing the dead image before him
with a passport-style photo he carried of his carefully coiffed
young bride, Michaelle Dieujuste.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was one of 40 Haitian refugees feared dead in the
worst immigrant smuggling catastrophe in Florida since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   She carried a card with a name and phone number that led
authorities to Doirin, who said he was expecting Dieujuste to
arrive by boat last weekend. They asked him to come to the Medical
Examiner's Office to identify her Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two boats with 43 people sank 26 miles off the coast of West
Palm Beach before dawn Saturday. Three men survived. The U.S. Coast
Guard pulled two bodies from the sea _ Dieujuste, 25, of
Port-au-Prince, and a woman they believe is Immacula Fleurantin, 33
of Jacmel.
</P>
<P>
   Doirin, a tobacco and sweet-potato picker, left Rocky Mount,
N.C., Saturday to meet his wife. Someone in Haiti had told him she
was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7 p.m., while driving past Fort Pierce, he
received a page.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said two boats sank in the water,'' Doirin said. His wife
didn't swim.
</P>
<P>
   Doirin began searching the emergency rooms of West Palm Beach
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Why did she leave Haiti, he asked himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dieujuste earned a living by buying clothes, soap and lotions in
the Bahamas and selling them in Haiti, Doirin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Port-au-Prince, he said, ``she's got a home, she's got a car,
she's got no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she left their 18-month-old twins in her mother's care and
took her chances on a smuggler's boat.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky Doirin came to the United States in 1986 and has a
green card. He visited Dieujuste every five months of their
six-year relationship. They married two years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials told him it could take 10 years for his
wife to emigrate legally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She come because I'm here,'' he sighed.
</P>
<P>
   The woman in the photo, her features muted by a watery death,
resembled the woman in Doirin's wallet picture.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to see her body, but that's not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to see a necklace she wore, to make sure it was the
one he had given her, but the Border Patrol had collected it for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   At last, he saw a photocopy of a business card found on her
body. It was of the North Carolina garage where he fixes his car.
</P>
<P>
   He had given it to her so she could call the number if she ever
needed to get in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's her,'' Doirin finally said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to make it official, he signed the back of the photo.

MAKING BOOKS FOR VANITY AND OBSESSION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds. subs to rewite last graf)  By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Publishers are not yet madly bidding against each
other for the rights to books about making movies, but suddenly, it
seems, these and other movie-related books are popping up in
numbers that no longer can be ignored. It's a genre about vanity
and obsession: the conceit of the moviemakers and the infatuation
of those who, to a great degree, get their culture in the
flickering darkness of the picture show.
</P>
<P>
   Movie scripts and the novelization of them have been a minor
publishing accessory for a long time, although they are getting
even more popular, particularly during the Oscar hype. What's new
in the genre's growth are what publishers call ``the making of'' or
the ``companion to'' books about the production of particular
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The two classics of the movie-set genus were separated by 39
years. They are ``Picture'' (Rinehart, 1952) by Lillian Ross, about
the making of ``The Red Badge of Courage,'' and ``The Devil's
Candy: `The Bonfire of the Vanities' Goes to Hollywood'' (Houghton
Mifflin, 1991) by Julie Salamon. In each the writer had unlimited
access to the production and the reporting was rigorous and
incisive, ultimately at times to the dismay of the moviemaker who
had been bold enough to open his set.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been nothing in between or since that could be
called journalism in its most muscular form. Although the ``making
of'' books do provide interesting information for the movie fan or
the techie, they are mostly driven by the moviemaker's ego _
there's no critical analysis _ and are generally puffery, with
little tough reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for instance, in ``Titanic and the Making of James
Cameron'' (Newmarket Press) by Paula Parisi, a reporter and editor
of The Hollywood Reporter, a trade paper, the director is depicted
as a ``tempestuous auteur,'' a sort of combination Napoleon and
Humphrey Bogart. He is described as a hero who does his job amid
confusion ``with the quiet intensity of a tightrope walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times these books are subsidized by studios. Esther
Margolis, the president and publisher of Newmarket Press, which
almost specializes in movie-related books, said that about half the
titles she publishes have a guarantee by the studio to buy so many
copies. These are used for the studio's marketing, as a way to
showcase their movies for overseas distributors and for home-video
producers months before the movie is available. They have to be
approved by the moviemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometimes these books are best sellers. In the great popular
sweep of the movie ``Titanic,'' the debris in its wake included
``James Cameron's Titanic'' (Harper Entertainment) sold more than a
million copies. It was a species of the ``making of'' genre, which
is the increasingly popular glossy movie coffee table book with
beautiful photographs from the movie set and some text that gently
discusses, for instance, the research that went into making the
movie authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the first best seller in the genre was Ballantine Books'
1993 paperback ``The Making of Jurassic Park'' by Don Shay and Jody
Duncan. While the printings of most of these books stay within
about 10,000 copies, the genre has produced some big successes.
About 25,000 copies of ``The Men in Black'' (Newmarket Press) were
sold. In the book, the actor Tommy Lee Jones was said to have
``sought and found a deeper side to his character in the
screenplay,'' befitting a talented actor and a Harvard graduate,
and the director, Barry Sonnenfeld, wrote a foreword titled ``The
Aliens Are Us.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 copies of ``Saving Private Ryan: The Men. The
Mission. The Movie.'' (Newmarket Press) were sold, with about 5,000
bought by the movie studio for marketing. ``What makes them work is
the additional material we get from the scriptwriters and the
directors,'' Ms. Margolis said. Such cooperation is seldom
withheld, since the moviemaker has the final say on the book's
contents. A book, no matter how slight, is one of the great
validators: for a director or screenwriter to be interviewed as
Norman Mailer would be for a book is apparently a heady high.
</P>
<P>
   These books are not simply a matter of regurgitating the movie.
John Silbersack, the publisher of Harper Entertainment, said that
these ``making of'' books ``give a reader an appreciation that film
and television are genuine art forms,'' with their chatter about
production and screenwriting and special effects and with
interviews with directors and actors. Harper Entertainment does
book tie-ins with any studio, but mostly with its sister company,
Fox, a partner in the production of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant of this relatively small but growing part of book
publishing is Hyperion Books, a division of Disney, which publishes
not only books from Disney movies but also from movies of the
Disney-owned Miramax and Touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Miller, the Hyperion publisher, takes the high ground
on what can almost be called vanity press publishing. ``Miramax is
the only movie studio that has a brand name, in a sense, for
intelligent high-quality movies for adults,'' he said. One of the
Hyperion/Miramax Books spun off ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a Miramax
movie, is a small book of Shakespeare love poems, from the plays
and sonnets, with 57,000 copies in print. There are nearly 35,000
copies of the Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman screenplay in print.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion also benefits _ through Disney _ from the increasing
number of people who are becoming serious fans of animation
artwork. Thus its ``Art of the Lion King'' sold nearly 60,000
copies at $50 a pop, and 20,000 copies of ``Mulan'' at $60 each.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is but a lead-in to the tidal wave that will hit
book publishing in May when the first of the three Star Wars
prequels, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' will be in
the theaters. Ballantine Books, which has sold more that 13 million
copies of the first Star Wars novelizations, will have all its
literary satellites in print: the screenplay, the making of, the
novelizations, the picture books, the guide books and the
children's books.

NASA SHUTTLE MISSION IS MOVED UP TO REPAIR HUBBLE TELESCOPE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to avoid a ``science emergency'' with the
Hubble Space Telescope, NASA officials announced Wednesday that
they would launch a space shuttle to repair failing parts on the
orbiting observatory in mid-October, eight months ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the
shuttle Discovery and a team of spacewalking astronauts would be
dispatched to replace malfunctioning gyroscopes that stabilize
Hubble and allow the 12.5-ton telescope to point accurately at
targets across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for science,
said at a news conference that the $2 billion telescope itself was
not in danger, but its scientific mission was threatened by the
malfunctioning pointing devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a spacecraft emergency,'' Weiler said, ``it's more
of a science emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubble, which has regularly uncovered the mysteries of the
cosmos since its launching in 1990, ``is the crown jewel of NASA's
space observatories,'' said Weiler, and every reasonable effort
must be made to keep it functioning. While the telescope is now
operating normally, he said, only three of its six gyroscopes are
working properly, the minimum needed for it to perform its
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Two gyroscopes have failed and a third is acting so abnormally
that it cannot be relied upon as a backup. If one of the three
functioning gyroscopes fails in coming months, Weiler said, Hubble
will have to cease its science mission and go into a protective
``safe mode'' until replacement parts are installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one failure away from losing all science from the
Hubble Space Telescope,'' Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the risk of losing months of invaluable Hubble
data, wasting about $20 million per month budgeted for these
observations, made it worth spending extra money for an early
service mission. The October shuttle mission will add an extra $25
million to Hubble program costs over two years and $50 million to
shuttle program costs over the same period, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the Hubble service mission scheduled for
June 2000 will be split into two parts, with about half of the
planned modifications and equipment changes being carried out in
October during a nine-day flight. In addition to replacing all six
of Hubble's gyroscopes, astronauts are to exchange the
observatory's central computer with a faster, new model; add a new
fine-guidance sensor; replace an old-style data tape recorder with
a digital model, and change a backup radio transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   A second mission to upgrade Hubble's scientific equipment,
during which a powerful new camera will be added to look at small
objects and the solar power arrays will be replaced, will be flown
between December 2000, and March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   William Readdy, an astronaut who is the shuttle program
director, said the same four astronauts who were training to do
spacewalks for the original service assignment would fly on both
segments of the divided mission. They are Steven L. Smith, C.
Michael Foale, John M. Grunsfeld and Claude Nicollier. The
remaining crew members, a commander, a pilot and a flight engineer,
will be announced by the end of the week, Readdy said.
</P>
<P>
   It normally takes more than a year to plan a shuttle mission,
Readdy said, but the flight to Hubble can be put together quickly
because most of the crew is far along in training for it.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ His team lost 10 games along the way, double the total of
his first-round opponent here. The characteristic full-court
pressure went by the wayside early in the season because his young
team couldn't run it, and he benched a couple of seniors late
because he was worried they were trying too hard.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday, though, Nolan Richardson, college basketball's angry
man, was all smiles. However today's NCAA West Regional opener
against Siena turns out, the Arkansas coach already is feeling like
a winner this week.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger battle at long last has been won, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, talking to John Thompson and John Chaney and those
guys, all that effort for a while we didn't think it was going to
work out,'' Richardson said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it did. Earlier this week, a United States district
judge struck down Proposition 16, ruling that the NCAA cannot
impose Scholastic Assessment Test scores as a method to establish
qualifying standards for athletes because the standardized tests
tend to discriminate disproportionately against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The battle isn't over, as the NCAA will seek to have the
decision muted or reversed. For the moment, though, the
Richardsons, Thompsons and Chaneys have found at least one ally in
a high place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love standards,'' Richardson said. ``You've got to have
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the standards have got to be fair. Education has to be for
the poor also.''
</P>
<P>
   That stance, simple and logical as it might have seemed to
Richardson and those of similar mind, hadn't always been the stuff
to win friends and influence people. Richardson even conceded
Wednesday that his decision to seize the pulpit and speak out took
some of the joy out of Arkansas' 1994 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   His angry countenance didn't always play well with fans or
media. Certainly, it didn't make life any more pleasant for the
fellow who unfailingly took up residence at the heart of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back now and see what has happened with one judge's
ruling,'' he said, ``it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Richardson would like to have a little more fun. With an
odd mix _ three seniors and six freshmen, three of whom have played
prominent roles _ the Hogs have been up-and-down for most of the
season and are tough to handicap as the big show gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   They started 5-1, employing their customary full-court pressure,
before a 30-point defeat at Oklahoma convinced Richardson they were
not quite ready to use the whole ``40 minutes of hell'' package.
</P>
<P>
   Reverting to a half-court game, Arkansas won six in a row before
a defeat at Auburn. After subsequent losses to Mississippi and
Alabama, Richardson went back to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the bubble for a Tournament spot, the Hogs sealed
the deal by defeating Auburn and Kentucky at home within a five-day
stretch. A loss at Alabama let some of the air out of the balloon,
but the Hogs beat Florida and Mississippi State in the Southeastern
Conference tournament before losing to Kentucky in the final game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they hit the NCAAs as a No. 4 seed in the West. At 22-10,
they meet 25-5 Siena today 30 minutes after Iowa (18-9) and
Alabama-Birmingham (20-11) get the day started with an 11:40 a.m.
tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (20-8) and New Mexico (24-8) lead off the evening
session at 6:50 p.m., with top-seed Connecticut (28-2) taking on
No. 16 Texas-San Antonio (18-10) in the last game of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Siena finds one of the Tournament's enigmas, a team
with potential but one not burdened by great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors _ guard Pat Bradley, forward Derek Hood and guard
Kareem Reid _ are the leading scorers, averaging 14.4, 12.5 and
10.2 points respectively. Hood, just 6-8, has been the main force
inside, averaging 10.5 rebounds, while Reid manages five assists
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, from the Bronx, N.Y., generally is the best indication of
which way the wind is blowing. When he is on, the Razorbacks can
play with anyone, but he is given to be less than his best at
inopportune moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't so much good hype at the beginning,'' he said.
``But I think it's been a smooth ride lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid will be at the heart of the matter again today, if Siena
coach Paul Hewitt is to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we run up against great guards who have great games, we
have problems,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's freshmen hope to cause problems, too. Forwards
Chris Jefferies and Sergerio Gipson and guard Brandon Dean have
played in 95 of a possible 96 games combined, with Jefferies making
19 starts. Each averages more than 7.1 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   What next, then? Will March Madness bring out the team that beat
Auburn and Kentucky or the one that was blown out by an OU club
that barely made the field of 64?
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Richardson doesn't know, but he appreciates the irony in
what this postseason brings. When times should have been happier,
they weren't. Now, a fellow atop a Tournament dark horse is able to
enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time in '94, I was an angry person,'' he said. ``But I
had a reason to be angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm walking around on Cloud Nine, and I ain't played a
game yet.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, with practice about to begin, he stepped down from
the soapbox unhurried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, write about that,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan's happy.''

MICROSOFT LAWYER SAYS TRIAL IS GOING WELL  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outsiders may think that the Microsoft Corp. is
faring badly in its antitrust trial. But the case is actually going
Microsoft's way, according to an internal assessment sent to the
company's senior executives last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a long status report, David Heiner, a senior Microsoft
lawyer, said that the government had proved nothing, that the news
coverage was a slipshod distortion and that ``Microsoft will
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail report from Heiner to Microsoft's executive team was
sent on March 3, and it is mainly a point-by-point critique of the
case from the Microsoft perspective. The points Heiner makes mirror
the arguments that the company has made in court.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that Heiner had written and sent
the status report. In the past, internal Microsoft documents have
been intentionally leaked as a way to convey the company's views.
</P>
<P>
   The Heiner memorandum became public Wednesday when James Love,
the director of the Consumer Project on Technology, an advocacy
group that is critical of Microsoft, sent the e-mail to reporters.
Love said he had received the e-mail from a university researcher,
who had received a copy from a Microsoft employee.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Heiner's memorandum offers a glimpse into the
mindset of the Microsoft legal team. There are no self-doubts, no
apologies _ no sense whatsoever, as some have suggested recently,
that Microsoft has suffered a humbling setback in court or that it
might be eager to seek a settlement with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft have
accused the company of being a bullying monopolist that stifles
competition. Heiner says the government poses the real danger. ``We
believe that the government's case against Microsoft is profoundly
anti-consumer,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he added, has succeeded mostly in creating a
``lot of noise around various random incidents or pieces of
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prosecution's long list of accusations, backed by a
procession of industry witnesses, ``We believe that none of the
government's claims can be sustained on the basis of the record as
it now stands,'' Heiner wrote.  &QL;

JAIL INSTEAD OF PSYCHIATRISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<P>
   It did not take long after the vaunted reforms of the 1970s,
when warehouses for the mentally ill were shut down, for reformers
to notice that the mental-health millennium had not arrived.
Inmates were freed from appalling conditions behind institution
walls only to reappear on city streets, wandering at risk to
themselves and sometimes to others as well as to civic propriety.
The community health alternatives that were supposed to replace the
oversize state hospitals remained wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years ago, Geraldo Rivera was one of those who
contributed to deinstitutionalism when he exposed Willowbrook, a
New York home for the mentally retarded that came to stand for
warehousing at its most excruciating. Friday night he delivers case
histories of what he says represents the latest fashion in
society's noncare: confining the mentally ill in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rivera is in a relatively sober mode, his program's
production effects are as frenetic as ever, loading on the most
sensational images available of violence and commotion. That is
particularly unfortunate, not only for their slow-motion,
fast-motion triteness and their reminder of Rivera's reputation
before reform gripped him, but also because this time his material
is worth attention.
</P>
<P>
   From Louisiana to California to Tennessee to Colorado, he finds
people with schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses consigned
to the company of criminals rather than sick people. The
consequence for perhaps a million inmates, who Rivera says are
``caught between good intentions and broken promises,'' seems to be
at best inadequate care and too often abuse by guards trained to
subdue their charges rather than assist them.
</P>
<P>
   Especially painful are the accounts of parents who find that the
only way they can get some sort of medical attention for their
children is to have them convicted of a felony. Yet the examples
featured here of what goes on in the generally jammed prisons _
fights among prisoners, isolation cells and tough nonlove _ are not
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Rivera reports, the ill may receive drugs but not much
else that passes for treatment. A prison official laments that
there is nowhere else to send the afflicted youths. One despairing
mother calls the practice ``imprisonment for mental health.''
</P>
<P>
   A few concluding minutes are given to a model halfway house in
Washington and a plug for Tipper Gore, who is organizing a White
House meeting on mental health in May. These days reformers appear
to be focusing on luring or coercing the mentally ill into
treatment, pressure once resisted by civil liberties advocates. But
then, as evidenced by Rivera's work, exposes have a way of changing
with the times.

<P>
   SUSSEX, Va. _ In this quiet corner of southeastern Virginia,
sturdy farmhouses command vast fields of peanuts, soybeans and
cotton. Slender loblolly pines poke through the flat, wet terrain,
like celery stalks wedged into a marshy bog. It seems like a Robert
Penn Warren poem sprung to life.
</P>
<P>
   But if this county is rich in beauty, it is also poor in
opportunities. For years, the courthouse had no indoor plumbing,
and so little space that defendants occasionally had to wait
outside before their arraignment. No new schools have been built in
30 years, and teachers had to make do with antiquated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Sussex County discovered garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the county embarked on a risky, controversial
path that many people believed would improve their struggling
economy, even though it would jeopardize their beloved environs: a
private, state-of-the-art landfill that would import thousands of
tons of garbage a day, much of it from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A result, so far, is that the landfill, while still far from
beloved, now generates one-third of all annual local revenues _
more than $12.3 million so far in taxes and fees. It has enabled
the county to hold taxes steady, build a new courthouse and waste
water plant, and break ground on a $15 million high school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Sussex has found itself in the middle of a
multistate battle over trash that has once again prompted many
people here to try to reconcile their economic needs and
environmental concerns, pragmatism and principles.
</P>
<P>
   Trash has become a hot topic in an election year, with
politicians deploring Virginia's status as the second-biggest
importer of out-of-state trash. Egged on by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's insouciant suggestion that Virginia should accept New
York's trash in return for the city's cultural and financial
contributions, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation
last month limiting garbage imports. And last week, Sens. Charles
Robb, a Democrat, and John Warner, a Republican, reached across
party lines to co-sponsor a bill that would also restrict the flow
of garbage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most Virginians have applauded such antitrash, anti-New York
reflexes. But here in Sussex, one of several places in Virginia,
Pennsylvania and Ohio that import garbage, the reaction has been
more ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather not have it, but we're caught between a rock and a
hard place, because the county is in bad shape and we need the
money,'' said Bill Jenkins, 40, a peanut farmer who was eating
breakfast at the Virginia Diner in Wakefield. He initially opposed
the landfill; now he tolerates it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can we do?'' Jenkins continued, as the diner's
owners, Bill and Mary Ann Galloway, nodded. ``If we don't have this
dump, the next thing they're going to do is raise taxes on the
land. I don't see another solution.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, several of Virginia's rural landfills _ including the
Atlantic Waste Disposal landfill in Sussex _ faced no limits on
importing garbage.
</P>
<P>
   But under state Senate proposals, which have the support of Gov.
James Gilmore, Virginia would be able to limit a landfill's intake,
ban garbage barges on major rivers and regulate waste more
rigorously. The Robb-Warner bill, meanwhile, would restrict the
interstate commerce of garbage as well, and allow states to collect
fees on imported trash.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex officials worry that any reduction in trash revenues may
hamper an economy already sapped by declines in agriculture and
manufacturing, said Mary E. Jones, the county administrator.

 SUSSEX, Va.: county administrator. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Situated 45 miles southeast of Richmond, this county of 10,000
has long struggled to get by. One-fifth of the county's residents
live in poverty, almost double the state average. The school system
perennially ranks near the bottom. The teen-age pregnancy rate is
triple the state average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workforce is not that great, and you have a small working
pool to grow from,'' said Thomas Rose, 57, a lawyer who was having
lunch at the Thornton General Store in the village of Sussex.
``We're not going to get anything high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, Sussex has absorbed industries that more
prosperous areas would avoid: two state prisons, hog farms and, in
1994, the landfill in the county's northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to build the landfill sharply divided
the community: The final vote by the Board of Supervisors was 4 to
3.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still smarting from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sussex counts on the money, but sometimes you've got to think
above money,'' said Rhonda Powell, postmistress of the tiny post
office in the village of Yale. ``People are tired of getting all
these things to get money, instead of getting something more
acceptable. You don't want to be thought as, `All we can get is the
dregs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others, meanwhile, have grumbled that the county has received
less money than originally promised. But Ms. Jones said that
without the landfill, the county might have had to double or triple
the tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Now owned by Waste Management Inc., the landfill covers 1,315
acres, or roughly the size of Central and Prospect Parks combined.
Up to 50 percent of its 4,200 daily tons of trash comes from New
York City; the rest is from Maryland, northern Virginia and
Washington. About three-fourths of the trash comes by truck; the
rest by rail, said Jerry Johnson, the site's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the dump itself, New York garbage is easy to spot: an ``I
Love New York'' bag here, a mustard-colored bag from a Chinatown
noodle shop there, New York newspapers all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the dump, it is easy to find Sussex residents who feel
queasy about the landfill's odors, the trucks lumbering down Route
460 or just the idea of the highest hill in Sussex (450 feet)
rising in their backyard.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a couple of weeks ago that a Sussex-bound truck
carrying New York City garbage overturned on Interstate 295.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stinking up the place,'' said Floyd Edward Hardy 3rd, a
Bronx native who moved to the town of Waverly almost a decade ago
and now works at a Hardee's restaurant. ``I think that every state
should take care of their own trash.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain perspective, New Yorkers should put themselves in
Sussex's shoes, said Tom Raines, the county registrar and a farmer
whose family can trace its Virginia roots to the 1600's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell New Yorkers that we like this landfill as much as they
would if it sat in the middle of Central Park,'' said Raines, who
was among the lunchgoers at the Thornton General Store.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable to see why some Sussex residents are
prickly about New York. A couple of years ago, the New York Post
annoyed many people here when it described the county as a
``dirt-poor, dirt-filled'' place with a ``warren of tar-paper
shacks'' and potbellied residents who couldn't get enough of New
York's refuse.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bit unfair. Most people work hard to scrape by,
occupying small but well-groomed bungalows or mobile homes. They
take pride in their surroundings. They pray at the county's 60
some-odd churches, most of them Baptist. They also make this the
kind of friendly, leisurely place where a cup of coffee with a
stranger turns into a few cups, then some biscuits, then maybe a
full meal.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever the conversation veers from hometown pride, to
local affairs, to environmental fears, the same nagging conundrum
remains: Has the landfill been worth it?
</P>
<P>
   According to interviews with more than three dozen people over a
few days, the answer is a resounding ``Not Sure.'' On the streets
of Waverly, for instance, Thelma W. Wyatt, a former English teacher
who now teaches at one of the state prisons, initially voiced solid
opposition, then paused to consider the other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand the smell; we're supposed to have clean fresh
air in the rural area here,'' said Mrs. Wyatt, 54, who supports the
proposed curbs on garbage intake. ``But I think people have
accepted it, because they definitely needed a school, and they felt
that they didn't have much of a choice but to go with this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the peanut fields of Stony Creek, Marvin Wachsman, a farmer
who harvests timber, peanuts and soybeans, straddled the issue as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got enough sense to know that we've got no other choice,
but we're a little afraid about what's going to happen to the
environment in the future,'' said Wachsman, 55, who was nuzzling
twin newborn calves under threatening skies. ``There are no easy
answers.''

RUBIN, THE PRACTICE PARTNER, STUNS HINGIS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS, Calif. _ On Wednesday morning Martina Hingis, the
Evert Cup's defending champion, selected Chanda Rubin as her
practice partner for this afternoon's quarterfinal even though it
was none other than Rubin whom she was scheduled to face in that
round.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for complication was easy for the top-ranked
Hingis to overlook because, in her opinion, Rubin is the perfect
practice partner. And Hingis takes perfection wherever she finds
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, she could be a real champion, but in matches, she
just wasn't really able to put her game together and beat great
players,'' said Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   But to the great surprise of Hingis, the 26th-ranked Rubin
didn't leave her championship game on the practice court. Instead,
she took them out to the sunlit stadium court and used them to
inflict a 6-3, 7-6 (7-2) thrashing on Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was fallible on her backhand side, sluggish with her
footwork, and feeble with her ever-suspect second serve, which
Rubin demolished 15 of the 20 times she took a swat at it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hingis twice served for the second set, she couldn't
convert either attempt, and the ensuing tie breaker was just an
encore to what had unfolded before: Rubin, renowned as a comeback
artist rather than a front-runner, led the whole way. An unfocused
forehand return from Hingis at match point clinched an upset Rubin
readily described as the best victory of her injury-interrupted
career.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since she underwent wrist surgery in August of 1996, Rubin
has been in comeback limbo, unable to restore her game to its
former stability: she went to a career-best sixth in the world, and
was touted as a serious Slam contender before her wrist intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin will face seventh-seeded Steffi Graf, who improved her
record against Jana Novotna to 29-4 with a perfunctory 6-2, 6-0
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week I've felt like I'm hitting the ball well enough to
play with anybody and to beat anybody,'' said Rubin, who has won 13
of her last 15 matches, including upsets of 14th-seeded Conchita
Martinez and seventh-seeded Amanda Coetzer here before Wednesday's
dismantling of Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hingis: ``I was always one step late and too defensive
today; on the rallies with the backhand, I usually am better than
most of the players, usually I win these rallies, but she just
wouldn't miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin broke Hingis' serve on 7 of 13 opportunities. ``I wanted
to take advantage on her second serve, start the point off
aggressively, and overall I felt I did the things I wanted to do
out there,'' said Rubin, whose down-the-line drives and cross-court
passes continually flummoxed Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, who knocked second-seeded Lindsay Davenport
from contention in the second round, continued to rid the draw's
bottom half of its seeds: Wednesday's victim was sixth-seeded Mary
Pierce, 7-5, 7-6 (7-1). ``She's a powerful, powerful player,'' said
Pierce, who has often heard that comment about her own game.
</P>
<P>
   The men's event, the Newsweek Champions Cup, operated in upset
mode as well: Third-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain, one of four
players who had a chance of overtaking Pete Sampras at No. 1 this
week, was dismissed by Australia's Mark Philippoussis, 4-6, 7-5,
6-2. &QL;

SEARS SETTLES SUIT ON RAISING OF ITS CREDIT CARD RATES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ariz.)  (nk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. announced Wednesday that it would settle a
class-action suit from plaintiffs who contended that the retailer
had fraudulently raised the annual interest rates on their credit
cards after it had promised not to. Sears agreed to pay $36 million
in cash and issue store coupons worth $118 million to card holders.
</P>
<P>
   The company's large credit-card operations _ about 63 million
U.S. households own a Sears card _ have a troubled history. Just
last month, Sears pleaded guilty to federal changes that it had
illegally forced card holders who had filed for personal bankruptcy
to pay their Sears debt anyway. Sears paid $475 million in fines
and penalties to settle all suits related to those charges.
</P>
<P>
   This credit-card settlement was unrelated to the bankruptcy
issue. From 1994 to 1996, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill.,
moved many of its credit-card accounts to a credit-card bank it had
acquired in Arizona. When Sears transferred the accounts, it
changed the annual finance charge to 21 percent for all accounts
but said that balances accrued before the transfer would continue
to be billed at their old rates.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Sears sent a notice that it was changing credit
terms. Under the new terms, unpaid balances accrued before the
consolidation would be subject to the same annual interest rate
that Sears charged on all its other accounts. In some cases, that
amounted to a rate increase. Defendants in the class action
contended that the first letter amounted to a promise not to change
rates and that Sears was breaching the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In settling the case, Sears admitted no wrongdoing. The action
was taken ``to avoid the litigation,'' said Jan Drummond, a company
spokeswoman. She also said, ``It is an acknowledgment that the
communication we sent may have been misconstrued by customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising credit-card rates without customer approval has become a
national issue as the credit-card business consolidates into fewer
and larger hands and banks sell accounts to other banks, which are
free to impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear. But
the Sears ruling is not likely have significant effect on the
industry. ``The issue here is specific to them and their
literature,'' said Anita Boomstein, a partner at Hughes Hubbard &AMP;
Reed L.L.P. who specializes in credit-card law.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a nationwide class who were
transferred to the Arizona bank and who had not fully paid off
their balances when credit terms changed in 1997. All 11 million of
these customers will get a coupon worth $7.50 _ even though not all
of them had their interest rates changed. Three million customers
who had their rates increased will receive a combination of cash
and coupons totaling $23.80.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sears agreed to spend $3 million for consumer
counseling, protection and education. The settlement is subject to
court approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, Sears said Wednesday that it would
buy back up to $1.5 billion of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   The buyback, which will take place over an unspecified time,
represents about 9 percent of outstanding Sears shares. Shares of
Sears rose $1.3125, to $45, on Wednesday.

<P>
   They have been declared a team for the ages by many of the
coaches whose teams were destroyed by them in the regular season,
and they have put up the kind of numbers that inspire the
untouchable status they take into the NCAA tournament that begins
Thursday with 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke Blue Devils are 32-1, average 93 points a game, the
most in the country, and have beaten opponents by an average of
more than 25 points _ another national best. But that does not
guarantee them a championship, as their coach, Mike Krzyzewski,
acknowledges _ especially in the one-and-your-done format that is
high on emotion and low on historic precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 16 teams to come into the tournament with one loss
or less, only three reached the Final Four _ UNLV in 1987 and '91,
and Massachusetts in '96. None of them reached the title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be beaten by anybody,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I truly
believe that, because if I'm the other guy coaching the other team,
I believe I'm going to beat Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   One team has beaten the Blue Devils this year, while another has
come tantalizingly close. The Cincinnati Bearcats defeated Duke,
77-75, in the finals of the Great Alaska Shootout last November,
and their coach, Bob Huggins, said that any team hoping to beat the
Blue Devils will have to play the game of its life.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's coach Mike Jarvis, whose team lost to Duke, 92-88, in
overtime at Madison Square Garden in January, said a team that
hopes to beat Duke must also believe it can win.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those games revealed pieces of the blueprint for beating
Duke, and the tournament brackets are embedded with teams that can
follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have any weaknesses,'' Huggins said. ``The guy
sitting on their bench knows what he's doing. They have nine
McDonald's all-Americans _ I guess Mike didn't want a 10th. They
play extraordinary defense that doesn't give you anything. Maybe
they don't have a 6-11 shot blocker, but they got a couple of 6-8
guys who don't let you close to the basket. Everything you do has
to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   In their victory in Alaska, the first and foremost thing the
Bearcats did right was shoot the ball well. Guard Melvin Levett
scored 25 points, and as a team Cincinnati shot 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make a heck of a lot of shots because they make
every open shot they get,'' Huggins said of a Duke team that shot
51.5 percent for the year and 38 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm struggled in its shooting against the Blue Devils,
making only 38 percent of its shots, but Bootsy Thornton's 40
points _ including seven 3-pointers _ compensated for the low
percentage. What kept St. John's in the game was the way it battled
Duke's pressure defense with its own, which is what any
upset-minded tournament team will have to do. The Blue Devils force
an average of 19.2 turnovers a game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Storm pressured Duke into 23 turnovers _ seven of
them by the Blue Devils' point guard William Avery, four each by
Trajan Langdon, Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier. In the meantime,
St. John's took care of the ball, coughing it up only 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows this is a game of runs, and defense keys the
runs,'' Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said, referring to his own
Huskies. ``Sometimes it gets you over a team. And it keeps you from
getting run over.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is no consensus on how to play Duke's 6-foot-8-inch
all-American Elton Brand, whose intricate footwork and soft touch
down low give him polish to complement his determination to score.
Cincinnati leaned on him with the 6-9, 255-pound Ryan Fletcher and
let its shot blocker, Kenyon Martin, roam behind him. St. John's
blanketed the entire floor and forced Brand's teammates to make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In both games, Brand showed that he could be frustrated. Against
Cincinnati, he got only nine shot attempts. He had 16 points, 12
rebounds and seven blocked shots against St. John's, but fouled out
at the end of regulation.n
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important factor for an upset-minded team is
the belief that it can win. There are several squads in the
tournament that are not only deep and defensive-minded, but fit
that psychological profile. The most prominent is Cincinnati,
which, as the No. 3 seed in the East, could meet the Blue Devils in
the regional finals next weekend at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys started smiling a little bit around the room when we
saw that potential matchup,'' said Levett, who slammed home the
game-winner in Alaska. ``Of course, you want to go out and prove to
everybody that the first time was for real. If the day ever comes,
we'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Hurricanes also have proved that they are hard-nosed
and poised enough to outlast very good teams. They swept St. John's
in the regular season, beat Connecticut on the road and likely will
play Cincinnati in the East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest region, two teams that could test the Blue Devils
are Kentucky and Arizona. Both sets of Wildcats are championship
seasoned. Kentucky's Wayne Turner leads the defending national
champions and already has played in three Final Fours. Arizona won
the title two years ago and veterans of that team _ the senior
guard Jason Terry (22 points a game) and the 6-10 center A.J.
Bramlett (14.2) _ combine as the best outside-inside tandem in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from the West Regional is Connecticut. In Khalid El-Amin
and Richard Hamilton, the Huskies' backcourt displays more
versatility and explosiveness than Duke's duo of Avery and Langdon.
No one player can match Brand, but Kevin Freeman and Jake Voskuhl
won't be intimidated. In Ricky Moore, Connecticut has a defensive
stopper, and the Huskies are athletic and talented enough to go
10-deep in its rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are good enough and we intend to make a serious run,''
Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   Overconfidence is a factor only the Blue Devils can control. Not
since the 1991 Larry Johnson-led UNLV team has a squad come into
the tournament with such expectations. The Running Rebels were 34-0
until they lost to Duke in the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell said he won't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to pop in a tape of that Final Four game to remind
my teammates that it can happen to us, I will,'' he said. &QL;

BOEING 737 RUDDERS TARGETED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The National Transportation Safety Board may be on the
verge of calling for significant and costly changes in Boeing 737
jetliners, sources confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Revisions in the hydraulic mechanism that controls the rudder of
the 737 _ the world's most popular commercial passenger jet _ are
recommended in the draft of an NTSB report on the crash of USAir
Flight 427 near Pittsburg in 1994, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report _ which is still subject to revision _ is
likely to fix blame for the crash on the rudder system of the
Boeing 737, according to sources familiar with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the crash has become the longest in U.S.
aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   All 132 people aboard the 737-300 died after it rolled sharply
and spun into the ground from 5,500 feet while preparing to land.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board will meet publicly for two days in Springfield,
Virginia, beginning March 23 to consider the draft report and to
make final recommendations. The draft was prepared by NTSB staff
and continues to be revised.
</P>
<P>
   The safety of the 737 rudder has been in question since a 737
spun into the ground while landing at Colorado Springs, Colo., in
1991. All 25 people on the plane were killed. The NTSB was unable
to determine the probable cause of the Colorado crash, though a
rudder defect was one of the leading theories.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming report also is expected to reconsider the cause of
Colorado crash.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB staff has been meeting with individual board members
about the draft report, and the discussions have focused on
additional changes to the rudder control system on the 737.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility under consideration would be for a second
hydraulic actuator in the rudder, said a source familar with the
discussions. This second control unit would be in addition to the
backup system already on the 737.
</P>
<P>
   Some Boeing jets have such dual power-control units, but not the
737.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Pittsburg crash, the Federal Aviation Administration
has ordered several changes to the 737 rudder's design. Those
changes were supported by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But a major redesign using a second hydraulic actuator would be
a huge expense for Boeing and the many airlines that operate the
more than 3,000 737s now flying.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, though, it is far from certain that further
design changes will be ordered on the 737 rudder.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB can make recommendations, but only the FAA has the
authority to order design changes in a plane.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA plans to brief the media next week before the board
meeting, outlinging the changes it has already ordered to make the
737 rudder safer. A spokesman said Wednesday the agency has not
seen the draft NTSB report and would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing plans a similar background briefing for the media before
the safety board meets.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkowicz said Wednesday he could not
comment on the content of the draft report, but he cautioned that
any recommendations that might be contained in the draft could be
changed between now and the March 23 board meeting. Changes also
could be made during the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board can adopt the draft report as final at the end
of the meeting, or send it back to staff for additional changes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the staff and board members have copies of the draft
report, he said. It is not distributed outside the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft is being reviewed by board members,'' he said. ``As
with any report, there could be all sorts of questions that members
might have on the draft in preparation for the board meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the meeting, no more than two of the 5 board members can
get together to discuss the draft report. If 3 or more members did
so, the meeting would have to be public. The March 23 meeting will
be the first opportunity the full board has to consider the draft,
Lopatkowicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the full board adopts a draft report as final
about 95 percent of the time at the end of its meeting, rather than
returning the report to staff for more work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Jorunal first reported Wednesday that the draft
report contains a recommendation for dual power-control devices to
move the rudder on the 737. It quoted unnamed industry executives
as saying such a redesign could cost U.S. carriers anywhere from
$60 million to upwards of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A source told the Post-Intelligencer the cost estimate in the
Journal article did not come from Boeing and should be considered
with some caution.
</P>
<P>
   But any redesign of the rudder using a dual control system could
have a significant financial impact on an airline such as
Southwest, which operates an all-737 fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that's the way to go,'' Southwest spokesman
Beth Harbin said Wednesday when asked about the possible
recommendation in the draft NTSB report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we have been flying this plane for 27
years. We fly it exclusively. We feel it is the safest plane in the
air. Through all of this, the FAA and Boeing feel that this plane
meets all safety requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has 284 of the jets in its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Young, Boeing's chief spokesman on safety matters, said the
company has not seen the draft report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any discussion (about the report) that is now underway is
internal to the safety board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he praised the safety record of the 737.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have complete confidence in the 737,'' he said. ``It has
proven itself in almost 30 years of airline service. It has a
tremendous record. We have made improvements (in the rudder system)
and the question (for the safety board) is whether additional
cautions should be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing's position remains that there is insufficient
evidence to determine the probable cause of the Pittsburg crash.
</P>
<P>
   Tests have found that the rudder on older model 737s can jam in
unusual conditions, causing it to swing in the opposite direction
of the one the pilot intended.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the FAA ordered replacement of the valves in older
737s. The new valve is designed to prevent the rudder from making
uncommanded movements. U.S. carriers have until this August to make
the fixes on classic 737s in their fleets. The new generation 737s
already use the redesigned valve.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA recently ordered airlines to check the new valves
for cracks after cracks were discoverd in several valves at the
manufacturing plant. So far, though, airlines have not found any
cracked replacement valves on the 737s they have inspected.
</P>
<P>
   As an added safety measure, airlines have required their flight
crews be trained in 737 recovery techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some 737 pilots have reported uncommanded rudder
movements in their planes.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently a US Airways Metrojet traveling from Orlando,
Florida, to Hartford, Connecticut, experienced an unintended rudder
movement Feb. 23 while at cruising altitude. The flight diverted
safely to Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is investigating that event.

MURDERS IN NEW YORK UP 5% SO FAR IN '99
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of murders reported in New York City has
risen slightly this year compared with the same period last year,
the police said Wednesday, adding that there was no way to know
whether the increase represented a temporary jump or a leveling off
in the city's historic drop in crime of the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   There were 115 murders reported in the city this year through
March 7, an increase of 5.5 percent over the same period last year,
when 109 murders were reported, according to preliminary Police
Department statistics. Reported crime continued to drop in all
other major categories, though, and overall reported crime was down
14 percent, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said at a news conference that
it was too early to say what the figures presage. ``Homicides, like
all crimes, have peaks and valleys,'' he said. He noted that even
if the city ended the year with 700 murders _ there were 629
reported last year _ it would still represent the second-lowest
total since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the year's homicides indicated that
the biggest jump was in those stemming from domestic violence or
family disputes, Safir said. Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman,
said that of the murders with known motives, 21 stemmed from
domestic violence or family disputes, up from 11 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence murders are among the most difficult to curb
with policing tactics. Though the police have found that increasing
patrols in high-crime areas and starting antidrug initiatives can
bring down the number of murders related to robberies and drug
deals, they have a much harder time keeping a husband from killing
his wife at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not all areas of the city saw the number of murders go up.
</P>
<P>
   The largest increases were in southern Queens, which had 8
reported killings compared with 4 last year, and northern
Manhattan, which jumped to 16 from 9. But there were fewer reported
killings this year in the Bronx, which had 26, and northern
Brooklyn, which had 19.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Queens remained steady with 11, as did Staten Island,
which had none. There were 8 killings reported in Manhattan south
of 59th Street, and 27 in southern Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was most striking in the last four weeks, when 52
killings were reported, compared with 45 over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Safir has credited aggressive police tactics with
driving down crime. He noted Wednesday that some people had
suggested that after the Feb. 4 shooting of Amadou Diallo and the
increased scrutiny it has brought on the Police Department, some
officers might fear taking aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear whether the police are holding back, in
the four weeks after the Diallo shooting, officers made 186 arrests
for firearms possession, down 17 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have expressed concerns with me about police officers
not wanting to take chances because of the possibility they will be
viewed in the wrong light, or as overly aggressive,'' Safir said.
``All of that is just speculation.''

DR. PHILIP STRAX, 90, IS DEAD; AN ADVOCATE OF MAMMOGRAMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Fla., Texas)  (nk) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Strax, a radiologist whose early and passionate
advocacy of the mammogram helped revolutionize breast-cancer
detection, died on Tuesday at a daughter's home in Bethesda, Md. He
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   A general practitioner with a small family practice in
Manhattan, Strax was spurred into a single-minded battle against
breast cancer in 1947, when his first wife died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 years later, he helped conduct a milestone study
involving almost 62,000 women in New York that established
conclusively that early detection of breast cancer significantly
reduced its mortality rate. Strax went on to open several
pioneering clinics devoted to breast-cancer detection, often at no
charge, and inaugurated the city's first mobile mammography units.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Goldberg Strax, the doctor's wife, was 39 when she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very much in love with her,'' said Dr. Albert Messina,
director of Park Avenue Radiology, where Strax practiced until
about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they discovered it, he was shocked,'' Messina said of the
breast cancer. ``It was a major blow to him. And he decided at the
time that he was going to spend his lifework preventing that kind
of shock from happening to anyone else, especially the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Bertha Strax's death, few doctors realized that
X-rays could be useful in detecting breast cancer, in part because
the technology of the time was best-suited for giving doctors a
picture of bones. When it came to detecting problems in soft tissue
like that making up the breast, the pictures were so blurry as to
be of little value. Many doctors, moreover, attributed the
mortality of any given case to the strength of the individual
cancer, not to the time when it was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the technology was refined, allowing doctors to get a
clearer picture of the breast.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Strax collaborated in the first large-scale
controlled study of women to determine the effectiveness of
mammograms in reducing mortality. The study was conducted from 1963
to 1966 by the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York and
involved tens of thousands of women 40 to 64 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Half the women were given mammograms and manual breast cancer
examinations; the other half were not. When the first results of
the study were published some years later, doctors announced that
the use of mammography had reduced breast-cancer deaths by a third.
Even now, since patients from the HIP study are still alive, new
analyses of the data are being published, Dr. Michael A . Cohen,
medical director of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Guttman Diagnostic
Center, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Strax, then affiliated with the University of Miami
School of Medicine, and a colleague, Prof. Sam Shapiro of Johns
Hopkins University, were honored for their work by the General
Motors Cancer Research Foundation. The HIP study, the foundation
said in awarding the $100,000 prize, ``almost unilaterally changed
medical thinking about early detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the results of the studies were fully known, Strax
had opened two clinics in New York where women could have
mammograms at low cost or no charge. He also opened a third clinic,
the Strax Institute, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he started his breast center and he started to use
mammography,'' Cohen said, ``it had not been statistically proven
that mammography was an effective means of cancer detection and
mortality reduction in women. He had that vision. He thought it was
the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Cohen noted, ``it is today really our only effective way of
screening for breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Strax also emphasized the importance of manual examinations. ``A
good exam has three components,'' he said in an interview in 1966,
``the mammogram, a clinical examination by a physician or trained
nurse, and a lesson in breast self-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   Some debate persists, however, about the reliability and
effectiveness of mammograms for women under 50. The often denser
nature of breast tissue in younger women can make it harder to spot
problems. At the same time, a higher number of false alarms have
been reported in mammograms of women below 50.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Strax was born on Jan. 1, 1909, the son of Jacob and
Molly Strax, and grew up in Brooklyn. His parents had emigrated
from Eastern Europe, and his father worked in the garment industry
sewing pockets. Philip Strax was one of five children, three of
whom became doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Strax graduated from New York University Medical School in 1931,
at the age of 22, and went into private practice.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of his first wife, Strax married Gertrude
Jacobson. She died in 1987.
</P>

   Strax was the author of several books about breast cancer and
three volumes of poetry, his other lifelong passion. In the poetry,
as in his life, ``his most important theme is, always do more for
others than is done for you,'' said a daughter, Rita Weil, of
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Strax retired about a decade ago and lived in Hollywood, Fla.,
but he was taken to Mrs. Weil's home about a week before he died
there.
</P>
<P>
   Strax is survived by a sister, Dr. Anne Robbins of Ossining,
N.Y.; three daughters: Polly Hammer of Huntington, N.Y., Gayle
Martin of Plantation, Fla., and Mrs. Weil; three sons: Norman, of
New York, Marshall, of Nanuet, N.Y., and Dr. Richard, of Houston;
eight grandchildren and one great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   At the Guttman Institute, Cohen said, some of Strax's patients
still talk about him decades after their encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could live in the heart of one of my patients for the
next 30 years,'' Cohen said, ``that would be an accomplishment.''

THERE'S NO DEBATE: THESE SENATORS ARE GOOD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In losing by 3-0 to the Ottawa Senators Wednesday
night at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers saw their undefeated
streak end at six games and their winning streak end at three. They
missed a chance to move back into a tie with Boston for the eighth
and final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defeat, the Rangers performed well against the team
with the best record in the conference, battling hard until the
end. Even without three regular defensemen and three regular
forwards, even after being outplayed for the first two-thirds of
the game, they came on strong in the third period, pressuring
Ottawa goalie Damian Rhodes, who stopped 29 shots, 11 of them in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Ottawa's goals were scored by Aleksei Yashin, one in the
first period on the power play, the other in the third period into
the empty net after the Rangers pulled goalie Mike Richter for an
extra attacker. Lance Pitlick scored at even strength in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hope to get at least one or two of their injured
players back Thursday night when they play host to the Bruins. This
was the sixth time the Rangers have been shut out this season, five
of them defeats, one of them a 0-0 tie. It was the first time they
have been shut out by the senators since 1933, when the first
version of the Ottawa team played in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Senators, in their seventh season, are proof that expansion
teams can build contenders with draft choices and that Canadian
teams can compete with American teams despite differences in
currency values and market size. Should the Senators maintain their
position while the Rangers qualify for the last playoff berth,
these two teams could meet in the first round of the Stanley Cup
playoffs in late April.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators scored once in the first period and once in the
second, and the Rangers were fortunate to be trailing by only 2-0
at the second intermission. Ottawa dominated the first 40 minutes,
keeping the puck at the Ranger end of the ice for long stretches of
time. Occasionally, Ranger fans cheered sarcastically when the Blue
Shirts were able to clear the puck out of their zone. Ottawa's
26-18 shot advantage was misleading. In good scoring chances, the
Senators might have been ahead by 15-5.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin, a candidate for the Hart trophy as the NHL's most
valuable player, gave the Senators a 1-0 lead at 6 minutes 18
seconds of the first period when he scooped up a pass next to
Richter's net on the power play and flipped the puck over the
sprawling goalie. It was Yashin's 36th goal of the season and came
during the first part of a double minor against Rich Brennan, the
defenseman, who was sent off for high-sticking Vaclav Prospal, an
incident that left Prospal with a broken tooth and a cut mouth.
Yashin, the captain, is a 25-year-old star from Russia who leads a
roster that is heavily stocked with European players.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators made the score 2-0 at 9:18 of the second period on
the goal by Pitlick, a defenseman who finished a transition rush by
moving up uncovered into the slot and beating Richter. The goal was
typical of the way the Senators play. Young, strong and fast, they
take advantage of turnovers in their defensive end or in the
neutral zone, and use them to trigger speedy counter rushes.
Although Ottawa plays a variation of the neutral-zone trap, it is
not a passive and boring version. The Senators rarely fight and are
lightly penalized. Their average of 11.4 penalty minutes per game
is the lowest in the 27-team league. So it is difficult for a team
like the Rangers _ which counts on its power play _ to get manpower
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers killed off three power plays in the second period,
one of them for high-sticking against Stan Neckar, a former
Senator. Because the Rangers have so many injuries to their
defense, players such as Neckar, Brennan and Rumun Ndur are getting
more exposure. But, following his penalty, Neckar began to spend
longer minutes on the bench. &QL;

MAVERICKS' GREEN HAS STREAK APPROACHING 1,000
</HEADLINE>

By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A.C. Green is trying his best to treat Saturday's home
game against the Vancouver Grizzlies as just another basketball
game.
</P>
<P>
   But deep down, the Mavericks forward knows this game is very
special to him and to the NBA. That's because it will be the
1,000th consecutive game Green has played in _ assuming, of course,
he plays in his 999th game in a row when the Mavericks (6-14) face
the Orlando Magic (14-5) at 7:30 tonight at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 35, has been besieged with interview requests this week
leading up to his milestone. He now knows this is an event that he
can't push off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really pay attention to it,'' Green said, trying to
convince his listener. ``I'm just preparing for another game _ and
a home game _ and one that you're trying to get the momentum going
into it so we can try to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know people are coming in, and I need some more
tickets. That's been in the forefront more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has played more NBA games in a row than teammates Michael
Finley, Gary Trent, Steve Nash, Chris Anstey, Erick Strickland,
Dirk Nowitzki and Samaki Walker have played combined. Total.
</P>
<P>
   Those seven players _ more than half of Green's teammates _ have
played in a total of 934 NBA games. And none of them, except
Finley, has a streak of playing at least 200 games consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Green's teammates use adjectives like unbelievable, amazing and
incredible to describe his iron man status.
</P>
<P>
   Nash said: ``For a guy to have played that many games, let alone
that many consecutive games, is a real tribute to the character of
that person and their ability to prepare themselves physically and
mentally to play and to remain healthy through thick and thin. It's
a real tribute to A.C., and I commend him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks center Shawn Bradley said he doesn't think Green's
teammates can comprehend what he has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes out with broken noses, broken teeth, and other
injuries _ things that he just fights through,'' Bradley said.
``He's one of the workhorses, and you can see by looking at him and
having been on the team with him, that his work ethic and how he
takes care of his body is second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Green became the NBA's all-time iron man when he played in his
907th consecutive game on Nov. 20, 1997, breaking the record set by
Randy Smith. But the 6-foot-9 forward almost didn't reach the
elusive record.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, 1996, then-New York Knicks forward J.R. Reid
clobbered Green in the mouth, dislodging two teeth, while Green was
playing for the Phoenix Suns. However, instead of taking a game or
two off, Green played the next 12 games with a face mask.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years later, Mavericks center/forward and former
Suns player John ``Hot Rod'' Williams says that the punch was meant
for him. Williams said Suns coach Cotton Fitzsimmons removed him
from the game and replaced him with Green when he noticed Williams
and Reid were involved in a heated trash-talking exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``When J.R. came downcourt he told me, `I'm going to kick your
butt,' '' Williams said. ``I said, `Well, I'm here. If you want to
do it, come on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach heard all of that, so he took me out the game for a
minute to cool down, and when A.C. went into the game J.R. hit him.
I'm glad to have a guy like A.C. on my team, because he takes your
licks for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is to the NBA what Cal Ripken is to major-league baseball.
But when Ripken decided to remove his name from the starting lineup
and end his iron man streak, Green was confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he did that, and I don't understand why he
did it,'' Green said. ``But I won't be doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Don Nelson marvels at how Green answers the bell
time after time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even talk about it, because it's just such an
incredible feat that I don't know how to describe it,'' Nelson
said. ``We've seen him play when he probably shouldn't have _ even
here when his back sometimes is hurting pretty bad. But he still
gets out there and straps them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who is a free agent after this season, hopes to retire as
a Mavericks player _ but not after this season. He said he still
has a lot of basketball left in him, and plans to stretch his
streak as far as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect positive things to happen because it's just all part
of God's promise,'' Green said. ``So I'm not surprised, and I don't
know where this streak will end up. I think I'll retire before it
ends.''

TRADE RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A blockbuster trade for a team in the midst
of a nine-game winning streak? Even though four of those victories
are against the Clippers, it sounds like the type of move reserved
for the one of the NBA's knee-jerk franchises, like the Pistons,
Raptors or, yes, Hornets. Certainly not the Lakers, whose every
move seems to be thoughtfully calibrated. Or at least used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's trade that sent Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to
Charlotte for Glen Rice, J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong was only the
latest example that the franchise is becoming the NBA's version of
the Fox-run Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to win a title, combined with the on-again,
off-again tension between owner Jerry Buss and executive vice
president Jerry West, is creating transactions that seem better
suited for teams in need of a major overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is considered heresy to criticize any decision West
makes, and the acquisition of Dennis Rodman has been brilliant, the
five-player trade with Charlotte raises plenty of questions. Rice,
one of the best pure shooters around, isn't completely healthy and
has yet to play a game this season. He's been sidelined with an
injury in his shooting elbow, and those injuries are tricky to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Rice is 100 percent, he has to jell with the rest of
the lineup, not exactly ideal circumstances for a team trying to
ready itself for a title run with 30-odd games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is essentially a throw-in to make the deal work under the
salary cap. Armstrong seemed like a valuable addition, a veteran
with championship experience to spell Derek Harper. So what did the
Lakers do? They waived him a few hours after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   From West's perspective, the trade made sense because the Lakers
add an outside shooter (if healthy) and become instantly older.
That's right, older. Neither Buss nor West wanted to wait until
Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant reached 30 to win another title.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete against Utah or Indiana, the Lakers needed
to add some veterans, according to the conventional wisdom. But
didn't Rodman already take care of that void?
</P>
<P>
   This trade not only alters the roster, it demolishes team
chemistry. If Rice plays small forward, what happens to Rick Fox?
He's demonstrated loyalty by signing one-year deals the past two
seasons, and is now about to be buried on the bench. That's too
bad, since Fox is one of the few good influences in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Robert Horry, who will never see minutes at his
natural position of small forward and continue to play out of
position at power forward. He'll now split time with Travis Knight
and Reid. Oh yeah, and Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Lakers are making moves, one wonders if Rice will be
back if they don't win the title this year. He's a free agent after
the season, and even though the NBA now has a salary scale, Rice is
represented by mega-agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason to dislike the trade. Falk is generally
detested by most NBA teams, and even though he's been diminished by
the current labor agreement, don't think he won't pester West about
trading for or signing some of his other clients, and use Rice as a
bargaining chip to do it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of nuisance Washington and Miami have dealt
with, but not the Lakers. But the way the revolving door keeps
spinning, the Lakers are resembling those teams more every day.

NO BULL: HEDEMAN &AMP; CO. PLAYERS IN LAST REAL SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just Worm Rodman or Albert Belle or Roger Clemens. It's
even an above-it-all icon such as Jack Nicklaus screwing up this
thing of ours. This thing called sports.
</P>
<P>
   Way to be a hypocritical old legend, Jack. Or at least you came
across as one this week.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Nicklaus raised his right hand and solemnly swore to
tell the truth on that kid, Casey Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was too bad, Jack testified, about Casey's withered leg and
his degenerative, crippling disease. But carts had no place out
there on the manly PGA Tour. Unfair advantage, you see.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, Nicklaus is considering a cart ride for Senior
Tour events. Hip replacement surgery has hampered Jack.
</P>
<P>
   To Nicklaus, and everybody else, I say bull.
</P>
<P>
   And thank goodness, there will be plenty of that in the
neighborhood this weekend. The way I've got it figured, the last
real sport known to mankind makes its annual visit to Will Rogers
Memorial Coliseum starting tomorrow night. The bull stops here, you
might say.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the PGA, there are no guaranteed contracts. You have
to earn your paycheck week to week. One difference, however, is the
rules don't allow boulder removal for any Tigers. Instead,
contestants are required to stay atop a ton of fast-moving,
four-legged, man-eating boulders.
</P>
<P>
   And if your given name is Richard Neale ``Tuff'' Hedeman, you
don't even count broken arms or separated shoulders as serious
occupational hazards. And when every bone between your upper lip
and your forehead is crushed, you shrug off the total
reconstructive face surgery with, ``it didn't matter _ I was ugly
to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, you saw your best friend, Lane Frost, killed
during a competition in 1989, with you no more than 20 feet away
that awful day in Cheyenne, Wyo. Now, your 4-year-old son is named
Lane, and when he's old enough, he can rent the Hollywood version
of the Frost story, called ``Eight Seconds.'' Luke Perry plays
young Lane's namesake. Stephen Baldwin plays young Lane's dad.
</P>
<P>
   Then a year ago, here in Fort Worth, ``the next Hedeman'' or
``the next Frost,'' crashed to the Will Rogers dirt, and in another
split-second of tragedy, Jerome Davis was paralyzed, probably for
life.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough people, and to most of us, crazy people. But as
it turned out, also enterprising and business-smart individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Just six years ago, a small group of bull riders led by Hedeman,
a four-time world champion, removed its event from the traditional
rodeo format, and took it on the road as a separate sport.
Originally, there were a handful of stops on the Professional Bull
Riders tour.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 28 PBR events, coast-to-coast, leading up to a
national finals. TNN purchased the television rights for every
show, and because of strong attendance and the TV focus, tour prize
money is up to $5.5 million, plus individual commercial
sponsorships for contestants has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of sports, that kind of money isn't much,'' Hedeman
said yesterday. ``But for rodeo, it's huge. And it's growing every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For me, however, it's all about sheer entertainment. The ``Tuff
Hedeman Championship Challenge,'' makes a Fort Worth stop each
March. I attended my first one three years ago. Now, I arrange
Florida trips to baseball spring training around bull riding. I get
funny looks when I tell people. My answer: ``see just one,'' and
then tell me I'd rather be in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the PBR can guarantee goes far beyond what even the
biggest of the traditional rodeos can provide,'' said Hedeman.
``The best bull riders in the world and the best bulls will be
here. The governing body of rodeo (the Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association) viewed us as outlaws to start with, but we thought we
had something that would sell nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   It did, and the danger element is obviously part of the appeal.
``Just like with NASCAR,'' said Hedeman, 36, who will miss
competing in his own event this weekend because of a re-injured
neck, which is a potential career-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to popular opinion, I have always listened to the
doctors,'' said Hedeman, smiling. ``I will have another checkup in
about a month. If it's time for me to retire, I can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuff also serves as president of the PBR, and along with Ron
Pack of Stephenville, co-produces the Fort Worth tour stop, voted
by contestants as the PBR's best event three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, it's OK to bring on the bull. But that also
doesn't mean you, Jack, or you, Worm, or you, Roger, or ...

WORLD CLASS ARCHITECTS VIE FOR CHANCE TO DESIGN SEATTLE PUBLIC
LIBRARY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Some of the world's top architects are tantalized by
the chance to design this city's $156 million new Central Library.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meier, Moshe Safdie and Michael Graves were among the
hot architects who sent representatives Wednesday to a
question-and-answer session in Seattle about its downtown library
to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exceptionally attractive project,'' said Joshua Ramus,
a Rotterdam architect whose firm recently designed the Jussieu
University library in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms represented Wednesday included those of Cesar Pelli,
who designed the world's tallest building in Malaysia, and Peter
Bohlin, who created Bill Gates' Medina mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 60 local and international firms attended a
session to discuss the 355,000-square-foot landmark that will
replace Seattle's 40-year-old library at Fifth Avenue and Spring
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Approved by 70 percent of Seattle voters last November, the
project is on a fast track. Architects must submit their
qualifications by the end of this month. Three to five finalists
will be selected by April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists will be grilled by a 13-member advisory panel, the
five-member Library Board and Seattle citizens. The Library Board
picks the winner May 18.
</P>
<P>
   The project has provoked friendly philosophical tension at City
Hall between Mayor Paul Schell, a former University of Washington
architecture dean who seeks a structure of global significance, and
City Librarian Deborah Jacobs, who's intent on getting a building
that works smoothly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Schell is as passionate about good architecture as I am
about good libraries,'' Jacobs said yesterday. ``Together, we make
a good marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Past library design work isn't required. The key is to have done
an excellent job on buildings of similar scale and complexity, said
Alexandra Harris, the library's capital project director.
</P>
<P>
   Meier, for example, is famous for the Getty Center in Los
Angeles. Graves and Safdie created widely praised libraries in
Denver and Vancouver, B.C., respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the international set, Seattle firms at the
meeting included NBBJ, designer of Safeco Field, and LMN, designer
of Benaroya Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with the new Central Library _ part of a $240
million citywide expansion project that encompasses 26 locations _
said they were thrilled with the caliber of architects showing
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the top list,'' said Gordon Walker, a local architect
consulting on the library.
</P>
<P>
   However, John Pastier, a local architecture critic, said a great
design would be more likely if the Library Board had assembled a
design competition rather than asking for submission of
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Library officials said a competition would take too long and
could produce a structure that looks great on paper but wouldn't
necessarily fit Seattle's needs.
